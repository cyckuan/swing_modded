<HEADLINE>  Golfers Honor Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Tour Championship used to be the  
end-of-the-year event for the rich to get richer. This year, it has 
become a stage to honor the memory of Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III was among those wondering why the PGA Tour didn't  
cancel the $5 million event for the top 30 on the money list, 
especially because golf was far from anyone's mind after Stewart 
died in a plane crash Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be weird this week,'' Love said. ``It doesn't  
feel right grinding it out on the range. It doesn't feel right 
laughing in the fairways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might feel hollow to win.  
</P>
<P>
	So, why play?  
</P>
<P>
	Love found that answer at Champions Golf Club on Wednesday, his  
first day on the course and his first chance to see the PGA Tour 
family since Stewart was killed in what Arnold Palmer called the 
greatest tragedy in modern-day golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The players remembered Stewart's passion and grace, his  
victories and losses, his flamboyant personality and needling humor 
from which no one was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Love came to the conclusion that it was time to  
share the memories of the two-time U.S. Open champion with everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can shed a lot of light on Payne Stewart by playing,'' he  
said, glassy eyes staring off into the distance. ``A lot of things 
are going to remind us of Payne Stewart for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship got off to an emotional start today with a  
brief memorial service for Stewart on the first tee. A lone 
bagpiper played ``Going Home,'' about a Scottish man finally 
returning to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
took from us one of our great champions,'' PGA Tour commissioner 
Tim Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every player in the Tour Championship field was at the  
service. Many of those were visibly shaken as the bagpiper played 
``Amazing Grace,'' then ``Going Home'' one more time as he walked 
back down a fairway shrouded in fog. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very emotional guy,'' said Tom Lehman, who offered a  
prayer. ``He loved to laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not 
going to be ashamed of my tears this morning, and neither should 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players hugged each other as they left the first tee. Duffy  
Waldorf, playing alone because Stewart's death left an odd number 
of players in the field, was on the putting green, preparing for 
his 8:39 a.m. tee time as the first player off. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will be the focus from the first round through the  
trophy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not playing golf, I don't know how else we can honor  
him,'' Finchem said Wednesday. ``There's not much of a forum to 
remind people about Payne. This provides us a way to tell what he 
was all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first day features 27 holes, followed by a day off to honor  
Stewart, whose memorial service will be at 11 a.m. Friday in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said a collection of private planes will take whoever  
wants to go to the service Friday morning. A larger jet has been 
chartered for players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in 
Mississippi to go to the services. 
</P>
<P>
	That tournament also is suspending play on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said Stewart's wife, Tracey, ``was very pleased that we  
were creating a situation where the players had an opportunity to 
attend the service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether all 29 players from the Tour  
Championship would attend. Love said he has had trouble going to 
such services ever since his father died, and would advise players 
not to go if they didn't feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to hug the guys that want to be hugged and  
cry with the guys that want to cry,'' said Love, who plans to leave 
tonight and spend time with Mark O'Meara in Orlando. ``Go ahead and 
get your grieving process started. I think that's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his two U.S. Opens and the PGA Championship, memories of  
Stewart usually start with his passion for the Ryder Cup. Love was 
paired with him in the first alternate-shot match on opening day, a 
halve against Padraig Harrington and Miguel Angel Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mystified why Ben Crenshaw would ever pair me with Payne  
Stewart,'' he said. ``After four or five holes I said, `Now I know. 
You want to teach me a lesson on how to take my excitement and my 
passion and my nervousness and my desire to win, and put it into my 
game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thanked Payne twice that day for what he taught me during  
that match,'' Love said. ``I said, `I'm sorry we didn't win, but 
it's going to help me in the future.' It did. It helped me on 
Sunday (a decisive victory over Jean Van de Velde). We all will 
remember the Ryder Cup for a lot of reasons, but now I think it 
will be even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship, the final PGA Tour event of the year, has  
a $5 million purse, with $900,000 going to the winner. Finchem said 
the $80,000 for last place would be given to Stewart's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the first-tee service at Champions, a service is  
scheduled tonight after the first round of the PGA Tour event in 
Mississippi. In Europe, players in the Volvo Masters in Spain said 
they would observe a moment of silence on the 18th green after 
Friday's round. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was concerned primarily with Stewart's two children,  
13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron, and with the families of 
the other five victims in the crash. He remembers what it was like 
to lose a father in a plane crash -- Davis Love Jr. was killed 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing I'm going to watch out for over the next few  
years is how we can help those children remember their father,'' 
Love said. ``Hopefully, we can help Aaron and Chelsea understand 
that eventually the memories of their father will be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will still live on -- definitely in golf, but he will live  
on as a great father.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Book Co. Loses Jacket Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Walt Disney Corp.'s publishing arm  
isn't entitled to First Amendment protection for allegedly 
fraudulent claims it made on jacket covers for the ``Beardstown 
Ladies Investment Club'' books, an appellate court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Such promotional copy is ``commercial speech which, when false  
or misleading, is entitled to no First Amendment protection at all 
and may be entirely prohibited,'' California's First Appellate 
District ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision published Wednesday, which sets a legal precedent  
in California, means a San Francisco man's false advertising 
lawsuit against Disney's Buena Vista Books Inc. can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	It also means that publishers may have to do some hard thinking  
about how they promote books and videotapes sold in California, 
particularly in the get-rich-quick genre, according to John Baker, 
editorial director for Publishers Weekly in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the implications for publishers would be very  
grave,'' Baker said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacket copy writers are already prone to exaggeration, Baker  
noted. If such statements are treated in court as commercial 
speech, ``publishers should be even more alarmed at the possibility 
of an oversell coming back to haunt them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Keimer sued on behalf of the general public on April 2,  
1998, accusing Disney of false advertising and unfair business 
practices for promotional statements on five books and a video 
based on the investment advice of the women's club in Beardstown, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Learn how to outperform mutual funds and professional money  
managers 3 to 1,'' was one claim. Another said the women earned 
23.4 percent on their investments from 1984 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were not named in the lawsuit, although their ghost  
writer, Seth Godin Productions, is among the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	After questions were raised about the amateur investors'  
remarkable success, auditors discovered their actual rate of return 
was 9.1 percent. The women apologized, blaming a simple data input 
error, and the publisher issued a disclaimer two weeks before 
Keimer filed suit on behalf of the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	But Keimer said Disney continues to use inflated claims to  
promote the books. He wants Disney to stop making the false claims 
and publish retractions or corrections. He also wants Disney to 
give up its profits from sales of the books and video. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was dismissed by Superior Court Judge David Garcia on  
Sept. 30, 1998 after Disney claimed the book jacket and video cover 
statements merely repeated the contents of the material within, and 
therefore had an absolute protection under the constitutional right 
to freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appellate court said Disney is responsible for its own  
advertising claims, which must be judged independently to see if 
they conform with California's Unfair Trade Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney cannot shield itself from the statute's mandates by  
linking its advertising to the books' content,'' the court ruled, 
sending the case back to trial and ordering Disney to pay the costs 
of Keimer's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Landers, the publicity director at Disney's Hyperion  
Press, the brand name for Buena Vista Books, said she couldn't 
comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Keimer was represented by attorneys Andrew August and Jeff  
Lerman, who said the ruling sends a clear message to publishers 
that ``advertising containing verifiably false factual statements 
will not be protected by the First Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The court is saying that consumers of books and videos have  
the same right as other consumers not to be misled or defrauded,'' 
Lerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means publishers will be alarmed, since they now can be  
held liable in California if their promotional claims are proven to 
be false, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be an inhibiting factor without a doubt on the  
preparation of book jacket copy, and the way in which certain books 
are presented,'' Baker said. ``Lots of books tell you how to beat 
the market and how double your investment, and lots of these claims 
I'm sure are basically unsound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Russell Keimer vs. Buena Vista Books, Inc., et al.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Claim Nomo on Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Phillies claimed  
right-hander Hideo Nomo on waivers Thursday from Milwaukee, which 
would add some pitching depth if they can meet his salary demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo and his agent, Don Nomura, were not contacted by the  
Phillies before the claim, Nomura said from his office in Tokyo. 
Nomura planned to talk to Phillies general manager Ed Wade early 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo was waived by the Brewers on Tuesday after he balked at  
contract offers worth up to nearly $5 million a year. Nomura, said 
to have been seeking a deal worth more than $27 million for three 
years from the Brewers, declined Thursday to talk about how much he 
would seek from the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the Phillies' payroll, 23rd among the 30 major league  
teams opening day, Nomo's demands would seem out of reach. In 
addition, the team is unlikely to pay the 31-year-old Nomo more 
than Curt Schilling, who will make $5.65 million in 2000, the final 
season of a $15.45 million, three-year contract that contains a 
$6.5 million team option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking to add depth and quality to our rotation, and  
if he decides to accept the assignment, he could be an asset to us 
in 2000,'' Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, who arrived in Japan on Thursday and was asleep when the  
claim was announced, has until Tuesday to accept or reject the 
waiver claim. If he accepts, he would become eligible for salary 
arbitration. If he rejects, he would become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo signed with the Brewers for $250,000 five months ago in  
what was believed to be one of his last chances. The New York Mets 
cut him in spring training, and he made three minor league starts 
for the Chicago Cubs with a 1-1 record and a 3.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo didn't look sharp in subsequent tryouts with Milwaukee and  
Cleveland, but the pitching-poor Brewers signed him, anyway. The 
1995 NL Rookie of the Year proved to be one of the majors' biggest 
bargains this season, winning six of his first seven decisions and 
nine of his first 11. He finished 12-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 28 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	His success in Milwaukee largely was the result of adjusting to  
his arm's diminished capacities. He now pitches with a serviceable 
fastball, a slick curve and a good forkball. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a 61-49 career record with a 3.82 ERA and 1,031  
strikeouts in 960 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Ashcroft: End Race-Baiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Ashcroft responded Thursday to  
controversy over a 1960 photograph of Democratic Missouri Gov. Mel 
Carnahan singing in blackface, saying the governor is not a racist 
and that race-baiting in Missouri politics must stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are running for Senate in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Ashcroft, R-Mo.,  
denied distributing the picture or knowing who circulated the 
image, which has been published in Carnahan's hometown newspaper in 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked by the picture, and frankly, the picture does  
not square with my understanding of who Gov. Carnahan is,'' 
Ashcroft said in a 25-minute interview in his Capitol Hill office. 
``I've known Mel Carnahan for a quarter century. I respect him. I 
think he is a decent person. I do not believe he is a racist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan has apologized for the small-town racial insensitivity  
of the blackface minstrel performance almost four decades ago. The 
AP first reported the story Sunday after obtaining the image from a 
GOP source on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has accused Ashcroft of having his operatives  
quietly pass around the photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not true,'' Ashcroft said Thursday. He Sunday was the  
first he had heard about the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	As to whether the picture should have been distributed, he said:  
``I'm not standing in judgment on anybody here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not put out such pictures and I will not allow my staff  
to do so, and I am very eager that we not have a campaign 
characterized by any association with race-baiting,'' Ashcroft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ashcroft blamed Carnahan for recent allegations of racism,  
arguing the governor was wrong to say Ashcroft's defeat of a black 
judge's judicial nomination had racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator pointed out that two black Democratic House members,  
Reps. Bill Clay of Missouri and Maxine Waters of California, 
labeled him a racist after the Senate on Oct. 5 rejected the 
nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White for a 
federal judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said he is disappointed that Carnahan would categorize  
him in the same way that Clay and Waters had. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan was traveling and could not be reached for a response.  
</P>
<P>
	But his campaign adviser, Roy Temple, continued to hold Ashcroft  
accountable for the flap over Carnahan's blackface photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree the race-baiting should stop, but in order for that  
to happen, John Ashcroft has to be willing to accept responsibility 
for the actions of people who report to him,'' Temple said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor has not called John Ashcroft a racist, nor has he  
implied John Ashcroft is a racist,'' said Temple, executive 
director of the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan, asked Monday whether he considered Ashcroft to be a  
racist, said: ``I think he has been insensitive, but I don't know 
what's in his heart and I specifically have not made that charge 
and do not make that charge.

<HEADLINE> Braves Miss Plays and Pay the Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The third inning of Game 4 of the World Series  
started badly for the Atlanta Braves and got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, John Smoltz got a ground ball, the prescription for  
escaping trouble. Both times, though, it turned into big trouble 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great traits about that club is they're so  
opportunistic,'' shortstop Walt Weiss said. ``They're a tough club 
to pitch to. They get quality at-bats, up and down the order. They 
shoot the ball all over the field. They're tough to defend. You 
pretty much have to play them straight up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when leadoff hitter Chuck Knoblauch rapped a ball in the hole  
between shortstop and third base, Weiss had a couple of extra steps 
to cover to get to the ball. On the mound, Smoltz thought it was 
rather routine, the kind of ball the smooth-fielding Weiss gobbles 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely could have made the play,'' Weiss said.  
</P>
<P>
	Only he didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	The ball glanced off his glove for an infield single, and the  
Yankees had an opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I might have a chance to throw him out,'' Weiss  
said. ``With him running, I tried to be real quick with the 
exchange and get the throw off. I think I was trying to throw the 
ball before I actually got the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did Weiss think he might be charged with an error?  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure,'' he said. ``With Knoblauch running, it made it  
a tougher play. It was going to be a bang-bang play at first 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, there was no play.  
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter followed with a single to right field, sending  
Knoblauch to third. Then Jeter stole second as Paul O'Neill struck 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing the percentages, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox ordered  
cleanup batter Bernie Williams walked, loading the bases for Tino 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Smoltz needed another ground ball, and he got it when  
Martinez sent a shot to the right of first baseman Ryan Klesko. 
Williams hesitated for a moment, perhaps blocking Klesko's view for 
an instant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball just jumped up on me,'' Klesko said. ``He hit it  
hard. It came up and hit me on the top of my arm. There was nothing 
I could do. I couldn't get a glove on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ball glanced off the first baseman and into short right  
field, where second baseman Bret Boone ran it down. By the time he 
retrieved it, two runs had scored and the Yankees were on their way 
to their 4-1 Series-clinching victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox shook his head over the way the game turned in that one  
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one inning, the two infield hits,'' he said. ``We didn't  
catch the ball good that inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko said when the ball was hit, he thought he might be able  
to turn it into a double play. Instead of two outs, though, the 
Braves got no outs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said he wasn't sure what happened on the play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was a bad hop or not,'' he said. ``We  
walked a guy, set up the double play. We got the ground balls. We 
didn't get an out. That's the way it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast with the Yankees' infield was dramatic, especially  
in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, shortstop Jeter ranged far to his left on a ball  
hit up the middle by Gerald Williams, crossed second base and made 
the play cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Boone walked, Chipper Jones hit a bouncer to third  
base. Scott Brosius, playing him to pull, got a good jump and 
backhanded the ball at the bag. Then he pivoted, jumped like an 
old-time quarterback throwing a pass and retired the runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays missed.  
</P>
<P>
	Two plays made.  
</P>
<P>
	They were the difference in the deciding game of the World  
Series.

<HEADLINE> Braves Suffer World Series Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- One for the '90s. Maybe the next decade will be  
kinder to the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while making eight straight postseason appearances -- a feat  
unmatched by any other team -- these Braves will be remembered as 
the Buffalo Bills of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta may object, but its legacy is undeniable after the New  
York Yankees completed a World Series sweep with a 4-1 victory 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One Series title in 10 years is not enough to secure a loftier  
place in baseball history. Too many potential championships got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's unfair,'' Chipper Jones said in protest. ``We've won  
more championships than about 25 or 26 other teams. When you look 
at our organization, you can only call it a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, these are the moments that endure:  
</P>
<P>
	--In 1991, Lonnie Smith stops running and Minnesota wins Game 7  
in the 10th inning. That one was excused in the tomahawk-chopping 
euphoria over a miraculous worst-to-first season. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1992, the Braves expected to win against Toronto and were on  
their way to a 2-0 lead in the Series until pinch-hitter Ed Sprague 
homered in the ninth against ancient Jeff Reardon. The Blue Jays 
went on claim the title in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1996, after winning their lone Series title of the decade  
over Cleveland the previous year, the Braves were poised to 
establish themselves as one of the great teams in baseball history. 
They won the first two games of the '96 Series at Yankee Stadium by 
a combined score of 16-1, only to lose the next three at old 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The collapse was completed back in 
New York, and the Braves have never been so close to another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Wednesday night, the decade of lost chances ended on a  
dismal note. The Yankees finished off the Braves with a four-game 
blitz, marking the first time this decade that Atlanta lost a 
best-of-7 series in fewer than six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did it all,'' Jones said. ``They're awesome. They pretty  
much played a perfect series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Braves, their plight was summed up by the placard  
carried by a Yankees fan. ``Hey Atlanta. Ever Heard of the Buffalo 
Bills?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message was clear: The Braves now have a place alongside the  
NFL team that lost four straight Super Bowls in the first half of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things that have been written about us are unfair,'' said  
John Smoltz, who took the loss in Game 4. ``But this is the level 
we've established for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The totality of this defeat overshadowed what had been an  
amazing season for the Braves. They managed to win 103 games 
despite losing five players to season-ending illness and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no solace in scratching and clawing to get here,''  
Smoltz said. ``There's just an overwhelming feeling that we've got 
to win when we get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the final chance for Team of the Decade honors turned out to  
be a debacle. The Yankees showed Atlanta how it's supposed to be 
done, celebrating their third title in four years while their fans 
mocked the Braves with a Bronx version of the ``Tomahawk Chop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta finished the decade with three straight 100-win seasons  
and nary a Series title to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a bit of drama to the final game of the '90s,  
unlike the previous night when the Braves squandered their best 
chance to make a Series of it by blowing a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored all of their runs in the third, taking  
advantage of a potential double-play grounder that bounced off the 
right arm of first baseman Ryan Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	While judged a hit by the official scorers, it was clearly a  
miscue -- the kind of play the Yankees always seem to make, the kind 
of play the Braves couldn't make at critical times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best team won,'' Smoltz said. ``The Yanks are head and  
shoulders above most when it comes to this time of the year. We 
lost to the best team, simply put.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez watching from the dugout,  
sidelined by cancer and a bum knee respectively, the free-swinging 
Atlanta hitters were thoroughly dominated by New York's starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez allowed one hit in Game 1. David Cone matched  
him in Game 2. Roger Clemens surrendered four hits in the clincher, 
allowing just one Atlanta runner to reach second base when he left 
with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox will take his share of blame for letting this  
one get away, too. In Game 1, when the Braves took a 1-0 lead into 
the eighth, he left starter Greg Maddux in the game four hitters 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 -- a contest the Braves had to have -- flu-ridden Tom  
Glavine was sent back to the mound in the eighth with a 5-3 lead, 
even though Cox said beforehand that all he wanted was seven solid 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two batters later, the game was tied on Chuck Knoblauch's  
315-homer down the right-field line. Two innings later, the series 
effectively ended when Chad Curtis hit a ball considerably farther 
into the Braves bullpen for a 6-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Braves bid adieu to the 1990s. Good riddance.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be nice that we don't have to listen to all that  
stuff,'' Jones said. ``We can start a new decade and certainly 
everyone will come in looking to get it kicked off the right way.''

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 4.8 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JEANNINE AVERSA    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Economic growth rebounded from a sluggish  
spring at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, while 
a modest rise in Americans' wages and benefits eased inflation 
fears and sparked a Wall Street rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which have been on edge, soared Thursday. In  
midafternoon trading, the Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks 
was up more than 200 points; broader gauges also were higher, as 
were bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The two government reports, released Thursday, paint a picture  
of a remarkably robust economy that is growing rapidly without 
sparking out-of-control inflation, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many economists believe the Federal Reserve will raise  
interest rates for a third time this year when policy-makers meet 
Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent increase in the gross domestic product -- the  
total output of goods and services -- from July through September 
marked the fastest pace this year, the Commerce Department said. 
That followed a 1.9 percent rate of growth in the April-June 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While it has not triggered inflation, third quarter growth, more  
vigorous than many analysts had expected, is stronger than Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan would like and may lead the Fed to raise 
interest rates again this year to slow growth to a sustainable 
level, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're more than likely to see another rate hike  
but both reports suggest it won't take too much more by the Fed to 
get the economy where the Fed wants it to be,'' said Mark Zandi, an 
economist with Regional Financial Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other report, the Labor Department said its Employment  
Cost Index -- considered the best measure of changes in wages and 
benefit costs and closely watched by Greenspan -- rose a moderate 
0.8 percent in the third quarter. That was slightly less than many 
economists were forecasting and much lower than the big 1.1 percent 
surge in the second quarter, which rekindled inflation fears and 
sent stocks tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter report, economists said, indicated little  
inflationary pressures coming from rising wages. In the past 12 
months, employment costs rose a modest 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond and stock markets rallied on this news because they  
had been expecting very bad news -- a big acceleration in wages and 
benefits -- which would likely be followed by aggressive Fed rate 
hikes,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this and other good inflation news, Jones said the  
``odds are 55-45 for a November 16 rake hike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP also showed modest price  
pressures, rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third 
quarter. That was even better than the tiny 1.9 percent increase 
for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is absolute key is that there was strong economic growth  
in the third quarter along with a reduction in the broad-based 
inflation rate,'' said KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland. ``Stocks and 
bonds reacted positively to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robust consumer and business spending, a strong buildup in  
inventories held by businesses and strength in most other 
categories boosted third-quarter GDP growth, offsetting a drag in 
growth from the surging trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we keep this going, in February, without having had a war,  
we will have the longest economic expansion in history,'' President 
Clinton said, taking note of the GDP numbers. ``It's now the 
longest peacetime expansion in history. Wars guarantee you an 
economic expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic  
activity, rose at a solid annual rate of 4.3 percent in the third 
quarter, down slightly from 5.1 percent growth in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, confident that consumers will keep spending,  
increased their stockpiles by $14.1 billion in the third quarter, 
following a slowdown in inventory building in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit subtracted $343 billion from GDP in the third  
quarter at an annual rate, an even bigger drag than in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP numbers reflect a comprehensive overhaul in the way the  
government calculates the GDP, making changes back to 1959 
estimates. The GDP revisions show the economy grew at a 
significantly faster rate in recent years with an increase in 1998 
of 4.3 percent and even bigger 4.5 percent rise in 1997, the 
fastest surge in economic activity in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes also show lower inflation and Americans saving more  
than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of  
disposable income -- had dipped to record lows in negative territory 
but was 2.1 percent in the third quarter under the new 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	All the various changes show the GDP growing at an annual rate  
of $8.88 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars in the third 
quarter of the year. Before adjusting for inflation, GDP in the 
third quarter totaled $9.28 trillion.

<HEADLINE> AMA Unveils Health Info Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The American Medical Association and several  
other physician groups on Thursday unveiled plans for their own 
health information Web site, trying to combat fears that their 
patients are getting inaccurate and misleading information over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the unfamiliar name of medem.com, its relatively late  
arrival on the Internet scene and the AMA's close connection to 
doctors rather than patients, the for-profit initiative will have a 
difficulty time attracting consumers, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is expected to be launched early next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have flocked online as an easy way to obtain detailed  
information about diseases affecting them and their family. Doctors 
have complained, though, about being barraged by patient queries 
sparked by questionable material found on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Though medem.com will offer the same health news and information  
available online from sites such as drkoop.com and America Online's 
Health Channel, the physician groups say their credibility give 
them an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medem, based in San Francisco, also hopes to attract consumers  
by providing a direct link to Web sites of physicians who sign up 
for the service. Through the link, medem.com will provide patients 
a secure service so patients and physicians can communicate via 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The name medem is short for medical empowerment, and empowering  
consumers with health information they can use to live healthier 
lives is the site's main aim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medem.com will give our patients access to information they  
can trust and information they can use with their physicians in 
order to improve their health care,'' said Dr. H. Dunbar Hoskins 
Jr., chairman of the Medem board of directors and executive vice 
president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ``We felt much 
of the information being delivered on the Internet was inaccurate 
and out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the AMA and the AAO, the other groups participating  
are: the American Academy of Pediatrics; the American College of 
Allergy, Asthma &AMP; Immunology; the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists; the American Psychiatric Association; and the 
American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 writers and editors will provide daily health and  
medical research news. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is free for consumers, though doctors have to pay $70  
per month. Doctors can have their fee covered by a sponsoring 
company. No sponsors have been signed up yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The early prognosis for medem.com looks challenging at best,  
according to industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are facing an enormous amount of competition online  
that's already gone down the learning curve to acquire and retain 
customers,'' said Claudine Singer, an Internet analyst with Jupiter 
Communications in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major health-related Web sites include Intellihealth.com,  
WebMD.com and healtheon.com, all of which have been available for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the medical groups also will face a difficult balancing  
act in using corporate sponsors and advertising. That's because the 
AMA and other groups do not want to appear as promoting certain 
companies or products. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA last year suffered severe criticism from non-members and  
members alike over an endorsement deal with appliance maker Sunbeam 
Corp. The AMA eventually paid Sunbeam nearly $10 million after 
backing out of the deal, and several high-ranking executives were 
fired or quit 
</P>
<P>
	AMA trustee Dr. William Mahood said the new Internet site will  
make sure that problem does not occur, insisting that the site will 
clearly differentiate editorial content from advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Caplan, director of the center for bioethics at the  
University of Pennsylvania, said the AMA is on the right track 
helping doctors and patients use e-mail to communicate. Currently, 
less than 2 percent of doctors use e-mail with patients, though 
Caplan expects the numbers to soar as doctors realize they can more 
efficiently help consumers by answering their questions online. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA name will help attract some users to medem.com, Caplan  
said, though people like to seek information on the Internet 
because they can search a multitude of sources, all with different 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The glory of the Internet is it is wide open and freewheeling,  
but the problem with the Internet is it is open and freewheeling,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> MIT Frat Punished for Serving Minor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An MIT fraternity accused of serving alcohol to an  
underage Wellesley College student lost its dormitory license 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The city Licensing Board gave residents of the off-campus Sigma  
Alpha Epsilon house until Nov. 15 to find new lodging. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to be told they aren't children anymore,'' said  
chairman Daniel Pokaski. ``I don't think they even have a clue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a party at Sigma Alpha, fraternity members drove a  
group of women back to Wellesley on Sept. 3 and dropped the 
intoxicated student off at a hospital. She was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Licensing Board revoked the dorm license of  
another Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternity, Phi Gamma 
Delta, after an 18-year-old freshman, Scott Krueger, drank himself 
into a coma and died. The fraternity eventually disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigma Alpha lawyer Carl King said the fraternity was  
disappointed by the board's decision.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Monitors Suggested for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Britain suggested  
Thursday that, with no weapons inspectors in Iraq, U.N. monitors 
instead make sure that equipment imported for humanitarian programs 
wasn't being diverted to military use. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq in December as the United  
States and Britain launched airstrikes, and the Iraqi government 
has barred them from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then no one has been able to monitor the country's weapons  
programs or check that materials with military applications is 
being used for humanitarian purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are U.N. monitors in Iraq to check food distribution  
in the government-controlled central and southern regions. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. deputy ambassador Peter Burleigh said the United States  
wanted to discuss with the United Nations how there could be ``U.N. 
monitors on the ground in Iraq who could reassure the Security 
Council that the purpose of a particular export has actually been 
accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, and to a lesser extent Britain, have stalled  
on approving a number of contracts for humanitarian programs in 
Iraq, saying they couldn't be sure of what Iraq was doing with 
dual-use materials, such as chemicals for an oil field. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has expressed concern about  
holding up contracts that could relieve some of the hardships Iraqi 
people suffer as a result of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries suggested that, if the equipment could be  
checked, Iraq could import more spare parts for its oil industry, 
as well as equipment for water, electricity and sanitation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Security Council members discussed the possibility of  
temporarily using U.N. humanitarian workers or employees of Saybolt 
International, a Dutch firm consulting with the United Nations on 
Iraq, a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether Iraq would accept additional U.N. monitors remained to  
be seen. In the past, Baghdad has expressed reservations over the 
number of U.N. employees overseeing the distribution of 
humanitarian supplies.

<HEADLINE> Clinton hosts Nigerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By SONYA ROSS 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the president of Nigeria by his side,  
President Clinton today called on international leaders to ease 
Nigeria's debt and on the Senate to loosen trade restrictions with 
the African continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barriers to trade are barriers to opportunity for Africans  
working hard to catch up in a global economy and for Americans who 
want to work with them,'' Clinton said. ``That's why it is vital 
that the Senate approve the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
which is now pending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton extolled the leadership of President Olusegun Obasanjo,  
a former military leader who advocated democracy and was elected to 
his nation's top post earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to realize the promise of this moment for  
Nigeria, and for Africa,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he would work to ease Nigeria's $31 billion  
debt because it was ``neither morally rite nor economically sound'' 
to force Nigerians to choose between paying their debts or 
educating their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is seeking to help Obasanjo turn his nation into a  
stabilizing force for the rest of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	He met at the White House today with Obasanjo, who took office  
in May and is hoping his first official visit will yield a pledge 
of more U.S. aid and an end to a U.S. ban on flights because of lax 
airport security in Nigeria and drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has billions in oil  
wealth but is struggling with $31 billion in debt, a declining 
standard of living and widespread unemployment. Clinton, who has 
advocated debt forgiveness for poorer nations, is less concerned 
with that than with events that have unfolded since Obasanjo took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the White House notes that Nigeria acted as a  
mediator in Sierra Leone's civil conflict and has taken steps to 
curb corruption, such as canceling questionable government 
contracts and recovering assets stolen under the regime of late 
military leader Gen. Sani Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're witnessing here is a coming of age, if you will,  
for Nigeria under the Obasanjo government,'' said national security 
spokesman Jim Fallin. ``Obasanjo's leadership bodes well for our 
future relationship and successes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among matters on today's agenda was oil -- Nigeria provides about  
10 percent of the oil exported to the United States. Obasanjo wants 
U.S. help in reviving Nigeria's economy by leveraging its oil 
wealth; Clinton is interested in coordinating the assistance 
Nigeria is getting from 18 federal agencies under an umbrella 
effort, the U.S.-Nigerian Joint Economic Partnership Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's attempts to rebuild its economy are hampered by  
lingering concerns over corruption. Several powerful figures, 
including a main Obasanjo supporter, former military leader Ibrahim 
Babangida, got rich off of corruption and continue to live off of 
that wealth, anti-corruption activists assert. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Abacha's death in June 1998, Nigeria has convicted few  
people of corruption, and former officials suspected of corruption 
continue to live openly with little fear of prosecution. While 
Obasanjo forced dozens of senior military generals to retire, there 
have yet to be broad investigations of the military necessary to 
root out deeply entrenched corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Obasanjo's government has shown willingness to prosecute  
some of the most brutal officials of the Abacha regime. Abacha's 
son and one of his top security officials were recently arrested in 
connection with the slaying of pro-democracy activist Kudirat 
Abiola, a wife of the late Moshood Abiola, winner of the 1993 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiola died of a heart attack in prison a month after Abacha  
died.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Eyes Sanctions Against Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The NAACP wants minorities to boycott businesses  
owned by Detroit Tigers owner Mike Ilitch and wants the baseball 
commissioner's office to take sanctions against the team for 
failing to interview minorities for its managerial position. 
</P>
<P>
	By hiring Phil Garner, who is white, without interviewing anyone  
else, the Tigers ignored baseball's initiative to consider 
minorities for management positions, the president of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of Comerica Park, the Tigers' new stadium,  
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume called the hiring of Garner 
``essentially a slap in the face'' to minorities such as Atlanta 
Braves coach Don Baylor, San Diego Padres coach Davey Lopes, 
Philadelphia Phillies coach Hal McRae and New York Yankees coach 
Willie Randolph. All have been mentioned as candidates for 
management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call on Mr. Ilitch to publicly apologize for this egregious  
affront to African-Americans and Latino communities all over this 
nation who believe in baseball, who love this sport and who believe 
in equal opportunity,'' Mfume said. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig issued a statement  
Oct. 14, the day Garner was hired, saying his office was reviewing 
the decision. Selig's office did not return calls Wednesday left by 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume also called on Detroit's minority community to boycott  
Ilitch-owned businesses, which include the Little Caesar's pizza 
chain, the Detroit Red Wings and several restaurants and clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes said Wednesday that the team's  
commitment to diversity is backed by the $60 million in contracts 
awarded to minority firms to help build Comerica Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no organization that is more committed to equal  
opportunity employment and the inclusion of minority business 
communities than the Tigers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Contaminated Hot Dogs Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Health officials are investigating two deaths  
and six cases of illness to determine whether they were caused by 
contaminated hot dogs from a New York City plant, the federal 
Centers for Disease Control said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot dogs made at the Bronx factory and distributed nationally  
were recalled after listeria, a food-borne bacteria, was found. The 
plant makes hot dogs sold under the brands Sabrett's and Western 
Beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria found in an unopened package of Sabrett's hot dogs  
appeared to be similar to a strain of bacteria found in eight 
patients in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia and Rhode Island, CDC 
spokesman Tom Skinner said. Two of the eight have died. 
</P>
<P>
	Skinner said the CDC had not confirmed that hot dogs caused the  
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathon Enterprises Inc., which operates the plant, shut it and  
recalled about 52,000 pounds of hot dogs on Oct. 13. It expanded 
the recall Tuesday to 2.1 million pounds of frankfurters bearing 
the code EST 8854 inside the USDA seal of inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions that the CDC is taking are part of their normal,  
routine procedure in any inquiry,'' said Marathon spokeswoman 
Courtenay Higgins. ``Right now, it's inappropriate to conclude that 
it's directly linked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western Beef spokeswoman Selma Gore said the company has  
switched to another manufacturer for its frankfurters.

<HEADLINE> A Debate Without Breakthroughs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- They can't go on meeting like this.  
</P>
<P>
	The five Republican presidential candidates who have debated  
twice in a week haven't found much to argue about -- except with the 
sixth man, who wasn't there. Gov. George W. Bush sent regrets, 
again, but said he looks forward to debating the rest of the 
Republican field next time, in Manchester, on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' said Steve Forbes, who is financing 
much of his campaign out of his personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said he was frustrated that Bush wasn't at Dartmouth  
College for Thursday night's debate, and hadn't been at a GOP 
candidate forum last Friday, either. Bush went to next-door Vermont 
for a fund-raising event that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither forum produced debate breakthroughs. Sen. John McCain,  
Forbes, conservative activist Gary Bauer, commentator Alan Keyes 
and Sen. Orrin Hatch made their points with little dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer criticized Forbes' ideas on a flat tax to replace the  
income tax, but that was as tough as it got. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes took the only real shot at Bush, when a questioner said  
she would have liked an opportunity to ask the front-runner whether 
nominations should go to the highest bidder. Bush has far outraised 
the others, as he had outpolled them so far. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was frustrated, too, that the Texas governor wasn't  
there to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, the candidate closest behind Bush, said afterward that  
obviously he'd like to have everybody at such forums. ``I'm sure 
he'll be coming and debating,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	``... Particularly since we're moving up so rapidly in the  
polls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes had said earlier that Bush's absence ``underscores that  
one candidate thinks he can play by his own rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush didn't write the rules for front-runners, one of which  
is to avoid debate confrontations with challengers for as long as 
possible. He has. And he apparently has decided that time is almost 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain has narrowed the polling gap, gaining traction, he says,  
although he still trails by 12 to 16 points in the latest state 
surveys. Not very close, but closer. 
</P>
<P>
	The others are in single digits, while Bush is at 39 percent in  
one poll, 42 percent in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Bush got his turn on New Hampshire television two  
hours before the debaters did, in an interview on WMUR of 
Manchester, the dominant TV station in the first primary state and, 
with CNN, the debate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' Bush said in the TV interview. He said he hopes New 
Hampshire voters understand that his family comes first, so he 
thought it more important to be in Dallas, where his wife, Laura, 
was honored at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush appearance irked his opponents.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was catering to someone who's given people up  
here the brushoff,'' said Lyn Nofziger, a veteran GOP campaign 
consultant now supporting Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP veteran, Scott Reed, said it worked to Bush's  
advantage. ``If anything, he gained by having his five minutes to 
himself,'' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	During 60 minutes of debate, none of the candidates took new  
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain had the clearest strategy: The Arizona senator is  
trying to establish himself as a reformer, on his trademark 
campaign finance issue and other points as well. 
</P>
<P>
	He said repeatedly that the only way to get things done, on the  
rights of patients in managed care, on taxes, on school voucher 
financing, is to do away with the influence of special interests by 
curbing big money in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be president of the United States because I want to  
reform government,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a message that could boost him with the independent vote,  
potentially pivotal in New Hampshire, where one third of the voters 
are in that category and will be able to cast ballots in either the 
Republican or Democratic primary on Feb. 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Woman Disrupts Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- An unidentified woman whose yelling  
interrupted Thursday night's Republican presidential debate was 
escorted out of the theater by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanover Police Capt. Chris O'Connor said Dartmouth College  
security officials called his department to remove the woman after 
she refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who was seated in the balcony overlooking the stage,  
began shouting as another woman tried to ask Gary Bauer the third 
question of the debate. She demanded a cut in military spending 
``so we can have good schools, good health care, good education 
....'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor said she left the theater without incident when police  
arrived. She was not arrested and police do not plan to charge her, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not have any information about whether the woman had a  
ticket to the event or was allowed in because there was extra room 
in the theater.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Visits Twin Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINA, Minn. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan's visit Thursday to the Twin Cities included a book 
signing and a campaign fund-raiser, but no meeting with the highest 
officeholder of his newly adopted party. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Gov. Jesse Ventura wasn't interested in meeting with  
Buchanan, plenty of other Minnesotans were. More than 200 lined up 
for a book-signing at a suburban bookstore and chanted ``Go Pat 
Go'' as he entered the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, however, said his schedule was full and he didn't have  
time to meet with Buchanan, who signed copies of his book ``A 
Republic, Not an Empire.'' When asked whether he had any interest 
in talking to Buchanan, the governor said, ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who joined the Reform Party on Monday, is considerably  
more conservative than Ventura. The former Republican opposes 
legalized abortion; Ventura supports abortion and gay rights. 
Ventura always has said Buchanan is welcome in the party. But the 
governor also wants someone else to be the party's presidential 
nominee and even has left open the possibility of entering the race 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor's got a right to disagree with me,'' Buchanan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he's a good fit for the party because of his  
opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, support of 
campaign finance changes, pledge to keep U.S. soldiers out of 
foreign wars, push to stop illegal immigration and promise to stand 
up to China. 
</P>
<P>
	To those in the party who think he's too conservative, Buchanan  
said, ``They know Pat Buchanan. I bring to the party my beliefs and 
values and ideals and I don't change them because the weather 
changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he was ready to take on any Reform candidate  
Ventura might support. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Reform Party Chairman Rick McCluhan, who brought  
greetings to Buchanan from the governor, said he doesn't believe 
Buchanan will find much support in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	But those who met the candidate at a Barnes and Noble bookstore  
were enthusiastic, and many said they were impressed with his 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's book has been criticized because he argues that  
Germany was not a threat to the United States after 1940. Although 
some of those waiting for his autograph hadn't read the book, they 
weren't buying into the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rampetsreiter, 28, a Republican and Minneapolis financial  
consultant, said he's a supporter because Buchanan ``doesn't back 
down and stands up for what he believes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Leibel, 60, a home contractor from St. Paul, nodded in  
agreement and said, ``I like what he stands for. He doesn't weasel 
out, doesn't back down. He has his beliefs and that's it.''

<HEADLINE> EU Backs U.S. Anti-Doping Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- European Union officials have joined the  
United States in giving a cool response to the International 
Olympic Committee's plan for a world anti-doping agency, a U.S. 
official says. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, head of the White House drug policy office,  
said Thursday that during his trip to Europe this week, EU and 
national leaders gave their blessing to alternative U.S. proposals 
for an international agreement on tackling performance-enhancing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is, I believe, a growing consensus among the  
nations -- the Australians, the Brits, the French, the Germans, the 
EU in general -- that there are certain principles that ought to 
guide the final solution,'' McCaffrey told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Those principles include a broad international consultation  
process on the proposed agency which must be independent of any 
other world body, according to McCaffrey. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey accused the IOC of attempting to push through its own  
project for an anti-doping agency without consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand what the IOC is doing. ... Normally we do  
things by consultation, by consensus, by common sense,'' McCaffrey 
said. ``I don't understand what the ... apparent arrogance of the 
approach is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC plans to set up the agency as a Swiss foundation on Nov.  
10 with the appointment of a board of directors. The IOC says the 
agency will be up and running by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCaffrey said the planned agency would not be independent,  
would not publish test results, and its anti-doping code would be 
only advisory in nature. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the U.S. proposal includes the establishment of an  
independent and accountable agency which would conduct tests on a 
year-round, no-notice basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to move in this direction,'' McCaffrey said, noting  
that the U.S. Olympic Committee had agreed to the setting up of an 
independent drug-testing agency for American athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey believes next month's Australian Sports Summit, where  
26 nations will discuss doping in sports, would be the ideal place 
to establish common ground on the doping agency. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was visiting the Lisbon-based European Monitoring  
Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction as part of his six-day trip to 
four European countries to discuss drug-control policy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Slams Congress on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton criticized Congress today  
for resisting his education priorities and accused them of engaging 
in ``frivolous'' battles for short-term political gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used the film ``Independence Day'' as a dramatic example  
of how crisis forces citizens to work together for a common cause. 
He said good economic times and the absence of a looming 
international threat had led some in Congress to believe that they 
didn't have to plan for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were being attacked by space aliens we wouldn't be  
playing these kinds of games,'' he said. ``These kinds of games are 
only possible because the economy is strong and the American people 
are self-confident and people believe therefore that they can do 
frivolous things that they would otherwise never consider doing to 
try to get short-term political advantage. But it's a huge 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke to the 1998-1999 Blue Ribbon School Awards  
ceremony, which recognized schools that have overcome obstacles to 
improve education. He indicated frustration with the short shrift 
his budget priorities were receiving on Capitol Hill given the 
strong economy and improving federal finances. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called on Americans to commit themselves to improving  
basic education. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one believes yet that we are giving every child in America  
a world-class education in'' kindergarten through 12th grade, 
Clinton said. ``Everybody knows we have the best system of higher 
education in the world. Therefore, we cannot quit until we know we 
have done the same with K-12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president renewed his call for hiring 100,000 new teachers  
nationwide and said he would veto a Republican proposal to mandate 
a cut of 1 percent to 1.4 percent in all federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will pay an enormous price in opportunities forgone ... if  
we don't use this magic moment to build a future of our dreams,'' 
Clinton said. ``I am worried that what we see in Congress today in 
this debate on education is a kind of mental lapse, or focus on 
short-term politics.''

<HEADLINE>  Mariano Rivera Is World Series MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The slender right-hander with the buggy-whip  
fastball stood on the mound. Two outs. Ninth inning. Another World 
Series to close out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no contest.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second year in a row, Mariano Rivera closed the case for  
the New York Yankees, and this time he was rewarded with the MVP 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about it,'' he said. ``I just feel tremendous to  
be there. I want to be there when this happens. I was the guy 
throwing the last pitch. And I had the last out. It feels 
tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees couldn't think of anyone they'd rather have in that  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``He's the best  
closer I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers support that point of view.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera saved Game 1 of the Series, getting the last four outs in  
a 4-1 Yankees victory. He came back with two scoreless innings as 
the winning pitcher in the 6-5 victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, he came on in the eighth inning with the  
tying runs on base and retired Chipper Jones on a grounder to end 
Atlanta's last threat. Then he breezed through the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was done, Rivera had just added to an awesome postseason  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight postseason appearances this October, he had two  
victories and six saves. He has not allowed a run in his last 25 
2-3 innings of postseason play, with two victories and 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's postseason earned-run average of 0.36 -- two earned runs  
allowed in 47 1-3 innings -- is the lowest for any pitcher with at 
least 30 innings pitched in postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 4 save extended his streak to 12 1-3 consecutive  
scoreless innings over eight games in three World Series. The last 
time he gave up a run in a Series game was the eighth inning of 
Game 3 in 1996. The Yankees beat Atlanta that night, triggering a 
record-tying streak of 12 World Series victories for New York.

	``I love the challenge,'' he said. ``I love to be in that  
situation. I guess that's my motivation. Once you're there, you 
have butterflies in your stomach. You know you're there for real. 
You just want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was just as good in the regular season, finishing with a  
4-3 record and 1.83 ERA and converting 45 of 49 save opportunities, 
which tied his career high. He ended the regular season with a 
scoreless streak of 30 2-3 innings over 28 games and converted his 
last 22 save chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he gave up a run was July 21, more than three  
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was the setup man for the '96 Yankees when bullpen  
partner John Wetteland saved all four Yankees victories to earn the 
MVP award of that Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was my teacher,'' Rivera said of Wetteland. ``We would  
sit together and spend time talking about baseball. I know I 
learned a lot from him and he learned a lot from me, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Wetteland signed as a free agent with Texas, Rivera  
inherited the closer role. The switch required a change in approach 
for Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're the setup man, you know somebody will come behind  
you,'' Rivera said. ``When you're the closer, you know there's 
nobody coming behind you. It's tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The setup man has a net. The closer has nothing. If he falls,  
he's dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Rivera as a closer, that rarely has been a problem for the  
Yankees.

<HEADLINE>  Mariano Rivera Is World Series MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The slender right-hander with the buggy-whip  
fastball stood on the mound. Two outs. Ninth inning. Another World 
Series to close out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no contest.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second year in a row, Mariano Rivera closed the case for  
the New York Yankees, and this time he was rewarded with the MVP 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about it,'' he said. ``I just feel tremendous to  
be there. I want to be there when this happens. I was the guy 
throwing the last pitch. And I had the last out. It feels 
tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees couldn't think of anyone they'd rather have in that  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``He's the best  
closer I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers support that point of view.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera saved Game 1 of the Series, getting the last four outs in  
a 4-1 Yankees victory. He came back with two scoreless innings as 
the winning pitcher in the 6-5 victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, he came on in the eighth inning with the  
tying runs on base and retired Chipper Jones on a grounder to end 
Atlanta's last threat. Then he breezed through the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was done, Rivera had just added to an awesome postseason  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight postseason appearances this October, he had two  
victories and six saves. He has not allowed a run in his last 25 
2-3 innings of postseason play, with two victories and 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's postseason earned-run average of 0.36 -- two earned runs

<HEADLINE> Clear Channel Net Earnings Are Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Clear Channel Communications Inc. said  
Thursday its net earnings fell in the third quarter amid extensive 
acquisition activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest owner of radio stations said its net income  
was $1.5 million, or zero cents per share, down from $11.5 million, 
or 5 cents a share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met the expectations of analysts surveyed by First  
Call/Thomson Financial, who had anticipated the company would break 
even on a per-share basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating income before depreciation and amortization was  
$300.35 million for the quarter, up from $157.7 million in the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues more than doubled, to $887.9 million from $434.6  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1999, Clear Channel merged with Jacor Communications and  
absorbed its radio stations and syndicated radio shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Clear Channel agreed to buy AMFM Inc. of  
Dallas. The move creates a company that will dominate the nation's 
airwaves with 830 radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clear Channel already was the nation's largest radio empire with  
512 stations, while AMFM had 443 stations, the second largest 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Clear Channel's net income  
was $95.3 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $45 
million, or 19 cents per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $2 billion, up from $1.02 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Clear Channel stock was up 3 9/16 at 81 9/16 today.

<HEADLINE> Lodge Sued in Yosemite Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A lodge that employed the handyman who  
allegedly killed three Yosemite National Park sightseers should be 
held liable for their deaths, the victims' families allege in two 
wrongful death lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of victims Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old  
daughter, Julie, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, contend 
employees of The Cedar Lodge in rural Mariposa County were wrong to 
assign the women to an isolated room and failed to do a proper 
background check on former employee Cary Stayner, who has been 
charged with their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits were filed Wednesday in Fresno County Superior  
Court. Both families seek unspecified sums for punitive and other 
damages, and reimbursement for funeral expenses and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The lodge is one of six area motels owned by Gerry Fisher and  
his family. In a short statement, their company said it had not 
seen the lawsuits and declined comment on the specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 38, is named as a codefendant in the complaints, adding  
another legal layer in a case already compounded by parallel 
federal and state prosecutions and potentially thorny defense 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who is being held at the Fresno County Jail, was  
charged last week by a state prosecutor in the three mid-February 
deaths. He is yet to be arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has pleaded innocent in the July 21 death of Yosemite  
naturalist Joie Armstrong. He will be tried in U.S. District Court 
in that case because the park falls under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are still working out how and when the cases will  
proceed. Stayner faces the death penalty in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints are similar, though the Sund complaint is more  
specific in faulting the lodge for keeping Stayner on staff, saying 
managers should have known that he acted in an ``unusual, bizarre 
or violent manner'' on prior jobs.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Earnings Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp. Ltd. said Thursday its first-quarter  
earnings exceeded analysts' expectations despite lower income from 
its entertainment division, which was buoyed last year by video 
sales of the motion picture ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit after taxes was $165 million, or 16 cents a  
share, down from $196 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago. The 
results in the latest quarter were 2 cents above analysts' 
predictions, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. shares were unchanged at $35.93 3/4 in trading at 5:15  
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $3.16 billion, compared with $3.19 billion a  
year earlier, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said consolidated operating income in the quarter  
was $395 million, down from $407 million a year ago. Income in the 
filmed entertainment division fell to $46 million from $123 
million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Fox Entertainment Group, which is 82 percent owned by  
News Corp., said its net income for the July-September quarter was 
$43 million, or 6 cents a share, down from $57 million, or 10 cents 
a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the difference again was attributed to last year's  
``Titanic'' popularity. But Fox Television Stations and Fox 
Broadcasting Co. reported earnings increases, as did the company's 
cable operations, which also include the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Before depreciation and amortization, earnings in the  
July-September quarter were $280 million, up from $273 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $1.8 billion, the same as a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox Entertainment stock was quoted at $22.18 3/4 a share at 5:15  
p.m. on the NYSE, down 75 cents.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Hurricanes' New Arena Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hockey's nomads finally have a home.  
</P>
<P>
	After two years of playing ``home'' games at the Greensboro  
Coliseum 80 miles down Interstate 40 and starting this season with 
an NHL record-tying nine-game road trip, the Carolina Hurricanes 
will open the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a strange feeling,'' defenseman Glen Wesley  
said about playing in the team's new 18,700-seat arena. ``You can 
probably go all the way back to Hartford to where we felt like we 
had a home -- until we found out we were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been tough sleeping at night because you are so excited  
about coming down to the new rink and seeing the new things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Hartford Whalers left Connecticut for North Carolina  
following the 1996-97 season, but construction delays in the new 
building forced the team to play two years in Greensboro, where it 
was last in the NHL in attendance both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of times during that I-40 drive you wondered if the  
end would ever come,'' center Jeff O'Neill said of the 160-mile 
round trip for each home game. ``But we saw the light at the end of 
the tunnel and we stuck together as a team. Since I came into the 
league they have been talking about the Whalers moving and for me 
this is the end result. I've finally got a home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's home opener against the New Jersey Devils is sold out,  
not a very common occurrence for the Hurricanes. The team sold out 
only four games last season in Greensboro, where the coliseum had a 
black curtain lowered in the upper deck to hide empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain what the guys have quietly put up with over  
the last two years,'' coach Paul Maurice said. ``We didn't get a 
lot of complaining out of our locker room about the circumstances 
and I'm happiest for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's solid 4-2-3 start during the season-opening nine-game  
road trip and the opening of the new arena has created somewhat of 
a hockey buzz throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice and the players hope the sport can catch on and give the  
team a home-ice advantage, something that was missing the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost a quarter of the way into our road schedule, now  
we have to make hay at home,'' said Maurice, whose team has 11 home 
dates in November. ``That will be a big test for us Friday. Are we 
going to be able to keep our emotions in check enough to play our 
game and not open it up too much and try to put on too big a 
show?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having 11,000 seats in the arena's lower bowl could make the new  
place rather loud, Maurice said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect it to be loud just based on the fans that we had  
last year and how loud they were,'' Maurice said. ``They came to 
yell and scream. There are some places that are like libraries 
around the league ... and that works against the home team. This 
building doesn't have any of those characteristics. They've done a 
great job with the slant of the lower bowl.''

<HEADLINE> Huang May Testify About Ickes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee today cleared the way for  
public testimony by former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang 
after revealing that he supplied the Justice Department with new 
information about political donations regarding both of President 
Clinton's campaigns for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee voted unanimously to grant  
Huang, a government witness, limited immunity from prosecution 
after the panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, stated that Huang: 
</P>
<P>
	--Was asked by the architect of Clinton's 1996 re-election,  
then-deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes, to raise money 
for the congressional campaign of Jesse Jackson Jr. in 1995, a 
period in which Jackson's father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, posed a 
threat to Clinton's re-election. Jackson was considering a run for 
president as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Embarked on an illegal fund-raising scheme in 1992 after his  
boss, Indonesian businessman James Riady, promised presidential 
candidate Bill Clinton $1 million in political donations. ``Why 
wasn't James Riady indicted?'' asked Burton. Clinton greeted Riady 
while shaking hands on the president's recent trip to New Zealand. 
Riady has not returned to the United States since allegations of 
campaign fund-raising abuses erupted in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said Huang has told investigators that after Clinton and  
Riady took a car ride in 1992, Huang helped arrange the scheme in 
which Riady employees could be reimbursed for their political 
donations. Burton said Riady made the promise of $1 million during 
the ride. The car ride and Riady-connected donations were 
previously known, but Riady's alleged $1 million personal 
commitment to Clinton had not been known until Huang began 
cooperating with the Justice Department earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said today that the Justice  
Department examined allegations regarding Ickes to determine 
whether an independent counsel should have been appointed to 
investigate the man who now is a key strategist for Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's bid for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reviewed all of these instances and look at it to  
determine whether it triggers the independent counsel,'' Reno told 
her weekly news conference. ``In this instance, we determined that 
it did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, The Associated Press disclosed that Huang, who has  
been a central figure in the fund-raising probe, has been secretly 
telling the Justice Department that Ickes was behind an effort in 
1995 in which he asked Huang to support the congressional candidacy 
of the Jesse Jackson Jr., son of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the White House was closely watching the plans of  
the elder Jackson, who was weighing a possible challenge against 
Clinton as an independent presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes at the time was overseeing Clinton's re-election effort  
from the White House; Huang was a Commerce Department employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits government employees like Ickes from  
soliciting campaign donations from subordinates. It is a felony 
punishable by up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes denies breaking any fund-raising laws. He and his lawyers,  
Robert Bennett and Amy Sabrin, did not return calls this week to 
their offices. Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department conducted an initial inquiry into Huang's  
allegations but concluded the facts as outlined by Huang didn't fit 
the elements of a federal crime and there was no need to seek an 
independent counsel to investigate Ickes, according to legal 
sources familiar with Huang's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans repeatedly have criticized Reno for not seeking an  
independent counsel to investigate Democratic fund raising in the 
1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang told the investigators he donated $1,000 to Jackson and  
raised an additional $6,000 to satisfy Ickes' request. 
</P>
<P>
	According to legal sources, Huang told Justice last winter that  
Ickes called him at his government office and set up an Oct. 2, 
1995, job interview at the White House. Ickes said he was trying to 
``round up people'' to support Jackson and asked Huang to raise 
$10,000 to $15,000 for Jackson from Asian-Americans, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes testified to Congress that, at the president's request, he  
called Huang and met with him on that Oct. 2 about going to work at 
the Democratic National Committee, where Huang's activities 
eventually triggered the fund-raising controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Huang was a deputy assistant secretary at the  
Commerce Department but was seeking Ickes' help to land a job with 
the Democratic Party for the 1996 election. Huang became a key 
fund-raiser for the party in the Asian-American community, a job 
that landed him in hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang has been sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to  
charges he conspired to violate federal fund-raising laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Jackson, who took an active role fund raising and  
campaigning for his son, said Wednesday he spoke often to Ickes 
during that period, but doesn't recall ever discussing whether the 
White House could assist the congressional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not pursue them to support Jesse's campaign,'' the  
elder Jackson said of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he'd talked to presidential aides about the White  
House supporting his son, the elder Jackson replied, ``No. I have 
no knowledge of that, no recollection of that at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's son, now a congressman from Illinois, said the FBI  
interviewed him about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not talk to Mr. Ickes during my campaign about fund  
raising, about raising any money for our efforts, and I indicated 
this to the FBI,'' the younger Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Germany To Share Stasi Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA is sharing files with German agents  
that it secretly obtained from East Germany's Stasi intelligence 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither U.S. nor German officials are discussing terms of the  
agreement, but CIA Director George Tenet says it will include all 
files that would not compromise U.S. sources or CIA methods. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. spy agency for the first time is publicly acknowledging  
it has the files believed to contain information about thousands of 
former East German spies and informants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have promised the German government that we will provide  
them with as much information as possible about all the German 
cases in these files in a form that does not compromise sources and 
methods from our perspective,'' Tenet said at Georgetown University 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He said German agents have had some access to the files since  
1994. The CIA has not disclosed how it got them. They were obtained 
by American agents sometime after reunification of East and West 
Germany in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA spokesman Tom Crispell said Wednesday the agency is not  
releasing any information from the documents or discussing their 
content or details of what will be handed over to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the German Embassy, Claudius Fishbach, referred  
questions to the German agency in Berlin that would get the 
documents, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Calls 
to the agency went unanswered late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A German government spokesman said last week that the CIA had  
agreed to return copies of the Stasi records but he provided no 
more details. Officials had said previously the documents were 
believed to contain both code names and real names of former Stasi 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records in Virginia show that the files, even before the  
CIA said it had them, were used to help convict two former leftist 
student activists -- Theresa Marie Squillacote and Kurt Alan Stand -- 
of espionage. Squillacote, a former Pentagon lawyer, was sentenced 
in January this year to 21 years in prison. Stand, her husband, was 
sentenced to 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany has been seeking the files from the CIA since at least  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents is a masterlist of 320,000 ``identities,''  
including real names, code names and pseudonyms of East and West 
Germans, The Washington Post reported on Wednesday. It quoted 
German sources as saying most names on the list likely were people 
under surveillance rather than spies. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in data collected by East Germany runs high in Germany,  
with the agency in charge of Stasi files reporting hundreds of 
daily requests to look at the documents it now has. German 
officials estimate that 174,000 East Germans and possibly 30,000 
West Germans worked as Stasi informants. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a German government spokesman told reporters that the  
government gained leverage for a deal with the United States after 
Stasi files' administrators in Berlin cracked codes on East German 
magnetic tapes, revealing details of which spy turned over what 
information between 1969 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes identify the spies only by code names. Germany hopes  
the CIA-held files will reveal their true identities. In return, 
Germany would agree to share with the United States the codes it 
has cracked, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Impeachment May Hurt Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton conceded today that his  
impeachment woes may hurt his vice president's campaign but 
maintained that ``mature people'' ultimately would judge Al Gore on 
his own record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people who may not like me may hold it  
against him, but I don't think mature people hold another person 
responsible for another person's conduct,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference with Nigerian President Olusegun  
Obasanjo, Clinton reminded that Gore also deserves credit for the 
successes of his administration, including a healthy economy and 
dropping crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they give him some credit for the longest peacetime  
expansion in history,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a debate Wednesday night against Democratic challenger Bill  
Bradley, Gore acknowledged that many voters are angry with Clinton 
over his admittedly inappropriate relationship with intern Monica 
Lewinsky and the resulting impeachment trial. ``In terms of what he 
said,'' said Clinton, ``he didn't say anything that I haven't 
said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton insisted that, in the end, voters would base their  
decisions on issues like education, crime and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are not dumb,'' he said. ``They vote for what is in  
their interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Days before he planned to attend a ceremony highlighting the  
Middle East peace process in Oslo, Norway, Clinton indicated that 
Israelis and Palestinians were making steady progress toward a 
final peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively, but they've  
but themselves on an aggressive timetable'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both the leaders want to make peace. I believe  
they're committed to it,'' Clinton said. ``They're down to the 
difficult issues now.''

<HEADLINE> McCarthy-Era Screenwriter Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Abraham Polonsky, a director and  
Oscar-nominated screenwriter who worked under pseudonyms and used 
other writers as fronts after being blacklisted in McCarthy-era 
Hollywood, has died at 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonsky was found dead Tuesday by his housekeeper after  
suffering a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonsky was blacklisted for nearly two decades and had only  
nine films to his credit. But he earned an Oscar nomination for 
writing the 1947 John Garfield boxing film ``Body and Soul.'' And 
critic Andrew Sarris once said the 1948 movie ``Force of Evil,'' 
Polonsky's first as a director, is ``one of the great films of the 
modern American cinema.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, Polonsky's career was disrupted after he  
refused to testify about his Communist Party affiliations or name 
party members. His refusal prompted 20th Century Fox to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you said you were sorry you were a radical and had seen the  
errors of your ways, you were let off. That's like saying you have 
no right to make political experiments in your mind,'' Polonsky 
said in a 1968 interview. ``That's the kind of thing they do in 
Communist countries, but we're supposed to be a free country. We 
need to be a genuinely free country and not merely pretend to be 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though blacklisted, Polonsky never completely abandoned  
Hollywood. His best known work as an outcast scribe was the 1959 
crime melodrama ``Odds Against Tomorrow,'' which he co-wrote under 
the name John O. Killens. In 1996, the Writers Guild of America 
restored his real name to the credits. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonsky also used other writers as fronts, which is how he kept  
steady work on the TV show ``You Are There.'' With such jobs, he 
said, his pay under the blacklist was actually higher than it had 
been before. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until 1969 that he would direct his second film,  
``Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here,'' starring Robert Redford. Polonsky 
also directed ``Romance of a Horse Thief'' in 1971 and wrote the 
screenplays for ``Avalanche Express'' in 1978 and ``Monsignor'' in 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonsky was highly critical of ``On the Waterfront'' director  
Elia Kazan, who was honored this year with a lifetime achievement 
Oscar despite testifying before the House Un-American Activities 
Committee and naming names. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a creep,'' Polonsky said. ``I wouldn't say hello to him  
if he came across the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polonsky was trained as a lawyer and taught English at what is  
now the City University of New York. In World War II, he was a 
member of the OSS, a forerunner of the CIA. Before turning to 
films, he wrote novels as well as radio dramas for Orson Welles. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, he taught at the University of Southern  
California and California State University at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Iris; a son; and two granddaughters.  
His first wife, Sylvia, died in 1993 after 56 years of marriage.

<HEADLINE> Penn. Man Accused of Being a Nazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department filed suit Thursday to  
strip a retired Pennsylvania mechanic of his citizenship on grounds 
he served as a Nazi SS guard at three concentration camps during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, the  
department's Nazi-hunting Office of Special Investigations alleged 
that Theodor Szehinskyj, born in Poland in 1924, was a guard for 
the Waffen-SS Death's Head Battalion at Gross-Rosen Concentration 
Camp, Warsaw Concentration Camp and Sachsenshausen Concentration 
Camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by telephone in Upper Darby, Pa., a man identifying  
himself as Szehinskyj said only that his lawyer would respond for 
him in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Szehinskyj's lawyer, Andre Michniak, said, ``My client  
categorically denies these charges. He is shocked and dumbfounded 
by them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was taken as a slave laborer by the Nazis to Austria,''  
Michniak said. ``After three years in Austria on a farm, he ended 
up in late 1944 in a displaced persons camp in Germany.'' He said 
the evidence against his client may have been in Soviet custody at 
some point and should be carefully scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleged that Szehinskyj joined the Waffen-SS in  
1943 and served in the SS Death's Head Battalion as an armed guard 
in the three Nazi camps from 1943 to 1945. In that role, he 
assisted the persecution of civilians on the basis of race, 
nationality or religion, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the period of his alleged service, prisoners at the three  
camps were confined, beaten, tortured, forced into slave labor and 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	Sachsenhausen, opened in Oranienburg, Germany, near Berlin in  
1936, was the Nazis' second largest camp, after Auschwitz, by 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	Warsaw was a smaller camp opened after the suppression of the  
Warsaw ghetto uprising in the spring of 1943. Prisoners were 
brought to Warsaw from other camps to work as slave laborers 
demolishing the Warsaw ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
	About 120,000 prisoners passed through Gross-Rosen and its  
subcamps, and an estimated 40,000 prisoners died there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazis used the concentration camps to isolate and kill Jews,  
Gypsies, Poles and other Nazi-designated enemies, first in Germany 
and later in occupied countries, said Eli M. Rosenbaum, head of the 
special investigations office. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Sachsenhausen, Gross-Rosen and Warsaw concentration camps,  
terror was the daily bread for tens of thousands of innocent 
civilians,'' Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Michael Stiles of Philadelphia added, ``The Nazis  
made diabolically effective use of these camps to silence and 
eliminate all actual or imagined opposition to Nazi rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since it began work in 1979, the special investigations office  
has had 63 Nazi persecutors stripped of U.S. citizenship and 52 of 
them have been expelled from this country. The office's watchlist 
has prevented more than 150 Nazi persecutors from entering the 
United States. More than 250 people in this country remain under 
investigation by the unit, Rosenbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Purina Mills Files for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Purina Mills Inc., the nation's leading  
producer of animal feed has filed for bankruptcy court protection 
as it seeks to restructure debt from a failed takeover and reduced 
feed sales due to falling livestock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Purina Mills. Inc., a 105-year-old St. Louis company, announced  
Thursday it has filed for protection from creditors while it 
reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The 
company said it will continue to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said falling livestock prices, particularly in the hog  
industry, have hurt the company's sales of livestock feed as 
farmers cut back their herds. Purina Mills had 1998 sales of nearly 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's filing came after it couldn't make an interest  
payment last month on $350 million worth of bonds that financed the 
company's buyout last year by Koch Industries Inc. of Wichita, Kan. 
Koch is now backing out of its $110 million purchase of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Purina Mills officials said in a statement that Koch's ownership  
interest would be canceled, and that purchasing and payroll would 
also return to St. Louis from Koch's Witchita office. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the original goal of its relationship with Koch  
was to create a world-class agriculture business, but that the 
operational synergies and strategic initiatives expected from the 
partnership ``failed to materialize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purina hopes to complete the bankruptcy reorganization early  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given current markets where there is an oversupply of both  
feed and animal products, we have adjusted our business models to 
better manage our resources,'' Brad Kerbs, Purina Mills' president 
and chief operating officer, said in a statement. ``Supporting the 
substantial acquisition-related debt in this environment was just 
not possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``But apart from that debt, our financial condition is sound. We  
anticipate we will operate on a positive cash flow basis 
going-forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has $50 million in bank financing to get it through  
the bankruptcy process. The bankruptcy petition was filed in 
Wilmington, Del., where Purina Mills is incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch acquired Purina Mills Inc. in 1998 for $670 million. Purina  
had a $6.9 million profit in 1997, but lost $52 million in 1998 -- 
$43.1 million of that after Koch took control. 
</P>
<P>
	Purina Mills began as a St. Louis feed mill, and was founded in  
1894 by William H. Danforth. His company became Ralston Purina Co., 
which sold its feed business in 1986 and now makes pet food and 
batteries. Both companies continue to use the Purina trademark and 
red-and-white checkerboard logo. 
</P>
<P>
	Purina Mills has 49 plants and 2,500 employees nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Micron Makes Chip Deal With Gateway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Micron Technology Inc. has reached an  
agreement to become Gateway Inc.'s largest memory chip supplier -- 
its second such deal this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boise-based semiconductor company said Wednesday that it has  
entered the five-year agreement to provide a ``near majority'' of 
the personal computer manufacturer's memory chips. The announcement 
came two days after Micron Technology made a similar deal with 
Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ensures demand for Micron Technology's products  
and provides Gateway with a steady supply of chips. Details were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts speculated the Compaq deal could mean $2 billion to $4  
billion in chip sales for Micron each year. No estimates were 
available for the Gateway agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway is the No. 2 direct-seller of personal computers in the  
United States, following top-seller Dell Computer Corp. Nampa-based 
Micronpc.com ranks third in direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really gives us another large, steady customer,'' Micron  
Technology spokeswoman Julie Nash said. ``If you look at the 
industry right now, it probably makes sense for them to ensure they 
have product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dynamic random access memory chips have been in short supply  
recently because of events such as September's earthquake in 
Taiwan. Prices jumped from about $4 for a 64-megabit DRAM chip this 
summer to $20 in September. They have settled to about $12. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things clients have a demand for is memory,''  
Gateway spokesman John Spelich said. ``We don't perceive supply 
issues for the fourth quarter. But supply is tight for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Micron Technology is Idaho's largest private employer, with  
nearly 12,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Finds No NCAA Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The University of Tennessee, claiming it  
has made a thorough investigation of allegations of academic fraud 
in its athletic program, is giving itself a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result is pretty much what we have always said,'' general  
counsel Beauchamp Brogan said Thursday. ``We found no violations of 
NCAA rules at all. No cover-up. Nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan's office has been reviewing allegations raised by EPSN's  
Internet magazine Sept. 26 of tutors doing homework for UT 
athletes, particularly football players, as far back as 1995, and 
administrators failing to tell superiors about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletics director Doug Dickey was expected to release the  
university's findings on Friday as they are mailed to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	Four football players were suspended before the  
Tennessee-Memphis game but later reinstated after Tennessee's 
preliminary investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. Those 
initial findings were turned over to the Southeastern Conference 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said the athletic department and university president J.  
Wade Gilley were reviewing the report on the full investigation 
Thursday. Dickey did not return calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very short. It won't take you long to read it,'' Brogan  
said. ``It reports what the allegations were, what we did and what 
our findings are and conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said his office ``interrogated dozens of witnesses'' in  
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it is an in-house counsel, we have to do as  
thorough job as possible,'' he said. ``We can't sugarcoat our 
report. We don't answer to ESPN.com or anything like that. But we 
have to answer to the NCAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said the NCAA ``always has the right to accept the report  
as it is written or to come in and question our findings or to look 
at whatever we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan's office has conducted similar investigations in recent  
years involving the fraudulent use of a long-distance calling card 
by dozens of athletes and recruiting violations by an assistant 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Football coach Phillip Fulmer levied individual sanctions  
against players in the phone fraud case, and the university fired 
the assistant coach and voluntarily reduced scholarships in the 
recruiting case. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, chancellor Bill Snyder said that while the  
investigation turned up no violations, the focus turned to 
practices and policies concerning academic assistance to 
student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of the university's Faculty Senate voted to set up a  
five-member subcommittee to look into academic integrity issues, 
including whether grades were changed to keep athletes eligible for 
competition.

<HEADLINE> Treadmill May Be Better Heart Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers say they have found a better way to predict a heart  
patient's risk of early death than the expensive, high-tech tests 
most doctors swear by: an often-ignored measurement taken during 
routine treadmill ``stress tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heart's recovery rate -- how much the heartbeat slows after  
someone exercises to exhaustion and stops -- can help doctors spot 
patients needing aggressive treatment for heart disease, the 
nation's biggest killer, according to Cleveland Clinic researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Their findings also could spare healthier patients risky  
follow-up tests and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's already changed my clinical practice,'' said Dr. Michael  
Lauer, lead researcher and director of the Cleveland Clinic's 
exercise laboratory. ``It's terrific news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study is reported in today's New England Journal of  
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Exercise stress tests, used since the 1960s, involve having a  
patient walk on a treadmill while his or her heart rate, blood 
pressure and the heart's electrical currents are monitored. The 
test costs about $600. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the mid-1980s and early '90s, however, doctors have used  
more sophisticated tests also involving a treadmill: stress 
echocardiograms, or ultrasound images of the heart pumping, costing 
around $1,500; a nuclear imaging technique called thallium 
scintigraphy, costing about $2,400; and a nuclear ``video'' showing 
sections of the heart that are not pumping properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, when someone exercises to exhaustion and then stops,  
the heart rate drops 15 to 25 beats per minute. Lauer and 
colleagues found that for patients whose heart rate fell less than 
12 beats one minute after exercising, the risk of dying within six 
years was four times greater than for those above the cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the number that best discriminated between people who  
were going to live and people who were going to die,'' Lauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally doctors focus on other results from a treadmill test:  
how the patient feels, his endurance, how much his heart rate 
increases and changes in the heart's electrical currents. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald Fletcher, a professor at the Mayo Medical School in  
Jacksonville, Fla., said the study convinced him doctors should add 
heart-rate recovery to those four factors to get the best picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have so many sophisticated tests to do that we sometimes  
overlook the obvious,'' Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied records from standard treadmill stress  
tests of 2,428 adults treated at the clinic for suspected heart 
problems from 1990 through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found 19 percent of patients whose heart slowed  
less than 12 beats per minute in the first minute after exercise 
were dead within six years. Of those with a normal heart-rate 
recovery, only 5 percent died in that time. 
</P>
<P>
	After adjusting for the patients' age, medication use, heart  
rate during exercise and at rest, and other factors, the patients 
with abnormally low heart-rate recovery still were twice as likely 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may throw a flag up that maybe this person's at greater  
risk and they need to be watched closely,'' said John Jakicic, a 
professor at Brown University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer said the recovery rate as measured by a treadmill test was  
twice as good as thallium scintigraphy at predicting death. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who are thought to have heart problems during initial  
testing sometimes undergo heart bypass operations or angioplasty, 
in which a tiny balloon is threaded into an artery to clear away a 
clog. These procedures can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and 
the complications can include bleeding, heart attack, stroke and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart-rate recovery could be an indicator of some other risk  
factor, given that scientists don't fully understand how hormones 
and electrical signals from the brain tell the heart when to speed 
up or slow down, said Dr. Edward Dwyer, chief of cardiology at New 
Jersey Medical School in Newark, N.J.

<HEADLINE> McKeon To Stay On To Manage Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jack McKeon wanted to stay as the Cincinnati  
Reds manager. The club wanted him back. 
</P>
<P>
	After an awkward week of wrangling over terms, both sides got  
what they ultimately wanted: McKeon gets to keep managing, the Reds 
get to keep him for at least one more year. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon accepted a one-year contract extension Thursday that was  
less than he thought he deserved after a remarkable season. McKeon, 
68, wanted a multiyear deal after leading the small-market club to 
96 wins and a close brush with the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Reds holding firm to a one-year offer and no other club  
interested in hiring him as manager, McKeon had limited options. He 
thought about his ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to manage,'' McKeon said from his home in North  
Carolina. ``I'm happy with the result. I'll take it one year at a 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the season, chief operating officer John Allen  
and general manager Jim Bowden concluded that McKeon should get an 
extension. The Reds' ownership change forced a delay in making the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack and I talked some time in late July or early August, then  
a lot was made in the media about the delay,'' Allen said. ``With 
the ownership change, it was the right thing we had to go 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marge Schott's sale to three limited partners wasn't completed  
until this month, and Allen waited until the new ownership was in 
place before dealing with personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He met with McKeon at the end of last week and offered a  
one-year deal with a slight increase over the approximately 
$500,000 he made this year. McKeon was upset with the timing and 
the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	He went home to North Carolina and mulled over his options:  
accept less than he wanted or walk away and end his managing 
career. Some players, coaches, scouts and front-office employees 
called and urged him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he accepted, McKeon said, ``A lot of things. First, my  
desire to manage again. Second, all the phone calls I received were 
certainly an influence. And my family wanted to see me continue 
because I was happy doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen declined to talk about why the club offered only one year.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted Jack to manage,'' Allen said. ``It was just a matter  
of sitting down and hammering out the details. We wanted Jack back 
and that's what we got accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With McKeon handling a youthful lineup, the Reds competed for  
the playoffs despite a $35 million payroll that was by far the 
smallest of the contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds finished with their most wins since 1976 and were in  
line to make the playoffs as the NL wild card until losing three of 
their last four games, resulting in a tie with the New York Mets. 
The Reds lost a one-game playoff with the Mets in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of McKeon accepting his extension, the rest of the  
coaching staff agreed to terms for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year to win 96 games with a $35 million payroll and see  
the development of (all the young players) was just phenomenal,'' 
Bowden said. ``Jack and his coaching staff did such a great job 
that it was a no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon's job will be tougher next year. The club stands to lose  
cleanup hitter Greg Vaughn through free agency and the starting 
rotation remains a big concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a remarkable bunch of players this year,'' McKeon said.  
``They played their hearts out. A lot of them developed very 
quickly. I hope now we can sustain that and get better.''

	Republicans To Debate Without Bush  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates warmed  
up for a campaign debate tonight, with Sen. John McCain trying to 
use the forum for headway against the absent front-runner, Gov. 
George W. Bush. McCain said he is encouraged by the polls that show 
him gaining on Bush by margins of 12 to 16 percentage points. Bush, 
appearing on local television to explain his absence, said he knows 
the forum is important, but that his family comes first. He chose 
to stay in Dallas, where his wife was being honored by Southern 
Methodist University. The next GOP debate in New Hampshire is on 
Dec. 2, and Bush plans to participate.

	Clinton Hosts Nigerian President  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Extolling the leadership of President Olusegun  
Obasanjo, President Clinton today called on international leaders 
to ease Nigeria's $31 debt and on the Senate to loosen trade 
restrictions with Africa. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, 
has billions in oil wealth but is struggling with a declining 
standard of living and widespread unemployment. Obasanjo, who took 
office in May, came to the White House in an effort to secure more 
U.S. aid for his country and an end to a U.S. ban on flights 
because of lax airport security and drug smuggling. 

</P>
<P>
	House Approves Spending Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed the last and biggest  
spending bill of the year through the House today, rallying around 
the twin themes of protecting Social Security and not boosting 
taxes. The bill contained $314 billion for education, labor and 
health programs for the new fiscal year and $429 million for the 
District of Columbia budget. It included more than Clinton wanted 
for the Job Corps and AIDS treatment, but less than he wants for 
substance abuse and programs for the elderly. Clinton stood ready 
to veto the measure because of the damage he said would be caused 
by the bill's 0.97 percent across-the-board cut in all agency 
budgets.

	Two Die in Blue Angels Plane Crash  
</P>
<P>
	MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. (AP) -- A jet from the Navy's Blue  
Angels precision flying team crashed during a training flight while 
trying to land, killing both people aboard. The F/A-18 Hornet went 
down on a farm near Moody Air Force Base. The Blue Angels were 
scheduled to perform at the base this weekend, doing the high-speed 
acrobatics and stunts they are famous for. The Pentagon doesn't yet 
know what caused the crash.

	Stocks Romp; Dow Up 227.64  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street had its best day in seven weeks as  
investors chose to focus on employment cost numbers instead of a 
strong report on the nation's gross domestic product. The Dow 
industrials closed up 227.64 at 10,622.53. On the NYSE, advancers 
led decliners 2,190-904. The Nasdaq rose 71.27 to 2,873.79. The 
Labor Department's employment cost index rose by 0.8 percent in the 
third quarter. The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 
percent from July through September, the fastest pace this year.

<P>
	Employers Stingy on Health Coverage  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Employers today are no more likely to offer  
health insurance coverage than they were in 1996, even though 
insurance premiums have remained stable as the U.S. economy 
prospered. While nearly all companies with 200 or more workers 
offered health insurance benefits, just 60 percent of smaller firms 
did so, according to a report by Kaiser Family Foundation and the 
Health Research and Educational Trust. The failure of smaller 
employers to add coverage is one reason the number of Americans 
without health insurance has increased from 39 million in 1994 to 
44 million in 1998, employee benefits experts say.

	Gov't Tries To Block Computer Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department wants to block  
Compuware Corp.'s acquisition of Viasoft Inc. on grounds the deal 
could result in higher prices for certain mainframe computer 
software. The two are head-to-head competitors worldwide for 
mainframe testing and debugging software and for mainframe fault 
management software, which the government said is crucial for some 
mainframe computer users. The government said it intends to file a 
lawsuit soon to stop the transaction, which was announced last 
July.

	World Series Ratings Rise  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television ratings for the World Series  
increased 14 percent over 1998 but were still the second-lowest 
ever. The New York Yankees' four-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves 
on NBC got a 16.0 national rating and a 26 share, up from a 14.1 
rating and 24 share for the Yankees' sweep of the San Diego Padres 
last year on Fox. NBC estimates that more than 63 million people 
watched Game 4, which was the second-highest rated World Series 
game in three years.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Trading Is Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After-hours stock trading goes mainstream Friday,  
with the first traditional exchange staying open late to compete 
with upstart electronic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the bell rings signaling the start of the inaugural  
two-hour extra session at the Chicago Stock Exchange, most 
investors are expected to be on the sidelines -- content to keep 
their activity to trading's prime time. Many apparently are heeding 
warnings of the pitfalls of delving into a more volatile market. 
</P>
<P>
	While touted as the wave of the future, after-hours trading has  
a long way to go to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move by the Chicago exchange is seen as a momentous --  
if symbolic -- step toward round-the-clock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``the beginning of a sea change,'' said Junius Peake, a  
longtime Wall Street broker and consultant, now a finance professor 
at the University of Northern Colorado. ``Finally customers are 
getting what they want, which is cheap trading, longer hours and 
... a single place where they can trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of being locked into traditional hours -- last  
expanded in 1985 to 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time -- the trading 
world has been shaken up by off-hours trading offered to 
individuals by alternative trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Several regional stock exchanges, including Chicago, offer a few  
minutes of late trading for institutional investors, such as 
pension funds. But individuals who want the protection offered by 
traditional exchanges had been left out. 
</P>
<P>
	Beating its better-known New York competitors to the punch, the  
Chicago exchange is offering trading starting at 4:30 p.m. Eastern 
time and running through 6:30. The New York Stock Exchange and 
Nasdaq Stock Market tentatively plan to open their own after-hours 
sessions next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to knock anyone's socks off'' Friday, said  
Andrew Davis, vice chairman of the downtown Chicago exchange, the 
nation's third largest behind New York and Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're a little bit early,'' he said. ``But it beats the  
hell out of being late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange officials anticipate only a handful of trades Friday  
and an estimated 1,000-2,000 daily by mid-2000. After-hours trading 
won't really take off, they expect, for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	While some 120 brokerages and dealers have the capability to  
place customers' orders with the exchange, many are sitting out for 
now, reluctant to commit extra staff and time without customer 
demand to justify the expense. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 311 most-active stocks from the NYSE, Nasdaq and the  
American Stock Exchange will be traded initially in Chicago, where 
more than 90 percent of all transactions are handled 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect investors from wide price swings that might take  
place when only a small number of people are trading, investors 
will only be allowed to buy and sell through ``limit orders.'' This 
means customers must state maximum and minimum prices at which they 
are willing to buy or sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, there are concerns about greater risks associated with  
after-hours trading until the number of players grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not for me,'' said Ted Lauder, 44, a Chicago insurance  
agent. ``Like a lot of other people, I got sucked into playing 
around with a few thousand dollars in after-hours trading. I got 
burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Markese, president of the American Association of  
Individual Investors, sees no reason for individual investors to 
indulge yet in after-hours trading, which he calls ``a different 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are more vulnerable after hours, he said, because with  
low volume and a marketplace scattered among disconnected 
electronic trading systems, it may be difficult to find the best 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get the world hooked up and communicating, it'll be a  
much broader market,'' the Chicago-based investment expert said. 
``Right now, we're not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The after-hours debut nevertheless is a coup for Chicago, which  
despite processing 65 million-70 million shares a day is still 
trying to shake its label as a regional exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional exchanges -- Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati,  
and the Pacific with dual operations in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco -- started out trading in local or regional stocks but 
increasingly offer national and international issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After-hours trading could hasten their demise or force them to  
merge, Peake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something for everybody,'' acknowledged Chicago  
exchange chief executive Bob Forney. ``There's probably not enough 
demand to justify more than a couple of exchanges in it for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to be one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart, Crash Victims Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The skirl of a lone bagpipe playing the Scottish  
lament ``Going Home'' cut through ghostly fog in a chilling tribute 
to Payne Stewart before the start of the Tour Championship on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With sullen faces and vacant eyes, Stewart's peers on the PGA  
Tour sat on white folding chairs on the first tee of Champions Golf 
Club to honor his memory at the tournament where he was to have 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved to laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not going  
to be ashamed of my tears this morning, and neither should you,'' 
Tom Lehman said. ``When he died on Monday, a big part of us died, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a winner of 18 tournaments around the world and three  
major championships, was as traditional in his knickers and tam 
o'shanter as the game itself. That spirit lived on in a service 
that showcased golf's roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrouded by an eerie fog, the bagpiper walked 100 yards toward  
the first tee playing a song about a Scotsman finally returning to 
his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' Tim Herron said. ``The bagpipes drew you  
into Payne Stewart. When you think of bagpipes, you think of 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was traveling to Texas to play in the Tour Championship  
when his plane crashed. Killed with Stewart were his agents, Robert 
Fraley and Van Ardan; pilots Michael Kling and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue; and Bruce Borland, one of Jack Nicklaus' golf course 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every one was convinced the tour should have proceeded with  
the tournament, but PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem was among 
those who said it could be a platform to honor Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
on Monday took from us one of our great champions,'' Finchem said. 
``Payne represented the best of golf. He was a man of great faith, 
a devoted, compassionate and most energetic husband and father, and 
a man of tremendous generosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players hugged each other as they left the service and headed  
past the practice green, where Duffy Waldorf was getting ready for 
the first tee time in the Tour Championship, the $5 million event 
for the top 30 money-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a startling reminder that there was golf to be played.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way you plan to start any round of golf,''  
Waldorf said after finishing 27 holes in 2-under-par. Because 
Stewart's death left only 29 players in the field, Waldorf played 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Estes used his putter for the first shot of the tournament,  
rapping it about 15 feet -- the length of that historic putt Stewart 
made in June to win the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's for you, Payne,'' he said. Estes wound up with a double  
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida on Thursday, New York Mets pitcher Orel Hershiser  
gave a eulogy for Fraley at a private memorial service. Stewart's 
wife and children attended, along with New York Jets coach Bill 
Parcells and golfers Greg Norman and Lee Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orel Hershiser gave a very eloquent, very moving and very  
touching speech,'' said Elise Maynard, a friend who attended the 
service near Orlando, where Stewart lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman considered not playing this week because his mind was not  
on golf, but then Finchem asked him to offer a prayer at the 
service Thursday morning. After a few remarks, Lehman prayed for 
comfort for Stewart's wife and two children, and the families of 
the other victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was up all night ... worrying about completely collapsing  
and not being able to blubber a word,'' Lehman said. ``I think it's 
appropriate that we had that service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players bowed their heads or stared into space as he spoke.  
</P>
<P>
	After a moment of silence, the bagpiper, Steve Agan of Houston,  
played ``Amazing Grace.'' Then he turned and walk back down the 
fairway, again playing ``Going Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a service at Orlando for Ardan later in the afternoon,  
golfer Paul Azinger, choking back tears, told several hundred 
people about Ardan's sense of humor and his devotion to 
Christianity and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter, Fla., Nicklaus and about 1,500 other people attended  
a service for Borland. The architect had decided at the last minute 
to fly on the Learjet with Stewart in order to discuss a business 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fish gets caught in a net or a bird gets caught in a  
snare, Bruce Borland was caught in an evil trap Monday,'' said 
Tommy Kiedis, associate pastor at the First United Methodist Church 
in Jupiter. ``Life is so unsure.''

<HEADLINE> Clemens Proves Skeptics Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens had spent his entire life waiting  
for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't win the big one, they said. Didn't have the heart,  
didn't have the guts. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 30 minutes after he did it, he was up on top of the  
Yankees' dugout, leaning into the first row, hugging the fans and 
giving them high-fives, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight,'' he said, ``I kind of feel what it's like to be a  
Yankee for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years after he first stepped on a major league field, he  
finally proved the doubters wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to make history, Clemens didn't just beat the  
Atlanta Braves, he smothered them. 
</P>
<P>
	On baseball's greatest stage, the mound of Yankee Stadium with  
the World Series title just one win away, he threw four-hit ball 
for 7 2-3 innings and led the Yankees to a 4-1 win Wednesday night 
that gave them their second straight Series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was calm today,'' wife Debbie Clemens said. ``He studied  
his videotapes and was with the family. The whole family was 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koby, 12, and Kory, 11, were out on the Yankees' infield now,  
digging up some dirt to save. Kacy, 5, and Kody, 3, were back at 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens had come back on the field, fans still cheering.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pump you fists. Pump your fists,'' Roger told his kids.  
</P>
<P>
	And the crowd kept yelling for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what everybody said it's all about,'' Clemens said.  
</P>
<P>
	He remembered back to April 11, when the Yankees of '98 received  
their rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We're going to get you one,''' Clemens recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, he played a part, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Those five Cy Young Awards were nice -- more than enough for each  
kid -- but he couldn't flash one on a finger and proclaim himself a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he can.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to thank my family for pushing me to come here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans never quite bonded with him. They loved Mr. Perfect,  
David Wells, a shot-and-a-beer guy. Clemens was more aloof. 
</P>
<P>
	And it didn't help that following consecutive Cy Youngs, he  
slumped to 14-10 after the spring training deal that sent him from 
Toronto to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed Wednesday, when they sensed title No. 25 as they  
walked off the subway and into the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Here was Clemens, bounding off the mound like a kid to field  
three comebackers. He didn't admit it, but he was juiced. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why he came here,'' Derek Jeter said, ``to win a  
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't allow a fly ball to an outfielder, didn't allow a  
runner past first base until the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to do it,'' Series MVP Mariano Rivera  
said. ``This guy was pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the mound before the first, Clemens stopped by  
Monument Park to give Babe Ruth's monument a little pat. And then 
he gave a performance that would make Ruth proud. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Lockhart in the fifth was the only batter to reach leading  
off an inning. He was quickly erased when Eddie Perez bounced into 
a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens pumped his right fist, then pointed his right index  
finger, the one that has released so many fastballs, at second 
baseman Chuck Knoblauch as if to say, you can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't allow another hit until the eighth, when Walt Weiss  
reached on an infield hit -- replays showed first base ump Gerry 
Davis blew the call, that Clemens had caught the ball and had his 
right foot on the bag before Weiss stepped on the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer came out, but Clemens stayed in, allowing a clean  
single to Gerald Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	That was it. New York manager Joe Torre decided Clemens should  
call it a night, even though players on the Yankees bench seemed to 
pull for him to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to finish,'' Clemens said. ``I thought I was still  
pumping pretty good and Skip was going to give me an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly off the mound, Clemens walked. He waved his cap to the  
crowd. He was back to the clubhouse as Jeff Nelson allowed a single 
to Bret Boone that drove in Atlanta's lone run, but came back to 
the dugout for the triumphant ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	He had brought so much baggage with him to New York, including  
the hatred of Boston fans who felt he turned traitor when he left 
the Red Sox after the 1996 season to sign with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	After pitching seven shutout innings against the Rangers in the  
first round, he was bombed in Boston, didn't get out of the third 
inning. The Fenway fans said that was the real Clemens, the one 
with the 2-3 postseason record, not the one who went 247-134 during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that, Clemens said Wednesday night. This is me.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very blessed to be a part of the team,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His career may not be complete, but his mission is.  
</P>
<P>
	``You did it. You stayed within yourself,'' Yankees owner George  
Steinbrenner said after Clemens gave him a big bear hug in the 
chaotic clubhouse. ``I'm really proud of you.''

<HEADLINE> South Carolina Execution Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A day before a convicted cop killer was to  
be put to death, the state Supreme Court blocked the execution 
Thursday, saying it would review materials filed after a woman 
stepped forward and said she was the one who pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Charles Johnson, 36, was scheduled to be executed by  
injection for the 1985 shooting death of a state trooper on 
Interstate 95. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's five justices stayed the execution, saying they  
needed more time to examine the large amount of material submitted 
both by Johnson's lawyers and prosecutors. The justices promised to 
rule by Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last week Connie Hess, who was with Johnson and whose  
testimony was used against him at two trials, said it was she and 
not Johnson who killed Smalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hess, who was 17 at the time of the slaying, said she  
confessed to ease her conscience, and had lied originally ``because 
I did not want to die. The solicitor told me I would fry if I had 
anything to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they doubted her credibility because she has a  
history of mental illness, and they planned to proceed with 
Johnson's execution. 
</P>
<P>
	After Thursday's ruling, South Carolina Attorney General Charlie  
Condon stood by his statements but said ``we want every last 
question that the court may have in this case answered 
satisfactorily before the execution is carried out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's lawyer has questioned why Ms. Hess' trial testimony  
was considered credible, but her latest statement was not. The 
trooper's mother also said Johnson should not be executed.

<HEADLINE> Economy Growing Faster Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's economic performance in the 1990s,  
not too shabby to begin with, is looking even better due to a major 
revision in government statistics released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the new calculations, economic growth has been  
stronger, inflation lower and Americans' personal savings rate, 
which had plunged into negative territory, was revised upward to a 
more respectable level. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes were released by the Commerce Department's Bureau of  
Economic Analysis as part of a twice-a-decade overhaul in the 
government's main economic statistic -- the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	The revisions showed that in the current eight-year-old economic  
expansion, already the longest in peacetime history, the GDP has 
been rising at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent, even better 
than the previously reported 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The upward gains were even more pronounced in the past two years  
with growth in 1998 revised up to 4.3 percent and 1997 growth 
boosted to 4.5 percent, the best showing in 14 years. Before the 
revisions, GDP growth had been put at 3.9 percent for the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and others in his administration who are  
hoping the good economy will help Vice President Al Gore in his run 
for the White House wasted no time hailing the stronger figures as 
further evidence the economy is enjoying the best of times with 
strong growth and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Baily, the president's chief economist, told reporters at  
the White House that the new figures depicted ``a really 
extraordinary record over any period and certainly well into an 
extended boom, potentially the longest boom in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the new-found growth in the revised statistics came from  
changes in how the government totes up the various components of 
America's $9.3 trillion economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest impact came from changing the way the government  
accounts for purchases of computer software by businesses and 
government agencies. Those purchases will be treated as an 
investment that will add directly to GDP output. Previously, 
software purchases were treated as a current expense that did not 
get captured in the GDP's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998 alone, the different treatment of computer programs  
added $160 billion to GDP, accounting for two-thirds of the 
revision for that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another classification change helped boost Americans' personal  
savings rate by including government contributions to government 
employees' pension plans. That change lifted the personal savings 
rate, which had fallen to a record low of a negative 1.3 percent, 
in the spring of this year, back into positive territory of 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the inflation front, a price measured tied to the GDP, was  
revised to show rates over the past few years of about 0.1 
percentage point lower than the already low levels. For 1998, the 
GDP price gauge rose by just 0.7 percent after an increase of just 
1.4 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists generally welcomed the various changes the government  
made in the GDP accounts, saying they corrected long-recognized 
flaws in how the GDP accounted for investments in computer programs 
and how personal savings were computed. Various analysts said that 
because the changes have pushed up total output, they should 
translate into even stronger gains in worker productivity, the key 
factor supporting rising living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never believed that consumers were not saving to the extent  
that the government numbers have said. The revisions give a more 
realistic picture of what's going on in the household sector,'' 
said Ken Mayland, economist at KeyCorp in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Gap Executive Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Robert Fisher, executive vice president of  
Gap Inc. and president of the Gap division, has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher's resignation is effective Nov. 15, the company said  
today. He will remain a member of Gap Inc.'s board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob has made many contributions to our company's growth over  
the past 19 years,'' said company president and CEO Millard 
Drexler. ``He's led the Gap brand through an important period of 
growth. I respect his decision to take some time off and look 
forward to his ongoing contributions as a board member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gap division will report to Drexler.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gap is a great company with great people,'' Fisher said.  
``Helping this company grow has been a big part of my life. Now I 
feel it's time to take a personal leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, 44, joined Gap Inc. in 1980 after earning an MBA from  
Stanford University. In 1985, he was named executive vice 
president, merchandising, for Banana Republic, then an 11-store 
division of Gap Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He became Banana Republic's president in 1989 and was elected to  
Gap Inc.'s board of directors in 1990. He's been an executive vice 
president of the company since 1992 and served as chief operating 
officer from 1992-93 and 1995-97 and chief financial officer from 
1993-95. He was named head of the Gap division in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap Inc. is an international specialty retailer offering  
clothing, accessories and personal care products under the Gap, 
Banana Republic and Old Navy brands. Gap Inc.'s 1998 sales were 
$9.05 billion.

<HEADLINE> Umpires To Vote on Fate of Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires will vote next month on whether to keep  
Richie Phillips and their union or form a new one. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballots will be sent Nov. 5 to all 93 major league umpires,  
including the 22 let go last month, the National Labor Relations 
Board said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be given three choices: the current union, the new  
union formed by dissident umpires or neither, NLRB New York 
regional director Dan Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the secret-ballot election will be announced Nov. 30.  
If no choice gets a majority, a runoff will be held between the top 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissidents, led by AL umpires Joe Brinkman, John Hirschbeck  
and Dave Phillips -- who is not related to the current union head -- 
want agent Ron Shapiro, who represents Cal Ripken, to negotiate 
their next labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 12, the dissidents filed a petition with the signatures  
of more than 30 percent of the umpires calling for the NLRB to hold 
an election, the amount required by federal law. The agency had 
scheduled a hearing for Friday but called it off when all sides in 
the dispute agreed to the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips has headed the Major League Umpires Association  
since 1978 but his support among AL umps has eroded in the past 
year. The union called for a mass resignation strategy in July, 
designed to force an early start to negotiations for a labor 
contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plan backfired when most AL umps either refused to  
resign or quickly withdrew their resignations, which all were 
effective Sept. 2. All umpires then withdrew their resignations, 
but by then the American and National leagues had hired 25 new 
umpires from the minors and accepted the resignations of 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The current union filed a grievance to try to regain the 22  
jobs, and the matter is in arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	If the dissidents win, Shapiro is expected to negotiate a new  
agreement for umpires during the offseason, then have the new union 
hire a permanent head.

<HEADLINE> Smith Makes Overtures Toward GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who bade the  
Republican Party a less-than-fond farewell last July, may be on his 
way back. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who left to become an independent, has made numerous  
gestures pointing to a return, possibly within the next several 
days, according to Republican officials who spoke Wednesday on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	These overtures, including conversations with Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and others, began before Sen. John 
Chafee's unexpected death this week. But officials say the process 
appears to be accelerating because the Rhode Island lawmaker's 
death opened up the chairmanship of the Senate Environment and 
Public Works Committee -- a position that Smith is eager to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith declined comment on his plans earlier in the week. He told  
a reporter it was ``not appropriate'' to discuss political issues 
until after funeral services for Chafee this weekend. He stopped 
short of denying a possible return to the Republican Party though, 
saying, ``I'm just not going to say anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Smith  
wants to retain his seniority rights if he returns to the GOP, a 
move that would allow him to take the chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma is currently in line to become the  
committee's chairman, since he holds the greatest seniority among 
GOP members of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Several officials said Smith and Inhofe were among participants  
at a closed-door discussion Wednesday about the committee post. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's return would mark a rapid turnabout for the 58-year-old  
second-term senator, who sharply attacked his party last July for 
abandoning its conservative principles in the name of political 
expediency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the revolution on issues. We won the revolution on  
principle,'' he said then in a Senate floor speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the desire to stay in power caused us to start listening  
to the pollsters and the consultants again, who were telling us for 
some inexplicable reason that we need to walk away from issues...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my party to stand for something,'' the conservative  
lawmaker said, adding that Republicans routinely ignored their own 
party platform on issues as diverse as abortion, foreign policy and 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said at the time he would seek the presidential nomination  
of a third party. But shortly thereafter, his wife became ill, and 
his presidential campaign has been moribund for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading up to Smith's announcement, a string of GOP  
leaders criticized him. Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican 
National Committee, called the defection a ``serious mistake for 
you personally, with only a marginal political impact -- and a 
counterproductive one at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's petty and it's vindictive and it's insulting,'' Smith  
said of Nicholson's letter when he announced his switch in the 
Senate in July. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, though, Republican officials said Smith has  
talked with Lott and other senior GOP lawmakers about returning to 
the party. He also met with Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Smith attended fund-raisers for GOP causes in his  
home state, and attended a major GOP fund-raising dinner in 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Young Facing Long Odds on Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young can't let go of the  
season or the game just yet. Soon, he might not have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying what Young couldn't, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve  
Mariucci on Wednesday said Young's concussion problems almost 
certainly would keep him sidelined for the rest of the season. And 
the health risks associated with getting another could prevent him 
from ever playing again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small part of me that would love to see him running  
around, throwing touchdown passes again,'' Mariucci said. ``I think 
the whole world would love to see that. But there's a larger part 
of me that has to be ready to have him unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that Steve could play again someday. He is trying to  
get to that point. He knows that it's a long shot, but I don't know 
that he wants to admit that every day. It's like being down 20 
points. He's not going to concede the loss because he's a 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, in his first public comments in two weeks, said he  
continues to hold out hope of playing again, though he conceded he 
has no idea when or if he'll receive medical clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has not been the easiest thing to deal with,'' Young  
said. ``I will not play unless Dr. (Gary) Steinberg and the 
coaching staff and myself feel that it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sidelined since suffering his fourth concussion in three years a  
month ago, the 38-year-old quarterback refused to rule out a 
comeback this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you can put percentages on it, but today I'm  
not on the field, so it's zero percent,'' he said. ``I'm not going 
to play in the next couple weeks or the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put a time frame on it. But I think in time I  
will be able to put enough time between the incident, that the 
unknowable might become knowable. If time runs out on the season, 
so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the team has discussed putting Young on injured  
reserve, which would finish him for the year. But Young has pleaded 
for patience, and out of respect to him the team is allowing more 
time before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want to leave it or let it go,'' Mariucci said.  
``He wants to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci added that the injured reserve list could be inevitable  
for Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we don't need that roster spot. Now, if we get  
an injury or two, we may reconsider. And Steve knows that,'' 
Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young insists he is indeed serious about his health. He says the  
death of a San Jose high school football player following a 
concussion was ``sobering to all of us, not just myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he needs more time and information before deciding  
on his future. Young continues to consult with specialists and 
speak with players who have been driven from the game by repeated 
concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will ultimately abide by his doctor's recommendations  
and does not fear being forced to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been preparing for retirement since I started playing  
football,'' Young said. ``I went to law school. I've done a lot of 
other things. So when that comes, that will be fine. We'll just 
move right on in and do something new. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize these concussions can have their effects, so I'm  
not in any way in denial about it. But certainly I've talked about 
the possibility of coming back and I would like to explore that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver J.J. Stokes said Young's teammates are coming to  
realize their quarterback won't be back any time soon, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought until just recently he would be back at some point  
in time this season,'' Stokes said. ``The fact that he will 
probably not be back is going to be rough, but we just have to go 
with Jeff Garcia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's latest concussion came during a game at Arizona on Sept.  
27. He lapsed into unconsciousness for about 30 seconds after being 
leveled by blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams, and then hit his 
head on tackle Dave Fiore's knee before hitting the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Young has been bothered by headaches, lethargy and  
general wooziness though he said most of the post-concussion 
symptoms have now dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, his chief neurologist, made a recommendation about  
his future. Young still wouldn't say what it was in his first 
public comments in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's telling me I can't play right now,'' Young said. ``It's  
like any injury. You have to give it time to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, Mariucci and the rest of the 49ers are preparing  
for life without Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, we're all prepared not to have him. Sure, we'd like  
to have him, but that may not be what ends up happening,'' Mariucci 
said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed; Up Vs. Pound, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar finished mixed Thursday in foreign  
exchange trading, rising against the Japanese yen and the British 
pound but falling against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	A soaring U.S. stock market and renewed support from the  
treasury secretary helped bolster the dollar, which rose to 105.04 
Japanese yen in late New York trading from 104.17 yen Wednesday. 
The pound dropped to $1.6385 from $1.6439. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar slipped against the euro, which edged up to  
$1.0521 from $1.0500, in part because of expectations of an 
increase in interest rates for the 11 countries that share the 
common European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks and bonds got a lift from economic reports that  
portrayed a robust economy with little inflation. Foreign investors 
who wanted to join the securities-buying spree needed to purchase 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the U.S. economy grew at a 4.8 percent clip  
in the July-September quarter, up from 1.9 percent growth in the 
previous three-month period. A second report said wages and 
benefits grew at a slightly lower rate than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other factors affecting the dollar were comments early  
Thursday from Japan's top economic planner, who said the yen's 
recent appreciation against the dollar has not been rapid enough to 
cause alarm. Taichi Sakaiya, director-general of the Economic 
Planning Agency, also said the government may have to intervene in 
the foreign exchange markets if the dollar falls below 100 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``That probably helped to push the dollar a little higher,''  
said Greg Anderson, a financial economist for FleetBoston 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers declared  
once again that ``a strong dollar is in the national interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson said Summers may have made the comments to take  
advantage of the strong economic data ``to push the dollar a little 
higher against the yen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5238 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5244, and 1.4734 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4721. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the European countries participating in the euro  
are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8586 
German marks, down from 1.8633; 6.2336 French francs, down from 
6.2492; and 1,840.30 Italian lire, down from 1,844.42.

<HEADLINE> Court May Face Division on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State efforts to ban some late-term abortions  
could force the Supreme Court to confront divisive issues it has 
avoided since 1992 when it reaffirmed women's basic right to end 
their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld Illinois and Wisconsin  
laws that ban a procedure labeled ``partial birth abortion'' by 
abortion opponents. ``We conclude that both laws can be enforced in 
a constitutional manner,'' the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
said in its 5-4 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	A month earlier, another federal appeals court threw out similar  
laws in Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflicting results make it more likely -- but still not  
certain -- the Supreme Court will step in to resolve the issue. In 
March 1998, the nation's highest court voted 6-3 not to review an 
appeals court's invalidation of an Ohio law that banned the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion has been one of the nation's most hotly disputed issues  
since the justices legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 in a 
decision called Roe vs. Wade. In 1992, the court reaffirmed women's 
core right to end their pregnancies but let states raise new 
hurdles, such as 24-hour waiting periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the court has not issued a major decision on the  
right to abortion. The majority in the 1992 decision were Justices 
Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter and the 
court's two swing votes, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony 
M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and  
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	White and Blackmun later retired, and President Clinton replaced  
them with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- 
presumably making a 6-3 majority to uphold the basic right to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts say it is hard to predict how the court might  
view a case involving the controversial procedure often used in 
late-term abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure involves partial delivery of the fetus through the  
birth canal. Although a woman's cervix is dilated, the head of the 
fetus cannot pass through it, so an incision is made in the skull 
base and the skull's contents are drained. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Colorado law professor Robert Nagel views the  
court's 1992 ruling as a ``compromise intended to defang the 
issue.'' But a ruling on this late-term procedure ``would be 
inflammatory whichever way they went,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 ruling said states cannot erect an ``undue burden'' to  
women's right to abortion. That standard has been relatively 
untested since then, said Marcia Greenberger of the National 
Women's Law Center, who contends the Illinois and Wisconsin bans 
would create an undue burden. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court takes the case, University of Minnesota law  
professor Suzanna Sherry said the justices ``may answer some 
interesting questions about how abortion statutes have to be 
crafted ... in terms of their specificity and in terms of their 
exceptions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Erwin Chemerinsky, a University of Southern California law  
professor, said, ``Will they see this as a threat to Roe itself? Or 
will they just see it as regulating one particular type of 
abortion?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chemerinsky called O'Connor and Kennedy ``reluctant votes for  
abortion rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec said he thinks  
the court will deny review, particularly because the Illinois and 
Wisconsin laws have not yet been applied to any actual cases.

<HEADLINE> Report: Drug-Resistant TB Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drug-resistant tuberculosis has been found in  
104 countries and could spread to every nation unless $1 billion is 
devoted to controlling it, according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was commissioned by philanthropist George Soros and  
conducted by Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian prisons are among the epicenters of the hard-to-treat  
and potentially fatal disease. About 100,000 inmates have active TB 
and about 40 percent have drug-resistant TB, said Gen. Vladimir 
Yalinin, the chief of prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30,000 people with active cases are released from prison  
in Russia each year, and 400 prison workers have developed TB, he 
said through a translator at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``These epidemics are only briefly local,'' said Dr. Paul  
Farmer, a professor of social medicine at Harvard and author of the 
report. ``They will not remain within prisons, they will not remain 
within national borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TB is the leading infectious cause of death among adults  
worldwide, killing up to 2 million people every year. Eight million 
people are infected each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The report identified TB hotspots -- countries where at least 5  
percent of all TB cases are drug-resistant. The highest percentage 
of drug-resistant TB cases were found in Latvia at 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Latvia was followed by the Delhi state in India, Estonia, the  
Henan province of China, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, the 
Ivanovo region of Russia and the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The study says a TB strategy successfully implemented in New  
York City in the mid-1990s -- deploying health workers to watch 
patients take each and every dose -- is the only way to cure the 
disease and stop the proliferation of drug-resistant strains. 
</P>
<P>
	While the approach used in New York City required less than a  
year of treatment for each case, new strains of 
multi-drug-resistant TB may require up to two years of complex 
treatment, costing anywhere from several hundred dollars to several 
thousand per patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries lack the funding, personnel and public health  
infrastructure to implement such an intensive method of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report predicted that the disease will spread across the  
globe unless $1 billion worth of resources is devoted to 
controlling it. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also suggests that physicians in many countries are  
improperly prescribing TB drugs, contributing to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease is airborne and can be spread through contact as  
casual as sitting on the same airplane with someone who is 
infected.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warplanes Bomb Iraqi Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Responding to Iraqi fire, U.S. warplanes  
bombed an Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery site in the northern no-fly 
zone on Thursday, a U.S. military statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. planes dropped precision-guided bombs on the site east of  
Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad, the Germany-based U.S. European 
Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	All planes left the area safely, it said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqi military claimed it shot down an allied warplane,  
according to a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. 
But the Pentagon denied the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the information I have says that that statement is  
false,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has previously claimed to have shot down a number of U.S.  
and British aircraft over its territory, but has never produced 
evidence. The statement did not say whether Iraq had found any 
debris from the downed plane. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, U.S. planes bombed an Iraqi surface-to-air missile  
site. One of the bombs missed its intended target, but did not 
result in civilian casualties or damage to civilian facilities, the 
U.S. European Command said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. bombings have caused  
civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes patrol no-fly zones in northern and  
southern Iraq, set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf War to protect 
Kurds and Shiites from the forces of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi forces have challenged the planes since December.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Slams Congress on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton criticized GOP budget  
writers Thursday for ignoring his education goals and accused 
lawmakers of engaging in ``frivolous'' battles for short-term 
political gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The president suggested that Congress was making a mistake by  
assuming that good economic times and the absence of an 
international threat presented an opportunity to ignore long-term 
domestic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were being attacked by space aliens, we wouldn't be  
playing these kinds of games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at the 1998-1999 Blue Ribbon School Awards  
ceremony, where schools were recognized for overcoming obstacles to 
improve opportunities for children. ``You have proved that we can 
give them a world-class education,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He renewed his call for 100,000 new teachers nationwide and said  
he would veto a GOP proposal to mandate a cut of 1 percent to 1.4 
percent in all federal programs. The president said it seriously 
would curtail education and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also sought a commitment to improving basic education.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one believes yet that we are giving every child in America  
a world-class education in'' kindergarten through 12th grade, 
Clinton said. ``Everybody knows we have the best system of higher 
education in the world. Therefore, we cannot quit until we know we 
have done the same with K-12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cited the film ``Independence Day'' -- in which aliens  
destroy the White House -- as an example of how crisis forces 
citizens to work together, and suggested that good times had 
prompted some to postpone planning for future domestic needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were being attacked by space aliens we wouldn't be  
playing these kinds of games,'' he said. ``These kinds of games are 
only possible because the economy is strong and the American people 
are self-confident and people believe therefore that they can do 
frivolous things that they would otherwise never consider doing to 
try to get short-term political advantage. But it's a huge 
mistake.''

<HEADLINE> Complaint Filed Against Sports Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Police filed a sworn complaint Thursday  
against sports agent William ``Tank'' Black, accusing him and an 
employee of violating the state's agent law by illegally recruiting 
Florida Gators. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint states that Black's employee, Alfred Twitty,  
recruited former Florida football players Jevon Kearse, Johnny 
Rutledge and Reggie McGrew by offering them cash and other 
inducements while they were still eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Police charged Black and Twitty with three felony counts of  
unlicensed agent activity. They could face a $5,000 fine and up to 
five years in prison per count if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The sworn complaint comes after a nearly yearlong investigation  
in which police at the University of Florida gathered much of their 
evidence during a search of Black's offices in Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, police said the investigation was continuing and  
more charges forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence will be turned over to assistant state attorney  
Bill Cervone in the next week. He will determine whether to final 
formal charges, which could be a month or more away. 
</P>
<P>
	``This means the university police are finished with their part  
of the investigation,'' Cervone said. ``Now it's in the legal 
arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the investigation began, all three players fired Black and  
hired agent Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	The players have admitted wrongdoing in sworn affidavits.  
Rutledge has gone public saying he took money. Kearse has publicly 
stated that he felt embarrassed by what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Black has maintained his innocence throughout and will continue  
to do so, said spokesman Michael Butler. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges are without substance,'' Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL Players Association ran a concurrent investigation into  
Black's dealings and recommended his license be revoked for three 
years. That case is scheduled for arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	The sworn complaint states that Twitty provided cash and other  
inducements to the players in exchange for their eventual signing 
with Black's company, Professional Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It says Twitty's recruiting efforts were financed and conducted  
on behalf of Black and PMI. 
</P>
<P>
	Twitty is charged with illegal recruitment because he is not a  
licensed agent in Florida. Black's charges come because he 
allegedly aided Twitty even though he knew Twitty was not licensed. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler said Twitty is not required to be licensed to service  
players in Florida who are already under contract with PMI. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twitty provides services to professional players signed by PMI  
after their college eligibility is completed,'' Butler said. ``He 
has never acted in a capacity as a sports agent and is not required 
to be licensed by the state of Florida. We do not believe any state 
laws have been violated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley said the school knew  
nothing of the illegal recruiting efforts until after the players 
were off the Gators' roster. He said he did not anticipate any 
disciplinary action from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not unexpected from what we know,'' Foley said of the  
sworn complaints. ``This is a case that our police department is 
committed to bringing to a successful conclusion to, one that 
prevents this from happening in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Huang To Testify on Campaign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee cleared the way Thursday for  
public testimony from ex-Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang, 
whose allegations have raised questions about political donations 
for President Clinton's campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dan Burton said Huang has told the Justice Department he  
engaged in an illegal fund-raising scheme after his employer, 
Indonesian businessman James Riady, promised Clinton $1 million in 
political contributions during a 1992 car ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang said that after the Clinton-Riady car ride, Huang provided  
bank account numbers to the Riady home office in Jakarta so 
employees could be reimbursed for political donations to the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why wasn't James Riady indicted?'' Burton, chairman of the  
House Government Reform Committee, asked minutes before the panel 
voted unanimously to grant limited immunity from prosecution for 
Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	Riady hasn't returned to the United States since the start of  
the campaign fund-raising controversy in 1996. Clinton greeted 
Riady recently at an event in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang also told investigators that while he was at the Commerce  
Department in 1995, he raised money for congressional candidate 
Jesse Jackson Jr. at the direction of Clinton campaign strategist 
Harold Ickes, then deputy White House chief of staff, said Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time Huang was collecting the donations, Jackson's father  
was weighing a presidential campaign against Clinton as a political 
independent. Ickes is now a key strategist in Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's prospective Senate campaign in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton asked why Attorney General Janet Reno decided against an  
independent counsel investigation of Ickes. Justice officials say a 
criminal law barring federal officers from soliciting donations 
from subordinates does not apply to the circumstances described by 
Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reviewed all of these instances and look at it to  
determine whether it triggers the independent counsel,'' Reno told 
her weekly news conference. ``In this instance, we determined that 
it did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to legal sources, Huang also has given the Justice  
Department additional information connecting James Riady to the 
elder Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang says that about a year after he raised money for Jesse  
Jackson Jr., the elder Jackson became aware that Huang had helped 
his son. Huang was asked by his ex-boss, James Riady, to let Jesse 
Jackson Sr. know that Riady was willing to help the elder Jackson's 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang told the Justice Department he knows that Riady  
wire-transferred money to one of Jackson's non-profit entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Riady may have made a contribution to our educational fund,''  
the elder Jackson said in an interview. He said he didn't know how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Huang was working as a fund-raiser at the  
Democratic National Committee in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats insisted that all of the questioning of Huang be done  
in public, a step that will eliminate a situation where information 
can be leaked selectively to the news media. Burton said there 
probably will be more than one day of hearings for Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's ranking Democrat, Henry Waxman, said Huang ``is  
not going to be an explosive witness'' and that Republicans had 
failed to produce evidence for the most serious allegations in the 
fund-raising controversy -- that China funneled money into U.S. 
elections and that Huang was a Chinese spy. Huang through his 
lawyer has vigorously denied the spy accusation.

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 4.8 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JEANNINE AVERSA    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Economic growth rebounded from a sluggish  
spring in the third quarter while a modest rise in Americans' wages 
and benefits eased inflation fears and sparked a Wall Street rally 
that gave investors their best day in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which have been on edge, soared Thursday. The  
Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks closed up 227.64 points at 
10,622.53. Broader gauges also were higher, as were bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The two government reports, released Thursday, paint a picture  
of a remarkably robust economy that is growing rapidly without 
sparking out-of-control inflation, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, many economists believe the Federal Reserve will raise  
interest rates for a third time this year when policy-makers meet 
Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	A 4.8 percent increase at an annual rate in the gross domestic  
product -- the total output of goods and services -- from July 
through September marked the fastest pace this year, the Commerce 
Department said. That followed a 1.9 percent rate of growth in the 
April-June quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While it has not triggered inflation, third quarter growth, more  
vigorous than many analysts had expected, is stronger than Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan would like and may lead the Fed to raise 
interest rates again this year to slow growth to a sustainable 
level, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we're more than likely to see another rate hike  
but both reports suggest it won't take too much more by the Fed to 
get the economy where the Fed wants it to be,'' said Mark Zandi, an 
economist with Regional Financial Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other report, the Labor Department said its Employment  
Cost Index -- considered the best measure of changes in wages and 
benefit costs and closely watched by Greenspan -- rose a moderate 
0.8 percent in the third quarter. That was slightly less than many 
economists were forecasting and much lower than the big 1.1 percent 
surge in the second quarter, which rekindled inflation fears and 
sent stocks tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter report, economists said, indicated little  
inflationary pressures coming from rising wages. In the past 12 
months, employment costs rose a modest 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond and stock markets rallied on this news because they  
had been expecting very bad news -- a big acceleration in wages and 
benefits -- which would likely be followed by aggressive Fed rate 
hikes,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this and other good inflation news, Jones said the  
``odds are 55-45 for a November 16 rake hike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP also showed modest price  
pressures, rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third 
quarter. That was even better than the tiny 1.9 percent increase 
for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is absolute key is that there was strong economic growth  
in the third quarter along with a reduction in the broad-based 
inflation rate,'' said KeyCorp economist Ken Mayland. ``Stocks and 
bonds reacted positively to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robust consumer and business spending, a strong buildup in  
inventories held by businesses and strength in most other 
categories boosted third-quarter GDP growth, offsetting a drag in 
growth from the surging trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we keep this going, in February, without having had a war,  
we will have the longest economic expansion in history,'' President 
Clinton said, taking note of the GDP numbers. ``It's now the 
longest peacetime expansion in history. Wars guarantee you an 
economic expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic  
activity, rose at a solid annual rate of 4.3 percent in the third 
quarter, down slightly from 5.1 percent growth in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, confident that consumers will keep spending,  
increased their stockpiles by $14.1 billion in the third quarter, 
following a slowdown in inventory building in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit subtracted $343 billion from GDP in the third  
quarter at an annual rate, an even bigger drag than in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The GDP numbers reflect a comprehensive overhaul in the way the  
government calculates the GDP, making changes back to 1959 
estimates. The GDP revisions show the economy grew at a 
significantly faster rate in recent years with an increase in 1998 
of 4.3 percent and even bigger 4.5 percent rise in 1997, the 
fastest surge in economic activity in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes also show lower inflation and Americans saving more  
than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of  
disposable income -- had dipped to record lows in negative territory 
but was 2.1 percent in the third quarter under the new 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	All the various changes show the GDP growing at an annual rate  
of $8.88 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars in the third 
quarter of the year. Before adjusting for inflation, GDP in the 
third quarter totaled $9.28 trillion.

<HEADLINE> McKeon To Stay On To Manage Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jack McKeon wanted to stay as the Cincinnati  
Reds manager. The club wanted him back. 
</P>
<P>
	After an awkward week of wrangling over terms, both sides got  
what they ultimately wanted: McKeon gets to keep managing, the Reds 
get to keep him for at least one more year. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon accepted a one-year contract extension Thursday that was  
less than he thought he deserved after a remarkable season. McKeon, 
68, wanted a multiyear deal after leading the small-market club to 
96 wins and a close brush with the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Reds holding firm to a one-year offer and no other club  
interested in hiring him as manager, McKeon had limited options. He 
thought about his ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to manage,'' McKeon said from his home in North  
Carolina. ``I'm happy with the result. I'll take it one year at a 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midway through the season, chief operating officer John Allen  
and general manager Jim Bowden concluded that McKeon should get an 
extension. The Reds' ownership change forced a delay in making the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack and I talked some time in late July or early August, then  
a lot was made in the media about the delay,'' Allen said. ``With 
the ownership change, it was the right thing we had to go 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marge Schott's sale to three limited partners wasn't completed  
until this month, and Allen waited until the new ownership was in 
place before dealing with personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
	He met with McKeon at the end of last week and offered a  
one-year deal with a slight increase over the approximately 
$500,000 he made this year. McKeon was upset with the timing and 
the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	He went home to North Carolina and mulled over his options:  
accept less than he wanted or walk away and end his managing 
career. Some players, coaches, scouts and front-office employees 
called and urged him to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he accepted, McKeon said, ``A lot of things. First, my  
desire to manage again. Second, all the phone calls I received were 
certainly an influence. And my family wanted to see me continue 
because I was happy doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen declined to talk about why the club offered only one year.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted Jack to manage,'' Allen said. ``It was just a matter  
of sitting down and hammering out the details. We wanted Jack back 
and that's what we got accomplished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With McKeon handling a youthful lineup, the Reds competed for  
the playoffs despite a $35 million payroll that was by far the 
smallest of the contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds finished with their most wins since 1976 and were in  
line to make the playoffs as the NL wild card until losing three of 
their last four games, resulting in a tie with the New York Mets. 
The Reds lost a one-game playoff with the Mets in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of McKeon accepting his extension, the rest of the  
coaching staff agreed to terms for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year to win 96 games with a $35 million payroll and see  
the development of (all the young players) was just phenomenal,'' 
Bowden said. ``Jack and his coaching staff did such a great job 
that it was a no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon's job will be tougher next year. The club stands to lose  
cleanup hitter Greg Vaughn through free agency and the starting 
rotation remains a big concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a remarkable bunch of players this year,'' McKeon said.  
``They played their hearts out. A lot of them developed very 
quickly. I hope now we can sustain that and get better.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Surge on Mild Inflation / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices surged Thursday on news that  
inflationary pressures were milder than anticipated during the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/32  
points, or $10.31 per $1,000 invested. Its yield, which moves 
inversely to the price, fell to 6.25 percent from 6.33 percent late 
Wednesday and a two-year high of 6.37 percent on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors clamored for Treasurys after Labor Department  
statistics revealed that the employment cost index, which is used 
to gauge employers' compensation costs and is a closely watched 
inflation barometer, rose 0.8 percent during the three-month period 
that ended in September. Economists had anticipated a 0.9 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The news eased investor concerns that Federal Reserve Board  
policy-makers would find it necessary to raise interest rates 
repeatedly to defuse inflationary pressures, even if they raise 
rates again at a Nov. 16 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also said the economy grew at an annual rate of  
4.8 period during the same period, well above the 4.5 percent 
annual rate analysts had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The two reports also served as catalyst for a strong rally in  
the stock market, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 
227.64 points to 10,622.53. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices for short-term securities rose  
1/16 point to 1/8 point, while intermediate treasury securities rose 
9/32 point to 17/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.09 percent as the  
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from Wednesday to 4.95 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.29 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 
percentage point to 5.08 percent. One-year yields were 5.45 percent 
as the discount fell 0.04 percentage point to 5.17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.31 percent from 5.38 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hargrove Hopes To Land Orioles Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Former Cleveland Indians manager Mike Hargrove  
remains very much interested in assuming the same job with the 
Baltimore Orioles, who apparently are in no rush to fill the void 
left by the dismissal of Ray Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove could have his first formal meeting with Orioles owner  
Peter Angelos this weekend, according to a source close to the 
situation. Hargrove had a three-hour meeting with team officials 
last week, but Angelos was not in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, reached at his Ohio home Thursday night, said he had  
not yet received an invitation to return to Baltimore for a second 
interview. But he was eager to get a chance to meet with the entire 
search committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I'm being considered for the job and I'm still very  
interested. It's a good situation because they have a very good 
core of talent,'' Hargrove said. ``I'm excited about the 
possibilities. But whether or not it happens, I honestly don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The job became available when Miller was fired on Oct. 6.  
Hargrove then became a candidate when the Indians dismissed him 
following Cleveland's collapse against Boston in the AL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Perlozzo, the Orioles' third-base coach under Miller, and  
Marv Foley, the team's first-base coach, have already interviewed 
twice apiece. Foley managed 10 years in the minor leagues and 
Perlozzo was well respected by the players within the veteran 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither has managed at the big league level. Hargrove, who  
turned 50 this week, recorded 721 victories and won five AL Central 
titles in eight full seasons with Cleveland, twice taking the 
Indians to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles have indicated that a decision would be made shortly  
after the conclusion of the World Series, and now it appears as if 
the process will extend at least into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates interviewed include: Boston Red Sox bench coach  
Grady Little, Cincinnati Reds bench coach Ken Griffey Sr., 
Philadelphia Phillies batting coach Hal McRae, former Chicago Cubs 
manager Jim Riggleman and former Orioles catcher Rick Dempsey.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Forward; Dow Up 215.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today after the Labor Department  
reported that U.S. workers' wages and benefits are increasing at a 
slower than expected pace. The report raised hopes that inflation 
is not threatening the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
	With an hour remaining in trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 215.29 at 10,610.18, extending 
Wednesday's 92-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 41.15 at 1,337.86, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 58.90 at 2,861.42. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its  
employment cost index rose by 0.8 percent in the third quarter, 
slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many economists were 
expecting. Economists view the index as a significant barometer of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the third 
time this year in its continuing effort to ward off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the employment cost index might not deter the Fed  
from implementing another rate hike when its policy-writing Open 
Market Committee meets Nov. 16, but they believed the next increase 
could be the last for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not closed, of course,'' said Michael Moran,  
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, pointing out that the 
Fed will also carefully monitor next week's employment report. 
``But inflation pressures are not problematic at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose for a second straight session, pushing the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.25 percent, from 6.33 
percent late Wednesday. Stocks have drawn some additional support 
from the retreat in bond yields, which earlier this month rose high 
enough to lure some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The promise of stabilizing interest rates boosted bank stocks  
for a second straight session. Citigroup rose 2 5/8 to 53 3/4, and Chase 
Manhattan rose 4 5/16 to 87 1/16. American Express, a component of 
the Dow, rose 6 5/8 to 157 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks are especially sensitive to rising rates because higher  
rates can dissuade customers from borrowing money, cutting into 
lending volume. Also, higher rates can reduce the value of a 
financial firm's fixed holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the  
exclusion of a strong report on the nation's gross domestic 
product. The government reported today that the U.S. economy 
expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent from July through 
September, the fastest pace this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com fell 4 7/16 to 71 1/2. The online  
retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results 
topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as 
the company spent heavily to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom rose 5 1/4 to 82 13/16 after saying third-quarter  
operating profits nearly tripled from the same period in 1998. The 
telecommunications company earned $1.09 billion, or 55 cents per 
share, beating analysts' expectations of 54 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 907.69 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 5.04 to 421.81.

<HEADLINE> Baylor Waits for an Offer to Manage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It looks like Don Baylor will have to wait a few  
more days to rejoin the managerial ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Atlanta Braves hitting coach appears likely to be  
hired as manager of the Chicago Cubs, general manager Ed Lynch 
declined comment Thursday, saying he had nothing new to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how soon it's going to happen,'' Baylor said  
Wednesday night after the New York Yankees completed their World 
Series sweep of the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next two or three days?  
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a surprise to me,'' said Baylor, who managed  
Colorado for six years and led the Rockies to their only postseason 
appearance. ``I talked to my representative, and he would tell me 
if something is on the plate we could gnaw on. But we haven't 
gotten it. But if we work out a deal and I have to get back on a 
plane, I will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs have made him an offer, Baylor told the Chicago  
Tribune, but so have the Milwaukee Brewers. Milwaukee's multiyear 
offer is thought to equal or exceed the $1.2 million annual salary 
former Brewers manager Phil Garner receives in his new four-year 
deal with Detroit, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
</P>
<P>
	But money won't be the only factor in his decision, Baylor said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chicago is a great town. Besides New York City, Chicago is  
right there,'' Baylor said. ``Hopefully, we can get it done. I 
don't know how soon. If I had a crystal ball going down the road 
right now, I have no idea what's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who guided the Rockies to their only postseason berth in  
1995, has been mentioned as a candidate for virtually every 
managerial opening. The Braves already have conceded they don't 
expect Baylor to return as their hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement that Baylor had been hired as Cubs manager was  
discovered last week by a Chicago Tribune reporter on a hidden area 
of the team's Web site. Apparently, a Cubs employee prepared a 
profile and news release in case Baylor got the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch denied then that Baylor had been hired and the information  
was removed from the site.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Reports Record Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak has rolled out a package of upbeat  
results, announcing record revenue in the past year and, for the 
first time, increased ridership for a third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger rail corporation reported Wednesday taking in  
$1.84 billion during fiscal year 1999, up 7 percent from the 
previous year. That is the highest revenue total in Amtrak's 
28-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridership for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 was  
21,508,700, up 2 percent from last year and nearly 10 percent since 
it began rebounding in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 1999, Amtrak increased the number of trains operating in  
nine states and introduced service to Oklahoma for the first time 
in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak reported it is on course to wean itself from government  
subsidies by 2003. A 1997 law prohibits Amtrak from using any 
federal funds for operating expenses after fiscal 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year's growth in revenue, implementation of initiatives  
to improve efficiency, and America's demand for passenger rail, 
demonstrate the increasing fiscal strength of Amtrak and bring the 
goal of operational self-sufficiency well within our sights,'' said 
Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Amtrak's chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridership records were set on the Pacific Northwest corridor,  
which carried 450,000 riders in Washington State and Oregon; the 
Keystone Service between Harrisburg, Pa., and New York City, which 
reached 1 million riders; and the California Capitols route 
(Oakland-Sacramento-Colfax), with 540,000 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record was set on the New York-Washington, D.C.,  
Metroliner. Amtrak originally put 1999 Metroliner ridership at 
2,134,671 but then revised the number to 2,240,620. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's system-wide on-time performance remained steady at 78  
percent, the corporation reported.

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign RB McElroy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Running back Leeland McElroy, who hasn't  
played in the NFL since 1997, was signed Thursday by the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick of Arizona in 1996, McElroy played in  
30 games and started 14 in two seasons with the Cardinals. He was 
waived by Arizona in June 1998, spent nearly two months on Tampa 
Bay's roster during the preseason and was with Denver this year 
during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-year letterman at Texas A&AMP;M, McElroy's kickoff return  
average of 36.3 yards is an NCAA record. He had 1,122 yards rushing 
as a junior and entered the NFL after foregoing his final year of 
college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts also re-signed running back Scott Greene, who played  
in three games before being waived on Oct. 13, and put running back 
Darick Holmes on injured reserve. Holmes injured his ankle during a 
preseason game against Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Many See Lottery As Way to Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-quarter of Americans believe their best  
chance to build wealth for retirement is by playing the lottery, 
not by patiently saving and investing, a survey says. Those living 
paycheck to paycheck are even more likely to feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Misconceptions about how small amounts of money can grow keep  
millions of people from taking the steps that could greatly improve 
their lot, say sponsors of the survey released Thursday -- the 
Consumer Federation of America and the financial services firm 
Primerica. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Americans understood that their chances of winning a big  
lottery jackpot were 10 to 20 million to one but that they could 
accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars through regular saving, 
more families would put $50 away rather than spending it on 
gambling or unneeded consumption,'' said Primerica Chairman Joseph 
Plumeri. 
</P>
<P>
	Invested for 40 years at a 9 percent annual yield, $50 a week  
would add up to $1,026,853. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Brobeck, the consumer group's executive director, said  
banks and brokerage firms must take some of the blame for the fact 
that many Americans don't realize there are ways to invest 
profitably even small amounts of money, such as in savings bonds or 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they've done an adequate job in publicizing  
those products to the low- and middle-income households,'' Brobeck 
said. ``There are decent savings options out there for any 
household.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll indicated 27 percent of Americans believe winning a  
lottery or sweepstakes is their ``best chance to obtain a half a 
million dollars or more in your lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among households with annual incomes of $35,000 or less, those  
holding that belief jumped to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, fewer than half -- 47 percent -- of all those surveyed  
said saving and investing some of their income was the most 
reliable route to wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	People were also asked how much $25 invested weekly for 40 years  
at a 7 percent annual yield would amount to. Fewer than a third 
guessed over $150,000. The correct answer is $286,640. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of similar questions found that younger and  
lower-income Americans, along with women, tend to most undervalue 
how savings can add up. 
</P>
<P>
	But that $286,640 is still not the half-million dollars the  
survey asked about. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of households that will have a very  
difficult time under any scenario,'' Brobeck said. But he noted, 
``In every income class there are savers and there are spenders ... 
there are still, even in the lower-income classes, a minority who 
save and accumulate wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,010 Americans 18 and older conducted  
July 22-25, has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. It was released along with a companion study of household 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of the latest Census Bureau data -- from 1995 -- found  
that the median savings of American families, meaning half have 
more and half have less, was just $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the value of money in the bank and stocks and  
bonds, minus household debts other than mortgages, such as credit 
card balances. Without subtracting debt, the median savings was 
$2,700. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included was the value of home equity or other property and  
pensions or 401(k) retirement plans sponsored by employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are concerned about the low savings rate among  
Americans, which has persisted even during the ongoing economic 
boom which has raised wages in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Revisions to government figures released Thursday show that the  
national savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable 
income -- is not as bad as previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	But Americans, who saved at a rate of 2.1 percent in the third  
quarter of 1999 according to the new estimates, are still the 
world's biggest spendthrifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't have a plan they operate day to day and  
paycheck to paycheck,'' said Plumeri. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer federation and Primerica are using the poll and  
study to kick off an educational campaign that will offer tips on 
saving.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticized for Skipping Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush's excuse for missing his  
second consecutive Republican presidential debate ``doesn't wash'' 
with the people of New Hampshire, rival Steve Forbes said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' the millionaire conservative said in an interview 
hours before the debate in nearby Hanover. ``It will be noticed. 
Why won't he put himself at risk like the rest of us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' advisers said the debate's format, which calls for  
questions from the audience, may not give candidates an opportunity 
to criticize Bush. Forbes and four other GOP candidates will face 
off in a repeat of their Bush-less debate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor, the leading candidate in the GOP  
field, will interview with a local television station before the 
debate to explain his absence. Bush chose to remain in Texas to 
join his wife, who is being honored by Southern Methodist 
University tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said it was a ploy to keep Bush above the fray, out of  
danger of making a mistake that could cost him his lead in polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to say his wife had a commitment and he made a  
commitment to her. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah,'' Forbes said, sitting 
in a booth at a local diner after shaking hands for 30 minutes. 
``And he'll go through his slogans while we're on stage going 
through substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```His consultants probably say this is brilliant, but the  
people of New Hampshire will say this doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had no plans to debate until January, but agreed to a  
December showdown amid pressure from his rivals and the advice of 
New Hampshire supporters who said he was running a risk of looking 
afraid to engage. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Wenger, a retired book wholesaler who was sipping coffee  
at the diner an hour before Forbes arrived, said Bush must prove 
he's worth his high poll ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you push somebody so far up so fast, the only way to move  
is down,'' said the Forbes backer.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped Americans Freed in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN`A, Yemen (AP) -- An American teacher and her parents were  
released early today after tribesmen kidnapped them in Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta R. Colburn and her parents, Don and Gladys Colburn, of  
Portland, Ore., were on their way to the capital, San`a, from the 
northern province of Marib where they were kidnapped Tuesday, 
Yemeni Interior Ministry officials said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the Americans were freed following intensive  
negotiations by authorities with the kidnappers, who belong to the 
Bani Jabr tribe of the Habab Valley in Marib, east of San`a. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said the Americans were in good health but gave no  
other details. The U.S. Embassy in San`a confirmed the release and 
thanked the Yemenis. ``The Yemeni government did a very good job,'' 
said Chris Eccel, a press officer at the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Marta Colburn teaches at the American Institute for Yemeni  
Studies in San`a and was formerly deputy director of Middle East 
studies at Portland State University. Her parents were visiting her 
when they were kidnapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemeni officials said Wednesday the kidnappers were demanding  
the release of 25 fellow tribesmen who have been detained in 
connection with an explosion that damaged an oil pipeline on Oct. 
21. It was not clear if their demands were met. 
</P>
<P>
	Yemeni tribesmen often kidnap foreigners to pressure the  
government into providing money or better services, such as new 
roads, for their impoverished areas. The kidnappers usually treat 
the hostages as guests and release them unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Mariah Carey Bolts From CBS Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television's morning war is already getting  
interesting: Pop diva Mariah Carey has suddenly backed out of a 
concert set to kick off CBS's ``The Early Show'' on Monday and will 
appear on the ``Today'' show instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's switch was a blow to CBS, which hoped for a flashy  
launch to its heavily publicized new show. It also suggests just 
how vicious network competition for big-name guests is likely to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey, who agreed to the concert to promote a new album due out  
Tuesday, pulled out of ``The Early Show'' late Wednesday because 
she was nervous about CBS's ability to get a city permit for the 
concert. Within an hour, she was scheduled on ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Friedman, senior executive producer for ``The Early  
Show,'' brushed off the snub with a dig at his NBC rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only have to book our own show, but we have to help the  
others come up with their ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had grand plans to shut down a portion of Manhattan's Fifth  
Avenue for the concert, but the plans kept getting scaled back, 
said Larry Jenkins, spokesman for Columbia Records. The event 
couldn't be publicized until the permit was secured, so an 
ultimatum was issued: no permit by the end of the day Wednesday, no 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:45 p.m., Carey bolted. A permit was issued shortly  
thereafter, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing we have done either maliciously or  
intentionally,'' Jenkins said. ``But we have an artist with an 
album coming out next week and it is our responsibility to find the 
best situation for her. We agonized over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' was only too happy to accommodate Carey, even though  
executive producer Jeff Zucker had publicly vowed not to book 
guests aligned with Pat Kingsley, a partner in Carey's public 
relations firm, after Kingsley client Calista Flockhart backed out 
of a summer appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Show spokeswoman Allison Gollust said the ban applied only to  
Kingsley's personal clients, not to all people represented by her 
firm, PMK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a chance to stick it to `The Early Show,'''  
Gollust said Thursday. ``There's no question a Mariah Carey concert 
would be a lot of fun, not only for guests of our show but our 
viewers. We would be silly to pass it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, meanwhile, is left with a concert permit, but no artist.  
Friedman wouldn't say what ``The Early Show'' would do for a 
replacement.

going to change the face of Monday morning. It's our premiere, 
people will watch us to see what we're doing. If we're good, fine. 
If we're not, Mariah Carey couldn't have saved us.''

<HEADLINE> Big Brother Watches in Holland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALMERE, Netherlands (AP) -- Ruud absent-mindedly sweeps the  
kitchen floor. A few minutes later, he takes out the trash. Bored, 
he lights a cigarette and sits down to strum his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
	And a million Dutch viewers, roughly one in 15 people, watch  
every tedious move. 
</P>
<P>
	This is ``Big Brother,'' a new television and Internet show  
that's enjoying unprecedented popularity and controversy with its 
unique approach to reality TV: nine strangers confined for 100 days 
in a house packed with surveillance gadgetry, all for a shot at 
fame and a $120,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``This type of show appeals to a certain sense of voyeurism in  
all of us, like listening in on a nearby conversation or walking 
past a house and glancing in the window,'' said ``Big Brother'' 
executive producer Paul Romer. ``There is something magical about 
being able to listen to and watch other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drawing its name from George Orwell's classic novel, ``1984,''  
the show takes the idea of an omnipresent Big Brother to the brink 
of the new millennium by isolating and continuously monitoring the 
participants from mid-September to New Year's Eve. There are 
nightly updates on TV and live Webcasts via an Internet site that 
has been swamped with more than 11 million hits since the show 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	With 24 cameras and 59 microphones placed throughout the house,  
even the bathroom is utterly devoid of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is a twist to this carefully constructed Orwellian  
world: Every few weeks, the participants nominate one or more of 
their fellow house mates to leave the Almere homestead, about 20 
miles east of Amsterdam. The show's viewers have the final say on 
who gets the boot, and on Dec. 31 will select a winner from among 
the final three survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	While admitting the setup is ``a little cruel,'' Romer said  
psychologists regularly were consulted during the show's three-year 
development, and the participants' last names have been withheld to 
protect their identities. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the show's competitive nature, Romer stressed the  
participants were instructed to ``just be themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very much a mix of group psychology versus the  
individual,'' he said. ``As a group, they must work together to 
survive and get things done. But they also know that in the end 
there can be only one winner. You can feel and see these two ideas 
competing with each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 32, was the first to feel the wrath of these  
contradicting forces. After a failed attempt to thwart a budding 
romance between Bart, 23, and Sabine, 25, Martin's popularity took 
a nosedive, and he was voted out after less than two weeks on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	But even for a loser, there are perks. Martin entered the house  
an anonymous citizen and left a celebrity sought after for 
interviews and TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a big surprise,'' he said. ``It's very strange, of  
course, like being in a whole new world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Brother'' is produced by Endemol, a Dutch entertainment  
company, and airs on the youth-oriented Veronica network. Now that 
it has snagged 40 percent of viewers in the 20-34 age bracket, 
other stations are scrambling to get in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
	One rival network even sent its own celebrity reporter  
parachuting behind enemy lines, handing out candy and beer to the 
surprised ``Big Brother'' inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
	The show has inspired fan clubs and attracted international  
attention. Networks in Canada, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Germany, 
England and Sweden already have expressed interest in ``Big 
Brother'' spin-offs, Romer said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS recently announced plans to air its own ``reality  
adventure'' next summer. ``Survivor'' will send 16 strangers to an 
uninhabited island in the South China Sea, where they'll gradually 
be voted off by viewers until a single winner remains to claim a $1 
million prize. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Swedish version of the show began with a dark incident: In  
the opening season of ``Expedition Robinson'' in 1997, the first 
contestant to be declared a loser committed suicide a month after 
returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	The network that airs the highly popular program in Sweden  
denied any responsibility, but the man's widow blamed the show then 
and still does. CBS said it believes the program was not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a real-life soap isn't new. MTV's ``The Real World''  
and ``Road Rules'' series' have been peeking into not-so-private 
lives for eight seasons. The phenomenon has been lampooned by 
Hollywood in ``The Truman Show'' and ``EDtv.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Brother'' has its critics, though. The Netherlands  
Institute of Psychologists branded the show ``irresponsible and 
unethical,'' while others called it a type of mental torture. Now, 
most critics simply call it dull. 
</P>
<P>
	```Big Brother' is all about emptiness -- and every day, for  
millions of people, there is no escape,'' Joost Zwagerman wrote in 
a recent commentary for the newspaper De Volkskrant. 
</P>
<P>

contestants to compete for its top $2 million prize. The show is

<HEADLINE> Japan Suspends Cresvale Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's financial authorities ordered a two-month  
suspension Thursday on Martin A. Armstrong Jr.'s company in Tokyo 
following charges they were engaged in a $1 billion (113.8 billion 
yen) securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale International Ltd.'s Tokyo office was ordered to shut  
down all of its securities operations between Nov. 1 and Jan. 14, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Government regulators had previously suspended Cresvale's  
securities operations between Oct. 4 and Oct. 24. The latest 
suspension was laid down after the Securities Exchange and 
Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities industry watchdog, 
recommended further punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a well-known Princeton, N.J.-based market forecaster,  
was arrested and indicted in the United States recently. He has 
pleaded innocent and is free on $5 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale executives are accused of giving kickbacks to Japanese  
companies and providing false information about investments. 
Cresvale marketed interest-bearing promissory notes to about 100 
Japanese companies, which the company now cannot repay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale sold the notes, which were issued through Princeton  
Economics International Ltd. The money was invested by Armstrong, 
who had pledged to put the money in government bonds, but instead 
lost at least $500 million investing in risky futures and options.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Sidelined With Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros was scratched from the  
Philadelphia Flyers' lineup Thursday night against Colorado with a 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros played sick Tuesday night and had one of the worst games  
of his career in a 5-2 loss to Vancouver. He and linemate John 
LeClair were on the ice for four of the Canucks' goals, and each 
made turnovers that led to goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros did not practice Wednesday, following LeClair's advice  
to rest. 
</P>
<P>
	``My comment to him was that he should go home,'' LeClair said.  
``He's not going to accomplish anything. He's just going to wear 
himself down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, who has four goals and five assists and is minus-5,  
wouldn't have gotten a chance to play against his rival, Peter 
Forsberg, anyway. Forsberg is recovering from offseason shoulder 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg was part of the trade that sent Lindros from Quebec to  
the Flyers for six players, two draft picks and $15 million in 
1992.

<HEADLINE> Israel Deports Doomsday Christians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- In its third operation against Christian  
doomsday groups in a year, Israel on Thursday began deporting 20 
foreigners suspected of planning violent acts during the millennium 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	With Christian pilgrims heading to Israel for the celebration of  
the birth of Jesus, Israeli police have been on alert for religious 
fanatics who believe they can facilitate the second coming of 
Christ through violent acts or mass suicide. A special police unit 
has been established to deal with the threat. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Israel arrested 17 Americans, two Britons and two  
Australians, all members of the House of Prayer and Solomon's 
Temple groups, on the Mount of Olives. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Australians was released because she had already  
purchased a plane ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Britons were put on a flight for London on Thursday, and 11  
of the Americans were to leave for New York City early Friday, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The others will be deported in the coming days when spaces on  
flights become available, police spokesman Rafi Yaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Ministry tried to address potential tourists'  
concerns about the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of Israel was and will continue to be open to  
tourists and pilgrims, and the Interior Ministry will do everything 
to ease the entrance of pilgrims and tourists to Israel,'' read the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 people being deported said they only provided housing to  
needy Christians and guided tours around the Old City of Jerusalem. 
Some of them had lived in Israel for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	But police say they were suspected of laying the infrastructure  
for apocalyptic groups to take root on the Mount of Olives, where 
tradition says Jesus will first arrive in the Second Coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Israeli police have information that the deportees pose a  
threat to public order,'' said the Interior Ministry statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of those detained Monday had appealed their deportation  
to the Interior Ministry, but the petitions were rejected Thursday 
and arrangements made for the deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Americans slated for deportation had destroyed their  
passports and needed new travel documents, Yaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Americans, who identified himself as Brother Raymond  
of Sacramento, Calif., said from a police van after he was arrested 
Monday that the police operations were ``the work of the devil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israel deported 14 members of the Denver-based Concerned  
Christians in 1998 on suspicion they planned to commit mass suicide 
at holy sites in Jerusalem to bring about apocalyptic events and 
the second coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of another group, 25 Irish and Romanian Christians  
deported earlier this month, said they were a legitimate religious 
group dedicated to helping disabled people. They accused Israeli 
police of treating them roughly before they were deported. 
</P>
<P>
	The police said the group was ``an extreme Christian cult,'' but  
Irish officials insisted the group was not dangerous.

<HEADLINE> `The Dead' Works as a Musical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Well, it sounds impossible -- turning ``The  
Dead,'' James Joyce's haunting meditation on the power of the past 
over the present, into a musical. 
</P>
<P>
	That the production works as well as it does is a credit to  
adapter Richard Nelson and composer Shaun Davey, who, for much of 
the evening, capture the lingering melancholy and generous humor 
that permeate Joyce's evocative short story. 
</P>
<P>
	With one crucial exception, they have cast this musical play --  
there's no other way to describe it -- with care. The flaw isn't 
fatal but it harms a show that needs to be sung as well as it is 
acted. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dead,'' which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's  
Playwrights Horizons, exudes plenty of atmosphere and charm. It 
tells the tale of the elderly Morken sisters and their annual 
Christmas party in turn-of-the-century Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia (an incandescent Sally Ann Howes) is in failing health.  
Yet her voice still retains much of its former glory when she was 
queen of the church choir. Sister Kate (an equally fine Marni 
Nixon) flutters, frets and cries over the decline of her beloved 
sibling. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sisters share their house with niece Mary Jane (Emily  
Skinner). The three women are music teachers, and music figures 
prominently in their Yuletide celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	What Davey has done is to draw on a variety of sources for the  
lyrics -- Irish poems from the 18th and 19th century, Joyce's 
original text for ``The Dead,'' and new work by Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, the show seems more like a concert than a musical --  
with the Morken household used as a backdrop for the songs. The 
musical takes shape gradually as various guests join in the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	The most boisterous, Freddy Malins, arrives late and a little  
looped, much to the consternation of his mother, played by the 
deliciously dour Paddy Croft, a perfect Margaret Hamilton 
look-alike. Stephen Spinella, a Tony winner for ``Angels in 
America,'' shows considerable talent for musical comedy as the 
tipsy Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite having a minimal amount of material, such accomplished  
musical theater folk as Skinner, Alice Ripley and Brian Davies 
manage to make memorable impressions. So does performance artist 
John Kelly who gets to serenade Aunt Julia with an Italian aria in 
her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the creators of ``The Dead'' have made one peculiar casting  
decision: hiring Christopher Walken to play the pivotal role of 
Gabriel Conroy, the troubled man who, in this stage version, 
narrates Joyce's tale. 
</P>
<P>
	Walken is a very American actor in his manner and in his speech.  
He seems out of place in this most Irish of stories. He also can't 
handle the songs, especially the evening's final number which 
crucially brings together the show's two divergent strands. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce's story is constructed in such a way that it shifts  
dramatically near the end from the party to Conroy and his wife, 
Gretta. Conroy, nephew to the Morken sisters, realizes that his 
wife, played here by a warm and lovely Blair Brown, is distracted 
and unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	Conroy thinks her concern is for him, but, in fact, she is  
remembering a young man who died years ago. It's a memory she can't 
shake and one which will now obsess her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who shares directorial credit with Jack Hofsiss,  
awkwardly handles the ending. In it, Walken looks more ill-at-ease 
than filled with sorrow at the crucial moment when Conroy discovers 
his wife's true feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there are some vivid images, heartfelt and theatrical at the  
same time. In one, the old Julia confronts her younger self, played 
by Daisy Egan. Both Howes and Egan wring the tears out of ``When 
Lovely Lady,'' one of Davey's more plaintive melodies. 
</P>
<P>
	But then that's what this evening is about, sighs and smiles,  
tears and tenderness, displayed on a very human scale. Audiences 
expecting to be overwhelmed by production numbers will be 
disappointed. Even the settings are bare bones, simple but 
effective in re-creating the plain Morken living room and the 
Conroy bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, ``The Dead'' is a small, special evening of musical  
theater, but within its narrow confines beats a heart that is rare, 
true and often highly original.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Warner Chief Now Dodgers' Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Switching from movie mogul to baseball boss,  
Bob Daly is moving from the Hollywood dream machine to his own 
field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	He has no illusions that his new career running the Los Angeles  
Dodgers, though, will be any easier than the job he just left as 
co-leader of Warner Bros. In many ways, he said, the baseball 
business will be tougher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to bring a movie mentality to the Dodgers,''  
Daly said Thursday as the team announced his appointment as 
chairman and chief executive officer. Daly also bought a stake in 
the team, reportedly a 10 percent share for about $30 million, from 
its owner, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's primary duties will be largely the same: dealing with  
high-priced talent, big egos and tough deal-making. But he said the 
economics of baseball can be trickier than running a studio. 
</P>
<P>
	A successful movie can bring revenues to a studio for decades to  
come, while the success of a sports team can be fleeting and depend 
on the health of the athletes and the limited span of their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With movies, you own the negative,'' Daly said. Baseball  
``probably is more difficult because there is no residual value 
other than the franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This month, Daly and Terry Semel ended a long partnership as  
co-chairmen at Warner Bros., the studio they built into one of 
Hollywood's most consistently profitable performers over the last 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Dodgers, Daly inherits a weak team that finished third  
in the National League West despite the high payroll News Corp. 
ponied up after buying the franchise last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he will be at every game and will play cheerleader to  
energize the players and Dodgers staff, right down to the guards at 
the gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to have a winning team or a winning company, you have  
to have a winning attitude,'' Daly said. ``I want everybody to row 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He built a reputation as a cooperative, inspirational boss at  
Warner. News Corp. President Peter Chernin said he hopes Daly will 
bring that same spirit to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has an enormous ability to identify talent and  
nurture talent,'' Chernin said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dodgers fan since he was a 6-year-old in Brooklyn, Daly said  
he was heartbroken when the team moved to Los Angeles in 1958. He 
followed the team to Los Angeles in 1977, when he was named 
president of CBS Entertainment. He moved to Warner in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running a ball club is kind of a dream second career a lot of  
executives have,'' said David Davis, an entertainment industry 
analyst with investment banker Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Daly's experience running a studio will translate to  
heading a baseball team, Davis said. During the Daly-Semel era, 
revenues from Warner's film and TV operations rose from less than 
$1 billion in 1980 to about $6 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment and sports have converged in having many of the  
same kinds of issues,'' Davis said. ``Negotiating TV deals, 
maximizing profitability, negotiating with talent who are getting a 
higher and higher percentage of the gross.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tommy Lasorda, former Dodgers manager and a longtime friend of  
Daly, said he hopes Daly's positive attitude proves infectious for 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I was a boy reading a box of Carnation Instant  
Milk that said, 'Contented cows give better milk,''' Lasorda said. 
``I'm under the impression contented people do better in their 
jobs. I think that's what Bob's objective is.''

	GOP Hopefuls Discuss Issues  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls --  
front-runner George Bush not among them -- politely discussed 
abortion, health care and gun control tonight in a town hall 
meeting in the nation's first primary state. Stressing his 
opposition to abortion, Sen. John McCain said the Republican Party 
must nevertheless reach out to voters who differ -- and not a single 
one of his four rivals on the Dartmouth College stage offered any 
immediate challenge. Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer and 
Alan Keyes all said the nation's health care system needs 
reforming. 

</P>
<P>
	Bush Skips Debate for Wife's Award  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said that he skipped a  
debate in New Hampshire because ``I love my wife'' and wanted to be 
at her side when she received an award at Southern Methodist 
University. Mrs. Bush was being honored by SMU, along with three 
others, as a distinguished alumna. The governor stressed that he 
was not taking New Hampshire for granted and that he would be 
campaigning there next week.

	Clinton: Impeachment May Hurt Gore  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton conceded today that his  
impeachment scandal may hurt Vice President Al Gore's election 
hopes, acknowledging that ``a lot of people who may not like me may 
hold it against him.'' But Clinton said any Americans who fault 
Gore also should give the vice president credit for the 
administration's accomplishments, including the longest peacetime 
economic expansion in history, the lowest unemployment in 29 years 
and other achievements. His remark came on the heels of blunt 
criticism from Gore during last night's debate with Bill Bradley. 
Gore had said that Clinton's behavior had disappointed and angered 
him. 

</P>
<P>
	House Approves Spending Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed the last and biggest  
spending bill of fiscal 2000 through the House today despite a 
promised veto by President Clinton because of a 0.97 percent 
across-the-board cut in federal agencies' budgets. The $314 billion 
bill includes funding for education, labor and health programs. 
Clinton said the spending cuts would inflict damage on defense, 
schools and other programs. He also objected that the GOP did not 
provide money to help communities hire elementary school teachers. 
However, Clinton acknowledged that overhauling Social Security and 
Medicare would not be accomplished in the 2000 budget. 

</P>
<P>
	U.N. Monitors Suggested for Iraq  
</P>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Britain suggested  
today that, with no weapons inspectors in Iraq, U.N. monitors 
instead make sure that equipment imported for humanitarian programs 
wasn't being diverted to military use. The United States, and to a 
lesser extent Britain, have stalled on approving contracts for 
humanitarian programs, citing concerns over dual-use materials. 
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that some of those 
contracts could relieve some of the hardships Iraqi people suffer. 

</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Findings Expected Soon  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson  
could announce his factual findings in the federal Microsoft 
antitrust trial as early as tomorrow. That decision was expected to 
serve as a barometer for whether the judge believes the company 
broke any laws. But legal experts expect the landmark case to wind 
through appeals courts for as long as two years. That kind of delay 
would complicate decisions about possible punishments against 
Microsoft that might still be applied in 2002.

	Intel: Y2K, Taiwan Quake No Problem  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest  
maker of computer chips, said its production this year will not be 
disrupted by the earthquake in Taiwan or the Year 2000 computer 
problem. Intel shipments are on a record-setting pace. Some 
companies have said sales of its more profitable database servers 
could slow as customers cut back on orders to focus on the Y2K 
problem, and others have signaled profits will be hurt by last 
month's massive earthquake in Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Philly Newspaper Endorses Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Daily News endorsed  
Republican Sam Katz for mayor today, breaking a decades-long record 
of supporting Democratic mayoral candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat John F. Street ``keeps looking in the rearview mirror,  
admiring the road behind us. Sam Katz has drawn a map to steer the 
city toward growth and promise and has the values and skills to get 
there,'' the newspaper's editorial said. The Daily News had 
endorsed Street in the May primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper praised Katz's proposals to rethink and redesign  
city government, reduce the wage tax and take direct control of the 
school system. The paper also said he could better negotiate with 
state legislators to get more funding for schools. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, The Philadelphia Inquirer, which named Street its  
``clear choice in the Democratic primary,'' also endorsed Katz. The 
Inquirer last endorsed a Republican mayoral candidate in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz, a businessman, hopes to become the first Republican mayor  
of Philadelphia in nearly 50 years. Street is seeking to become the 
city's second black mayor. Polls have shown the race for Tuesday's 
election a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial said Street's 19 years in City Council had not  
always shown results for residents. Even in his own district, 
Street was mostly ``missing in action'' in confronting ``the 
realities of blight, drugs, crime and despair he now claims he can 
fix citywide,'' the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Editorial Page Editor Frank Burgos said the Daily News still has  
``enormous respect'' for the former City Council president's 
record, but it was time for fresh leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Burgos said no one at the Daily News could remember the last  
time it endorsed a Republican for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Street campaign spokesman Ken Snyder brushed off the  
endorsement, saying he was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The John Street campaign has been endorsed by labor  
organizations representing hundreds of thousands of working 
families across Philadelphia,'' Snyder said. ``We just never wrote 
it into our strategy that the Daily News editorial was necessary to 
victory.''

<HEADLINE> Old West Tradition Under Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KETCHUM, Idaho (AP) -- Spectators line up early every fall,  
hoping to find a good seat along Main Street to watch Wagon Days: a 
mock six-gun shootout and parade of painstakingly restored 
horse-drawn wagons, carriages and buggies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the days of the Blackjack Ketchum Shootout Gang -- complete  
with costumed volunteers as lawmen, desperadoes and dance hall 
hostesses -- may soon come to an end in this former mining town. 
</P>
<P>
	High noon comes Tuesday, when the City Council has scheduled an  
advisory vote on whether to keep a show that other towns across the 
West rely on for tourist dollars. It's a tradition under fire in 
some places. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jackson, Wyo., the Jackson Hole Shootout Gang has been  
``killing'' outlaws for tourists on the Town Square for 42 years. 
But this past summer, one visitor complained that it was 
inappropriate, given the recent slayings at Columbine High School 
in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	At Ketchum's Wagon Days, events are overseen by a committee of  
representatives from city and community groups, which decided even 
before Labor Day to recommend making the 1999 shootouts the last. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision rankled participants and supporters who collected  
almost 2,700 signatures -- about the same number as the town's 
population -- on petitions urging the council to reject the 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some members of the committee, including myself, felt that the  
shootout was boring. It celebrated violence and drinking and was 
not appropriate for family entertainment,'' said Jim Jaquet, city 
administrator and one of the festival's coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
	Ketchum historian Arthur Hart would just as soon see the  
gunfights end. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do them in every fake ghost town in the West,'' Hart  
said. ``It's corny, it's been overdone and it's not authentic in 
terms of our history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaquet said he would prefer to see a troupe of American Indian  
dancers instead of what he considers mere hackneyed antics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some members of our community who don't particularly  
like the violent part of the shootout,'' he said. ``That might be a 
minority; we'll find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ketchum community's sole claim to fame may be that it is  
where Ernest Hemingway killed himself with a shotgun blast in 1961. 
Blackjack Ketchum himself -- an outlaw supposedly hanged in New 
Mexico a century ago -- may never even have been in the former 
mining town that only coincidentally shares his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if he was, he never caused any problems,'' said Jim  
Valesey, a carpenter originally from upstate New York and a lead 
actor in Wagon Days. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick May, a seven-year resident who works at African Fine  
Arts, called the shootouts ``a spoof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I see nothing wrong with it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Valesey is confident voters will show appreciation for the show.  
</P>
<P>
	``I recall just walking up to the little kids and shaking their  
hands and tell them, 'Now you can tell your grandchildren you met 
Blackjack Ketchum.' It was a hoot,'' he said. ``That's what we're 
here for, to entertain the kids.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Spar in N.H. Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- In the first debate of the Democratic  
presidential race, Al Gore sought to stem his decline in the polls 
by attacking rival Bill Bradley's health care and spending plans. 
Bradley said today that he wouldn't waste his time ``making 
negative attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning this morning in Nashua, Bradley said Wednesday  
night's debate gave both candidates an opportunity to express their 
views, and that he felt good about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``People want a positive vision from the person who will be  
their next president,'' he said. ``You save your strength for the 
positive vision. You don't waste all that simply making negative 
attacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The closest that Bradley came in lashing out at the debate was  
in response to the vice president's criticism of his health care 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers have to add up,'' said Gore, who was folksy and  
playful at the audience while jabbing at Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said they did. ``We each have our own experts,'' the  
former New Jersey senator replied. ``I dispute the cost figure that 
Al has used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was an audience member who pressed Gore about President  
Clinton's personal behavior. Gore said he shared the public's 
disappointment and anger over the Monica Lewinsky affair and sought 
to provide ``as much continuity and stability'' as possible during 
the impeachment crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend,'' Gore said of Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
	Another crowd member probed a soft spot of Bradley's, asking  
about Gore's criticism of his Senate retirement in 1996 after 
Republicans had taken control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things I wanted to do I couldn't do in the Senate,''  
Bradley said, referring to stops at Stanford, in the private sector 
and at Notre Dame. In a gentle dig at Gore, who has been in 
government continuously since 1976, Bradley said that by leaving 
office he had been able to ``encounter people where they live their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and Bradley sat on stools or strolled the stage in a  
Dartmouth College auditorium for the 60-minute debate co-sponsored 
by CNN and WMUR-TV. The first primary election ballots of the 2000 
campaign will be cast in New Hampshire on Feb. 1, and polls show 
Bradley with a slight lead, having overcome Gore's enormous early 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republican presidential candidates -- absent front-runner  
George W. Bush -- meet for their second debate tonight at the same 
site. Bush, a two-term Texas governor, does not plan to debate them 
until a Dec. 2 meeting in Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Democratic standoff, Gore sought to take the offensive 15  
minutes before the television cameras were switched on. On stage 
for introductions, Gore turned to the audience and said: ``Why 
don't you start asking some question while we're waiting?'' 
</P>
<P>
	So they did.  
</P>
<P>
	And after the debate ended, Gore hung around for 90 minutes,  
taking questions while Bradley was long gone. 
</P>
<P>
	In other highlights:  
</P>
<P>
	--The two rivals pledged support for an overhaul of campaign  
finance laws to reduce the role of money in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gore said his biggest mistake was ``my choice of words when I  
claimed to have taken the lead in the Congress for inventing the 
Internet'' -- a comment that has earned him ridicule from 
Republicans and stand-up comics alike. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bradley spoke emphatically about his support for gay rights.  
``I support gays being able to serve openly in the military. If 
gays can serve openly in the White House, in Congress, in the 
courts, in the Treasury Department ... why can't they serve in the 
military?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	When Gore got a similar question, he said Bradley's answer had  
been eloquent, then followed by saying he supports legal protection 
for same-sex domestic partnerships, but ``not the same sacrament, 
not the same name,'' as marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate rules weren't designed for the two men to address one  
another directly. Gore, however, found ways to press Bradley -- 
particularly on his proposal to provide universal health care 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore cited a study -- which Bradley disputed -- claiming the  
ex-senator's plan would cost $1.2 trillion. ``That's more than the 
entire surplus over the next 10 years,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	He conceded that Bradley's plan would give health insurance to  
``a few more people'' than his own plan, but he said the price was 
too high. ``You're going to shred the social safety net,'' Gore 
said. ``I think the cost is way excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his more limited approach would cost $146 billion over  
10 years, while providing insurance for all children. Bradley said 
the next president should not settle for less than full coverage 
for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big problem,'' he said, ``and it needs a big  
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The topic illustrates the difference between Gore and Bradley on  
a host of issues. The vice president says he is offering practical, 
affordable solutions to the nation's ills. Bradley is setting 
higher, more expensive goals on everything from poverty to racial 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
	The dynamic puts Bradley to the left of Gore on many issues,  
though the vice president is the favorite among party regulars -- 
many of whom are considered liberal.

<HEADLINE> GOP Debate Highlights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Thursday's debate among Republican presidential  
candidates Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Alan 
Keyes and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.: 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On abortion:  
</P>
<P>
	MCCAIN: ``I worry a great deal about the unintended consequences  
of sending a message that we're not an inclusionary party. I am a 
proud pro-life person. I have a 17-year record on that issue. But I 
believe that we must begin a dialogue and a discussion on the issue 
of abortion. Both pro-life and pro-choice people believe very 
strongly that we need to eliminate abortion. We can work together. 
And my party, which is proud of its pro-life position and I am 
proud of it, should send the word: We want you in our party. We can 
have respectful disagreements on specific issues and we can work 
together on this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Texas Gov. George W. Bush:  
</P>
<P>
	FORBES: ``Like you, I share the frustration that Governor Bush  
is not here tonight. He didn't come to a debate last week because 
he had a fund-raiser. A couple of weeks ago, his plane got delayed. 
He had a choice between a fund-raiser and going to a school in 
Rhode Island with underprivileged kids; he chose the fund-raiser. 
So perhaps in the future at a forum like this, if we call it a 
fund-raiser, he might show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On education reform:  
</P>
<P>
	MCCAIN: ``It's probably the pressing issue that faces America as  
we want to fully exploit the potential of this information 
technology revolution that we're going through. We simply don't 
have the teachers, nor do we have the educated people to fulfill 
this incredible potential that is changing America and the world. 
And I'm pleased that America leads. ...I propound one simple 
proposition? I don't see why a good teacher should be paid less 
money than a bad senator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BAUER: ``We've got a real disparity in American education right  
now. Many of the suburbs have a lot of resources that they can use 
and they can get better results. But in the inner cities we've got 
schools that just aren't working. I believe that's a basic reform 
and we've got to do it. I think it'll take real progress on this 
issue so we don't have another whole generation left behind on the 
most important advances that the country's experiencing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On health care reform:  
</P>
<P>
	BAUER: ``I'm against big bureaucracy in Washington making health  
care decisions. I just have an aversion to bureaucrats. But it's 
not just government bureaucrats. I don't like HMO bureaucrats and 
insurance company bureaucrats either. And I think we need to level 
the playing field. ...I hope my party will get on the right side of 
being with the average American instead of with the big HMOs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCCAIN: ``Why is it that we can't come up with a decent  
patients' bill of rights? The Democrats are gridlocked by special 
interests of the trial lawyers, the Republicans by the insurance 
companies and special interests. Until we reform this campaign 
finance system, we're not going to reach a conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On stopping use of illegal drugs:  
</P>
<P>
	KEYES: ``I think sometimes we get all caught up in discussing  
what steps we will take to deal with the consequences of this 
problem; we don't want to deal with the problem. And the problem is 
very simple: You can't sustain self-government without 
self-discipline. And the drug problem is a symptom of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We proliferate laws. We even have started to invade property  
rights and do other things that are tearing down our system of 
liberty. Why? Because we are out of control. Because we are a 
people who do not understand that if you enslave yourself to 
chemicals, you cannot be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On gun control and the Second Amendment:  
</P>
<P>
	HATCH: ``When it comes to constitutional -- expressed  
constitutional -- provisions, and the Second Amendment is one of 
those expressed provisions, you've got to be very loathe to try and 
change that provision by mere statute. So I'm a strong supporter of 
Second Amendment rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On tax reform:  
</P>
<P>
	BAUER: ``If you're going to have a flat tax, what you describe  
as income becomes all-important. And how you see America's wealth 
being created is all-important. My plan is fairer for families. 
It's across the board. And I think it's the way the Republican 
Party has to go if we want to win the White House back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HATCH: ``Naturally, I favor throwing out the current system and  
getting rid of this awful IRS code. In fact, if I had my way we 
would get rid of the IRS and come up with the most fair, simple, 
decent, honorable system that we can have. ...I'd be happy to have 
any change that would simplify this code, that would give people a 
chance to be able to save more of their money, that would basically 
be stimulative to our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KEYES: ``The issue isn't the tax rate, and the issue isn't  
whether it's flat or progressive. The issue is the income tax 
itself. I am an abolitionist. It shouldn't surprise you. ...I think 
that just as we had to get rid of chattel slavery in the last 
century, we need to get rid of tax slavery at the end of the 20th 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCCAIN: ``I'm for reform. I'm for reform of education, reform of  
the military, reform of the tax code. My dear friends, that's not 
possible. That's not possible when average Americans are no longer 
represented in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I will fight to the last breath I draw to eliminate the  
influence of special interests in the tax code and every other part 
of America. And I will not rest until I give the government back to 
you.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Jet Cockpit Recorder Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Federal investigators said today they expect  
to finish picking up the pieces of golfer Payne Stewart's shattered 
Learjet by the end of the day, and confirmed they were looking at 
three other crashes for similarities to this week's tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen people wearing plastic biohazard suits worked  
today at the site where Payne's jet went down Monday after its 
ghostly autopilot trip halfway across the country. The crater, in a 
soggy portion of a cow pasture, was a jumble of black dirt 
surrounded by grass and tall weeds. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the wreckage should be removed from the crater this  
afternoon, Bob Benzon of the National Transportation Safety Board 
said today. Investigators then will spend several days sorting 
through the pieces in an airport hangar in Aberdeen to find parts 
that may offer clues to what caused the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said investigators are particularly looking for valves  
and parts of the doors, windows and hydraulic components that could 
have caused a rapid loss of pressure in the plane's cabin. Some of 
the parts are only an inch or two across, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for little, little parts, like valves,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to keep an open mind and not  
concentrate too much on any one possible cause because that could 
lead them astray, Benzon said. ``We're really not specifying or 
aiming at anything right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cockpit voice recorder was found just before sundown  
Wednesday, and it should arrive at the NTSB's Washington office 
later today. Benzon said he hoped to get a report Friday morning 
about the tape's contents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for unusual noises that may indicate some kind  
of breach of the hull of the airplane,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recorder might also contain sounds from the plane's two  
engines, possibly giving clues to whether the jets had mechanical 
problems before the crash, Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said the NTSB is looking into three other cases in the  
past two decades in which Learjets have been involved in crashes 
with similarities to Monday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
	According to published reports, they were apparently a 1983  
crash in which a German-owned Learjet that flew from Vienna 
disappeared into the Atlantic near Iceland, a 1988 crash in which a 
jet inexplicably bypassed its Texas destination and crashed in the 
mountains of northeastern Mexico, and a 1990 crash near Greenville 
in western Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll look at them. They may be for very different reasons,''  
Benzon said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet crashed into a field near Mina on Monday four hours  
after leaving Florida with Stewart and five other people aboard. 
All were killed, and investigators are trying to determine how the 
plane flew 1,400 miles across the country, apparently without 
someone at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Learjet had no flight data recorder that could provide  
mechanical information, and the cockpit voice recorder has a 
30-minute loop that usually records over itself. Officials do not 
expect to hear anything about what happened when radio contact was 
lost and the plane veered off course because that happened hours 
before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	But the voice recorder could have picked up sounds at the end of  
the flight that could tell a lot about what was happening in the 
plane, Benzon said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still confident we can get some good information off  
that tape,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials have said one possible explanation for the  
crash is that the jet lost cabin pressure soon after taking off 
from Florida, causing everyone aboard to die or lose consciousness. 
That's why investigators are particularly eager to find valves in 
the wreckage that regulate air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said investigators have learned that a device called the  
left-hand modulator valve, which takes heated air from the engine 
and runs it through the air-conditioning system to pressurize the 
cabin, was changed on the plane Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the left-hand valve failed, the one on the right engine  
should have fed sufficient air into the cabin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said the valve was replaced Saturday to balance engine  
thrust on the plane -- not because of any prior problem with cabin 
pressure. After the valve was replaced, the plane 
pressure-regulation system worked fine during a short flight on 
Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said he does not know whether such a valve has ever been  
a factor in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Today in Houston, Stewart's peers on the professional tour  
gathered on the first tee of the Champions Golf Club to remember 
one of the game's most admired figures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a chilling start to the Tour Championship, a lone bagpiper  
played ``Going Home'' as he marched through fog on the first 
fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important not to lose sight of the most important thing  
about Payne Stewart,'' said PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. ``He 
was a man of great faith, a devoted, compassionate and most 
energetic husband and father, and a man of tremendous generosity.''

<HEADLINE> Mariah Carey Bolts From CBS Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television's morning war is already getting  
interesting: Pop diva Mariah Carey has suddenly backed out of a 
concert set to kick off CBS's ``The Early Show'' on Monday and will 
appear on the ``Today'' show instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's switch was a blow to CBS, which hoped for a flashy  
launch to its heavily publicized new show. It also suggests just 
how vicious network competition for big-name guests is likely to 
get. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey, who agreed to the concert to promote a new album due out  
Tuesday, pulled out of ``The Early Show'' late Wednesday because 
she was nervous about CBS's ability to get a city permit for the 
concert. Within an hour, she was scheduled on ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Friedman, senior executive producer for ``The Early  
Show,'' brushed off the snub with a dig at his NBC rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only have to book our own show, but we have to help the  
others come up with their ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had grand plans to shut down a portion of Manhattan's Fifth  
Avenue for the concert, but the plans kept getting scaled back, 
said Larry Jenkins, spokesman for Columbia Records. The event 
couldn't be publicized until the permit was secured, so an 
ultimatum was issued: no permit by the end of the day Wednesday, no 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:45 p.m., Carey bolted. A permit was issued shortly  
thereafter, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing we have done either maliciously or  
intentionally,'' Jenkins said. ``But we have an artist with an 
album coming out next week and it is our responsibility to find the 
best situation for her. We agonized over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' was only too happy to accommodate Carey, even though  
executive producer Jeff Zucker had publicly vowed not to book 
guests aligned with Pat Kingsley, a partner in Carey's public 
relations firm, after Kingsley client Calista Flockhart backed out 
of a summer appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Show spokeswoman Allison Gollust said the ban applied only to  
Kingsley's personal clients, not to all people represented by her 
firm, PMK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a chance to stick it to `The Early Show,'''  
Gollust said Thursday. ``There's no question a Mariah Carey concert 
would be a lot of fun, not only for guests of our show but our 
viewers. We would be silly to pass it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, meanwhile, is left with a concert permit, but no artist.  
Friedman wouldn't say what ``The Early Show'' would do for a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life goes on,'' he said. ``This is not some major thing that's  
going to change the face of Monday morning. It's our premiere, 
people will watch us to see what we're doing. If we're good, fine. 
If we're not, Mariah Carey couldn't have saved us.''

<HEADLINE> State Hospital Implicated in Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A state mental hospital failed to diagnose  
diabetes in a patient allowed to binge on junk food in the months 
before he died, a state agency concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Northern Virginia Mental Health Institute mismanaged  
emergency care for Skander Najar and failed to ``control his 
dangerous eating habits,'' which caused his blood sugar levels to 
worsen and led to pancreas problems that killed him, the state 
Department for Rights of Virginians with Disabilities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings to be released this week echoed a confidential  
internal investigation on the 1998 death by the Falls Church 
hospital. The hospital concluded Najar's death was caused by human 
error, and seven staff members, including his psychiatrist and the 
on-call physician, resigned in the face of dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Najar, 26, had symptoms for two days before his death, including  
blurred vision, dizziness, vomiting and increasing lethargy, 
according to records obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of control over Najar's diet by allowing him to eat in  
a cafeteria was exacerbated by trips to convenience stores, 
fast-food restaurants and grocery stores as part of the institute's 
plan to reintegrate him into society, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent consultant wrote in a separate report that  
Najar's ``eating behaviors (at NVMHI) can best be described as a 
kid in a candy store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Najar suffered from manic depression and obsessive-compulsive  
disorder and had been in state mental institutions for 11 1/2 years 
prior to his transfer to Northern Virginia in March 1998. He died 
that June.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A New Jersey school did nothing wrong in  
refusing to let a 6-year-old read a Bible story out loud in class, 
an appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Upholding a lower court, a three-member panel of the 3rd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals said Haines Elementary School in Medford, 
N.J., did not violate Zachary Hood's right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal of the Oct. 22 ruling is planned, according to the  
boy's attorney, Eric Treene of the Washington, D.C.,-based Becket 
Fund for Religious Liberty. Treene said he would ask the entire 
12-judge court to hear arguments, instead of just the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Zachary's rights were violated and we'll continue  
to fight to vindicate those rights,'' Treene said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 incident, first grade teacher Grace Oliva was  
rewarding students for their reading skills by allowing them to 
read a story of their choice to their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy chose a story about Jacob and Esau from ``The Beginner's  
Bible: Timeless Children's Stories,'' to read aloud. Oliva told him 
the story was inappropriate because of its religious content and 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
	She allowed him to read it to her in private, but would not let  
him do so in front of the class. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's parents sought an apology and later sued the school  
district. They said the boy was humiliated by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the appeals court, Judge Walter K. Stapleton said  
Oliva was right to prevent Zachary from reading the story. 
Otherwise, the students might have believed that Hood's religious 
beliefs were sanctioned by the school, Stapleton said.

 *Methodists divided on Boy Scout debate    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Methodists support the Boy Scouts' anti-gay  
policy -- and they oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Methodist Church's social-action agency announced  
this month that it is calling upon the Boy Scouts of America to 
change its policy of excluding gays from participating in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the General Board of Church and Society would like to  
enthusiastically affirm and encourage this continuing partnership 
of the church and scouting, we cannot, due to the Boy Scouts of 
America's discrimination against gays,'' the board stated. ``This 
discrimination conflicts with our church's social principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Commission on United Methodist Men is supporting  
an appeal of the New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling in August that 
the Boy Scouts must allow openly homosexual leaders. Larry Coppock, 
director of the church's Office of Scouting Ministry, said the Boy 
Scouts should be allowed to ``select and recruit leadership in 
accordance with their guidelines and principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is the liaison with scouting for the United  
Methodist Church, the nation's second-largest Protestant 
denomination.

 *Presbyterian panel rejects churches' ordination of Gays    	
</P>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- A regional judicial commission of the  
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has ruled against upholding the 
ordination of homosexuals by two Presbyterian churches in New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases were considered tests of how the church would  
interpret a hotly debated constitutional provision that prohibits 
sexual relationships between unmarried church officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission ordered the Presbytery of Northern New England to  
require that Christ Church Presbyterian Church of Burlington, Vt., 
comply with the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The body also required the First Presbyterian Church in  
Stamford, Conn., to reexamine an openly gay elder's suitability for 
service. It also said the Presbytery of Southern New England was 
wrong to uphold the election of a previously ordained elder when 
his examination left some questions unanswered.

 *Scientologists, critic, battle in the name of dead worshiper    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- A critic of the Church of Scientology  
said he is financing a new foundation named after Lisa McPherson, a 
Scientologist who died in 1995 while in the care of the church. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert S. Minton said he would incorporate the Lisa McPherson  
Educational Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson, 36, suffered a severe mental breakdown for 17 days  
before she died of a blood clot in her left lung. Her death 
prompted a wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Tampa, and criminal 
charges against the church in Pinellas County. 
</P>
<P>
	Minton's foundation will reach out to disaffected members of the  
church and educate the public about what he says are the harmful 
effects of Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
	The new foundation would provide ``exit counseling'' for people  
wanting to leave Scientology, said Minton, who has spent about $2.5 
million over the past three years fighting the church. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Minton's plan, which leaked out on the Internet,  
Scientologists registered two corporations bearing McPherson's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lisa Foundation Inc., or the Lisa McPherson Foundation Inc.,  
would work to stand up against the ``hate-mongering'' and 
``religious intolerance'' of Minton and his allies, said Bennetta 
Slaughter, a Clearwater businesswoman and a Scientologist. She was 
McPherson's boss and longtime friend, and will lead the groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Slaughter said McPherson was a dedicated Scientologist who never  
would have wanted her name affiliated with Minton's cause.

 *Catholic, Jewish leaders embark on pilgrimage    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- About 70 Catholic and Jewish leaders from the  
Boston area are on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and Rome to explore 
the often-troubled relationship between the two religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a sign of hope to me that as Christians begin to  
celebrate the second millennium of Christ's birth that we are going 
to the Holy Land with our Jewish brothers and sisters,'' Cardinal 
Bernard Law said as the group left Boston Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``May the peace we find in Jerusalem be something that we can  
share,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilgrimage is being led by Law and Rabbi Samuel Chiel of  
Newton.

<HEADLINE>  Bishop Asks for East Timor Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Indonesia's military chief and other  
officers should face a war crimes tribunal for orchestrating a 
reign of terror in East Timor, Nobel Peace laureate Bishop Carlos 
Belo says. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these people, they must be put in a tribunal, an  
international tribunal,'' Belo told the Australian Broadcasting 
Corp. today. ``The U.N. should create a commission ... for these 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers in East Timor abetted pro-Indonesian  
militiamen in attacks on East Timorese after the territory voted to 
break with Indonesia in an Aug. 30 vote. Many East Timorese say the 
rampage was planned by the army. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who should be tried, Belo was quoted as saying, is  
Gen. Wiranto, the former defense minister and military chief who 
was given a different Cabinet post Tuesday under Indonesia's 
moderate new president. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo also named Gen. Syafrie Syamsuddin, the former Indonesian  
army chief of operations, and Gen. Adam Damiri, a regional military 
commander whose area of responsibility included East Timor. Senior 
Indonesian military leaders have denied ordering attacks by the 
militia or soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, any ordinary East Timorese who took part in the  
violence should be forgiven if they showed remorse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They must state publicly they are in guilt, they are at fault,  
they committed crimes against humanity and against the East Timor 
people,'' he said. ``They must kneel down and kiss the feet of the 
people (of) Timor, and after that we will receive them as brothers 
and sisters and they can come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rampage left much of East Timor in ruins. Hundreds of  
thousands of people fled or were driven from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	International peacekeepers arrived Sept. 20 to restore order,  
and a United Nations transition team took control of the territory 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Belo said he hoped East Timor and Indonesia could eventually  
forge friendly ties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need good relations,'' he said. ``We have interests ...  
beyond all the barbarity committed by the army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, the head of the U.N.'s relief effort in East Timor  
said Thursday that 120,000 refugees were planning to leave camps in 
Indonesian-held West Timor and walk home before seasonal rains 
begin over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference, Ross Mountain said it is ``now  
fully safe'' for the refugees to return to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	About 250,000 people fled to the western half of the island to  
escape the militia rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``There remain difficulties in the camps in terms of individuals  
who wish to exercise their right to voluntarily return to their 
country due to the presence of militia in the camps,'' Mountain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai called for  
Indonesian army participation in the international peacekeeping 
force in East Timor. Chuan, who is also defense minister, made the 
remark during a meeting with Gen. Wiranto in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what form Indonesian participation  
could take. Most East Timorese are extremely unlikely to welcome 
back Indonesian troops who are gradually withdrawing after 24 years 
of harsh occupation.

<HEADLINE> Goosen Leads in Volvo Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEREZ, Spain (AP) -- On the first day of golf on the European  
Tour since the death of U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart, the 
66-man field at the $1.6 million Volvo Masters wore black ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	The players have decided that at close of play Friday evening,  
they will gather at the 18th green to play their last respects to 
Stewart. The gathering will be led by two-time Masters champion 
Bernhard Langer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 42, was killed when his private plane crashed Monday in  
South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	In a subdued atmosphere with thin galleries, gray skies and wet  
ground, South African Retief Goosen shot a 10-under-par 62 over the 
Montecastillo to open a three-shot lead over Welshman Phillip Price 
and pull four clear of a six-man group that included Langer and 
Denmark's Thomas Bjorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I was on the green, I was thinking I had a chance for a  
60, but after three putts there I have to be happy with a 62,'' 
Goosen said of the final hole. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wet conditions, preferred lies were played, and 48  
players broke par. 
</P>
<P>
	Current European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie, fired a 70. Spain's  
Sergio Garcia carded a 69, and England's Lee Westwood had a 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood was an angry man after his round. At the 12th, his  
second shot landed in bushes among loose grass cuttings. He asked 
for a free drop but was refused on the grounds that the cuttings 
had not been piled for collection but just scattered. 
</P>
<P>
	Westwood's third shot plugged further in the cuttings and his  
hacked fourth hardly advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Englishman did not realize he could have scraped the  
cuttings away from around the ball. When he was informed of this by 
tournament referee John Grant, Westwood uttered several 
obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
	He later admitted his ignorance.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm to blame,'' Westwood said. ``If I'd known the rules better  
I'd have saved at least two shots.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 217.83 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today after a new report showed  
U.S. workers' wages and benefits are increasing at a slower than 
expected pace. The report raised hopes that inflation is not 
threatening the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 217.83 at 10,612.72, extending Wednesday's 92-point 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 37.25 at 1,333.96, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 51.75 at 2,854.27. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its  
employment cost index rose by 0.8 percent in the third quarter, 
slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many economists were 
expecting. Economists view that index as a significant barometer of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the third 
time this year in its continuing effort to ward off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the employment cost index might not deter the Fed  
from implementing another rate hike when it meets Nov. 16, but they 
believed the next increase could be the last for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not closed, of course,'' said Michael Moran,  
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, pointing out that the 
Fed will also carefully monitor next week's employment report. 
``But inflation pressures are not problematic at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The promise of stabilizing interest rates boosted bank stocks  
for a second straight session. Citigroup rose 2 3/4 to 53 7/8, and Chase 
Manhattan rose 3 13/16 to 86 9/16. American Express, a component of 
the Dow, rose 7 3/16 to 157 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks are especially sensitive to rising rates because higher  
rates can dissuade customers from borrowing money, cutting into 
lending volume. Also, higher rates can reduce the value of a 
financial firm's fixed holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the  
exclusion of a strong report on the nation's gross domestic 
product. The government reported today that the U.S. economy 
expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent from July through 
September, the fastest pace this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com fell 4 3/8 to 71 9/16. The online  
retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results 
topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as 
the company spent heavily to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 551.76 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 4.73 to 421.50.

<HEADLINE>  Marilyn Monroe Dress Fetches $1.26 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The formfitting dress Marilyn Monroe wore to  
serenade President Kennedy with ``Happy Birthday'' 40 years ago is 
still making jaws drop, this time over the price it fetched at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered Wednesday night when the hammer went down for  
the winning bid: $1.15 million from the Manhattan-based Gotta Have 
It! Collectibles. With the 15 percent commission to auction house 
Christie's, company co-owner Robert Schagrin paid $1.26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is record for an item of clothing sold at auction,  
obliterating the $222,500 paid for an ink blue Princess Diana gown 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he spent a small fortune, Schagrin said, ``Because it  
wasn't $3 million, which we thought it was worth. ... We stole 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flesh-colored, sequined stunner worn by Monroe during her  
breathless song on May 12, 1962, was the highest-priced item at the 
first session of a two-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The total take for 55 items auctioned Wednesday was $5.6  
million, Christie's said. The sale was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding on the dress quickly escalated from $200,000 and  
culminated in a wild 2 1/2-minute showdown before the final price was 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Made of silk souffle gauze and covered with 6,000 rhinestone  
beads and sequins, the Jean Louis dress originally cost $12,000. 
There was no pre-sale estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers snapped up everything from Monroe's blue jeans and boots  
to screenplays, most at prices far beyond pre-sale predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The night's first big-ticket item -- a platinum eternity ring  
encrusted with 34 baguette-cut diamonds given to Monroe by 
ex-husband Joe DiMaggio -- sold for $772,500. The pre-sale estimate 
was $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Designer Tommy Hilfiger bought two lots, a pair of cowgirl boots  
Monroe wore in ``The Misfits,'' for $85,000, and three pairs of 
jeans from ``River of No Return,'' for $42,550. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm inspired by pop icons and by pop culture,'' Hilfiger said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Curtis, Monroe's co-star in ``Some Like It Hot,'' sat in  
the front row and reminisced about Monroe after the sale. Actress 
Demi Moore was in a booth upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	A provocative scarlet silk halter dress, worn by Monroe in  
publicity photos for ``Let's Make Love,'' sold for $167,500, as did 
a sweater worn by Monroe for a series of 1962 beach photos. The 
buyer was Ripley's Believe it or Not. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe died in 1962 of an overdose of sleeping pills at 36. She  
left all her belongings to her acting coach, method acting guru Lee 
Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, is selling the items. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was broadcast live on the American Movie Classics  
channel and on the Web via Internet portal Excite.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S.S.R. United by Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The assassination of Armenia's prime minister in  
the assault on parliament was the latest convulsion of violence to 
grip the former republics of the Soviet Union as increasingly 
radical fringe groups take up arms. 
</P>
<P>
	In some republics, the violence has erupted between secular  
governments and religious movements; in others, bloody conflicts 
have arisen between political opponents. Hopes that democracy would 
flourish across the former Soviet Union are threatened by growing 
political polarization. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the radical groups have taken root in the economic  
desperation that has gripped much of the region since the Soviet 
collapse in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fathers and grandfathers, who spared no effort and  
sacrificed themselves to build this country, have been doomed to a 
half-starved and miserable existence,'' Nairi Unanian, the leader 
of the gunmen who killed Armenian Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, 
proclaimed in a televised statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thousands of our children have no school books and shoes to go  
to school, our economy has been ruined, social unrest has risen to 
an unbearable level and there is a looming threat of losing our 
independence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether Unanian and the other four gunmen who  
burst into the Armenian parliament on Wednesday represented a wider 
group. But their message would resonate with many in Armenia, one 
of the poorest nations to emerge from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty has toppled successive governments in Christian Armenia;  
in the Islamic republics of the former Soviet Union it has fueled 
militant religious movements that have challenged state 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The last few months alone have seen a violent incursion by a  
radical Islamic group into Kyrgyzstan, which had been the most 
stable former Soviet republic in Central Asia; a militant Islamic 
offensive in the southern Russian region of Dagestan, which drew 
Russia back into war with separatist Chechnya; and a series of 
terrorist bombings in Russian cities that killed about 300 people 
and were blamed on Islamic fighters from Dagestan and Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	Caucasus expert Alexander Iskandaryan said that high  
unemployment among young people, against a background of widespread 
corruption, made republics such as Dagestan ripe for the spread of 
radical Islam. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of this leads to the popularity of slogans about social  
equality, unmasking of corrupt officials and criticism of the 
social mullahs, who are sullied by luxury and hypocrisy,'' 
Iskandaryan wrote in The Moscow Times this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, terrorists unleashed car bomb attacks against  
several government buildings in the Central Asian nation of 
Uzbekistan, where the secular government of President Islam Karimov 
has been doing its utmost to stifle what it considers a growing 
threat of militant Islamic fundamentalism. The government has 
banned political parties based on religion and prohibits the 
teaching of religion in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights advocates say that such a climate of confrontation  
has encouraged the growth of radical movements -- especially in the 
Central Asian nations, where political life is dominated by 
authoritarian leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real problem is that the population is experiencing  
extremely difficult circumstances, and there are very few avenues 
for them to address their discontent,'' said John Schoeberlein, 
chairman of the Central Asian Forum of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from poverty and the struggle for power, the former Soviet  
republics are united by growing ties between politicians and 
criminals, and easy access to weapons. These factors have fed the 
growth of violent, radical movements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Huge stocks of weapons have been accumulated almost everywhere  
and there is no way of preventing them from spreading,'' said 
Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst at the Moscow office of the 
Carnegie Endowment for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that soldiers, who gained combat experience in the  
regional wars that broke out in the years following the Soviet 
breakup, provide ready recruits for militant groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mostly, they are unemployed, feel themselves alienated from  
society, and try to make their living with the help of guns,'' 
Petrov said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosting Nigerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Looking beyond billions of dollars of debt to  
admire Nigeria's efforts to shed a corrupt past, President Clinton 
is seeking to help President Olesegun Obasanjo turn his nation into 
a stabilizing force for the rest of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was meeting at the White House today with Obasanjo, who  
took office in May and is hoping his first official visit will 
yield a pledge of more U.S. aid and an end to a U.S. ban on flights 
due to lax airport security and drug smuggling. The two leaders 
planned to share lunch and hold a joint news conference later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has billions in oil  
wealth but is struggling with $31 billion in debt, a declining 
standard of living and widespread unemployment. Clinton, who has 
advocated debt forgiveness for poorer nations, is less concerned 
with that than with events that have unfolded since Obasanjo took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the White House notes that Nigeria acted as a  
mediator in Sierra Leone's civil conflict and has taken steps to 
curb corruption, such as canceling questionable government 
contracts and recovering assets stolen under the regime of late 
military leader Gen. Sani Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're witnessing here is a coming of age, if you will,  
for Nigeria under the Obasanjo government,'' said national security 
spokesman Jim Fallin. ``Obasanjo's leadership bodes well for our 
future relationship and successes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among matters on today's agenda was oil -- Nigeria provides about  
10 percent of the oil exported to the United States. Obasanjo wants 
U.S. help in reviving Nigeria's economy by leveraging its oil 
wealth; Clinton is interested in coordinating the assistance 
Nigeria is getting from 18 federal agencies under an umbrella 
effort, the U.S.-Nigerian Joint Economic Partnership Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's attempts to rebuild its economy are hampered by  
lingering concerns over corruption. Several powerful figures, 
including a main Obasanjo supporter, former military leader Ibrahim 
Babangida, got rich off of corruption and continue to live off of 
that wealth, anti-corruption activists assert. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Abacha's death in June 1998, Nigeria has convicted few  
people of corruption, and former officials suspected of corruption 
continue to live openly with little fear of prosecution. While 
Obasanjo forced dozens of senior military generals to retire, there 
have yet to be broad investigations of the military necessary to 
root out deeply entrenched corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Obasanjo's government has shown willingness to prosecute  
some of the most brutal officials of the Abacha regime. Abacha's 
son and one of his top security officials were recently arrested in 
connection with the slaying of pro-democracy activist Kudirat 
Abiola, a wife of the late Moshood Abiola, winner of the 1993 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiola died of a heart attack in prison a month after Abacha  
died.

<HEADLINE> Stewart, Crash Victims Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The skirl of a lone bagpipe playing the Scottish  
lament ``Going Home'' cut through ghostly fog in a chilling tribute 
to Payne Stewart before the start of the Tour Championship on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	With sullen faces and vacant eyes, Stewart's peers on the PGA  
Tour sat on white folding chairs on the first tee of Champions Golf 
Club to honor his memory at the tournament where he was to have 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loved to laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not going  
to be ashamed of my tears this morning, and neither should you,'' 
Tom Lehman said. ``When he died on Monday, a big part of us died, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a winner of 18 tournaments around the world and three  
major championships, was as traditional in his knickers and tam 
o'shanter as the game itself. That spirit lived on in a service 
that showcased golf's roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrouded by an eerie fog, the bagpiper walked 100 yards toward  
the first tee playing a song about a Scotsman finally returning to 
his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beautiful,'' Tim Herron said. ``The bagpipes drew you  
into Payne Stewart. When you think of bagpipes, you think of 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was traveling to Texas to play in the Tour Championship  
when his plane crashed. Killed with Stewart were his agents, Robert 
Fraley and Van Ardan; pilots Michael Kling and Stephanie 
Bellegarrigue; and Bruce Borland, one of Jack Nicklaus' golf course 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every one was convinced the tour should have proceeded with  
the tournament, but PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem was among 
those who said it could be a platform to honor Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
on Monday took from us one of our great champions,'' Finchem said. 
``Payne represented the best of golf. He was a man of great faith, 
a devoted, compassionate and most energetic husband and father, and 
a man of tremendous generosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players hugged each other as they left the service and headed  
past the practice green, where Duffy Waldorf was getting ready for 
the first tee time in the Tour Championship, the $5 million event 
for the top 30 money-winners. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a startling reminder that there was golf to be played.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way you plan to start any round of golf,''  
Waldorf said after finishing 27 holes in 2-under-par. Because 
Stewart's death left only 29 players in the field, Waldorf played 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Estes used his putter for the first shot of the tournament,  
rapping it about 15 feet -- the length of that historic putt Stewart 
made in June to win the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's for you, Payne,'' he said. Estes wound up with a double  
bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, about 100 players and caddies involved in the  
PGA event at Jackson, Miss., attended a memorial service for 
Stewart. Bradley Bryant and Andy Bean spoke during the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the players in the tournament, including first-round  
leader Russ Cochran, had already flown to Orlando, Fla., for 
Friday's service in Stewart's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant also passed along a message from Stewart's wife, Tracey,  
who said her husband would have been proud of the outpouring of 
support for her and their two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``The support we are giving her now is good, but it has to go  
on,'' Bryant told his fellow golfers. ``Tracey, Aaron and Chelsea, 
out of our love, out of our respect and out of our friendship we 
have for Payne, let's be there for his family, not just tomorrow 
but for the months and years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida on Thursday, New York Mets pitcher Orel Hershiser  
gave a eulogy for Fraley at a private memorial service. Stewart's 
wife and children attended, along with New York Jets coach Bill 
Parcells and golfers Greg Norman and Lee Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orel Hershiser gave a very eloquent, very moving and very  
touching speech,'' said Elise Maynard, a friend who attended the 
service near Orlando, where Stewart lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman considered not playing this week because his mind was not  
on golf, but then Finchem asked him to offer a prayer at the 
service Thursday morning. After a few remarks, Lehman prayed for 
comfort for Stewart's wife and two children, and the families of 
the other victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was up all night ... worrying about completely collapsing  
and not being able to blubber a word,'' Lehman said. ``I think it's 
appropriate that we had that service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players bowed their heads or stared into space as he spoke.  
</P>
<P>
	After a moment of silence, the bagpiper, Steve Agan of Houston,  
played ``Amazing Grace.'' Then he turned and walk back down the 
fairway, again playing ``Going Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a service at Orlando for Ardan later in the afternoon,  
golfer Paul Azinger, choking back tears, told several hundred 
people about Ardan's sense of humor and his devotion to 
Christianity and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter, Fla., Nicklaus and about 1,500 other people attended  
a service for Borland. The architect had decided at the last minute 
to fly on the Learjet with Stewart in order to discuss a business 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a fish gets caught in a net or a bird gets caught in a  
snare, Bruce Borland was caught in an evil trap Monday,'' said 
Tommy Kiedis, associate pastor at the First United Methodist Church 
in Jupiter. ``Life is so unsure.''

<HEADLINE> GAO: $50M Army Trailers Don't Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army spent $50.6 million for 6,700  
two-wheeled trailers that now cannot be used unless the jeeps and 
trucks that pull them are modified, according to congressional 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the 6,700 high-mobility trailers the army has  
purchased are not usable because of a safety problem and not 
suitable because they damage the trucks towing them,'' said the 
General Accounting Office, the auditing and investigative arm of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army plans to pay an additional $640 per trailer to correct  
the flaw, the GAO said in a report released Wednesday. The trailers 
were made by Silver Eagle Manufacturing Co., Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO study said the Army found that the trailers could break,  
causing a safety problem. They could also damage the trucks that 
pull them. Most have been stored until modifications are made. 
</P>
<P>
	George Schneiter, director of strategic and tactical systems for  
the Defense Department, said the Pentagon would follow GAO's 
suggestion that the Army ``demonstrate the design will meet 
requirements and will not damage the trucks'' before acquiring more 
trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army wants to purchase 18,000 additional trailers.

<HEADLINE> Guard Chad Elsey Is Leaving SMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Guard Chad Elsey, who averaged 13.4 points while  
starting all 30 games for SMU last season, is leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustangs basketball coach Mike Dement said Thursday that Elsey  
planned to leave at the end of the semester. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chad Elsey indicated that he did not want to play anymore and  
wasn't sure at this time if he would play basketball further,'' 
Dement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsey, who underwent his second knee surgery in two years during  
the summer, tied a school record with seven 3-pointers during a 
27-point effort against Texas Tech last season. He scored a 
career-high 28 the next game against Alcorn State.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Ilgauskas To Get Foot Checked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas  
flew to Houston Thursday to have a specialist examine the sore left 
foot that kept him out of all the team's exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas, who last season played only five games because of a  
broken left foot, got a toe infection in the same foot earlier this 
month. It required treatment with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Ilgauskas has been experiencing severe pain that has  
kept him off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Ilgauskas again this season would be a bad blow to the  
Cavaliers, who have converted to an uptempo offense under new coach 
Randy Wittman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavaliers showed they were building their future around  
Ilgauskas when they signed the 7-foot-3 center to a six-year, $71 
million contract extension just before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas has a long history of foot problems. He broke his  
right foot twice, in 1995 and '96, keeping him out of the Cavaliers 
lineup both years. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was healthy in the 1997-98 season, Ilgauskas was chosen  
to the NBA's All-Rookie team.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Plays After Father's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the middle of a joyous World Series  
celebration on the field, Paul O'Neill hugged his manager and wept. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill's father had died earlier Wednesday after a long  
struggle with heart problems, and Joe Torre had a special message 
for his right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your dad got to watch this one,'' Torre told O'Neill.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, O'Neill jogged off the field, wiping his eyes as he  
entered the dugout, no longer able to control his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously came out at the end,'' O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	He broke down again in the clubhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be here, I'm proud to be part of this team ...  
but believe me, I lost someone special,'' he said, his voice 
cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was in the lineup in his usual spot in Game 4 against  
the Atlanta Braves, batting third and playing right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he showed up, I assumed he was going to play,'' Torre  
said before the Yankees beat the Braves 4-1 to sweep the Series. 
``That's why he was here. This can keep his mind off the grieving 
for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paulie does what he does. As George Steinbrenner likes to say,  
he's a warrior. He's here even though it is tough to concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles O'Neill, 79, died at a New York hospital about three  
hours after the Yankees beat the Braves 6-5 in 10 innings in Game 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder O'Neill had come to New York from his Ohio home  
earlier this month for treatment. His son left the team for a day 
in June when his father underwent heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with heavy hearts,'' said winning pitcher Roger  
Clemens. ``I don't know if I could've done what Paul O'Neill did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said O'Neill was not surprised by his father's death  
``because he had been in tough shape. It's a very sorrowful time 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who did not want to talk about his father's death  
before the game, stretched and took batting practice with his 
teammates on the field. He went 0-for-3 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understood that his father wanted him to go out there,''  
said Joe Girardi, who is a close friend of O'Neill's. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill is the third Yankee whose father has died in the past  
two months. Scott Brosius' father died of colon cancer on Sept. 12. 
Luis Sojo missed the first two games of the Series after his father 
died Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he did it in a game like this,'' Brosius  
said. ``It took a lot of strength. I know how difficult it is to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre knew as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you play this game you try to eliminate the highs and  
lows,'' he said. ``That has been difficult. There is nothing higher 
than playing in the World Series and nothing lower than mourning 
the loss of a family member. There has been a lot of this going on. 
We just have to fight through it.''

<HEADLINE> FEC To Offer Campaign Web Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Internet becoming as much a part of  
the political process as buttons and posters, federal election 
regulators Thursday asked the public for ideas on what rules and 
regulations should govern campaigning on the Web. It also gave the 
green light to a non-partisan Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-member Federal Election Commission also indicated that  
it would not count independent Web sites that support George W. 
Bush as contributions to the Texas governor's presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC unanimously voted to ask for comments on how it should  
regulate Internet campaigning, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Candidates, parties and political action committees have  
apparently concluded that the Internet is a powerful campaign tool 
with the potential to significantly influence the outcome of 
federal elections,'' the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission did tell the Democracy Network, which is  
partially supported by the League of Women Voters, that it would 
not fall under federal limits on contributions or expenditures 
since it does not support or oppose a particular candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site will provide nonpartisan information about federal  
candidates, including links to candidates' Internet sites. 
Candidates will be invited to respond to e-mail and provide 
information about their positions. The Democracy Network Web site 
will be part of America Online's Election 2000 coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Though a decision was postponed, commissioners indicated they  
were ready to allow Web sites set up independently of political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign had asked the FEC to decide that independent  
sites supporting the Texas governor should not be considered 
contributions to his presidential run. Commissioners disagreed over 
whether they should answer narrowly or offer broader guidance on 
Internet use in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people have a lot of questions,'' commissioner Karl  
Sandstrom said. ``We best approach these one at a time. I'm going 
to be very supportive of allowing volunteers to engage in this 
activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Scott Thomas said that if the commission was going to  
stick to narrow rulings, he hoped others would pepper the FEC with 
more questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope those in the audience encourage someone to give us  
other requests if there is a problem,'' Thomas said. ``We would be 
well-served to get the questions answered as soon as possible.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Ethics Panel Wants Administrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An International Olympic Committee  
ethics panel decided Thursday to appoint an independent 
administrator as part of the continuing drive to stamp out 
malpractice within the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said the proposed ``special representative'' would  
have the ``necessary independence, powers and resources to 
implement the Ethics Code which applies to all Olympic parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued after a one-day meeting, the panel said  
the special representative would act as a source of advice on 
issues like a conflict of interest and investigate allegations of 
breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics commission was set up in the wake of the Salt Lake  
City scandal which forced the expulsion of six members and 
resignation of four more. IOC members and their relatives received 
$1.2 million in cash payments, college scholarships and other 
inducements by the successful bidders for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is headed by IOC Vice President Keba Mbaye, a  
former vice president of the World Court at The Hague. It is 
composed of three IOC members and five outsiders including former 
U.S. Sen. Howard Baker and former U.N. Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's 80-member 2000 Commission meets this weekend to  
discuss proposals for overall reforms to clean up the Olympic 
movement.

<HEADLINE> Onex Sweetens Air Canada Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Onex Corp. has raised its offer to acquire  
Canada's two airlines to about $1.4 billion in cash and stock in an 
effort to entice Air Canada stockholders to sell their shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will increase its cash offer for Air Canada  
shares to about $8.82 ($13 Canadian) apiece, from the $5.60 ($8.25 
Canadian) it offered in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised bid, up from a total of $1.2 billion. also decreases  
the role of Onex's partner, American Airlines, which would sell its 
stake to other shareholders and forgo membership on the Air Canada 
board. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, more than 400 jobs in accounting and administration  
would be added to Air Canada operations in Winnipeg and Montreal. 
And 400 jobs would be added to Air Canada's Montreal head office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've taken a great deal for Canada and made it better,'' Onex  
chairman Gerald Schwartz told a news conference Thursday. ``We have 
been listening carefully to what Canadians have told us. Today we 
are responding decisively on every single point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new bid deals with one of the major criticism of Onex's  
earlier offer: the key role of U.S. air giant American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said the changes mean American will sell its proposed  
14.9 percent stake in a restructured Air Canada and will not buy 
any shares of the Montreal-based carrier in future. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-expected new bid comes in response to a competing bid  
by Air Canada last week that was meant to block Onex by buying back 
more than one-third of Air Canada stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Air Canada agreed to poison-pill penalties in a  
long-term contract with the global Star Alliance, a rival to Onex 
partner American Airlines and its Oneworld network. 
</P>
<P>
	Onex, backed by American, offered $1.2 billion in late August to  
buy Air Canada and Canadian Airlines and merge them into one 
national carrier, with the loss of about 5,000 jobs. The company 
would also assume $2.6 billion in debt from the two airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that plan, Onex would own 31 percent of the merged  
airline, American 14.9 percent and public shareholders 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Canada, in a competing bid financially backed by its Star  
partners United and Lufthansa, proposed last week an $543 million 
buyback of 35 percent of its shares and a $62 million bid to take 
over Canadian Airlines, matching Onex's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal would see at least 2,500 jobs cut, most at  
Calgary-based Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
	A key part of the Onex plan is to bring Air Canada into  
Oneworld, dominated by American Airlines and British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Onex's plan, about 10 percent of the combined work force  
of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines would be cut -- through 
attrition and buyouts over 18 months. In addition, a number of 
domestic flights would be chopped as the merged airline ended 
overlapping services in a bid to cut costs.

<HEADLINE> Coke Eyes Price-Adjusting Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. is studying wireless technology  
that could allow bottlers to raise or lower soda prices by remote 
control at certain times -- say, during hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower prices during periods of slower sales would presumably  
bring in more business -- unless the higher prices at other times 
enraged customers. But a spokesman for the world's biggest soft 
drink maker said the company has no immediate plans to put such a 
machine into the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the pricing is something we don't see happening  
anytime soon, if ever,'' spokesman Rob Baskin said today. ``You 
could probably make a vending machine that could fly, too, but I 
don't think we would do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the company is testing a  
machine that can automatically raise prices for its drinks during 
hot weather. It also quoted chairman and chief executive M. Douglas 
Ivester's comments on the subject earlier this month to a Brazilian 
newsmagazine, Veja. 
</P>
<P>
	The desire for a cold drink increases during the summer heat,  
Ivester said, so ``it is fair that it should be more expensive. The 
machine will simply make this process automatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said Coke's research and development department is  
evaluating several technologies for new machines to allow the 
company to remotely collect data such as how full the machines are 
and how often they are visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke is one of several beverage makers interested in such data  
because the information could increase the machines' productivity, 
said Ron Sewell, president of Automated Network Solutions, a 
Roswell, Ga., company assisting Coke with the tests.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s first-quarter profit  
rose 8.5 percent before one-time restructuring charges as sales 
rose 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest consumer products maker had earnings before  
one-time charges of $1.27 billion, or 88 cents per share, compared 
with $1.17 billion, or 80 cents per share, in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results for the quarter ended Sept. 30 met the expectations  
of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. P&AMP;G stock 
rose $5.37 1/2 to $104.62 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time charges of $120 million related to the company's  
restructuring program are included, P&AMP;G earned $1.17 billion, or 80 
cents per share, in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales increased by 4 percent from a year ago to $9.92 billion  
from $9.51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said it increased the volume of its product shipments by 2  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G is in the midst of a reorganization designed to streamline  
decision-making and help it react more quickly to market demands. 
The company said it was beginning to see results from the 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported a 10 percent increase in its fabric and  
home care business, which includes brands such as Tide detergent; a 
2 percent decline in paper products earnings and a 5 percent gain 
in food and beverage earnings, on products such as Folgers coffee, 
Pringles snacks and Jif peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G's beauty care business had a 4 percent drop in earnings and  
health care, which includes the newly-acquired Iams pet food 
business, was up 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G sells about 300 brands in more than 140 countries, also  
including Crest toothpaste and Pampers disposable diapers.

<HEADLINE> Maersk Moving to Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maersk Inc., the world's largest shipping  
company, plans to leave the Port of Long Beach and lease space at 
the neighboring Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port of Long Beach is the nation's busiest container port  
and is making plans to develop a nearby shuttered Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maersk officials said the Port of Los Angeles offered good  
highway access and on-dock rail lines at a terminal now under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have the capability to build our own terminal from  
scratch and the space affords us a lot of options,'' Tom Boyd, a 
Maersk spokesman, said Wednesday. ``Everything will be high-tech on 
this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Danish-owned Maersk, which recently bought Sea-Land Services  
Inc., has agreed to lease space on Pier 400 at the Port of Los 
Angeles, a huge container terminal being built in the middle of the 
harbor. The deal was expected to be finalized in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, the Port of Los Angeles stands to  
get about $2 billion in revenue from the 25-year lease, scheduled 
to begin in mid-2002. The Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro moved 
the equivalent of 3.7 million 20-foot shipping containers in the 
past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Port of Long Beach handled about 4.3 million 20-foot  
shipping containers in the same period. About 13 percent of the 
port's revenue comes from Maersk and Sea-Land. 
</P>
<P>
	Maersk's decision disappointed Long Beach officials, but other  
carriers there will likely fill the departing company's space. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our customers have been asking for more room. ... This  
will give us a chance to meet the needs of our other customers,'' 
said Yvonne Avila, a spokeswoman for the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Those other customers include some of the fastest growing  
shipping lines in the world, including Hanjin, Hyundai and Cosco, 
the shipping line of the Chinese government.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sets Up $500M Venture Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's finance minister signed a  
memorandum Thursday to establish a $500 million venture capital 
fund to help Thai industry and spur recovery from the region's 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Partners in the agreement signed by Finance Minister Tarrin  
Nimmanhaeminda are the World Bank's investment arm, the 
International Finance Corp., and Lombard Investments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund is part of a medium-term economic stimulus package  
unveiled by the government Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, research from Thailand's biggest bank suggested  
that the country's nascent economic recovery may not be sustainable 
and predicted that five years could be needed to restore the 
financial sector to health. 
</P>
<P>
	Bangkok Bank said in a report presented at a seminar that gross  
domestic product will grow 3.5 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 
2000. But it said most would be the result of government fiscal 
stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bangkok Bank's chief economist, Nimit Nontapunthawat, said  
public spending could only stimulate the economy in the short-term 
because it created a huge debt burden the country could not afford 
to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be careful in spending and creating more debt,''  
Nimit said. ``Fiscal expansion is difficult to increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In setting up the venture capital fund, Tarrin said that ``the  
key problem of the private sector is a lack of capital to finance 
their operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the fund would help resolve this problem and ``lead to  
economic recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An official contract is to be signed in January, followed by the  
beginning of operations. Tarrin said the fund could be expanded to 
$1 billion after the first quarter of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Unveil Declassification Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two lawmakers, one the author of a book on the  
dangers of secrecy and the other a former CIA agent, announced 
legislation Wednesday that could speed up the declassification of 
reams of government documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about the American public's sense of their  
government and their confidence in it,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, D-N.Y., said Wednesday at a news conference with the 
legislation's House sponsor, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would create a board that would act as a  
clearinghouse for declassification requests and help move them 
along. Moynihan, whose most recent book, ``Secrecy: The American 
Experience,'' is about post-Cold War secrets in government, 
volunteered to lead the board after he retires from the Senate next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goss is a former CIA agent who worked on clandestine operations  
in Latin America, the Caribbean and parts of Europe during the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate how keeping information secret can erode the  
public's trust in government, Moynihan cited polls indicating that 
many Americans believe President John F. Kennedy was assassinated 
by the CIA. Many of the Kennedy papers were classified until 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Most documents 25 years or older must be declassified. There are  
1.5 billion documents that fit that category. 
</P>
<P>
	The Moynihan-Goss bill would create a nine-member ``Public  
Interest Declassification Board'' responsible for identifying and 
prioritizing declassification requests. The board would concentrate 
on issues of pressing public curiosity, such as the current 
interest in whether the CIA played a role in human rights abuses in 
the regime of former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Security Council and the Justice Department are  
doing separate searches for CIA documents on Pinochet, and Congress 
has proposed a third search. The board could coordinate those 
searches in a more organized and timely manner, Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation is narrower in scope than a similar bill  
Moynihan sponsored last year. The Senate passed that bill, but the 
House never voted on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan said he still wants Congress, through legislation, to  
address the issue of how documents are classified, saying it is 
likely too much information was being made secret. The number of 
documents classified by government agencies continues to rise. In 
1996, for example, a half-million documents were classified, said 
Mike Waterman, a Moynihan aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Goss likened the situation to a bathtub, saying the bill  
introduced Wednesday would create a ``slightly larger drain'' but 
that more and more water fills the tub every day. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA spokesman Tom Crispell said the agency was doing its best to  
meet declassification mandates but the number of documents was 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have as many people working declassification as we have  
people working terrorist targets,'' Crispell said. He said the CIA 
had no immediate comment on the proposed legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI did not return a phone call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> CART Title Battle Ready To Play Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Jimmy Vasser is a believer.  
</P>
<P>
	Even though Dario Franchitti has the upper hand in the CART  
FedEx Series championship battle heading into Sunday's 
season-ending Marlboro 500, Vasser thinks his teammate, Juan 
Montoya, has a realistic shot at the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Vasser, the defending winner in the race at California Speedway,  
loves watching the 24-year-old Montoya at work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come to realize throughout this season that the kid's not  
human, so I don't think he does surprise me any more,'' Vasser said 
with a grin. ``He's done things this year that I didn't think were 
possible for a racer, much less a rookie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya trails Franchitti by nine points -- the difference  
between first and fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Surprisingly, I'm not feeling a lot of pressure,'' Montoya  
said. ``I think the pressure is going to be on the other drivers to 
keep up with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be only the second 500-mile race for Montoya, who has  
adapted quickly to oval racing after being brought up on road 
courses. Montoya finished second in July at Michigan Speedway in 
his 500-mile debut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really enjoyed that race,'' he said. ``It seemed like I got  
stronger as the race wore on, so I'm hoping my endurance will be an 
advantage for me on Sunday, too. I'm just going to try to win the 
race, like I try to do every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, of course, stands in the way.  
</P>
<P>
	``Having the (points) advantage is helpful, but as we saw at  
Australia, it doesn't really mean anything,'' said the Scotsman, 
referring to the fact that he went from a 12-point deficit to his 
current lead by winning the race two weeks ago while Montoya 
crashed out with no points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going into this with the same attitude I've used all year  
to get to this point; to do the best job I possibly can, and we'll 
see what the result is at the end of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice begins today, with qualifying on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	For most of the this season, it looked like team owner Chip  
Ganassi, who chose the sensational rookie to replace two-time 
champion Alex Zanardi, had made another in a series of inspired 
decisions that has already brought Target-Chip Ganassi Racing three 
straight PPG Cup titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya nearly overwhelmed the series, winning seven of his  
first 17 races and building a points lead that seemed 
insurmountable until a combination of rookie mistakes and 
Franchitti's late-season charge put him behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it all comes down to the finale -- with a maximum of 22  
points -- one for the pole, one for leading the most laps and 20 for 
winning the race -- still up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``An old baseball coach of mine once said that a sign of a great  
team is one that can come from behind and win,'' Ganassi said. 
``That's our goal in Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have no control over the competition, but our  
entire team has done an excellent job of staying positive. No one's 
given up hope. It's going to be an exciting race, that's for 
sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the excitement of the championship battle is the kind  
of event the 500-mile race is likely to be on Fontana's wide, 
two-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Since CART introduced an aerodynamic rear wing known as the  
Handford Device in the 1998 U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway, its 
500-mile races have turned into wildly competitive affairs with 
lead and position changes possible on almost every lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of race where you can be first on one lap and  
fifth or even 10th the next time around,'' Vasser said. ``Nothing 
would surprise me.''

<HEADLINE> IRS To Go After Waiters' Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a concession to the restaurant industry,  
the Internal Revenue Service will no longer audit restaurateurs as 
long as they try to comply with tax laws on reporting of tips -- 
even if their waiters and waitresses are cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the IRS is shifting its enforcement focus to the  
employees who aren't reporting their tips, which officials 
acknowledge will be far more difficult to track due to lack of 
money and manpower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like they are finally realizing they don't have any  
recourse,'' said Amanda Cholden, general manager of the Tortilla 
Coast restaurant on Capitol Hill. ``It's great, but in all honesty 
we do put forth a good-faith effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS turnabout, which comes after years of court battles in  
which the agency fought to keep its restaurant audit powers, is the 
latest example of agency reforms that are geared toward helping 
taxpayers comply with the law rather than punishing those who 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas R. Burger, the IRS chief of employment taxes, said  
Thursday that ``there is something wrong'' when restaurant owners 
do everything they can to encourage waiters and waitresses to 
report tips but are still targeted by audits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're doing everything they're supposed to do, we won't  
focus on the employer,'' Burger said. ``We think it's much more 
beneficial to us to educate at the beginning. You've got people out 
there who are trying. Where they are trying, they'll probably get a 
bye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS figures it is losing billions of dollars a year in  
payroll and income taxes because of unreported restaurant and bar 
tips. In 1998, just over $7 billion in tips were reported -- tips 
over $20 a month must be disclosed -- in an industry that does some 
$250 billion in business a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not nickels and dimes,'' Burger said.  
</P>
<P>
	For years, the IRS locked horns in court with restaurants over  
the agency's practice of auditing the businesses instead of 
employees to collect underreported tips. Court decisions came down 
on both sides of the argument. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the IRS was promoting voluntary compliance  
through a program in which restaurants agree to advise workers of 
tip requirements, implement a way for them to report those tips and 
maintain records. In exchange, restaurants were less vulnerable to 
audits. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, restaurants could be kicked out of the IRS program  
and be subjected to audits if they complied with all the rules and 
their employees still failed to report tips. The new IRS move 
changes that, effectively immediately, and extends the voluntary 
program five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just makes sense that restaurateurs should not be  
vulnerable to being kicked off (the program) when they are 
complying with it, but their employees are not,'' said Steven C. 
Anderson, president of the National Restaurant Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The association has a sizable lobbying presence in Washington,  
spending $480,000 to lobby the federal government in the first half 
of 1999 and contributing $250,000 between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 to 
political campaigns, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision ... is a big win for restaurant owners across  
the country,'' Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will still closely monitor restaurant tax filings to  
ensure the tips being reported are reasonable compared with its 
amount of business, Burger said. The average for credit card tips 
is about 14.5 percent, 12 percent for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an establishment doing $1 million gross but  
reporting only 2 percent in tips ``very likely will get a contact 
from the IRS,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of Bullfeathers, another Capitol Hill restaurant, said  
his servers are required to report cash tips of at least 12 percent 
on time cards, which are then compared with the meal checks they 
had that day. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our standpoint, it's nice to know we're not going to be  
responsible'' for an audit, said owner Stratton Liapis. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bartenders at a downtown Washington pub and steakhouse said  
they liked the new IRS approach because they would be responsible 
for their own paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most customers are paying with credit card anyway and you have  
to report your credit cards,'' said one of the bartenders, Lisa, 
who spoke on condition only her first name would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Her colleague, Mike, acknowledged that the chances of getting  
caught will be slimmer with the new system. ``This restaurant has 
25 waiters. There is still going to be one guy checking the 25 
waiters instead of just one proprietor,'' he said. ``You have to 
report it regardless, or you'll lose your job.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Sink on S. America Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures plunged lower Thursday in a wave  
of selling just before the closing bell on the Chicago Board of 
Trade, wiping out two days of gains in the last 10 minutes. Grains 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical fund selling coupled with forecasts for weekend rains  
in South America prompted the decline, soybean traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	After dipping to their lowest level in seven weeks, soybean  
futures had been rallying for a second day on rumors that China may 
buy from 100,000 to 300,000 tons of U.S. soybeans by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures closed mostly lower, as farmer hedging negated an  
early rally on unexpectedly strong weekly export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat prices were mostly higher after forecasts called for no  
precipitation in the U.S. winter wheat belt for the next six to 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 3/4 cent to $2.57 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn fell 1 cent to $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 1/4 
cent to $1.11 a bushel; November soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.65 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced while pork futures retreated on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle rose .52 cent to 68.42 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle rose .88 cent to 80.40 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs fell .45 cent to 45.95 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies fell .87 cent to 61.15 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged To Pay U.N. Arrears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke today urged  
Congress to pay the country's arrears to the United Nations, saying 
``we must match our rhetoric with resources'' in the fight against 
mass violence, war crimes and other atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Auschwitz to the killing fields of Cambodia to Srebrenica  
to Sierra Leone and Rwanda, this century has come face to face with 
evil repeatedly,'' Holbrooke said in a keynote address to the first 
high-level international conference of its kind on preventing 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	``And yet, here we are again as it's recurring in various parts  
of the world ... asking ourselves 'why?''' 
</P>
<P>
	He told diplomats, academics and others at the two-day State  
Department conference to ``first, recognize that evil really 
exists'' in the world and to ``denounce it in no uncertain terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, words are not enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``We must match our rhetoric with resources -- empty words (and)  
resolutions which governments don't even want to agree with are 
insufficient,'' Holbrooke said in a conference room at the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community must also match its words with its  
wallet,'' he said, mentioning Europe, Africa and Asia in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said he was going from the conference to Capitol Hill  
to try to persuade legislators ``that the bare minimum'' is to pay 
late dues so the United States doesn't lose what influence it has 
at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, more importantly, for our policies to be implemented in  
East Timor, Sierra Leone'' and other nations trying to recover from 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, the United States has supported U.N. Security  
Council resolutions authorizing deployment of 6,000 U.N. 
peacekeepers to Sierra Leone and more than 9,000 to East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	According to U.N. figures, the United States is currently $1.8  
billion in arrears and must pay $350 million by Dec. 31 to keep its 
seat in the U.N. General Assembly. Its vote in the Security Council 
is secured. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke has been spending at least two days a week in  
Washington lobbying members of Congress and has said he is 
determined to get the United States to pay at least $900 million in 
U.N. arrears. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has held up payment of arrears for years, demanding  
that the United Nations streamline its organization and institute a 
no-growth budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of members of Congress want the United States  
to pay its dues ``and we are working with them to fashion a 
bipartisan solution in the interests of national security,'' 
Holbrooke said earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Killings Baffle Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Two Internet penny stock promoters found  
shot to death had ties to ``shady'' business dealings, which may 
ultimately have led to their execution-style killings, a prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Chalem, 41, and Mayir Lehmann, 37, were found early  
Tuesday face down on the bloodstained marble floor of the estate 
Chalem shared with his girlfriend and her 13-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Though investigators have not pinpointed a motive or suspects,  
Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye said the attack likely was at 
least partly tied to the pair's penny stock Web operation, 
www.stockinvestor.com, or other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was probably related to the victims' business activities,''  
Kaye said, ``and the killer or killers feared something else more 
than the loss of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission last year charged Lehmann  
and other defendants with distributing false information about 
companies after Electro Optical System Corp. stock rose from 50 
cents to more than $5 per share in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors eventually lost at least $10 million in that scheme,  
authorities have said. Lehmann agreed in January to pay $630,000 in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1996, Chalem worked at the brokerage A.S.  
Goldman, which was indicted in July in New York on charges 
connected with stock manipulation, forgery and illegal trading. The 
firm has denied the accusations, and Chalem was not named in those 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's Web site used mass e-mails to promote penny stocks to  
prospective investors. In exchange, the partners received 
commissions or discounted stock from securities firms. The Web site 
was registered in Panama and managed in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penny'' or ``micro-cap'' stocks are cheap, highly speculative  
securities that are vulnerable to investor manipulation. 
Authorities suspect the victims' Web site was based overseas to 
avoid SEC scrutiny. Kaye called the men's business practices 
``shady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe at least two gunmen attacked the men late  
Monday while they were reviewing business papers in the $1.1 
million home. Chalem and Lehmann were first crippled by the 
gunfire, then shot point-blank in their heads, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem was shot once in the chest and five times in the head,  
while Lehmann, of Woodmere, N.Y., was shot in the leg and once in 
the back of the head, Kaye said. Their cellular telephones were 
inches from their hands, and they were still ringing on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still calling these people, and we're answering the  
phone,'' Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	The home's wrought-iron gates were open and its front door  
unlocked, but there were no signs of burglary, Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye said the ex-husband of Chalem's girlfriend has been  
eliminated as a suspect and there are few leads, no suspects and no 
murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem had lived on the 16-acre property for up to eight months  
with his girlfriend. Her father owns the home in this small, 
wealthy community about an hour from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The friends who found the bodies said that Chalem had planned to  
drive to Tennessee and then charter a plane to Florida to meet his 
girlfriend, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The friends told authorities they had talked with both Chalem  
and Lehmann throughout the day on Monday, then could not reach them 
later that night.

<HEADLINE> Giant Casino Opens in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- More than seven years after lawmakers  
approved the idea, gamblers finally got their chance at the slot 
machines and table games at Harrah's 100,000-square-foot casino 
near the French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippi, watch out! Las Vegas, watch out! Atlantic City,  
watch out! Harrah's New Orleans is here to stay,'' Mayor Marc 
Morial told about 500 people Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's largest casino has 2,900 slot machines along with  
120 table games in five New Orleans-themed and decorated rooms. 
Gambling in the Big Easy so far has been an industry 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's temporary casino opened and closed in about six months  
in 1995 after attracting only a third of its projected revenue, 
followed by three years of bankruptcy reorganization. In the 
meantime, the nearby Mississippi coast developed a thriving 
gambling destination market with casino resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Three riverboat casinos -- which are heavily dependent upon local  
gamblers -- operate in the New Orleans area and analysts said 
Harrah's success likely depends upon its ability to tap into the 
tourist-laden French Quarter and the city's enormous convention 
business. The city plays host to about 11 million visitors 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Harrah's recently said it expects about 45 percent of the  
gamblers to be locals, providing about 30 percent of its revenue. 
And the casino faces an ominous $100 million annual tax to the 
state -- no matter how little it makes. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's has cut deals with hotels in the area to set aside  
rooms for gamblers, and deals with some New Orleans restaurants to 
``comp out'' meals for bettors. The casino is restricted by state 
law to a 250-seat onsite buffet and five standup dining spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino employs about 2,500 full-time and 300 part-time  
workers. Touted in the early 1990s as a major economic development 
tool for the city, city officials have been relatively quiet about 
the grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really looking forward to this,'' said Doris Wong of New  
Orleans, who has been frequenting area riverboats. ``It's really in 
the back yard now.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Investigates No Gun Ri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. Army investigative team came to  
South Korea on Thursday to consult with officials and meet 
survivors of an alleged assault on civilians by American soldiers 
during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight U.S. investigators, headed by the Army's inspector  
general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, will meet with their South 
Korean counterparts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will then fly to Yongdong, 100 miles southeast of  
Seoul, and talk to five South Koreans who say they survived an 
attack by U.S. soldiers at the nearby hamlet of No Gun RI in July 
1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will mark the start of the field investigation and  
information-sharing that Defense Secretary William Cohen promised 
President Kim Dae-jung in an Oct. 8 letter. Cohen told Kim the U.S. 
investigation would seek to uncover the truth ``no matter where it 
leads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 30, The Associated Press reported accounts by American  
veterans and South Korean villagers that U.S. soldiers killed up to 
400 civilians at No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	Before publication of the AP accounts, U.S. officials had told  
South Koreans seeking acknowledgment of the killings and 
compensation that they had found no evidence of a massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. investigators will return to Washington on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> World Series Ratings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television ratings for the World Series  
increased 14 percent but were still the second-lowest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' four-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves on  
NBC got a 16.0 national rating and a 26 share, up from a 14.1 
rating and 24 share for the Yankees' sweep of the San Diego Padres 
last year on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Before last year, the low had been a 16.4 rating for the 1989  
earthquake-interrupted World Series between the San Francisco 
Giants and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's 4-1 victory in Wednesday night's Game 4 got a 17.8  
rating, up 7 percent from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC estimates that more than 63 million people watched Game 4,  
which was the second-highest rated World Series game in three 
years. Game 7 of the 1997 Series between the Florida Marlins and 
Cleveland Indians had a 24.5 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Game 1 had a 14.2-26, up 15 percent from last season.  
Game 2, on Sunday night, posted a 15.0-23, up 19 percent from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC posted a 16.8-27 for Tuesday night's Game 3, up 9 percent  
from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol said that the network still  
made money, even though it was a four-game Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the National League championship series went so well,  
there wasn't the final pressure like in the past,'' Ebersol said. 
``We made a little bit of money. ... Not a real big profit, 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NLCS went six games and had two extra-inning games, which  
resulted in additional advertising dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households in the  
nation tuned to a program. Each ratings point represents about 1 
million households. Share represents the percentage of sets tuned 
to the show.

<HEADLINE>  Woods Hits Rock, Gets 'Stinger'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tiger Woods hit through a baseball-sized rock and  
suffered a stinger Thursday in the Tour Championship, which a 
physical therapist said would cause stiffness through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods said it would not force him to withdraw.  
</P>
<P>
	``No worries,'' the world's No. 1 player said. ``I'll be all  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may not have been the smartest play for Woods. Trailing by  
one stroke with five holes left in the 27-hole round, Woods' tee 
shot on No. 15 came to rest next to a tree, with a big rock right 
in front of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said moving the rock would have caused the ball to move, a  
one-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I took two club lengths (a one-stroke penalty), I would  
still be in the rough, the tree in my line. A bogey would be a good 
number,'' he said. ``If I could somehow get the ball back out in 
the fairway ... which is what I tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smashing through the rock with a wedge, the chain-reaction  
caused the ball to advance sideways about 25 yards, still in the 
rough. Woods hit his third shot to about 20 feet and two-putted for 
par. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Simpson, a physical therapist in the fitness trailer, said  
it was a brachial plexsus traction injury -- also known as a 
stinger, which is compounded by a neck strain. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Woods would be treated over the next two days with  
motion exercises and ice treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was at 6-under 100, one stroke back of Davis Love III.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, Woods was 1-under over the last three holes,  
wincing after every iron shot. He hit his last one to about four 
feet for birdie on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are times when you just have to accept the shot and know  
it is going to hurt,'' he said. ``Go ahead and hit, and at least 
make it count. It's like being a wide receiver going up the middle. 
You know the guy is going to lay you out, but at least catch the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won six times on the PGA Tour this year, the most  
since Tom Watson in 1980. He leads the money list with over $4.7 
million.

<HEADLINE> Philly Cops Probe Possible Mob Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The killing of a reputed mobster whose  
naked, decomposing body was found in the trunk of his wife's car 
may demonstrate turmoil within a Philadelphia crime family running 
scared over possible turncoats, police and mob experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This murder is another example of the insecurity these men  
have,'' said mob criminologist and historian Celeste Morello. 
``This is a show of power. There are probably a million dumping 
grounds in Philadelphia if you want to cover up the murder. They 
wanted it to be found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The body of Ron Turchi, 61, once third in command of the  
Philadelphia mob, was found Tuesday night with his hands tied 
behind his back, multiple gunshot wounds to his head and neck and a 
clear plastic bag covering his face, police said. No suspects have 
been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the mob's reputed former boss, Ralph Natale, agreed  
to cooperate with federal authorities after he was charged with 
running a methamphetamine distribution ring. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement made him the highest-ranking American mafia figure  
to flip sides, said Fred Martens, a former executive director of 
the now-defunct Pennsylvania Crime Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the mob has fallen into disarray, with Natale  
believed to be providing information on drug dealing, murders and 
political corruption in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are trying to determine whether Turchi was  
silenced to prevent him from verifying Natale's information, said 
police Capt. James Brady. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows the tremendous turmoil of the Philadelphia family,''  
Martens said. ``Once you have a boss cooperating, everybody becomes 
a potential source for information. It's basically preventive 
medicine.''

<HEADLINE> Blair Witch Town Embraces Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURKITTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The Blair Witch believers are back,  
just in time for Halloween. And this time, Burkittsville is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, curiosity seekers overran the startled western  
Maryland hamlet where the hit hoax horror film, ``The Blair Witch 
Project,'' is set. They snatched road and cemetery signs and 
vandalized tombstones, prompting a beefed-up police presence in the 
quiet farming community. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkittsville has since wised up -- and cashed in.  
</P>
<P>
	With the movie's recent release on home video and Halloween this  
weekend, many of the 214 townsfolk are embracing -- rather than 
bracing for -- another wave of what local artist Trude Head calls 
``the Blair Witch virus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roll into town on the narrow road over densely wooded South  
Mountain and you'll see a hand-lettered cardboard sign, ``WITCH 
STUFF,'' on a telephone pole near Mrs. Head's 200-year-old yellow 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sidewalk display offers $7 versions of the rocks and  
stick-figure totems featured in the film, some crafted by Mrs. 
Head's granddaughter. A few dollars more buy a good-luck Blair 
Witch spell or a ``witch-chaser'' bag filled with smooth stones, 
garlic cloves and lavender sprigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's play,'' she said, smiling brightly. ``I'm doing very  
well, selling things to the people who want to have something from 
the witch town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Margaret Kennedy, a painter and gallery owner whose sales  
have zoomed since she started selling Blair Witch T-shirts and 
totems to tourists from around the world. Her photographer friend 
Warren Morrow doesn't even live in Burkittsville but he made some 
stick figures, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get a little cash from the movie,'' he said.  
``Why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up and down Main Street -- the only street, really -- the Blair  
Witch has become a cottage industry, supported by several Internet 
sites and a market that expanded with the movie's international 
release and video sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie purports to show the final days of three student  
filmmakers who vanish mysteriously while traipsing through the 
Black Hills Forest to make a documentary on the legendary witch of 
Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	After the movie's release this summer, Blair Witch fever ran so  
high here that residents found ready buyers for their back yard 
rocks and dirt from the local cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of weird, isn't it?'' said Linda Prior, a Burkittsville  
grandmother who was among the first to see the sales potential, 
selling sticks and stones on the online auction site eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing craze extends to an outfitter offering weekend  
``witch hikes'' on the nearby Appalachian Trail. A suburban 
Baltimore entrepreneur organizes Blair Witch camping trips -- not to 
Burkittsville but to a state park near Washington, 50 miles away, 
where most of the mock documentary was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is pleased by the exposure.  
</P>
<P>
	The town council considered canceling trick-or-treating because  
of the expected influx of strangers. They decided to keep the 
tradition and pay for extra police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair Witch-related patrols have consumed half of the town's  
$3,000 contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let these people control our lives,'' said  
Deborah Burgoyne, mother of a 5- and a 10-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, A.K. Cox, has been bothered by drive-by tourists  
with video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that makes any parent nervous,'' she said as a white  
van with Ontario plates cruised by, camcorder rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillie Morris said vandalism at an abandoned church outside town  
got so bad that she and others recently held a prayer service there 
``to try to take back what Satan is trying to destroy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few residents say they have seen the film, not even Mayor Joyce  
Brown, though she plans to buy the video for the town archives. 
</P>
<P>
	She was miffed about the movie at first -- the filmmakers didn't  
seek permission to film here -- and even considered conferring with 
officials in Amityville, N.Y., where tourists flocked after ``The 
Amityville Horror'' came out 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents like Brenda Rupli, who has lived near the village  
crossroads for 27 years, said visitors have spoiled the serenity of 
a town that once seemed lost in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt like this was my hideaway,'' she said. ``Now  
I don't feel like that any more.''

<HEADLINE> Execution Photos Make Site Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands -- if not millions  
-- of people around the world have logged onto the Florida Supreme 
Court's Web site to look at grisly color photos of the last killer 
executed in the state's electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos depict the bloody body and contorted face of Allen  
Lee ``Tiny'' Davis, who was put to death in July. The pictures were 
posted by the high court because they figured in a case in which 
the justices upheld the use of the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those who have gone online for a look -- particularly  
Europeans -- were appalled. A Frenchman sent a one-word piece of 
e-mail: ``Barbarians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When Europeans think of Florida, they think of Disney World,  
beaches and fiery electrocutions,'' said Michael Radelet, a 
sociologist at the University of Florida who has researched capital 
punishment and opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
	But many Americans seemed to approve of both the execution and  
the posting of the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The photos on this website are WONDERFUL!'' a woman from North  
Redington Beach, Fla., e-mailed the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who weighed about 350 pounds, was executed for the 1982  
murders of a pregnant woman and her two young daughters. He 
suffered a nosebleed just before the current was applied, and blood 
poured from behind the mask over his face, soaking his white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge ruled that the chair operated correctly and the state  
Supreme Court upheld that decision, 4-3. But Justice Leander Shaw 
wrote a blistering dissent, charging that Davis was ``brutally 
tortured to death.'' He also attached the three photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Like all decisions by the state Supreme Court, the Sept. 24  
opinion was posted on the court's Web site, at 
www.firn.edu/supct/deathwarrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed to explode into an international news story and it  
seems to re-explode every couple of weeks,'' court spokesman Craig 
Waters said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos were also sent to the U.S. Supreme Court, which on  
Tuesday agreed to consider the constitutionality of electrocution 
and suspended use of the electric chair. It is the first review of 
the electric chair by the nation's high court in more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The public can access the Web page through two servers. The  
smaller server has crashed several times and sometimes creeps 
along. The number of hits destroyed the program that counts 
visitors to the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably is in the millions, but there simply is no way of  
knowing,'' Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union of Florida, which oppose the death penalty, approved of the 
release of the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people might find them disgusting,'' he said, ``but that  
is what state-sponsored execution by electrocution is.''

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Mayor's Race Expensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- They've been airing television ads for  
weeks, and slinging mud for days. The amount of money they're 
spending looks fit for a governor's race or a U.S. Senate contest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sue Anne Gilroy and Bart Peterson are running for mayor of  
Indianapolis. Republican Gilroy would become the city's first 
female mayor, and Peterson would be the first Democrat to hold the 
office in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they've spent more than $4 million, making this the  
most expensive mayoral race in city history. Tuesday's election is 
also expected to be the closest in a generation. Polls have shown 
the two running within the margin of error, or close to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a sudden surge of fear with Republicans that they  
might lose City Hall, and a sudden hope on the part of Democrats 
that they can win it for the first time in 30 years,'' said Brian 
Vargus, director of the Indiana University Public Opinion 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say demographic shifts have weakened a once-strong  
Republican grip on city politics enabled by a 1970 expansion of 
Indianapolis' boundaries that brought more GOP voters within city 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' hopes for a victory have been raised because the past  
decade has seen the ranks of minority voters -- who tend to favor 
Democrats -- swell in the city, while Republicans have flocked to 
the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A former chief of staff to former Gov. Evan Bayh, Peterson has  
touted the link as proof of his fiscal conservatism and bipartisan 
approach to government. Among the points of his ``Peterson Plan'' 
are calls for downtown developers to be weaned from subsidies, and 
the addition of 200 ``community'' police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilroy has spent much of the campaign saying Peterson is for too  
many things. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opponent has a risky plan that would add dozens of new  
programs to city government,'' she says in a TV ad. ``That can only 
mean higher taxes. It's a blueprint for more expensive 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilroy, in her second term as secretary of state, has stressed  
her preference for smaller government, and has cut her office 
budget by 15 percent at a time when the rest of the state 
bureaucracy has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest heated up Tuesday, when Peterson criticized the  
``partisanship and negativity'' in the race and demanded Gilroy 
pull a critical television ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other candidates, Libertarian Andrew Horning and Our Party  
candidate John Gibson, have garnered about 5 percent in the polls. 
While well below the political fund-raising poverty line -- 
especially in this race -- they've added some choice one-liners on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been running the cheapest campaign since George  
Washington,'' Horning said.

<HEADLINE> Maternal Health Program Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Three U.N. agencies and the World Bank  
launched a joint plan Thursday to reduce the number of women in 
developing countries that die during pregnancy and childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the deaths of nearly 600,000 women each year due to  
complications from pregnancy and childbirth ``a continuing 
tragedy,'' the head of the World Health Organization said the four 
agencies were dedicated to seeing that all women have access to a 
skilled attendant and a functioning health system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to create a movement around the world that takes up  
the challenge of safe motherhood as a global concern,'' WHO 
Director-General Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint program, which also includes the U.N. Population Fund  
and the U.N. Children's Fund, is aimed at increasing the network of 
qualified midwifes in developing countries, preventing unwanted 
pregnancies, and improving the nutrition of mothers and children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Complications in pregnancy and childbirth, the vast majority  
of them treatable and preventable, are killing and disabling more 
women and girls of childbearing age than any other set of causes,'' 
UNICEF's Executive Director Carol Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
	For young children, the chances of surviving to their fifth  
birthday are cut in half if their mother dies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those statistics fall especially hard on the world's poorest  
countries, where 98 percent of the those deaths occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the approximately 133 million births each year worldwide, 50  
percent are unplanned and 50 percent are unattended by a qualified 
health worker, said Dr. Nafis Sadik, the Population Fund's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemorrhaging during labor was the most frequent cause of  
maternal death during childbirth, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Bank already has programs on maternal health in 80  
countries, including those training tens of thousands of midwives 
in Indonesia and Zimbabwe, said Eduardo Doryan, the World Bank's 
vice-president for human development.

<HEADLINE> Girlfriend Describes Shepard Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson  
plotted to pose as homosexuals and rob Matthew Shepard, and 
McKinney later acknowledged they had killed him, McKinney's 
then-girlfriend testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney claimed ``a gay guy had been hitting on him (in the  
bar),'' Kristen Price, 19, told jurors. ``They decided in the 
bathroom to pretend they were gay, get him in the truck and rob 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, McKinney, covered in blood, returned to their  
home and told her ``he had killed someone,'' she said. He went to a 
sink to wash off a wallet, two driver's licenses and a voter 
registration card. 
</P>
<P>
	She also testified that she didn't see any sign that McKinney  
had been using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony countered defense contentions that the robbery  
wasn't planned, and that McKinney went into a drunken, drug-induced 
rage after a sexual advance from Shepard triggered memories of a 
childhood homosexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, however, on Wednesday said he wasn't sure whether  
state law allowed McKinney's attorneys to use a so-called ``gay 
panic'' defense 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old gay University of Wyoming student was beaten and  
left to die on a fence in a remote area near Laramie on Oct. 7, 
1998. His death galvanized those seeking to expand the nation's 
hate-crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder,  
and could be sentenced to death if convicted. Henderson, 22, is 
serving two life sentences for murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, prosecutors played an hour-long tape-recording of  
McKinney in jail, where he confessed to hitting Shepard. He said he 
struck him after Shepard touched his leg. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his attitude toward gays, McKinney said, ``I  
really don't hate them but I don't like them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ms. Price's testimony, she said she didn't think McKinney was  
telling the truth about the killing -- ``He always exaggerated so 
much I didn't believe him'' -- and that Henderson later assured her 
``that Aaron was just exaggerating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ms. Price said she saw no sign McKinney had been using  
drugs, she also said she had often shared methamphetamines with him 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Chasity Pasley, a girlfriend of Henderson's,  
testified that she saw no indication of drug use by McKinney. Under 
cross-examination, she acknowledged she was not in McKinney's 
company continuously in the hours before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, Ms. Pasley said Henderson and McKinney got  
together in the hours after the beating ``so they could get their 
story straight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that they beat somebody up and he was tied,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	McKinney sat back in his chair at the defense table and smiled  
briefly when Ms. Pasley pointed to him. 
</P>
<P>
	When interviewed by police the day after the attack, Ms. Price  
initially stuck by a story the four friends had concocted, but when 
she learned Shepard was near death, she asked to change her 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pasley received up to two years in prison after pleading  
guilty to being an accessory to first-degree murder for helping 
hide bloody clothes. Ms. Price's trial on accessory charges is to 
begin Jan. 3.

<HEADLINE> Japan Suspends Cresvale Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's financial authorities ordered a two-month  
suspension Thursday on Martin A. Armstrong Jr.'s company in Tokyo 
following charges they were engaged in a $1 billion (113.8 billion 
yen) securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale International Ltd.'s Tokyo office was ordered to shut  
down all of its securities operations between Nov. 1 and Jan. 14, 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Government regulators had previously suspended Cresvale's  
securities operations between Oct. 4 and Oct. 24. The latest 
suspension was laid down after the Securities Exchange and 
Surveillance Commission, Japan's securities industry watchdog, 
recommended further punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a well-known Princeton, N.J.-based market forecaster,  
was arrested and indicted in the United States recently. He has 
pleaded innocent and is free on $5 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale executives are accused of giving kickbacks to Japanese  
companies and providing false information about investments. 
Cresvale marketed interest-bearing promissory notes to about 100 
Japanese companies, which the company now cannot repay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cresvale sold the notes, which were issued through Princeton  
Economics International Ltd. The money was invested by Armstrong, 
who had pledged to put the money in government bonds, but instead 
lost at least $500 million investing in risky futures and options.

<HEADLINE> Fair Housing Enforcement Seeked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates for the disabled asked Congress to  
reject legislation that would protect some builders from 
prosecution for unknowingly violating laws requiring them to make 
new housing more accessible to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies that broke the law by refusing to build accessible  
housing do not deserve a 'Get out of jail free' card,'' Christopher 
Anders, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But a North Carolina builder said he was in jeopardy of losing  
his business because the Justice Department cited him for violating 
a law he was unaware of. Len Tozer, a licensed general contractor 
from the Winterville, N.C., area, said once he found out about the 
law, he found he supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the guns of the U.S. Department of Justice aimed at me  
was very disturbing,'' Tozer told the House Judiciary Committee's 
panel on the Constitution on Thursday. ``I feel I have been treated 
unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are amendments to the federal Fair Housing Act enacted  
in 1988, which imposed minimum standards for the design of some 
apartment buildings, subcommittee Chairman Charles Canady, R-Fla., 
said. The amendments required that newly constructed multifamily 
housing have features that would make it accessible to people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Canady said the government didn't do enough to make sure that  
builders, architects and engineers knew about the changes. 
Consequently, builders who received building permits from local 
governments assumed they could begin building and remained unaware 
of additional requirements in federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, it has been the industry practice for  
architects and builders to rely on local building code authorities 
for assurances of legal compliance,'' Canady said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill introduced by Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., would exempt  
builders from prosecution if their buildings were designed for 
occupancy after March 13, 1991 -- the date on which the changes 
became effective -- but before the day the Jones bill would go into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify, a builder would have had to received a building  
permit or another type of approval from local building authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of concentrating its efforts on education and ensuring  
that these standards became part of building codes, the federal 
government has essentially paid bounties to nongovernmental 
organizations to find builders who are out of compliance with the 
law,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil  
rights, said he opposed the Jones bill, which was passed with the 
support of housing industry trade groups. ``The Fair Housing Act 
accessibility requirements for multifamily housing are very simple, 
basic and reasonable,'' he said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by the National Multi Housing Council, the  
American Seniors Housing Association and the National Apartment 
Association said the problem could be solved without legislation if 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development would step up 
efforts to education builders instead of stepping up enforcement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JEREZ, Spain (AP) -- Just two days after the death of U.S. Open  
champion Payne Stewart, European golf star Ian Woosnam had a scare 
in his own private plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail of London reported today that Woosnam's  
twin-engine plane began depressurizing Wednesday while the former 
Masters champion was flying in from his home in Britain's Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes into the flight, oxygen masks dropped down.  
Woosnam, two friends accompanying him and pilot Robin Richards 
grabbed them and put them on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bit scary. I don't want to make a big thing about it,  
especially after the tragedy of Payne, but it was a strange 
coincidence,'' Woosnam told the newspaper. ``We had just been 
talking about what happened to Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woosnam's pilot immediately dived to equalize outer and inner  
pressure on the plane, which had been at an altitude of 15,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pilot told us that a compression seal had gone and that  
everything was fine,'' Woosnam told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination of the plane revealed a fault in a compression  
seal, the newspaper said. A loss of cabin pressure is suspected as 
being a factor in the crash Monday of Stewart's plane. The golfer 
and five others were killed, 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have continued the flight at a lower level, but there  
were too many big mountains ahead and it would have been very 
bumpy,'' Woosnam said. ``So we returned to Jersey. After what 
happened to Payne, we did not want to take any chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woosnam flew in on another plane, then refused further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to talk about it,'' he said in the locker  
room of the Montecastillo Club before teeing off in the first round 
of the $1.6 million Volvo Masters.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had quite a day  
in her native city -- Bo Diddley serenaded her and she handed out $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday visited two landmarks -- Chess Records  
and a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house -- to help win support for 
the preservation and restoration of endangered landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
	At the studio, she tapped her feet to Diddley and other legends,  
including Chuck Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is going to be so jealous,'' Mrs. Clinton said.  
``To be with Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry -- national security or no 
matter whatever he had to do -- I'm sure he'd rather be here 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Wright's Frederick C. Robie House on the University of  
Chicago campus, Mrs. Clinton presented a $1 million gift from the 
Pritzker Foundation for the restoration of the architectural 
treasure.

<HEADLINE> DEBATE NOTEBOOK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Had any of the Republican candidates  
strayed across the street to Ben &AMP; Jerry's on Thursday, Vic Hall 
was ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours before the Republican debate, the ice cream shop  
manager pondered which flavors would best fit each candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sen. John McCain, he chose Chocolate Fudge Brownie,  
``because good ol' chocolate is fairly conservative, but you throw 
in the brownies for that little other side of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butter Pecan was his pick for publisher Steve Forbes. ``It has  
the most calories -- it's the richest ice cream,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes would get a scoop of nonfat Coffee Fudge, to go with  
what Hall considers a no-frills campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the more conservative they are, the more interested  
they might be in not spending too much money and making government 
smaller,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A flavor named after a comic strip character and featuring  
hazelnuts, pecans and almonds summed up his opinion of Utah Sen. 
Orrin Hatch: 
</P>
<P>
	``Dilbert's World -- Totally Nuts,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Strawberry for Gary Bauer, because ``it's fruity,'' Hall  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the one Republican candidate skipping the debate, Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush -- Hall went back to the basics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World's Best Vanilla,'' he said. ``I think he's pretty  
plain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He chose Triple Caramel Chunk for his favorite candidate,  
Democrat Bill Bradley, who debated against Al Gore on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's new, it's active, and it seems to have some depth to  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The field of Republican candidates is three times that of the  
Democrats, but the GOP created barely a buzz in this college town 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Bradley and Gore's sign-toting supporters had  
swarmed the campus by midmorning. But by late Thursday afternoon, 
there were no Republican supporters or signs in sight, aside from a 
lone Alan Keyes banner tacked up on a side street. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Hanover's 6,413 registered voters, 1,854 are Republicans,  
2,224 are Democrats, and 2,335 are independents. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Wheelock Travel on Main Street made a quick change in  
their storefront window Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, office manager Rhonda Summarsell plastered the  
window with Bradley and Gore signs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came into work and the Bradley people were everywhere, so it  
was easy to get a few signs,'' she said. The Gore signs came from 
the company's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	The scarcity of Republican signs forced Summarsell to be  
creative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of disappointed. I'm an independent, I like to see  
all of that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's window featured a homemade sign: ``Wheelock Travel  
Welcomes Presidential Candidates,'' flanked by flags and two 
stuffed animals, a donkey and an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The two days of debates gave Dartmouth College students a unique  
view of the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people grow up seeing candidates on TV shaking hands with  
people in New Hampshire,'' said Ivan Cestero, a junior from 
Tenafly, N.J., who was grabbing a bite to eat in the student 
center. ``Now, they're here. People really do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greta Hansen, a sophomore from Santa Cruz, Calif., finds the  
attention the first-in-the-nation primary state a bit odd. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really strange coming from California to see this small  
state is so powerful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But junior James Flahive from Westfield, Mass., defended the  
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It forces a kind of dialogue,'' he said. ``The candidates are  
forced to talk to the voters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of money the Dartmouth College United Way is trying  
to raise, according to a sign near the debate site: $173,906. 
</P>
<P>
	How much the group has raised so far: $20,000.  
</P>
<P>
	How much money the Republican candidates who attended the debate  
had raised in the first nine months of the year: $20.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	How much money Bush had raised: $57 million.

<HEADLINE>  Marilyn Monroe Dress Fetches $1.26 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The formfitting dress Marilyn Monroe wore to  
serenade President Kennedy with ``Happy Birthday'' 40 years ago is 
still making jaws drop, this time over the price it fetched at 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered Wednesday night when the hammer went down for  
the winning bid: $1.15 million from the Manhattan-based Gotta Have 
It! Collectibles. With the 15 percent commission to auction house 
Christie's, company co-owner Robert Schagrin paid $1.26 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The price is record for an item of clothing sold at auction,  
obliterating the $222,500 paid for an ink blue Princess Diana gown 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why he spent a small fortune, Schagrin said, ``Because it  
wasn't $3 million, which we thought it was worth. ... We stole 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flesh-colored, sequined stunner worn by Monroe during her  
breathless song on May 12, 1962, was the highest-priced item at the 
first session of a two-day auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The total take for 55 items auctioned Wednesday was $5.6  
million, Christie's said. The sale was to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding on the dress quickly escalated from $200,000 and  
culminated in a wild 2 1/2-minute showdown before the final price was 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Made of silk souffle gauze and covered with 6,000 rhinestone  
beads and sequins, the Jean Louis dress originally cost $12,000. 
There was no pre-sale estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers snapped up everything from Monroe's blue jeans and boots  
to screenplays, most at prices far beyond pre-sale predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The night's first big-ticket item -- a platinum eternity ring  
encrusted with 34 baguette-cut diamonds given to Monroe by 
ex-husband Joe DiMaggio -- sold for $772,500. The pre-sale estimate 
was $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Designer Tommy Hilfiger bought two lots, a pair of cowgirl boots  
Monroe wore in ``The Misfits,'' for $85,000, and three pairs of 
jeans from ``River of No Return,'' for $42,550. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm inspired by pop icons and by pop culture,'' Hilfiger said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tony Curtis, Monroe's co-star in ``Some Like It Hot,'' sat in  
the front row and reminisced about Monroe after the sale. Actress 
Demi Moore was in a booth upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	A provocative scarlet silk halter dress, worn by Monroe in  
publicity photos for ``Let's Make Love,'' sold for $167,500, as did 
a sweater worn by Monroe for a series of 1962 beach photos. The 
buyer was Ripley's Believe it or Not. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe died in 1962 of an overdose of sleeping pills at 36. She  
left all her belongings to her acting coach, method acting guru Lee 
Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, is selling the items. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction was broadcast live on the American Movie Classics  
channel and on the Web via Internet portal Excite.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Governor: Cuba Visit a Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Illinois Gov. George Ryan is touting his five-day  
mission to Cuba as a successful step toward better relations, 
despite Clinton administration criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, who returned Wednesday, said ``the groundwork has been  
laid'' for ending the trade embargo imposed by the United States in 
1962 to punish the communist regime of Fidel Castro. Ryan, a 
Republican, is a staunch opponent of the trade ban. 
</P>
<P>
	His meeting with Castro began Tuesday evening and lasted into  
the early hours on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials criticized the trip, the first  
visit by a U.S. governor since the 1959 revolution that brought 
Castro to power. State Department spokesman James Rubin said that 
visiting the Cuban leader should be avoided ``to not give the 
impression that anyone supports the oppression that he has visited 
on his people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he was surprised by Rubin's comments and had received  
no previous State Department opposition to a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he ``never forgot for a second'' that Castro  
was head of a communist dictatorship, and said the trip -- which 
also brought $1 million in humanitarian aid -- embodied ``what 
America is really all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the University of Havana on Wednesday morning  
with Castro looking on, Ryan said he had come to Cuba ``to build 
bridges.'' He said his delegation of government and business 
leaders was leaving ``with the knowledge that those bridges are 
firmly in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raudel Medina Alfonso, an ailing 7-year-old Cuban boy, was  
allowed to return with the group. The child suffers from portal 
hypertension, a potentially fatal disease that produces high 
pressure in blood flowing from several organs to the liver. Cuban 
doctors don't have the facilities to treat him. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation's return flight also included the boy's mother,  
Idalmis Alfonso, 32. The boy's father, Raul Medina, 51, said he was 
grateful for the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't seem too bad now, but if the condition is not taken  
care of he can have complications in the future,'' said Medina, who 
remained in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy spent Wednesday night in Chicago, and will be brought to  
UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, N.C., for surgery, UNC Health Care 
officials said. The hospital and doctors say they will waive their 
fees.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic May Face New Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic may  
face more criminal charges, including genocide, in connection with 
the bloody crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the chief 
prosecutor of the international war crimes tribunal said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla del Ponte told reporters that the tribunal, based in The  
Hague, Netherlands was considering additional charges that included 
``offenses committed in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as 
offenses committed in Kosovo during 1998, including the charge of 
genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic and several lieutenants have already been indicted for  
war crimes allegedly committed in 18 months of violence against 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic has never been charged with offenses committed  
during wars elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, such as Croatia and 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribunal investigators have been in Kosovo gathering evidence  
for the cases since June 12, when NATO sent in peacekeepers after a 
78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Ponte, a former Swiss federal prosecutor, was on her first  
visit to the Balkans since she was named to replace Canadian judge 
Louise Arbour last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, NATO and the United Nations promised to find the  
ethnic Albanians who stormed a convoy of 155 Serbs leaving Kosovo 
on Wednesday. The attackers set fire to 19 vehicles and forced 
dozens to hide in an Italian military garrison. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacekeepers said Thursday that 18 of the 34 Serbs in the convoy  
were injured, but that all the Serbs eventually reached Montenegro 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on Thursday, French and Belgian peacekeepers used tear  
gas and bulldozers to remove a Serb roadblock in Lesak, 23 miles 
north of Kosovska Mitrovica. A few people were injured, NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred Serbs had blocked the road with tree trunks,  
cars and buses, and demanded NATO find two Serbs that disappeared 
Tuesday after going to work in Kosovoska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Montenegro's parliament in Belgrade seemed to take  
another step toward independence by adopting a new citizenship law 
that defines Montenegro as distinct from Serbia and the federal 
state, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Montenegro has not had a separate citizenship measure since  
1918, when it gave up its independence in favor of a union with 
Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia -- the precursor to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Prada Sweeps America's Cup Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- With its mast damaged in a morning  
race, AmericaOne struggled with only a headsail raised against 
Young America before finally withdrawing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The win put Young America behind Italy's Prada in the first  
round of the challenger races for sailing's America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Prada finished the round-robin with a 10-0 record. AmericaOne  
lost only to Young America and Prada, while Young America was 
defeated by Prada and Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne bowman Curtis Blewitt clung precariously to the top  
of the mast, trying to make repairs as the boat rocked violently in 
choppy seas and heavy rain. Trailing by more than 1.8 miles, 
AmericaOne gave up, giving Young America the win. 
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne's Paul Cayard said he asked officials to delay the  
start so repairs could be made, but wasn't complaining that the 
postponement wasn't granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has come time to show up at the starting line ready to  
sail,'' Cayard said. ``If you have damage and you break down, you 
are probably not ready to race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11 syndicates from seven countries will now begin  
reconfiguring their boats for the second round-robin in the regatta 
to decide who will take on defender New Zealand for the America's 
Cup next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Delays and controversial rulings were common during the first  
round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing was due to end last Saturday, but officials altered the  
race schedule to give AmericaOne time to make repairs after a 
collision with Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision angered some teams, which wanted a quick finish to  
the round-robin so they could work on their boats for the more 
important second group of races. 
</P>
<P>
	When they resumed Wednesday, racing was thrown into disarray  
when the race director postponed the morning's races, then ordered 
teams to do a quick turnaround and begin their afternoon races. 
</P>
<P>
	Two boats protested, claiming they did not have time to carry  
out repairs needed after the first races. The official jury voided 
the results of two races, including Prada's first victory over 
Abracadabra. They were rerun Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning boats earned one point per victory in the first  
round-robin, four points for victory in the second, and nine for 
winning in the third round-robin. A final series will decide the 
challenger for the America's Cup regatta starting in February 2000.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Gains Aid European Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stock markets closed higher Thursday led  
by the financial service, banking and insurance industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth was spurred by the rally in the U.S. equity and bond  
markets, which rose after key growth and wage data eased inflation 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 600 European companies rose 4.23  
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 312.05, with the financial 
services index up 3.2 percent, the bank index up 2.3 percent and 
the insurance index up 2.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest decliner was the construction index, which fell 1.7  
percent. The drop was sparked by Blue Circle Industries, the 
British building materials group, which saw its shares fall 66.5 
pence to 269.5 pence after it issued a profit warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 5.61 points at 
329.30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 80.68 points to 3866.75,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 74.52 points at 3839.94. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE 100 index rose 1.7 percent, to 6149.1. HSBC  
Holdings was one of the best-performing blue-chip shares, up 49.5 
pence, or 7.2 percent, to 735.5 pence. Other top performers were 
Woolwich, up 21.5 pence to 357.25 pence, and Standard Chartered, up 
32.5 pence to 807 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Paris, shares of Banque Nationale de Paris, Total Fina and  
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute were in demand after Stoxx Ltd. said 
these three stocks will be included in its European indexes 
starting Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP shares gained 3.65 euros to close at 80.65 euros. Total Fina  
jumped 5.60 euros to finish at 131.0 euros, while shares in retail 
group Pinault-Printemps-Redoute ended up 3.65 euros to 80.65 euros. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC-40 index was 1.1 percent higher to 4,748.42,  
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2.1 percent to 5,748.89, Milan's 
MIBtel index rose 1.9 percent to 32,860, and Amsterdam's AEX Index 
jumped 2.9 percent to 568.14.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Remembered at Texas Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In a chilling start to the Tour Championship, a  
lone bagpiper marching through the fog played ``Going Home'' today 
as players gathered on the first tee of the Champions Golf Club to 
remember U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he died on Monday, a big part of us died, too,'' said Tom  
Lehman, who offered a prayer after a brief service that left 
everyone somber and most in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 minutes after the service, Duffy Waldorf teed off on  
No. 10 by himself in what will be a tournament like no other. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every one was convinced the tour should have proceeded with  
the $5 million Tour Championship for the top 30 on the money list. 
But PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and Davis Love III were among 
those who said it could be a platform to honor Stewart's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a winner of 18 tournaments around the world and three  
major championships, was as traditional as golf with his knickers 
and tam o'shanter cap. The scene at his memorial service likewise 
took on the very nature of golf's roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrouded by an eerie fog, the bagpiper walked 100 yards toward  
the first tee playing a song about a Scotsman finally returning to 
his homeland. Among those not in the field who came to the service 
were Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw, Steve Elkington and Doug 
Sanders, who like Stewart was renowned for his colorful attire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
on Monday took from us one of our great champions,'' Finchem said. 
``Payne Stewart was a great champion, a tenacious competitor -- no 
better example than the U.S. Open -- and a real showman. Payne 
represented the best of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important not to lose sight of the most important thing  
about Payne Stewart. He was a man of great faith, a devoted, 
compassionate and most energetic husband and father, and a man of 
tremendous generosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service was short and simple, but long on emotion.  
</P>
<P>
	While not every player in the field gathered around the first  
tee, those who did had their heads bowed or stared vacantly as 
Lehman spoke about Stewart. Lehman then offered a prayer, asking 
for comfort for Stewart's wife and two children, and the families 
of the other five victims in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very emotional guy,'' Lehman said. ``He loved to  
laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not going to be ashamed of 
my tears this morning, and neither should you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He paused often to speak clearly through the tears.  
</P>
<P>
	After a moment of silence, the bagpiper, Steve Agan of Houston,  
played ``Amazing Grace.'' He then turned his back on the players 
and blew into the pipes once more, playing ``Going Home'' as he 
walked down the first fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the fog was beginning to lift.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican, US Officials To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello's chief of  
staff will come to the Pentagon on Monday to reopen talks regarding 
the Navy's use of a bombing range on the Puerto Rican island of 
Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday the Rossello  
aide, Angel Morey, will meet with Rudy deLeon, the undersecretary 
of defense for personnel, to discuss a presidential panel's 
recommendation that the Navy resume limited live-fire training on 
Vieques but leave within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Training on Vieques was halted after a civilian guard on the  
range was killed in a bombing accident April 19. The Navy says it 
must resume training soon, however, to prepare the USS Eisenhower 
battle group before it begins a six-month deployment overseas in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossello insists there be no further live-fire training and that  
the range be returned to civilian use only. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy contends there is no adequate alternative site for such  
training, and the presidential panel supported that conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute has taken on deeper political overtones recently.  
Last week, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, considering a run for 
a Senate seat from New York, publicly called for the Navy to stop 
using the bombing range immediately -- a position at odds with that 
of the commission President Clinton appointed to study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, and the four service chiefs might travel to San 
Juan to discuss the matter with Puerto Rican officials. A decision 
on that would depend on the outcome of Monday's talks, he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar; Dow Ends Up 227.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By EILEEN GLANTON    	
</P>
<P>
                         *AP Business Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A benign report on labor costs sparked a  
broad-based rally on Wall Street Thursday as investors who had 
abandoned stocks jumped back into the market, believing once again 
that inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.64 to 10,622.53,  
extending Wednesday's 92-point gain. It was the Dow's biggest 
advance since it rose 235.24 on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 45.73 to 1,342.44, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 72.70 to 2,875.22. Still, some analysts 
believed the wave of buying was an extreme reaction to fairly 
modest government data. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was looking for an excuse to go up,'' said Bernie  
Schaeffer, chairman of Schaeffer's Investment Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its  
employment cost index rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter, 
slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many economists were 
expecting. Economists view the index as a significant barometer of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the third 
time this year in its continuing effort to ward off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the employment cost index might not deter the Fed  
from implementing another rate hike when its policy-writing Open 
Market Committee meets Nov. 16, but they believed the next increase 
could be the last for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not closed, of course,'' said Michael Moran,  
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, noting that the Fed 
will also carefully monitor next week's employment report for 
October. ``But inflation pressures are not problematic at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose for a second straight session, pushing the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.25 percent from 6.33 
percent late Wednesday. Stocks drew some additional support from 
the retreat in bond yields, which earlier this month rose high 
enough to lure some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The promise of stabilizing interest rates boosted bank stocks  
for a second straight session. Citigroup rose 3 to 54 1/8, and 
American Express soared 10 3/8 to 161. Chase Manhattan rose 5 13/16 to 
88 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks are especially sensitive to rising rates because higher  
rates can discouarge customers from borrowing money, cutting into 
lending volume. Also, higher rates can reduce the value of a 
financial firm's fixed holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the  
exclusion of a strong report on the nation's gross domestic 
product. The government said the U.S. economy expanded at an annual 
rate of 4.8 percent from July through September, the fastest pace 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On a less optimistic day, the GDP report could have prompted  
selling, analysts said. But the employment cost index prevailed in 
shaping investor sentiment, calming an uneasy market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a sense that whatever the Fed does, once we  
get it out of the way, the market can move higher,'' Schaeffer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com fell 4 15/16 to 71. The online  
retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results 
topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as 
the company spent heavily to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom rose 6 1/16 to 83 5/8 after saying third-quarter  
operating profits nearly tripled from the same period in 1998. The 
telecommunications company earned $1.09 billion, or 55 cents per 
share, beating analysts' expectations of 54 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 1.12 billion 
shares, compared with 894.40 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.04 to 422.81.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent. The  
rally on Wall Street boosted European markets, lifting Germany's 
DAX index 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 index 1.7 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 index 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Profit Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom's profit fell 19 percent  
in the first nine months of the year, and the company blamed a 
price war in Germany's telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Net profit fell to 1.25 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, from  
1.55 billion euros a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit 
decline of about 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Group sales fell 3 percent to 25.5 billion euros, or $26.8  
billion, down from 26.25 billion euros last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom noted the revenue decline was not as steep as during the  
first half of the year, when it fell 5 percent, and said it was 
able to add to its share of the fixed-line telephone market 
``despite more intense competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it said the increased revenues in growth areas such as  
mobile communications were insufficient to compensate for enormous 
price cuts, especially for international long-distance calls, in 
its main fixed-line business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be remembered that the considerable tariff cuts made  
in the course of the year, which will save customers approximately 
3 billion euros ($3.15 billion) over the full year, contributed to 
this decrease in revenue,'' Deutsche Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, Deutsche Telekom said the British mobile phone  
company it recently acquired, One2One, should boost its 
fourth-quarter revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	It reiterated its intention to sell its 10 percent stake in  
Sprint Corp. following the U.S.-based company's takeover by MCI 
Worldcom. Deutsche Telekom said the stake is worth $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom shares were down 1.5 percent in early trading  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Blair Witch Town Embraces Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURKITTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The Blair Witch believers are back,  
just in time for Halloween. And this time, Burkittsville is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, curiosity seekers overran the startled western  
Maryland hamlet where the hit hoax horror film, ``The Blair Witch 
Project,'' is set. They snatched road and cemetery signs and 
vandalized tombstones, prompting a beefed-up police presence in the 
quiet farming community. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkittsville has since wised up -- and cashed in.  
</P>
<P>
	With the movie's recent release on home video and Halloween this  
weekend, many of the 214 townsfolk are embracing -- rather than 
bracing for -- another wave of what local artist Trude Head calls 
``the Blair Witch virus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roll into town on the narrow road over densely wooded South  
Mountain and you'll see a hand-lettered cardboard sign, ``WITCH 
STUFF,'' on a telephone pole near Mrs. Head's 200-year-old yellow 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sidewalk display offers $7 versions of the rocks and  
stick-figure totems featured in the film, some crafted by Mrs. 
Head's granddaughter. A few dollars more buy a good-luck Blair 
Witch spell or a ``witch-chaser'' bag filled with smooth stones, 
garlic cloves and lavender sprigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's play,'' she said, smiling brightly. ``I'm doing very  
well, selling things to the people who want to have something from 
the witch town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Margaret Kennedy, a painter and gallery owner whose sales  
have zoomed since she started selling Blair Witch T-shirts and 
totems to tourists from around the world. Her photographer friend 
Warren Morrow doesn't even live in Burkittsville but he made some 
stick figures, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get a little cash from the movie,'' he said.  
``Why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up and down Main Street -- the only street, really -- the Blair  
Witch has become a cottage industry, supported by several Internet 
sites and a market that expanded with the movie's international 
release and video sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie purports to show the final days of three student  
filmmakers who vanish mysteriously while traipsing through the 
Black Hills Forest to make a documentary on the legendary witch of 
Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	After the movie's release this summer, Blair Witch fever ran so  
high here that residents found ready buyers for their back yard 
rocks and dirt from the local cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of weird, isn't it?'' said Linda Prior, a Burkittsville  
grandmother who was among the first to see the sales potential, 
selling sticks and stones on the online auction site eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing craze extends to an outfitter offering weekend  
``witch hikes'' on the nearby Appalachian Trail. A suburban 
Baltimore entrepreneur organizes Blair Witch camping trips -- not to 
Burkittsville but to a state park near Washington, 50 miles away, 
where most of the mock documentary was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is pleased by the exposure.  
</P>
<P>
	The town council considered canceling trick-or-treating because  
of the expected influx of strangers. They decided to keep the 
tradition and pay for extra police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair Witch-related patrols have consumed half of the town's  
$3,000 contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let these people control our lives,'' said  
Deborah Burgoyne, mother of a 5- and a 10-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, A.K. Cox, has been bothered by drive-by tourists  
with video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that makes any parent nervous,'' she said as a white  
van with Ontario plates cruised by, camcorder rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillie Morris said vandalism at an abandoned church outside town  
got so bad that she and others recently held a prayer service there 
``to try to take back what Satan is trying to destroy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few residents say they have seen the film, not even Mayor Joyce  
Brown, though she plans to buy the video for the town archives. 
</P>
<P>
	She was miffed about the movie at first -- the filmmakers didn't  
seek permission to film here -- and even considered conferring with 
officials in Amityville, N.Y., where tourists flocked after ``The 
Amityville Horror'' came out 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents like Brenda Rupli, who has lived near the village  
crossroads for 27 years, said visitors have spoiled the serenity of 
a town that once seemed lost in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt like this was my hideaway,'' she said. ``Now  
I don't feel like that any more.''

<HEADLINE> AWOL Marine Arrested for Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A Camp Pendleton Marine suspected in a series  
of bank robberies was arrested as he arrived at a bus station in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	An anonymous caller phoned the FBI in Portland, Ore., to alert  
agents that Nicholas Paul Hills was headed to a downtown Greyhound 
station. Hills, from Juneau, Wis., was arrested Wednesday, said FBI 
spokesman Gordon Compton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hills, 21, and fellow Marine Benjamin Michael Johns of Colorado  
Springs, Colo., are suspected of robbing banks in California, 
Oregon and Washington. Both went absent without leave, fleeing 
Southern California in August after authorities identified them as

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Await Tickertape Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- By the end, even the Atlanta Braves were  
applauding the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones chuckled as he watched closer Mariano Rivera break  
three of Ryan Klesko's bats in the last inning of the World Series 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox found counterpart Joe Torre and congratulated  
him in a stadium tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	And John Smoltz personally complimented batting coach Chris  
Chambliss on New York's patience at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people love to hate the Yankees -- they're that  
good,'' Smoltz said Wednesday night. ``We would love to be hated 
like they are. They were absolutely perfect. The Yankees are a 
model of how to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What else was there to say? Not much as New York and the Yankees  
braced for their third tickertape parade in four years Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always felt it was too good to be true,'' Torre said  
Thursday as he joined Clemens and others for a television 
appearance with David Letterman. ``And then to have it finish the 
way it did, it was wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As confetti fluttered down on Yankee Stadium and Frank Sinatra's  
``New York, New York'' echoed on the sound system, a century of 
baseball left fans with a final, fitting image: one of the game's 
greatest pitchers wearing the pinstripes of its greatest team in 
the most storied ballpark of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens validated his greatness by beating the Braves 4-1 in  
Game 4, and the Yankees did the same in becoming the first club in 
60 years to sweep successive Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees tied the mark set by their Murderers' Row clubs by  
winning their 12th Series game in a row and captured their record 
25th championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we had the best team in the world and we came out and  
showed that here,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after reveling in the clubhouse, the Yankees took off for  
a party at the Oak Room at the Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter hit .353 against the Braves and extended his postseason  
hitting streak to a record-tying 17 games. At just 25, won his 
third ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens earned his first taste of the title at 37 -- the same age  
John Elway was when he won his first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged-up on the mound but able to keep his pitches down, the  
five-time Cy Young winner threw shutout ball into the eighth 
inning. Clemens then watched from the dugout as Rivera closed out 
the title and earned the Series MVP award. The reliever gave his 
signed spikes to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``This must be what it's like to be a Yankee,'' Clemens said.  
</P>
<P>
	Torre told him later: ``This is what you came here for.''  
</P>
<P>
	Traded from Toronto to the Yankees in spring training, Clemens  
spent the whole season trying to prove himself to his new teammates 
and fans. He struggled, going 14-10 with a 4.60 ERA, and was 
occasionally booed in his own ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was all forgotten on his shining night. He began the  
evening by patting the Babe Ruth monument beyond the bullpen and 
walked off the mound to an enormous ovation, raising both arms to 
acknowledge the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, while other Yankees celebrated with champagne in the  
clubhouse, Clemens climbed onto the dugout roof and ran back and 
forth, slapping hands with everyone he could reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees became baseball's first repeat champion since  
Toronto in 1992-93 and posted the first set of consecutive Series 
sweeps since the Yankees in 1938-39. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off last year's record 125-win season and sweep of San  
Diego, New York finished off a streak in which it won 18 of 19 
postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
	The year began when Darryl Strawberry was beset by health and  
legal problems. Then came Torre's prostate cancer, and the deaths 
of Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio and Catfish Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brosius' father died late in the season. Luis Sojo's  
father passed away right before the World Series began and Paul 
O'Neill's father died a few hours after Game 3 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your dad got to see this one,'' Torre told O'Neill after the  
sweep. ``He'd been so sick in the hospital, he hadn't been able to 
watch the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, at 36, figures to be back next season, provided the  
Yankees exercise the $6.5 million option on his contract. But New 
York must make decisions on several potential free agents: 
36-year-old pitcher David Cone, relievers Mike Stanton and Allen 
Watson, catcher Joe Girardi, Strawberry and backups Jim Leyritz and 
Sojo. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Braves, their record-tying eighth straight Series loss  
left them with little to show for their eight consecutive trips to 
the NL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	They beat Cleveland to win it all in 1995 -- prompting them to  
engrave ``Team of the 90s'' on their rings -- but also became the 
first club to lose four World Series in a decade since the New York 
Giants of 1910-19. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, which gets back injured first baseman Andres Galarraga  
and catcher Javy Lopez next year, also has some choices to make. 
The Braves hold an option on Jones, and will likely try to work out 
a long-term deal. Possible free agents include shortstop Jose 
Hernandez, first baseman Brian Hunter, outfielder Gerald Williams, 
pitchers Russ Springer and Rudy Seanez and backups Otis Nixon and 
Greg Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost to the best team, simply put,'' Smoltz said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Skips Debate for Wife's Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP)-- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday that he  
skipped a debate in New Hampshire because ``I love my wife'' and 
wanted to be at her side when she received an award at Southern 
Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New  
Hampshire will recognize that,'' Bush said in an interview on 
WMUR-TV, which was co-sponsoring the debate with CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Laura, was with him.  
</P>
<P>
	The governor stressed that he was not taking New Hampshire for  
granted and that he would be campaigning there next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``At every stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for  
America and it seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept 
my vision and want me to be the nominee,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush was being honored by SMU, along with three others, as  
a distinguished alumna. 
</P>
<P>
	She is founder and honorary chairwoman of the Texas Book  
Festival, a gathering of Texas authors and book lovers that has 
raised nearly $600,000 for the state's public libraries. She also 
promotes women's health through the Governor's Spouse Program of 
the National Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Bush made his first campaign swing through  
North Dakota, where he was endorsed by Gov. Ed Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the label `compassionate conservative,''' Bush told  
a crowd of more than 700 at a Greater North Dakota Association 
meeting in Fargo. ``I want compassionate minds to match our 
conservative ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The audience cheered at Bush's promise that his presidency would  
``rally the armies of compassion'' to fix shortcomings in education 
and welfare policies, and be an ``era of responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us must understand that we are responsible for our  
decisions in life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference later, Bush touched on a variety of issues:  
</P>
<P>
	--He suggested that the 1996 farm law, which was intended to make  
growers less dependent on government assistance, could use some 
fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
	--He believes better trade agreements would open more markets to  
U.S. farm products, helping to raise crop prices. But Washington 
also must be willing to open its borders, he said. ``It is the 
fearful who build walls. It is the confident who tear them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He said the United States must build up its military to protect  
the country from ``madmen and terrorists'' and he supports 
construction of a proposed national missile defense system.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Stopgap Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly today to keep  
federal agencies functioning another week as President Clinton and 
Congress work through their budget fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 424-2 vote signaled that neither side wanted to force a  
government shutdown. But big disputes remain, including battles 
over a huge package that includes money for social programs, the 
District of Columbia plus across-the-board spending cuts in all 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to approve the stopgap spending measure  
quickly, and Clinton was poised to sign it. The bill will keep 
agencies open through Nov. 5, and is the third temporary measure 
since fiscal 2000 began on Oct. 1. The current one expires Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	After days of lining up votes and tinkering with their big  
package of cuts and social spending, GOP leaders also planned House 
and Senate votes today on that measure. The cuts -- 0.97 percent for 
all federal agencies -- were attached to a huge spending package 
that contains $314 billion for health, education and labor programs 
plus $429 million more for the District of Columbia's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we bring it to the floor, we're going to have it,''  
predicted House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage by the House, and then the Senate, is certain to trigger  
a veto by Clinton, followed by negotiations over the last, overdue 
spending bills for fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Clinton said 
the across-the-board cuts would hurt defense, schools and other 
programs, and he objected that Republicans did not provide money he 
wanted for hiring elementary school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Republicans were eager to get the bill to the White  
House. Doing so would let them claim they had finished all 13 
spending bills for the new fiscal year without touching Social 
Security's surpluses -- a boast they hope will help them in the 2000 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and congressional Democrats say budget gimmicks shield  
the fact that the Republicans' plans would violate their own 
pledge, dipping into Social Security this year for $17 billion, 
according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is wrong and it doesn't have to be,'' Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the across-the-board cut, Republicans claimed  
savings from a computerized effort to crack down on unpaid federal 
student loans, and by trimming $120 million in administrative costs 
at the departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP designed the labor-health bill so Clinton would have  
little opportunity to attack them for cutting programs. The measure 
would provide about $600 million more than Clinton requested for 
the annually approved programs the bill controls, including $300 
million more for education than he proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, their biggest disagreements are over who controls the  
money. Instead of the $1.4 billion Clinton wants for hiring 
teachers, the bill would provide $1.2 billion that states could use 
to improve schools in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
	In their struggle to find votes, GOP leaders promised lawmakers  
reluctant to cut highway projects that they would get a chance to 
restore the reductions next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some internal grumbling, lawmakers also included their  
own salaries in the spending reductions. Their pay, currently set 
to rise 3.4 percent to $141,300 in January, would grow instead to 
$139,900. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say the across-the-board savings could come from  
federal waste. Democrats challenged that, and criticized other GOP 
savings proposals as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health's budget for fiscal 2000 would  
be $17.9 billion, $2.3 billion more than this year. But Republicans 
would require that $7.5 billion of it not be spent until next Sept. 
27, just four days from the end of the fiscal year, preventing most 
of it from being charged to fiscal 2000's books. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said that would disrupt research, while Republicans  
said it would not. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also were claiming $877 million in savings by using  
a computer database of newly hired workers to track down people who 
defaulted on student loans. The Congressional Budget Office says 
the idea would only save $130 million, but Republicans are using a 
more generous estimate used by Clinton's White House budget office. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have pledged to leave Social Security surpluses  
alone to position themselves as defenders of the pension system, 
even though both have routinely spent the money for decades without 
weakening the program.

<HEADLINE> Two Injured in Oil Tank Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONCA CITY, Okla. (AP) -- An oil tank at the state's largest  
refinery burst into flames Thursday morning, critically injuring 
two workers and sending school children scurrying off playgrounds 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	A plume of thick black smoke rose over the city, and the fire  
scattered charred chunks of foam-like debris up to 5 miles from the 
Conoco refinery. Smoke could be seen up to 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Ray, director of external affairs for Conoco, said the  
smoke was non-toxic but warned people with respiratory problems to 
stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Spencer, refinery manager, put the preliminary damage  
estimate at $1.5 million. A cause remained undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire was extinguished late Thursday afternoon, Ray said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ray said the tank contained about 50,000 barrels of oil.  
</P>
<P>
	The men who were injured were in a lift near the top of the tank  
inspecting insulation when the tank exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery produces about 188,000 barrels of crude oil a day.

<HEADLINE> Two Die in Blue Angels Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. (AP) -- A jet from the Navy's Blue  
Angels precision flying team crashed Thursday while trying to land 
during a training flight, killing two team members. 
</P>
<P>
	Cmdr. Jack Papp, a Navy spokesman in Pensacola, Fla., where the  
Blue Angels are based, confirmed the deaths. No names were released 
pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accident took place around 12:30 this afternoon. They were  
coming in to land, practicing arrival maneuvers when this 
happened,'' said Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon in Washington. ``We 
don't know what caused it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened near Moody Air Force Base, where the Blue  
Angels were scheduled to perform this weekend during the base's 
Community Appreciation Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The last crash involving the Navy's high-precision flying team,  
which has six F/A-18 jets, occurred in 1990. The last fatality 
occurred in 1985, in Niagara Falls, N.Y., when Lt. Cmdr. Michael 
Gershon died in a fiery crash after two planes collided during an 
air show. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's fatalities brought to 23 the number of Blue Angels  
pilots killed in air shows or training since the group was formed 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously if any sort of procedural or maintenance problems  
are revealed by the investigation they will be addressed 
aggressively by the Navy,'' Bacon said. ``This is its premier 
flying team, a team that performs to the amazement and pleasure of 
crowds all over the United States, and you can be sure the Navy 
will do whatever it can to make sure that this team is at the very 
top of its ability to fly.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Employees OK Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A new three-year contract has been overwhelming  
approved by Alaska Airlines' clerical, office and passenger-service 
personnel, the airline and the Machinists union announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact covers Alaska's 3,270 customer-service agents,  
reservations sales agents, operations agents, accounting 
specialists and others, said a news release from the carrier and 
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract includes wage and benefit increases, a matching  
component to the 401(k) plan, conversion to a single wage scale 
within each of the group's work units and an overhaul of the 
grievance process designed to produce timely resolutions and 
eliminate the current backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an agreement that everyone can take pride in,'' said  
Tom O'Grady, the airline's vice president for labor operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Machinists' chief negotiator, Don Welch, also said the  
agreement presents an opportunity ``to initiate a new era of 
improved working relationship between our group and the airline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will be signed in a ceremony Friday, the same day  
Alaska and its flight attendants sign their new four-year 
agreement. The carrier reached a 42-month agreement with its 
mechanics in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines serves more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada,  
Mexico and five Western states.

<HEADLINE> World Series Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the current Yankees celebrated their third  
World Series title in four years, many of the old Yankees returned 
to party with them in the clubhouse Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how tough it is to do,'' said Yogi Berra, part of 10  
World Series champions and 14 AL pennant winners in a 16-year span. 
``Let's see if they can keep the team together and do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitey Ford was in another part of the clubhouse, Dave Winfield  
-- like Berra, a rehabilitated Yankee -- was in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra noted that these Yankees aren't like the Bronx Bombers of  
old. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do things differently than we did,'' he said. ``You can't  
give them four or five outs, they take advantage of it every 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said this team had the most  
``heart'' of any team he's had, a comment he also made after the 
titles in '96 and '98. 
</P>
<P>
	And where does he think this team will rank in history.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to rank it at the top,'' he said as Derek Jeter  
doused his hair, blue blazer and white turtleneck with champagne. 
``Three tiers of playoffs doesn't make it twice as hard or three 
times as hard, it makes it five times as hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have gone 22-3 in the past two postseasons, tying  
the record of 12 straight World Series wins set by the 1927, '28 
and '32 Yankees. They joined the Yankees of '27 and '28, and '38 
and '39 and the only teams to sweep consecutive World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win three in four years, these guys have to be put up there  
with the old, great Yankees teams,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE FEATS:* Jim Leyritz hit the 18th pinch home run in World  
Series history, the first since Ed Sprague for Toronto in Game 2 of 
the 1992 World Series against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first by a Yankee since Johnny Blanchard in Game 3 of  
the 1961 World Series against Cincinnati. Eight of Leyritz's 13 
career postseason hits are homers, including three against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RIVERA'S STREAK:* Mariano Rivera finished the regular season  
with 30 2-3 consecutive scoreless innings, not allowing a run after 
July 21. He pitched 12 1-3 scoreless innings in eight postseason 
appearances, going 1-0 with six saves. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series MVP has not allowed a run in 25 2-3 consecutive  
postseason innings since Sandy Alomar Jr.'s homer run that cost the 
Yankees Game 4 of their 1997 first-round series against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE STREAKING: Derek Jeter extended his postseason hitting  
streak to 17 games, tying Hank Bauer (1956-58) for the longest 
ever. Jeter has hit in nine consecutive Series games. Bauer's 
streak was all World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLEMENTE FLAP:* Three Latin-American reporters sent a letter  
Wednesday to commissioner Bud Selig ``to express the most fervent 
disappointment for the unjustifiable exclusion of Roberto 
Clemente'' from the All-Century team. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying they were speaking for 21 Latin-American reporters who  
met and voted before Game 4 of the World Series, Jaime Jarrin, 
Billy Berroa and Manolo Hernandez-Douen included a Latin-American 
All-Century team with the letter they sent to Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	It has Orlando Cepeda and Andres Galarraga at first, Rod Carew  
and Roberto Alomar at second, Tony Perez and Vinny Castilla at 
third, Luis Aparacio, Dave Concepcion and Chico Carrasquel at 
shortstop and Ivan Rodriguez and Manny Sanguillen at catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The outfielders are Clemente, Sammy Sosa, Juan Gonzalez, Tony  
Oliva, Bernie Williams and Minnie Minoso. The pitchers are Juan 
Marichal, Luis Tiant, Fernando Valenzuela, Dennis Martinez, Pedro 
Martinez, Martin Dihigo, Mike Cueller, Mariano Rivera, Camilo 
Pascual and Roberto Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	Manny Mota was picked a pinch-hitter, and Edgar Martinez and  
Jose Canseco as designated hitters. Clemente was voted Latin 
American player of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Cubs star Sammy Sosa, speaking before the game, recalled  
watching Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody knows who Roberto Clemente was,'' Sosa said.  
``Roberto Clemente would have been on that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HANK AARON AWARDS:* Baseball presented its inaugural Hank Aaron  
awards to Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and Manny Ramirez of the 
Cleveland Indians. The awards, which are for hitting and are based 
on statistics, are given by the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baseball Writers' Association of America will announce the  
traditional awards -- Rookie of the Year, Cy Young and MVP -- next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron repeated that he expects Ken Griffey Jr. will break his  
record of 755 home runs ``because of his age, and he's going to be 
around awhile.''

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Union Gives Strike Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Mediated talks between Raytheon Missile  
Systems Co. and a machinists union broke off Thursday, prompting 
the union to issue a notice of its intent to strike in seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for the International Association of Machinists and  
Aerospace Workers Local Lodge 933 and the company met with a 
federal mediator present from 10 a.m. Wednesday until about 6 a.m. 
Thursday, but could not reach an agreement, said Gary Allen, the 
union's chief bargainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Jim Gilkerson said Raytheon had made a number  
of ``significant additional improvements over its initial 
proposal'' during the mediation. The company said it believes its 
latest offer was ``highly competitive, including enhancements in 
wages, benefits and paid time off.'' It did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we still have not come to a tentative  
agreement,'' Allen said. ``The committee at this time is not 
recommending accepting the offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union, which on Sunday rejected a five-year contract offer  
and voted to authorize a strike, is required to give the company 
seven days' notice of a planned work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not give any comparable notice. It would need to  
do so before unilaterally imposing terms of a rejected contract 
offer or locking workers out. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer the union rejected Sunday included a one-time, $1,500  
bonus, with wage increases totaling 17 percent through the five 
years. Nine hundred workers would receive additional pay increases 
through job classification changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The union says its local work force averages $15.70 an hour,  
versus about $22 industrywide. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 1,850 of the plant's 8,000 jobs are union-covered.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're always willing to listen, but at this point we're trying  
to evaluate our position and review the company's offer,'' Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side has indicated that it wants to continue talks.  
</P>
<P>
	But Gilkerson said, ``Our goal still remains the same. That's to  
reach a resolution without a work stoppage.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Landscape Shifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the year since the antitrust trial opened  
against Microsoft Corp., the nation's high-tech industry has made 
some of its most dramatic shifts since consumers began discovering 
the Internet in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Netscape Communications Corp., whose pioneer browser  
software helped popularize the Web, has a powerful new owner in 
America Online Inc., plus another strong new ally whose chief 
executive is no friend to Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of the nation's largest computer makers are selling some  
machines without Microsoft's Windows software already installed. 
Consumers previously tied to bulky desktop computers can surf the 
Internet using handheld devices, even fancy cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to raise the question: Can the slow wheels of  
justice keep pace in ``Internet time,'' where four years is roughly 
the equivalent of a generation? 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could announce his  
factual findings in the Microsoft trial as early as Friday, the 
first step toward a final verdict. That decision also was expected 
to serve as a barometer for whether the judge believes the company 
broke antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts expect the landmark case to wind through  
appeals courts for as long as two years. That kind of delay would 
complicate decisions about possible punishments against Microsoft 
that might still be applied in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you write a prescription that the patient is ultimately  
going to take 24 months later in an industry that moves this 
fast?'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George 
Washington University. ``It's a terrible problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cutting new ground here,'' agreed Rob Enderle, an  
industry analyst with Giga Information Group. ``Whatever (the 
judge) does will set a precedent that will be followed and cursed 
or blessed for decades to come. This is likely to be his biggest 
moment in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel  
Klein said the fast pace of the Microsoft trial ``demonstrates that 
both the Department of Justice and the court system can move in 
Internet time.'' Other important government antitrust actions, such 
as a lawsuit against IBM, dragged on for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also dismissed talk about possible remedies as premature,  
saying it would be ``putting the cart before the horse.'' People 
close to the case said the government still is deciding what type 
of punishment yet to recommend against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate speech elsewhere in New York on Thursday, Gates  
didn't discuss the courtroom fight against his company. He talked 
instead about children growing up already embracing the Internet, 
an era he called ``Generation I, I for Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyers have forcefully argued these dramatic shifts  
in the industry undermine allegations that competition among 
high-tech companies is so inadequate that a judge's intervention is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	They used AOL's recent $10 billion purchase of Netscape to  
dispute the government's allegation that it illegally wielded its 
influence to crush rivals, including Netscape. They cited e-mail 
from AOL chief executive Steve Case figuring that if AOL began 
distributing Netscape's browser to its 19 million subscribers, its 
portion would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also has noted that some major computer makers now  
offer models running Linux software, suggesting the company's 
reputed stranglehold isn't as tight over the industry as portrayed 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice lawyers reject those arguments, citing figures showing  
that Microsoft Windows continues to run the vast majority of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also cite evidence from the trial that even the largest  
computer companies expressed fear at upsetting Microsoft. Compaq 
Computer Corp. once wondered in an internal presentation about the 
software giant, ``How retaliatory could they get?''

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Results Top Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's third-quarter results topped  
expectations, but its shares fell more than 5 percent today on 
worries about future performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com's earnings report after markets closed Wednesday  
disclosed losses more than tripled from a year ago as the Internet 
giant significantly boosted its spending to expand its online 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	While its losses widened, Amazon.com's sales grew by 132 percent  
from the year-ago period and its customer base climbed by 2.4 
million in the past three months to 13.1 million, three times 
larger than it was in September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
Amazon.com was down $4 at $71.93 3/4 a share after some influential 
Wall Street analysts lowered their ratings on the stock because of 
increased loss estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, it was down as much as 12 percent at $65.87 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com reported that it lost $197 million, or 59 cents a  
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 
$45.2 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding $111.3 million in merger, acquisition,  
investment-related costs and stock-based compensation charges, 
Amazon.com lost $85.8 million, or 26 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	That loss was smaller than the 28-cents-a-share loss expected by  
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the third-quarter number was right on target,''  
said Sara Zeilstra, an analyst at Warburg Dillion Read. ``The 
concern right now has to do with the fourth quarter and year 2000 
and how much the losses will widen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the quarter rose to $355.8 million, up from $153.7  
million a year ago. Since the start of the year, sales are $963.8 
million, well above the $608 million in sales that Amazon.com 
tallied during all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In its four years in business, Amazon.com has yet to turn a  
profit. Yet, the company hasn't stopped spending money to build 
itself into a bigger and more diversified online retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company not only seeks to woo shoppers to its  
site, but it wants people to keep coming back. Repeat customer 
orders represented more than 72 percent of its orders during the 
third quarter, compared with 70 percent in the second quarter of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, Amazon has moved from being exclusively  
an online bookseller into an Internet shopping superstore, offering 
music, videos, auctions and electronic greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	During the third quarter, it added a wide array of toys and  
electronics to its Web site. It also started allowing anyone -- from 
major manufacturers to enterprising grandparents -- to sell 
merchandise on Amazon.com through its new zSHOPS program. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com has also invested millions of dollars this year in a  
number of online merchants with big growth potential. Those include 
online pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop Pets.com and Web 
wedding-gift registry Della &AMP; James. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we find new opportunities, we will invest in them, and we  
think that is the right thing to do,'' Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com 
founder and chief executive officer, said during a conference call 
with analysts late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com has aggressively built itself up, its costs  
have soared. During the third quarter, the company spent $86 
million on marketing and advertising and $44 million on product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said costs are likely to continue increasing. In the  
fourth quarter, Amazon.com expects its marketing expenses to rise 
as well as its costs to fulfill orders. It also expects the profits 
it makes off each item to decrease. Revenue is expected to soar, 
however, as shoppers buy gifts for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Amazon.com said that it expects its U.S. book  
business -- long the anchor of the company -- to make a profit during 
the fourth quarter, though it will contribute less than half of the 
company's total revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Amazon.com lost $396.8  
million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $78.1 million, or 27 cents 
a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding merger and acquisition, investment and stock-based  
compensation costs, Amazon.com lost $204.9 million, or 63 cents a 
share, compared with a loss of $51.6 million, or 18 cents, a year 
ago.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Profits Nearly Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom nearly tripled its third-quarter  
profits, extending a magnificent growth spurt fueled by a stream of 
takeovers that now includes the biggest merger ever, a proposed 
$115 billion purchase of Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplier of long-distance and Internet services said  
Thursday it earned $1.09 billion, or 55 cents per share, in the 
three months ended Sept. 30, excluding the impact of an investment 
in Embratel, a Brazilian telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with a profit of $359 million or 19 cents a share  
in the same period last year from the combined operations of 
WorldCom and MCI Communications, which didn't complete their merger 
until the end of that quarter. The year-ago figures also exclude 
Embratel and merger-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected an operating profit of 54 cents a share in  
this year's third quarter, according to a survey by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. MCI WorldCom's shares jumped 7 percent 
after the report, rising $5.43 3/4 to $83 in afternoon trading on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, MCI WorldCom crowed about the benefits of the MCI  
deal, which has enabled the company to save money by merging 
various operations and eliminating gaps in its communications 
network. With a more extensive network, more voice and data traffic 
can remain on company-owned cables for longer distances instead of 
being handed off to a rival carrier, for a fee, to reach certain 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom also continued to stress its growing reliance on  
Internet-related business rather than telephone calls -- especially 
a consumer long-distance market where price wars and access changes 
paid to local phone companies keep pressuring profit margins that 
are already razor-thin. 
</P>
<P>
	While voice minutes increased 12 percent in the third quarter  
compared with the combined WorldCom and MCI operations in the same 
period last year, they continued to shrink as a percentage of the 
company's overall network volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet, data and other nontraditional telecom services now  
make up almost 40 percent of MCI WorldCom's total revenues, and 
account for more than three-quarters of the company's revenue 
growth. Internet usage, as measured by connect hours, increased 83 
percent year-over-year. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the shifting focus on data, the telephone business  
posted a strong 6 percent increase in third-quarter revenues. 
Company executives cited the ``5-Cents Everyday'' calling plan 
introduced during the summer in response to the ``Nickel Nights'' 
offer launched by former rival Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	The new MCI plan has 2.5 million customers, three-quarters of  
whom are new to MCI WorldCom, said Bernard J. Ebbers, president and 
chief executive of MCI WorldCom, in a conference call after the 
report. About half of those customers are also using MCI for 
``local'' long-distance calling -- also known as toll or intralata 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were quite possibly surprised by (the phone business  
results). So many people think there's a price war going on,'' Dan 
Reingold, an industry analyst for Merrill Lynch, commented during 
the conference call. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, third-quarter revenues totaled $8.52 billion, excluding  
Embratel. That's an improvement of 11 percent as compared with the 
combined $7.67 billion generated by the same operations in the 
third quarter of 1998. Including Embratel, revenue for the 
just-ended quarter totaled $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest revenue tally reflects the loss of $29 million in  
service credits issued to customers in compensation for the widely 
publicized outages during August on one of the company's Internet 
``backbone'' networks. The problems, caused by an upgrade to the 
system software running the network, were resolved after 10 days of 
disruptions, at which point MCI WorldCom granted 20 free days of 
service to about 3,000 business customers, including America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers said the Sprint deal, signed earlier this month, will  
help meet the growing demand for one-stop shopping for telephone 
and data services. The most crucial part of that purchase is the 
Sprint PCS wireless business, which will fill a gaping hole in MCI 
WorldCom's product lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers and businesses alike are seeking ... packages of  
services with rates oriented towards bandwidth consumed, not 
distance,'' said Ebbers. ``Our substantial and timely investments -- 
in local access, data, Internet, international and recently 
wireless -- favorably position the company to meet these changing 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of 1999, MCI WorldCom earned $2.66  
billion, or $1.38 per common share, including results from the SHL 
computer services operation that was sold in April to EDS. That 
compares with a profit of $815 million or 45 cents a share in the 
same period last year, including a full-nine months of results from 
MCI and SHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues totaled $25.09 billion, up 12 percent from  
$22.4 billion in the same period last year. Including Embratel, the 
latest revenue tally amounted to $27.1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Convoy Under NATO Escort Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers today promised to  
track down ethnic Albanians who stormed a convoy of Serbs leaving 
Kosovo, setting fire to vehicles and forcing dozens to take refuge 
in an Italian military garrison. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack Wednesday against the NATO-escorted convoy was one of  
the most serious incidents of ethnic violence since the 
peacekeepers, known by the acronym KFOR, arrived in Kosovo on June 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement early today, KFOR and the United Nations said  
they ``strongly condemn this brutal attack on the humanitarian 
convoy of civilians. KFOR will make all the efforts to bring those 
responsible to justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another statement released in Vienna, the head of the  
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Knut 
Vollebaek, said he ``strongly condemns yesterday's brutal attack on 
a (U.N. organized) convoy of ethnic Serbs under KFOR protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Such acts of violence are totally unacceptable and cannot be  
tolerated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, French and Belgian peacekeepers used tear gas and  
bulldozers to remove a roadblock put up by local Serbs in Lesak, 23 
miles north of the ethnically tense industrial city of Kosovska 
Mitrovica. A few people were lightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundreds Serbs had blocked a highway with tree trunks,  
cars and buses to demand that peacekeepers find two Serbs who 
disappeared Tuesday after going to work in Kosovoska Mitrovica. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the convoy occurred Wednesday as German and Dutch  
peacekeepers were escorting 155 Serbs from the southwestern town of 
Orahovac to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, U.N. refugee 
agency spokesman Peter Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trouble began after the convoy split in two while passing  
through Pec, Kosovo's third-largest city and scene of some of the 
most brutal attacks against ethnic Albanians during Serb forces' 
18-month crackdown in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	One group headed through the city's outskirts. The other was  
trying to go through the center when it was mobbed, NATO spokesman 
Capt. Attilio Andre said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to witnesses, the ethnic Albanians were apparently  
provoked when some of the Serbs flashed a three-finger salute -- a 
symbol of Serb nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness, Veselj Berisha, 55, said outraged crowds circled  
the buses and cars, pulling people into the street. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces intervened, but not before some vehicles in the  
convoy were set on fire. Peacekeepers said today that 18 of the 34 
Serbs in the convoy were slightly injured and 19 cars were set on 
fire, including a vehicle of the U.N. refugee agency. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said 34 Serbs were taken to the Italian headquarters of the  
peacekeeping force, where hundreds of angry ethnic Albanians had 
gathered and were setting off firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, the peacekeepers said the Serbs were slipped out  
of the compound and taken to Montenegro under cover of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs leaving the province have often asked for NATO escorts to  
protect them from attacks by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for 
the brutal Serb crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	The crackdown ended after NATO forces bombed Yugoslavia for 78  
days, then took control of Kosovo. Kosovo is located in southern 
Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance pledged to try to stop violence against Kosovo's  
minority Serbs as it sought to built a pluralistic government in 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In the town of Urosevac, up to 5,000 people attended a funeral  
of three ethnic Albanian men. Some 50 of them were wearing uniforms 
of the Kosovo Protection Corps, the civilian successor to the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army, and some had weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	After traditional firing in the air, American peacekeepers  
confiscated eight rifles and a pistol, and detained one person for 
questioning.

<HEADLINE> Sosa: Baylor May Be Next Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sammy Sosa met on the field with Don Baylor  
prior to Game 4 of the World Series on Wednesday and believes the 
Atlanta Braves hitting coach will be the next manager of the 
Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor, who managed Colorado from 1993-98 and guided the Rockies  
to their only postseason berth, already has interviewed with 
Chicago, Anaheim and Milwaukee. The Cubs are thought to have the 
inside track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much understand that the strongest candidate we have  
is Don Baylor,'' Sosa said after receiving the Hank Aaron Award as 
the top hitter in the National League. ``I believe that Don Baylor 
would be a good decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs fired Jim Riggleman after finishing last in the NL  
Central with a 67-95 record. Baylor's name has been mentioned for 
virtually every opening after just one season on the Braves' staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa said he has not been consulted by the Cubs' front office  
during the search, and hasn't closely followed the dealings with 
Baylor and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just waiting for the announcement,'' he said. ``I think it  
will be soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor denied he has reached an agreement to manage the Cubs,  
saying he hasn't talked with team officials in a week. But he is 
fully aware that it's just a matter of time before he's hired as 
manager somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how soon it's going to happen,'' he said,  
collecting his belongings in a somber Atlanta clubhouse after the 
New York Yankees completed a Series sweep with a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Baylor said he has learned a few traits with the Braves that  
will come in handy in his next managing job. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little more patience. More emphasis on pitching and  
defense,'' he said, remembering his six years at Coors Field. ``I 
tried to do it before in a ballpark where it's hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement that Baylor had been hired as Cubs manager was  
discovered last week by a Chicago Tribune reporter on a hidden area 
of the team's Web site. Apparently, a Cubs employee prepared a 
profile and news release in case Baylor got the job. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright Offers Help to Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright directed  
her deputy, Strobe Talbott, to return to Armenia and offered the 
tiny former Soviet republic assistance in its troubled transition 
to a post-Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to see what we can do to lessen the pain,'' Albright  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunmen claiming a coup stormed the parliament in Yerevan on  
Wednesday and killed the nation's prime minister and other 
officials before eventually surrendering to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Directing her remarks also to the Russian offensive in the  
restive republic of Chechnya and unrest also in Dagestan, Albright 
said the United States wanted to try to make sure the former Soviet 
Union ``does not become an area for terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference today, Albright said she would confer in  
Oslo next week with Russian Foreign Minister Ivan Ivanov at a 
memorial in the Norwegian capital for the late Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott was in Armenia before assassins seized the parliament  
and took hostages. He then went to Moscow, where he received 
Albright's instructions to return to Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she telephoned President Robert Kocharian ``to  
offer my personal condolences and sorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No ``confirmed information'' about a motive was given for the  
attack, said State Department spokesman James Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight top Armenian officials were killed in the attack,  
including Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsian, Speaker of the Parliament 
Karen Demirchian, Deputy Speaker Youri Bakhshian and Leonard 
Petrosian, minister of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In a travel advisory, the State Department said ``this appears  
to be an isolated incident with no reports of related activity 
elsewhere in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American citizens were advised to take ``appropriate security  
precautions,'' but they were not cautioned against traveling in the 
country of about 3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	American diplomacy in Armenia has focused primarily on trying to  
help resolve a territorial dispute with Azerbaijan over 
Nagorno-Karabakh, which is in Azerbaijan and has a predominantly 
Armenian population.

	Dow Gains 228; Nasdaq Rises 61  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today after the Labor Department  
reported that U.S. workers' wages and benefits are increasing at a 
slower than expected pace, raising hopes that inflation is not 
threatening the economy's health. Just before 3 p.m. EDT, the Dow 
Jones industrial average was up 228.27 points at 10,623.16. 
Advancers on the New York stock exchange outnumbered advancers 
2,105-917. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 61.80 at 2,864.32. 
Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the exclusion 
of a strong report which said the U.S. economy expanded at an 
annual rate of 4.8 percent from July through September, the fastest 
pace this year.

	Many See Lottery As Way to Wealth  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-quarter of Americans believe their best  
chance to build wealth for retirement is by playing the lottery, 
not by patiently saving and investing, a survey released today 
says, and those living paycheck to paycheck are even more likely to 
feel that. Misconceptions about how small amounts of money can grow 
keep millions of people from taking steps to greatly improve their 
lot, say sponsors of the survey -- the Consumer Federation of 
America and the financial services firm Primerica. An analysis of 
the latest Census Bureau data -- from 1995 -- found that the median 
savings of American families was just $1,000.

	BEIJING (AP) -- On the run as followers of a ``devil cult,''  
nearly 30 members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement today 
denounced torture at the hands of Chinese police and promised 
defiance. At an extraordinary news conference organized in secrecy 
amid widening police sweeps, one practitioner displayed wrists 
bruised by manacles; another told how police burned her face with 
an electric baton. Other Falun Gong members converged on Tiananmen 
Square for a fourth day while the Communist Party promised it would 
show the movement no mercy. Police detained at least 20 people this 
morning.

	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush's excuse for missing his  
second consecutive Republican presidential debate ``doesn't wash'' 
with the people of New Hampshire, rival Steve Forbes said today. 
``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by his 
own rules,'' Forbes said hours before tonight's debate in Hanover. 
The two-term Texas governor will interview with a local television 
station before the debate to explain his absence. Bush will stay in 
Texas to join his wife, who is being honored by Southern Methodist 
University tonight.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring it wants to improve chances for  
peace, Mauritania today became the third Arab country to establish 
full diplomatic relations with Israel and defended the action 
against Arab criticism. ``It is a sovereign decision, taken by us 
as a sovereign state,'' Mauritania's foreign minister, Ahmed Ould 
sid Ahmed, said after exchanging documents with David Levy, the 
Israeli foreign minister, at a State Department ceremony. Egypt 
broke ranks from its Arab League allies in 1979 and was ostracized 
for making peace with Israel. Jordan took the step in 1994.

millennium-ending gathering today with a forceful denunciation of 
religious extremism. ``Any use of religion to support violence is 
an abuse of religion,'' John Paul said in his final message to the 
four-day council, speaking to orange-robed Asian monks, Catholic 
priests in black cassocks, Muslim women in head scarfs and Africans 
and American Indians in traditional clothing. John Paul summoned 
representatives of the world's religions to the Vatican for one 
last try during this millennium to help solve common problems of

team to glory. The announcement was made by Rupert Murdoch's News 
Corp., which owns the Dodgers. Daly, 62, and Terry Semel announced 
in July they were quitting as chairmen of Warner Bros. and Warner 
Music Group. The duo's films include the ``Lethal Weapon'' and 
``Batman'' movies, ``The Killing Fields,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy''

<HEADLINE> House Bars Assisted Suicide Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is looking to the  
Senate to reverse a House vote as Congress wrestles with the 
emotional question of what role doctors should play in helping 
suffering patients die. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a bill Wednesday that bars doctors from using  
federally controlled drugs to aid in a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The 271-156 vote came despite opponents' claims that such a  
bill, if it became law, would put federal drug agents in the role 
of making health care decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed in the vote, and we will working in the  
Senate to see what can be done,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said 
today. The Justice Department opposed the provision making 
physician-assisted suicide a federal crime with mandatory 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion forces have made the bill by Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., a priority this year. It would create a major headache for 
Oregon, the only state that has legalized physician-assisted 
suicide for patients with less than six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 patients who died under Oregon's landmark law during its  
first full year in 1998 used controlled substances to end their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats from Oregon were pleased they garnered more than  
the 146 votes that would be needed to sustain a veto -- although 
President Clinton has not yet said whether he would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version of the bill, by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,  
has not yet come to the floor, but Nickles said he hoped to pass it 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has pledged to filibuster the bill, but  
said he faces a ``very uphill'' battle to defeat the measure given 
Nickles' No. 2 position as the majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate action on the bill, previously thought by many to be  
unlikely in 1999, becomes more of a possibility because of a 
federal budget fight that is expected to keep lawmakers in the 
nation's capital into next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's bill, while it penalizes doctors who aid in a suicide,  
encourages physicians to treat the pain of dying patients. The 
measure authorizes $5 million for more training and education to 
improve end-of-life care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suicide is the ultimate act of despair and facilitating the  
intentional killing of a human life is the opposite of healing,'' 
Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the bill would discourage pain treatment for  
millions of Americans. Doctors would be so worried about losing 
their licenses to prescribe drugs, and spending at least 20 years 
in jail for aiding in a suicide, that they would decline to 
dispense needed medication, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extraordinary intrusion not only into states'  
rights, but into the practices of medicine,'' said Rep. Peter 
DeFazio, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde dismissed suggestions that his bill would create a medical  
``Gestapo,'' saying federal drug agents already review 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House debate, some members spoke of the issue in  
personal terms -- a child who died of leukemia, a parent who died 
from cancer -- but used those experiences to draw opposite 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Hyde supporters compared physician-assisted suicide to  
euthanasia and abortion and invoked the name of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, 
the Michigan physician who has battled to make the practice legal. 
Kevorkian is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for second-degree 
murder and drug delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregonians painstakingly tried to point out the protections in  
their law that limit the circumstances when people can take their 
lives. ``Please read the Oregon statute before you vote,'' pleaded 
Rep. David Wu, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide opponents have been pressing for legislation  
since June 1998, when Reno ruled that federal drug agents cannot 
move against doctors who help terminally ill patients die under 
Oregon's Death With Dignity Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But while last year's version of Hyde-Nickles fell flat, this  
year's bill has won more support from medical groups because it 
encourages pain treatment and gives doctors some assurances they 
wouldn't be prosecuted if a patients died accidentally from pain 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and National Hospice  
Organization are among the groups that support the measure after 
opposing last year's bill, although several other medical groups 
and several state medical societies oppose this year's Hyde-Nickles 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben wrote Oct. 19 that the  
Clinton administration supported the part of the bill that 
encouraged pain treatment but opposed the section that would make 
physician-assisted suicide a federal crime with ``harsh mandatory 
penalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Imposing such penalties would also effectively block state  
policy-making at a time when ... the states are still engaged in an 
earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality and 
practicality of physician-assisted suicide,'' Raben wrote.

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Cato to Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Center Kelvin Cato, who leads the NBA this  
preseason in shot blocking, has signed a multiyear contract 
extension with the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato's contract was extended by more than one year, but further  
terms were not disclosed Thursday by general manager Carroll 
Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato, a defensive specialist, was one of five players the  
Rockets picked up earlier this month when they traded Scottie 
Pippen to the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Iowa State player has averaged 5.29 blocks in  
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato has started in five of Houston's seven games. On Oct. 15  
against Cleveland, he notched a preseason triple-double with 20 
points, 13 rebounds and 12 blocks in 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Cato has averages of 3.7 points, 3.4 rebounds  
and 1.28 blocks in 117 NBA games.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 5, Avalanche 4, OT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Valeri Zelepukin scored with 8.2 seconds  
left in overtime as the Philadelphia Flyers bounced back after 
blowing a four-goal lead in the third to beat the Colorado 
Avalanche 5-4 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelepukin skated in on goaltender Marc Denis and flicked a  
backhanded shot between his pads, atoning for what had been one of 
the Flyers' worst collapses in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 4-0 in the third, Colorado stunned the Flyers with four  
goals on eight shots in 8:09. Alex Tanguay and Milan Hejduk each 
scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Lindros was home with a virus, and Flyers coach Roger  
Neilson was on the bench despite a similar ailment. General manager 
Bob Clarke struck an ominous pose in the executive box, standing 
for the duration of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the near-debacle, the Flyers won for the fifth time in  
six games and tied New Jersey for first place in the Atlantic 
Division. Colorado lost for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Flyers took a 4-0 lead on Mark Greig's first goal  
early in the third, Tanguay made things interesting with two goals 
in 3:13 to make it 4-2. First, Tanguay one-timed Chris Drury's long 
pass after it bounced out of the corner for a goal that slipped 
past John Vanbiesbrouck's stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanguay struck again -- and sent Clarke for a walk to the back of  
the executive box -- with a breakaway goal with 11:27 remaining. He 
got the puck on a turnover near the blue line and beat a sprawling 
Vanbiesbrouck on the stick side again to make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk continued the stunning comeback bid, scoring 38 seconds  
into a power play to make it 4-3 with 7:44 remaining. While Ulf 
Samuelsson cleared his man from the crease, Dan McGillis lost 
Hejduk in front leading to the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson called a timeout, and Clarke turned and appeared to spit  
on the floor upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensing it was time to go for the kill, Hejduk scored again with  
6:31 left, taking a long rebound, skating in unguarded and beating 
Vanbiesbrouck on the stick side yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a long way back from Eric Desjardins' crushing power play  
with two-tenths of a second left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers went on a power play with 3:20 left in the second and  
bombarded Colorado goaltender Denis with pressure. At one point, 
Sakic and Denis both lost their sticks, but the Flyers couldn't 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Shjon Podein gave his stick to Denis, and John LeClair deflected  
a shot over the glass as the power play ended. But Greg De Vries 
shoved Daymond Langkow, giving Philadelphia another advantage with 
1:04 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Desjardins made it 3-0 with two-tenths of a second left, a  
backbreaking goal that left Adam Deadmarsh and Eric Messier 
kneeling on the ice for several seconds in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Recchi had a goal and two assists, giving him 18 goals and  
35 points in 31 games against Colorado -- formerly Quebec.

<HEADLINE> Study: Protein Blocks Cell Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers at Harvard Medical School have  
found the first of a new class of proteins that block cell 
division. The discovery eventually could lead to a new type of 
cancer drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science,  
Harvard scientist Tim Mitchison and Stuart Schrieber describe 
discovery of a molecule that disrupts a key step in the process of 
cell division. 
</P>
<P>
	The compound, called monastrol, blocks cell division in a  
different way from many of the current cancer drugs, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchison said in a statement that the discovery ``represents a  
potential starting point for developing better chemotherapeutics'' 
against cancer.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Warner Exec Daly To Run Dodgers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By JOHN NADEL    	
</P>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are going Hollywood  
in an attempt to return to their glory years. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Daly, who ran Warner Bros. with Terry Semel for the last 20  
years, was hired Thursday as chairman, chief executive officer and 
managing partner of the Dodgers and said he will do everything he 
can to make the team a winner again. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Chernin, president and CEO of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.,  
which owns the team, said Daly will have ``absolute day-to-day 
control of all aspects of the Dodgers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bob has been an enormous winner at everything he's  
touched,'' Chernin said. ``We think he's the best possible person 
to return the Dodgers to excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, 62, made no immediate promises, but like the fan he's been  
since he was 6 and watching the Dodgers in Brooklyn, he's hoping 
for immediate improvement and an eventual return on his investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, am I happy,'' were Daly's first words at a news  
conference at Staples Center, a couple miles from Dodger Stadium, 
which is being refurbished. ``The Dodgers have a rich baseball 
heritage, and I look forward to helping the team return to the 
glory that Dodger fans have every right to expect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, a Dodgers season ticket-holder, agreed to buy a minority  
stake in the team, a deal that needs approval from other baseball 
owners. It is believed he's buying 10 percent of the team for more 
than $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to prove to everybody that not only is my heart in  
this, but so is my wallet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their 109-year history, the Dodgers have won six World Series  
titles -- one in Brooklyn, five in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he was heartbroken when the ``Brooklyn Bums'' moved to  
Los Angeles before the 1958 season. He moved west 19 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love LA, I love the Dodgers,'' he said. ``I promise you, I  
will do everything I can to bring the tradition back to the 
Dodgers. I will be at Dodger Stadium every day. Everybody has to 
row together. That's what I will try to instill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they made the playoffs three straight years starting  
in 1995, the Dodgers haven't won a postseason game since 1988, when 
gimpy-kneed Kirk Gibson's dramatic homer in the ninth inning of the 
opener started them to a World Series win over Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fox Group, a division of News Corp., bought the Dodgers from  
Peter O'Malley's family in March 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The team finished 83-79 and third in the NL West in 1998. With a  
$79.2 million opening-day payroll, the second highest in the 
majors, the Dodgers were favored to win the NL West but went 77-85, 
23 games behind first-place Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know last season was a tough season,'' Daly said. ``The  
caliber of players, in my opinion, is very good. There needs to be 
some adjustments. The plan is to help the team along and fix the 
holes that need to be fixed. I will only predict we will have a 
better year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he would like to see the team's payroll decrease, but  
doesn't know if that is possible because of long-term contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think spending the most money makes you the best  
team,'' he said. ``I don't have any set feeling whether the payroll 
should go up or down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly and Semel announced in July they were quitting as chairmen  
and co-executives of Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group to pursue 
new ventures, and left earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, who started with the studio 20 years ago, guided the  
film and television division and Warner Music Group to combined 
revenues of about $10 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent my life dealing with talent,'' Daly said. ``I am a  
believer that relationships matter. I believe players have to feel 
good about their team. I will try to instill that in the Dodgers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly said he's a big fan of general manager Kevin Malone and  
manager Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his experience and wisdom will add a lot to the  
Dodgers,'' Malone said. ``And he's a fan, the fans will be able to 
relate to him. The biggest Dodger fan from Brooklyn is running the 
Dodgers. I think that's special. It's more than just a job, that's 
why I'm so excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda had a front row seat at the  
news conference and beamed when Daly described him as ``one of the 
most important Dodgers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Daly knows baseball,'' Lasorda said. ``He's going to get  
that tradition back, he's going to get that character back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Graziano, promoted to president of the Dodgers shortly after  
the sale to Fox, was informed last month he wouldn't be retained in 
that position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him to please stay and help me with the transition,''  
Daly said. ``After the dust settles, `Let's talk.' If there is the 
right role for Bob and he wants to stay, we'll discuss it.''

<HEADLINE> Commission on Test-Ban Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Armed Services Chairman John Warner,  
one of 51 Republicans who voted against a global nuclear test ban 
treaty, on Thursday proposed a bipartisan commission to take 
another look at such a pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission would have 12 members -- six Republicans and six  
Democrats -- only four of whom could be senators. 
</P>
<P>
	It would study a range of issues relating to the testing of  
nuclear weapons and look into ``the possibility of crafting a 
treaty that would meet the security interests of our nation,'' said 
Warner, R-Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel would try to come up with language that would meet  
objections of treaty opponents who believed the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty was flawed and could not be verified, Warner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected the test-ban treaty 51-48 on Oct. 13.  
</P>
<P>
	Warner said the bipartisan commission, if enacted by Congress,  
would work to ``dispel much of the confusion in the world about why 
this Senate failed to ratify the treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His commission would have two equally powerful co-chairs, one  
appointed by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.; and the 
other appointed by President Clinton in consultation with Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.

<HEADLINE> Assets of Mutual Funds Are Up / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds  
rose in the past week, even though retail funds, which are sold to 
individuals, slipped slightly, the Investment Company Institute 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of retail money market mutual funds fell by $594.4  
million in the week ended Wednesday to $905.99 billion, according 
to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $144.8 million to $755.25 billion. Tax-exempt fund assets fell 
by $739.2 million to $150.74 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $3.09 billion  
to $633.92 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $3.43 billion to $585.95 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $332.1 million to 
$47.98 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.540 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.537 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was  
4.77 percent in the week ended Tuesday unchanged from the previous 
week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in 
Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day average yield 
rose to 4.75 percent from 4.73 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.89 percent from 4.88  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.87 percent from 4.85 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.07 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.48 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.44 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.83 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.82 
percent; 5.09 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 5.08 percent; and 
5.34 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.32 percent.

<HEADLINE> Many See Lottery As Way to Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One-quarter of Americans believe their best  
chance to build wealth for retirement is by playing the lottery, 
not by patiently saving and investing, a survey says. Those living 
paycheck to paycheck are even more likely to feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Misconceptions about how small amounts of money can grow keep  
millions of people from taking the steps that could greatly improve 
their lot, say sponsors of the survey released Thursday -- the 
Consumer Federation of America and the financial services firm 
Primerica. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Americans understood that their chances of winning a big  
lottery jackpot were 10 to 20 million to one but that they could 
accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars through regular saving, 
more families would put $50 away rather than spending it on 
gambling or unneeded consumption,'' said Primerica Chairman Joseph 
Plumeri. 
</P>
<P>
	Invested for 40 years at a 9 percent annual yield, $50 a week  
would add up to $1,026,853. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Brobeck, the consumer group's executive director, said  
banks and brokerage firms must take some of the blame for the fact 
that many Americans don't realize there are ways to invest 
profitably even small amounts of money, such as in savings bonds or 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they've done an adequate job in publicizing  
those products to the low- and middle-income households,'' Brobeck 
said. ``There are decent savings options out there for any 
household.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll indicated 28 percent of Americans believe winning a  
lottery or sweepstakes is their ``best chance to obtain a half a 
million dollars or more in your lifetime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among households with annual incomes of $35,000 or less, those  
holding that belief jumped to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, fewer than half -- 47 percent -- of all those surveyed  
said saving and investing some of their income was the most 
reliable route to wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	People were also asked how much $25 invested weekly for 40 years  
at a 7 percent annual yield would amount to. Fewer than a third 
guessed over $150,000. The correct answer is $286,640. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of similar questions found that younger and  
lower-income Americans, along with women, tend to most undervalue 
how savings can add up. 
</P>
<P>
	But that $286,640 is still not the half-million dollars the  
survey asked about. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of households that will have a very  
difficult time under any scenario,'' Brobeck said. But he noted, 
``In every income class there are savers and there are spenders ... 
there are still, even in the lower-income classes, a minority who 
save and accumulate wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,010 Americans 18 and older conducted  
July 22-25, has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. It was released along with a companion study of household 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	An analysis of the latest Census Bureau data -- from 1995 -- found  
that the median savings of American families, meaning half have 
more and half have less, was just $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes the value of money in the bank and stocks and  
bonds, minus household debts other than mortgages, such as credit 
card balances. Without subtracting debt, the median savings was 
$2,700. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included was the value of home equity or other property and  
pensions or 401(k) retirement plans sponsored by employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists are concerned about the low savings rate among  
Americans, which has persisted even during the ongoing economic 
boom which has raised wages in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Revisions to government figures released Thursday show that the  
national savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable 
income -- is not as bad as previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	But Americans, who saved at a rate of 2.1 percent in the third  
quarter of 1999 according to the new estimates, are still the 
world's biggest spendthrifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't have a plan they operate day to day and  
paycheck to paycheck,'' said Plumeri. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer federation and Primerica are using the poll and  
study to kick off an educational campaign that will offer tips on 
saving.

<HEADLINE> FAA Issues New Fuel Tank Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Aviation Administration today  
announced steps to ensure that airplane fuel tanks are less 
susceptible to explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a special regulation, the agency is ordering that aircraft  
makers develop a new maintenance program for fuel tanks within the 
next 12 months. The programs must assume that the tanks always 
contain an explosive mixture during all maintenance, ground and 
in-flight operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Once that program is developed, aircraft operators will have six  
months to adopt maintenance programs that incorporate the tasks 
identified by aircraft builders. 
</P>
<P>
	The special rule also states that new planes -- both those being  
designed and those on the assembly line -- must contain fuel systems 
that minimize the development of flammable vapors or provide a 
means to prevent catastrophic damage to an aircraft if ignition 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The special regulation would effect 6,000 airplanes in the  
current transport fleet including such familiar models as the 
Boeing 737, the Boeing 747 and some models made by the European 
aircraft maker Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA action is an outgrowth of research into fuel tank safety  
that started with the July 1996 explosion of TWA flight 800. During 
that flight, a 747 bound for Paris exploded shortly after takeoff 
from New York, killing all 230 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	A final report about the cause of that accident is not expected  
until early next year, but investigators have concluded that the 
airplane's near-empty center fuel tank exploded. Since then, the 
FAA has required new inspections and maintenance work on the wires, 
tubing and fuel quantity measuring systems in the tanks, all with 
the intent of eliminating explosion risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The new special regulation is aimed at further improving the  
safety margin around fuel tanks. The FAA estimated that the cost of 
the new program will be $170 million over 10 years. The regulation 
will not take effect for at least 90 days to allow comment from 
interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The action represents a fundamental change in how fuel tanks  
are designed, maintained and operated,'' said FAA Administrator 
Jane Garvey. ``This package results from literally thousands of 
staff hours in investigations and research and development. Indeed, 
that work is continuing with a broad range of research projects.''

<HEADLINE> Fair Housing Enforcement Seeked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advocates for the disabled asked Congress to  
reject legislation that would protect some builders from 
prosecution for unknowingly violating laws requiring them to make 
new housing more accessible to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Companies that broke the law by refusing to build accessible  
housing do not deserve a 'Get out of jail free' card,'' Christopher 
Anders, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But a North Carolina builder said he was in jeopardy of losing  
his business because the Justice Department cited him for violating 
a law he was unaware of. Len Tozer, a licensed general contractor 
from the Winterville, N.C., area, said once he found out about the 
law, he found he supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the guns of the U.S. Department of Justice aimed at me  
was very disturbing,'' Tozer told the House Judiciary Committee's 
panel on the Constitution on Thursday. ``I feel I have been treated 
unfairly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue are amendments to the federal Fair Housing Act enacted  
in 1988, which imposed minimum standards for the design of some 
apartment buildings, subcommittee Chairman Charles Canady, R-Fla., 
said. The amendments required that newly constructed multifamily 
housing have features that would make it accessible to people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Canady said the government didn't do enough to make sure that  
builders, architects and engineers knew about the changes. 
Consequently, builders who received building permits from local 
governments assumed they could begin building and remained unaware 
of additional requirements in federal law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, it has been the industry practice for  
architects and builders to rely on local building code authorities 
for assurances of legal compliance,'' Canady said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill introduced by Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., would exempt  
builders from prosecution if their buildings were designed for 
occupancy after March 13, 1991 -- the date on which the changes 
became effective -- but before the day the Jones bill would go into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify, a builder would have had to received a building  
permit or another type of approval from local building authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of concentrating its efforts on education and ensuring  
that these standards became part of building codes, the federal 
government has essentially paid bounties to nongovernmental 
organizations to find builders who are out of compliance with the 
law,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil  
rights, said he opposed the Jones bill, which was passed with the 
support of housing industry trade groups. ``The Fair Housing Act 
accessibility requirements for multifamily housing are very simple, 
basic and reasonable,'' he said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement released by the National Multi Housing Council, the  
American Seniors Housing Association and the National Apartment 
Association said the problem could be solved without legislation if 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development would step up 
efforts to education builders instead of stepping up enforcement.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Urge Police Hiring Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite fresh criticism from Republicans, a  
crowd of Democrats stood just outside the Capitol on Thursday to 
call for extending a program aimed at putting 100,000 new police 
officers on neighborhood streets across the nation by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill introduced by Rep. Anthony David Weiner, D-N.Y., and Rep.  
Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., would authorize $1.15 billion a year 
through 2005 for what the White House has called ``the logical 
successor'' to the program -- an effort to add 50,000 more new 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican critics succeeded in keeping any money for that new  
program out of budget bills now working their way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is making a difference and we would be foolish  
not to continue with its success,'' said Michigan Rep. David 
Bonior, the House's second-ranking Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonior and fellow Democrats spoke shortly after Republicans on  
the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee expressed 
reservations about the current Community Oriented Policing 
Services, or COPS program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no secret that the president has long made the COPS  
program a centerpiece of his crime agenda,'' said Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee. ``I am convinced 
that if we took all of the COPS funding each year and turned it 
into flexible block grants for local governments to fight crime as 
they see fit, and distributed on the basis of crime rates, we would 
be doing more to actually reduce crime than the COPS program 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The COPS program, which expires Sept. 30, was included in a 1994  
crime law championed by the president. It authorized $8.8 billion 
for grants to state and local police agencies to hire new officers 
or redeploy existing ones into street work with the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have called COPS a striking success that has driven  
crime rates down, but Republicans have said the money would be put 
to better use if state and local police departments had more say in 
how it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released in July, Justice Department auditors said  
the Clinton administration probably would fall 40,000 short of its 
goal of deploying 100,000 new officers by the end of this fiscal 
year. COPS officials then said they planned to have allocated 
enough money to fund 100,000 new officers by that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The report contained other criticisms, Republicans noted.  
</P>
<P>
	Allocation of the grants is not tied to a community's crime  
rate, McCollum said, and many communities could lose their new 
officers once their grants expire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 60 percent of police agencies that have accepted the  
three-year COPS grants have not developed plans to retain officers 
once the federal funding dries up, as is ostensibly required to 
receive a grant,'' McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	COPS Director Thomas Frazier told the subcommittee that early  
recipients of the grants weren't required to have a retention plan, 
but the rules have been changed since then.

<HEADLINE> FEC To Offer Political Web Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diving into the uncharted waters of Internet  
politics, the Federal Election Commission is deciding what rules 
should be followed by Web sites set up independently of a political 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FEC plans to seek the public's suggestions for  
future regulations governing use of the Internet for political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting into the new frontier here,'' FEC spokesman Ron  
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the top of today's FEC agenda is a proposal that would allow  
individuals to set up their own Web sites, independent of a 
campaign, to tout a particular candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The sites could offer a link to the candidate's own Internet  
site. But as long as the individual operating the site was doing it 
independently from a personal computer it would not count as a 
contribution and therefore would not have to be reported by the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where an expenditure is made independent of the candidate, and  
is not coordinated with the campaign, and where nothing of value is 
provided to the campaign, the (campaign) committee is not expected 
to report the receipt of an in-kind contribution,'' according to a 
proposed opinion submitted by staff to the six-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was brought before the FEC by Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush's presidential committee, which said it had discovered several 
independent pro-Bush sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the agenda is the question of whether the Democracy  
Network, which is partially supported by the League of Women 
Voters, could provide nonpartisan information about federal 
candidates on the Web, including links to the candidates' Internet 
sites. Candidates will be invited to respond to e-mail and provide 
information about their positions on issues. The Democracy Network 
Web site will be part of America Online's Election 2000 coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC is considering a proposal to allow the Web site to  
operate without falling under federal limits on contributions or 
expenditures, since it does not support or oppose a particular 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Web site is a new type of multifaceted vehicle, owing in  
large part to the technology involved,'' the staff's proposed 
opinion said.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Says `No' to 2000 Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A day after suggesting he could run for  
president, Gov. Jesse Ventura insisted he will stay out of the race 
under most normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reform Party governor had told Harvard Current magazine  
earlier in the week that he would consider running if Minnesotans 
mobilized behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried to clear things up Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said that I'm not running, that I won't run and they said to  
me, 'Well what if it means saving the third-party movement?' 
</P>
<P>
	``And I said, if indeed it got to that point, it would require  
the people of Minnesota to come out and say, 'It's OK, governor, 
run for president.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He emphasized, ``It does not mean I'm doing it. I said that  
would simply be one thing that would have to happen, but the 'nos' 
preceded that. No. I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while Ventura denied presidential aspirations of his own, he  
acknowledged his long-standing policy of never saying never to 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, I don't know if tomorrow, anything can happen  
tomorrow. But I tell you no means no and you don't believe me for 
whatever reason,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Harvard student interviewers were ``really begging''  
him to run in an attempt to save the third party and that he was 
clear he wouldn't run. 
</P>
<P>
	He blamed the media for contorting his comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``But see, the interesting thing is the only thing that happens  
is you lift out what you need for a story so you lift out only the 
portions that look like I'm going to run so it can be then twisted 
into a story,'' Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, who on Monday abandoned the Republican Party to  
seek the Reform Party's presidential nomination, plans campaign 
appearances today in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said Buchanan is too conservative on social issues  
for the party, and has urged real estate tycoon Donald Trump to run 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the possibility of a meeting with Buchanan, Ventura  
said, ``It's not on my schedule.'' Asked whether he would support 
Buchanan as the Reform Party nominee, Ventura said, ``I plan to 
have no comment.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Courts S.C. Backers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan thinks he has the answer  
to the question nipping his heels after he left the GOP to seek the 
Reform Party's presidential nod. 
</P>
<P>
	Will Republican Party supporters follow?  
</P>
<P>
	``Look behind me. What do you think?'' he asked, taking note of  
more than 200 people who showed up Wednesday night for the debut 
here of his Reform Party candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan bristled at the thought that he would be considered a  
spoiler for the Republican or Democratic presidential nominees. He 
also said he doesn't accept the thought that ``anybody else who 
runs is a thief taking it away from those two parties that are 
entitled to the presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner,  
``hasn't held a debate yet, he hasn't ... gone into a primary yet, 
he hasn't gone into caucus yet and people are telling me I'm 
stealing the presidency from him. What is his entitlement to the 
presidency of the United States ahead of me?'' Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime supporter Walter McSherry, who sat in the front row as  
the crowd cheered ``Go Pat, Go'' before a speech, said he will 
continue to support Buchanan even though he doesn't think the 
conservative commentator can be elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Buchanan is intelligent enough to know a third party  
candidate is not going to be elected president,'' McSherry said. 
But he can force Bush to be more conservative and ``will perform a 
public service,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan sat for more than hour under the fluorescent lights of  
Maurice's Piggie Park as a line stretched through the parking lot 
with more than 75 people waiting to get his signature.

	``This is one of the best turnouts I've ever gotten in the state  
of South Carolina,'' Buchanan said. ``I think it's a clear sign 
this campaign is catching fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the crowd, a sprinkling of Confederate flag  
supporters cheered Buchanan, and one handed out shiny coins with 
``KEEP IT FLYING'' printed above a Confederate naval jack. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said he  
opposes the NAACP's boycott of the state to force the Confederate 
flag from the Statehouse dome and chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said one of his great-grandfathers died fighting for the  
Confederacy at Vicksburg, Miss., and another great-grandfather was 
captured outside of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``The men who fought here and died here to defend Columbia, it  
seems to me, ought to be respected and so should the flag under 
which they fought and died,'' Buchanan said.

<HEADLINE> T.R. Dunn Is Coach of WNBA's Sting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- T.R. Dunn, an assistant since July, has been  
promoted to head coach by the WNBA's Charlotte Sting. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed by the team  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn joined the Sting coaching staff July 13, when assistant Dan  
Hughes was made interim head coach. Charlotte's record at that time 
was 5-8, but a 10-9 finish put the Sting in the playoffs for the 
third time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn first came to Charlotte in 1991, as an assistant with the  
NBA's Hornets. He moved to Denver with the Nuggets in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played 14 seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, the  
Nuggets and the Phoenix Suns.

<HEADLINE>  Two Die in Blue Angels Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. (AP) -- A jet from the Navy's Blue  
Angels precision flying team crashed Thursday while trying to land 
during a training flight, killing two team members. 
</P>
<P>
	Cmdr. Jack Papp, a Navy spokesman in Pensacola, Fla., where the  
Blue Angels are based, confirmed the deaths. No names were released 
pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accident took place around 12:30 this afternoon. They were  
coming in to land, practicing arrival maneuvers when this 
happened,'' said Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon in Washington. ``We 
don't know what caused it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash happened near Moody Air Force Base, where the Blue  
Angels were scheduled to perform this weekend during the base's 
Community Appreciation Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The last crash involving the Navy's high-precision flying team,  
which has six F/A-18 jets, occurred in 1990. The last fatality 
occurred in 1985, in Niagara Falls, N.Y., when Lt. Cmdr. Michael 
Gershon died in a fiery crash after two planes collided during an 
air show. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's fatalities brought to 23 the number of Blue Angels  
pilots killed in air shows or training since the group was formed 
in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously if any sort of procedural or maintenance problems  
are revealed by the investigation they will be addressed 
aggressively by the Navy,'' Bacon said. ``This is its premier 
flying team, a team that performs to the amazement and pleasure of 
crowds all over the United States, and you can be sure the Navy 
will do whatever it can to make sure that this team is at the very 
top of its ability to fly.''

<HEADLINE> Dust Bowl Century's Worst Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was a cruel time for America, heat and  
drought of the 1930s compounding the Depression, turning the 
nation's breadbasket into a dust bowl in the worst weather event of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``Men and women huddled in their houses, and they tied  
handkerchiefs over their noses when they went out, and wore goggles 
to protect their eyes,'' John Steinbeck wrote of the period in 
``The Grapes of Wrath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More than any other weather or climate event, the 1930s  
drought shaped American society,'' Weatherwise magazine reports in 
its November-December issue, which chronicles the century's 10 
worst weather and climate events. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat and drought of the 1930s caused the legendary flight of  
thousands from the Great Plains to California, revolutionized farm 
policy and, combined with the Depression, brought misery to 
millions, Weatherwise pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans still remember this time when the wind raced over  
the land, lifting it into great clouds of dust, digging among the 
roots of the corn, as Steinbeck wrote, ``until the roots were freed 
by the prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways 
toward the earth and pointed the direction of the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherwise asked about 30 of its contributing writers and  
editors to rate the worst weather of the last 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a very subjective list,'' admitted Weatherwise managing  
editor Doyle Rice. But, he added, ``We thought it would be a fun 
way to finish off the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``These 10 events were chosen not only for the devastation they  
wrought upon human life and property, but also because they opened 
doors for scientific discovery, changed our understanding of 
meteorology and climatology, and tested the limits of our 
technology,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Second on the list was the super tornado outbreak of April 3-4,  
1974, that killed more than 300 people in a dozen states: Alabama, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Few other natural disasters in this country can eclipse the  
Galveston (Texas) hurricane for sheer, focused horror,'' the 
magazine observed in rating the storm on Sept. 8, 1900, which 
killed at least 6,000 people and perhaps double that, as the third 
worst weather event. 
</P>
<P>
	A more recent event ranked fourth, the superstorm of March  
12-15, 1993, that raked the coast from Florida to Maine, shutting 
down every airport from Washington to Boston and, in effect, 
shutting down many cities themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Number five was the deadly Tri-State Tornado of March 18, 1925,  
that killed more than 700 people on a path from Missouri to 
Illinois and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Andrew of 1992 placed sixth for its massive  
destruction in South Florida and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventh was another powerful hurricane, Camille, which crashed  
into the Gulf Coast the night of Aug. 17-18, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The great Mississippi River Valley flood of 1927, an event  
Weatherwise called ``perhaps the most underrated weather disaster 
of the century,'' was eighth. Almost a million people were 
evacuated because of the flood and the death toll may have been in 
the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
	The El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 that spawned unusual weather  
across the country ranked ninth. Its counterpart -- La Nina -- is 
still causing changes in storms affecting North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenth was the New England hurricane of Sept. 21, 1938, which  
killed nearly 600 people in the storm and the disastrous flooding 
that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its top 10, the magazine also listed seven  
``honorable mention'' disasters. They are the Midwest floods of 
1993; heat wave and drought of 1988; the November 1950, ``Storm of 
the Century;'' Florida Keys hurricane of 1938; New England blizzard 
of 1978; the cold, snowy winter of 1976-77; and the 1998 New 
England ice storm.

<HEADLINE> Devils Sign Elias, Morrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Devils forwards Patrik  
Elias and Brendan Morrison signed contracts Thursday and became 
eligible to rejoin the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The two players, who missed the first eight games of the season  
because of a contract holdout, agreed to terms on Monday, 
abandoning their bids for $1 million contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for them on the roster, the Devils placed center  
Jason Arnott and defenseman Brad Bombardir on the injured reserve 
list. Arnott has a mouth injury and Bombardir has torn ligaments in 
his esophagus, Devils spokesman Mike Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Morrison reportedly will get a one-year deal worth $500,000.  
Elias reportedly agreed to a three-year deal worth $650,000 
annually, double what he made last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Elias had 17 goals and 33 assists last season. Morrison, who had  
a base salary of about $400,000 last year, had 13 goals and 33 
assists.

<HEADLINE> Ali-Foreman Was 'Rumble in Jungle' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Foreman remembers why he went to Hawaii  
instead of home to Houston after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``The islanders and birds didn't know who I was,'' said Foreman,  
who was suffering from ``pain, disappointment and embarrassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman had lost the heavyweight championship of the world on an  
eighth-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me it seems like another world as I look back on it,''  
Foreman said of that fight on Oct. 30, 1974. ``I know I was 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There, was Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Congo. The opponent was  
Muhammad Ali. The fight was the Rumble in The Jungle -- a match that 
put ``rope-a-dope'' into the language of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was his idea (to go to the ropes),'' Angelo Dundee, Ali's  
trainer, said. ``I thought he was a dope. I was cussing him out 
every round, telling him to get in the middle of the ring. He told 
me, `I know what I'm doing.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	It was about 4:30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. Oct. 29 in the eastern United  
States) when Ali set out to regain the championship before more 
than 50,000 fans in the Twentieth of May Stadium, many of them 
screaming, ``Ali booma-yay (Ali kill him).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ali had made himself the ``hometown'' favorite, casting himself  
as the good guy against the fearsome 25-year-old champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most boxing people, however, viewed the fight as the 32-year-old  
Ali's last hurrah, not as another step up the ladder of legend. It 
had been seven years since Ali had been stripped of the title for 
refusing induction into the military and it had been about 3 1/2 years 
since he had failed to regain the championship against Joe Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the wise-cracking, poetry-spouting Ali and the brooding  
Foreman stood flamboyant promoter Don King, who got the two 
fighters to sign for $5 million each. He then got people to put up 
the money, some of it from President Mobutu of Zaire, who was 
seeking world-wide publicity for himself and his country. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight was set for Sept. 25, but had to be rescheduled when  
Foreman got cut in sparring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the postponement hurt me,'' Foreman said in a  
telephone interview Thursday. ``He was always going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dundee was confident that Ali would win, even though Ali's  
strategy bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sensed it from the get-go,'' he said by telephone. ``My guy  
(Ali) just had the style to beat this guy. In this profession, 
style is everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's style back then was to bludgeon opponents into  
submission. Ali was to ``float like a butterfly, sting like a 
bee,'' although he floated slower and stung less in 1974 than he 
did when he dazzled boxing during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd been knocking everybody out. Now, I would have considered  
winning a decision good,'' said Foreman, adding he was a much 
smarter fighter when he came back in 1987 after a 10-year layoff to 
become history's oldest heavyweight champion than he was in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali, who now suffers from Parkinson's Disease, would lose, then  
win the title a third time before retiring in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	When Foreman got cut, many boxing writers left and others en  
route to the fight reversed themselves and returned home to await 
the new date. The fighters and their camps remained. 
</P>
<P>
	Dundee couldn't remember how long he stayed, but he said,  
``There were 2,624 hyacinths on the Zaire (Congo) River. I counted 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also passed time by regaling anybody by how he had learned to  
train lizards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just had to make the best of it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, with an equatorial African dawn approaching, the fight  
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman began looking for a knockout from the opening bell, and  
his sledge-hammer blows had onlookers thinking it was just a matter 
of time before he succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was looking for a home run,'' Dundee said.  
</P>
<P>
	After three rounds, Ali had devised the rope-a-dope and Foreman  
was puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe I hadn't knocked him out in the third  
round,'' Foreman said. ``I hit him some hard shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman kept winging away, while Ali covered, blocked many of  
the champion's punches and occasionally fired away in flurries. An 
eight-punch flurry by Ali at the end of the fifth round changed the 
course of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman began to tire, and late in the eighth round Ali threw a  
combination off the ropes, and Foreman corkscrewed his way to the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	A video tape of the fight confirmed that Foreman was up before  
referee Zack Clayton reached the count of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman complained that he did beat the count, but Thursday he  
said, ``He'd probably would have put me back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty bitter for a lot of years,'' Foreman said. ``I  
never got the feeling he beat me. But you have to shake it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman returned to a 20-by-30 dressing room jammed with about  
200 people who wanted to know, ``George, what happened?'' Bill 
Caplan, who was Foreman's publicity man, said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other dressing room, the world press was listening to Ali  
bellow, ``I told you I was The Greatest.''

<HEADLINE> Employers Stingy on Health Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Employers are no more likely to offer health  
insurance coverage today than they were in 1996, even as insurance 
premiums have remained stable and the U.S. economy prospered. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies that provide coverage have started to shift more  
insurance costs to their employees, reduced benefits for mental 
health care and limited assistance to retirees, according to a 
study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While nearly all companies with 200 or more workers in 1999  
offered health insurance benefits, just 60 percent of smaller firms 
did so -- virtually the same level as in 1996, said the report by 
Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent health care philanthropic 
research organization, and the Health Research and Educational 
Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found surprisingly strong support among  
employers, particularly of small firms, for the right of patients 
to sue their health plan, which is contentious issue being debated 
in Congress. Though employer groups have fought the proposal along 
with HMOs, saying it will increase health costs, 61 percent of 
small firms agreed with the provision, compared to 26 percent of 
large firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of small and medium-sized employers to add coverage  
is one reason the number of Americans without health insurance has 
increased from 39 million in 1994 to 44 million in 1998, employee 
benefits experts say. Though more Americans are working today, many 
of the new jobs do not include insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	If employers are unwilling to expand coverage in times of  
economic prosperity, that does not bode well for what will happen 
if the economy sours, said Jon Gabel, an author of the report and 
vice president with the Health Research and Education Trust. 
``We're treading water. If we can't expand coverage now, we never 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employers contend health insurance premiums still remain too  
high and they're worried that if they start providing the coverage, 
they would not be able to keep up with rising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many employers are scared to death of health care insurance,''  
said Becky Cherney, president of the Central Florida Healthcare 
Coalition, which represents about 100 employers. That's because 
they see giant private and government health insurance programs 
struggling to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers realize once you give the benefit, you can never  
take it away because it becomes a right,'' Cherney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurance premiums for all employers increased an average  
of 4.8 percent in 1999, the highest increase since 1994, according 
to the study, which was based on a survey of 1,934 public and 
private employers conducted last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But smaller employers (those with less than 200 employees), who  
have less negotiating clout with insurers, this year saw premiums 
increase 6.9, compared to a 2.1 percent rise in 1996, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance premiums are expected to increase about 8 percent next  
year, largely due to rising cost of prescription drugs, other 
surveys have found. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tight job market most small employers want to offer  
health insurance benefits but can't afford it, said Jim Weidman, a 
spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, 
which represents 600,000 small firms. He said employers would 
prefer to use any extra profits to give employees raises. ``Despite 
the good economy, profits are not keeping up with increases in 
health insurance premiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other key findings in the study showed:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Employees paid on average $145 per month this year for family  
health insurance coverage, up from $52 in 1988. Employees now pay 
32 percent of the costs of family coverage, up from 29 percent in 
1988. Employees opting for single coverage now pay 16 percent of 
the total cost, up from 11 percent in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	-- During the past two years, 35 percent of large companies that  
offered retiree coverage capped their maximum contribution, and 7 
percent dropped traditional indemnity coverage in favor of managed 
care plans. About 41 percent of large companies provide retiree 
coverage, the same as in 1996. -- About 21 percent of workers in 
large firms had unlimited outpatient mental health benefits, down 
from 36 percent in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only good news in the report for workers was this: The  
percentage of women employees in health maintenance organizations 
who can select an obstetrician/gynecologist as a primary care 
doctor rose to 67 percent in 1999, up from 49 percent a year ago.

<HEADLINE>  Love Leads at Tour Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The fog lifted and unveiled a first round in the  
Tour Championship that was as shocking as it was sad. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods hit through a rock the size of a baseball and left  
the course holding his left wrist in pain. Bob Estes hit the 
shortest drive in PGA Tour history. And Davis Love III, so shaken 
by an emotional service for Payne Stewart that he almost left, 
returned to take a one-stroke lead after an unforgettable day. 
</P>
<P>
	And the toughest part is still to come.  
</P>
<P>
	Not long after making nine birdies in 27 holes for a score of  
7-under 99 at Champions Golf Club, Love and Woods boarded a private 
plane for Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service for Stewart, among six people killed in a  
plane crash on Monday, is at 11 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the 29 players in the lucrative Tour Championship  
will have to figure out how to put their effort and concentration 
into what felt like a silly game in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't excite me,'' Love said. ``The fun doesn't last  
very long. It was more like work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Love, the fun included two birdie putts over 40 feet long  
and a 30-foot chip-in, along with having the actor from the ``Sign 
Boy'' commercial writing the initials ``P.S.'' on his hat, a 
tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also that woman he saw wearing knickers. And there  
was that plane carrying a banner that read, ``We will remember you, 
Payne,'' that caused Love to take 10 minutes over a 4-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole day I was thinking about all kinds of things --  
events of the week, all kinds of other crazy thoughts,'' Love said. 
``When you're not concentrating, it's hard to stay focused. I 
definitely wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard on Woods in other ways.  
</P>
<P>
	One stroke out of the lead with four holes to play, his drive on  
No. 15 came to rest next to a tree and directly in front of a rock. 
He couldn't move the rock without the ball moving, too, which would 
have been a one-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of taking a drop, Woods took a wedge and blasted through  
the rock, causing the ball to squirt sideways and advance about 30 
yards. He managed to hit the green and two-putt for bogey, but 
winced on every shot after that. 
</P>
<P>
	He grabbed his left wrist after his approach into No. 18 and  
didn't see the ball land four feet from the hole for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my wrist, it's my whole arm,'' Woods said before  
heading off to the fitness trailer. ``It's just a little stinger, a 
pinched nerve somewhere. It don't have the strength I normally 
have. They'll fix it. I should be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There may be no fixing the club; the grooves were flattened by  
the impact of the rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an interesting shot,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	The only other shot more unusual than that came from Estes. His  
tears from a touching memorial service for Stewart were barely dry 
when he arrived on No. 10 tee, the starting point for the day, and 
decided to pay his own tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached for the putter and rapped his opening ``drive'' a  
whopping 16 feet -- about the length of the putt Stewart made in 
June to win the U.S. Open. From there, Estes hit 3-wood and wound 
up with a double bogey -- and no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people, I'm sure, were surprised and didn't know what  
I was doing,'' said Estes, who was at even-par for the day. ``As I 
walked back to the bag, I just said, `That was for Payne.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Because no one took Stewart's place in the field of top 30  
money-winners, Duffy Waldorf played alone. He decorated every one 
of his balls with colorful inscriptions about Stewart. One had a 
cross with the words, ``In a better place'' written next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	All the players wore a black ribbon tied to their hats or  
shirts, and some attached a tartan to their bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Funk, Carlos Franco and Steve Pate were at 5-under. Nick  
Price was among those another stroke back. David Duval, paired with 
Woods for only the second time on tour, hit two balls in the water 
on the front side and finished 2-under. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores, however, were relative.  
</P>
<P>
	The gallery was subdued, perhaps sensing the somber mood of the  
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times out there today I felt like I was on the  
verge of tears,'' said Justin Leonard, who was at 2-under. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no avoiding tears Thursday morning during a chilling  
tribute to Stewart, highlighted by a lone bagpiper emerging from 
the fog while playing a Scottish tune called, ``Going Home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we got through that, getting out on the golf course was  
good,'' Funk said. ``But at the same time, I could not forget that 
Payne wasn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lehman talked about the family that is the PGA Tour during  
an informal dinner Wednesday night, and he spoke and prayed during 
the memorial service Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he had to play, no small task.  
</P>
<P>
	``There were not a lot of highs out there,'' he said after  
finishing even-par. ``You tried to do your best, but even-par was 
the best I could do. It's going to be tough to come back on 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Love wondered how he could play at all.  
</P>
<P>
	After the service, he walked across the practice green when  
Leonard, searching for anything to say to break the ice, asked Love 
when he was going to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might just go in a little while,'' Love told him.  
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he summoned enough strength to play and turned in the  
lowest score of a sad, sometimes spooky, day. It was important to 
get one round behind them, but the process will start over again on 
Saturday when he comes off another emotional service and faces 27 
holes on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Love says believes that's where they should be.  
</P>
<P>
	``The focus is not on us, not on the tournament and not on the  
scores,'' he said. ``It's on the loss of a lot of fathers and 
husbands.''

<HEADLINE>  Love Leads at Tour Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The fog lifted and unveiled a first round in the  
Tour Championship that was as shocking as it was sad. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods hit through a rock the size of a baseball and left  
the course holding his left wrist in pain. Bob Estes hit the 
shortest drive in PGA Tour history. And Davis Love III, so shaken 
by an emotional service for Payne Stewart that he almost left, 
returned to take a one-stroke lead after an unforgettable day. 
</P>
<P>
	And the toughest part is still to come.  
</P>
<P>
	Not long after making nine birdies in 27 holes for a score of  
7-under 99 at Champions Golf Club, Love and Woods boarded a private 
plane for Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial service for Stewart, among six people killed in a  
plane crash on Monday, is at 11 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the 29 players in the lucrative Tour Championship  
will have to figure out how to put their effort and concentration 
into what felt like a silly game in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just didn't excite me,'' Love said. ``The fun doesn't last  
very long. It was more like work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Love, the fun included two birdie putts over 40 feet long  
and a 30-foot chip-in, along with having the actor from the ``Sign 
Boy'' commercial writing the initials ``P.S.'' on his hat, a 
tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also that woman he saw wearing knickers. And there  
was that plane carrying a banner that read, ``We will remember you, 
Payne,'' that caused Love to take 10 minutes over a 4-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole day I was thinking about all kinds of things --  
events of the week, all kinds of other crazy thoughts,'' Love said. 
``When you're not concentrating, it's hard to stay focused. I 
definitely wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was hard on Woods in other ways.  
</P>
<P>
	One stroke out of the lead with four holes to play, his drive on  
No. 15 came to rest next to a tree and directly in front of a rock. 
He couldn't move the rock without the ball moving, too, which would 
have been a one-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of taking a drop, Woods took a wedge and blasted through  
the rock, causing the ball to squirt sideways and advance about 30 
yards. He managed to hit the green and two-putt for bogey, but 
winced on every shot after that. 
</P>
<P>
	He grabbed his left wrist after his approach into No. 18 and  
didn't see the ball land four feet from the hole for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my wrist, it's my whole arm,'' Woods said before  
heading off to the fitness trailer. ``It's just a little stinger, a 
pinched nerve somewhere. It don't have the strength I normally 
have. They'll fix it. I should be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There may be no fixing the club; the grooves were flattened by  
the impact of the rock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an interesting shot,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	The only other shot more unusual than that came from Estes. His  
tears from a touching memorial service for Stewart were barely dry 
when he arrived on No. 10 tee, the starting point for the day, and 
decided to pay his own tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached for the putter and rapped his opening ``drive'' a  
whopping 16 feet -- about the length of the putt Stewart made in 
June to win the U.S. Open. From there, Estes hit 3-wood and wound 
up with a double bogey -- and no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people, I'm sure, were surprised and didn't know what  
I was doing,'' said Estes, who was at even-par for the day. ``As I 
walked back to the bag, I just said, `That was for Payne.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Because no one took Stewart's place in the field of top 30  
money-winners, Duffy Waldorf played alone. He decorated every one 
of his balls with colorful inscriptions about Stewart. One had a 
cross with the words, ``In a better place'' written next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	All the players wore a black ribbon tied to their hats or  
shirts, and some attached a tartan to their bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Funk, Carlos Franco and Steve Pate were at 5-under. Nick  
Price was among those another stroke back. David Duval, paired with 
Woods for only the second time on tour, hit two balls in the water 
on the front side and finished 2-under. 
</P>

	Scores, however, were relative.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Approves Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *By ALAN FRAM    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed the last and biggest  
spending bill of fiscal 2000 through the House on Thursday despite 
a promised veto by President Clinton, even as the president 
abandoned efforts to overhaul Social Security and Medicare for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending measure, approved on a near party-line 218-211  
vote, also carries a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut in federal 
agencies' budgets. Senate passage is expected early next week, the 
next step in a political dance that will lead to a Clinton veto and 
then intensified budget talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Republicans claimed a triumph as they moved toward  
finishing the last of the new fiscal year's 13 annual spending 
bills. They also rallied around twin themes -- protecting Social 
Security and not boosting taxes -- that they hope will propel them 
in next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's vote is a victory for the American taxpayer and  
America's seniors,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, as dozens 
of GOP lawmakers gathered on the Capitol's East Lawn. A four-piece 
jazz band played ``Pennies from Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, please make the responsible decision for  
American taxpayers and American seniors and sign this important 
bill into law,'' said Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton stood ready to veto the measure because of the  
damage he said the spending cuts would inflict on defense, schools 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He also objected that the GOP did not provide money he sought to  
help communities hire thousands of elementary school teachers. The 
president also joined congressional Democrats in insisting that 
Republicans already had violated their own pledge and were on track 
to spend billions in Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to work together to get a budget that  
works,'' Clinton told reporters. ``And all this sort of smoke and 
mirrors that they have been doing and claiming that we and the 
Democrats were trying to spend the Social Security surplus when 
they were spending it all along is not helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side, however, was ready to let the budget fight produce  
a government shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	So Congress sent Clinton a measure letting federal agencies  
function through Nov. 5 as the two sides work through their 
differences. It was the third temporary extension for agencies 
since fiscal 2000 began on Oct. 1; the second was set to expire 
Friday night. The House vote was 424-2, Senate passage was by voice 
vote, and Clinton's signature were expected quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton acknowledged what has been a political fact  
in Washington for many weeks: that his proposals to extend the 
solvency of Medicare and Social Security, and create a new Medicare 
prescription drug benefit, would have to wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're making a big mistake,'' Clinton said of GOP  
opposition to handling those matters in Congress' few remaining 
weeks. He added, ``We can come back to all that early next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overhauling Social Security and Medicare, the government's huge  
pension and health-care programs, have been a top Clinton priority. 
But the political and technical difficulties of revamping those 
programs, plus the enormous price tags, have made it difficult for 
a bipartisan consensus to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending bill the House approved Thursday contained $314  
billion for education, labor and health programs for the new fiscal 
year and $429 million for the District of Columbia budget. It 
included more than Clinton wanted for the Job Corps and AIDS 
treatment, but less than he wants for substance abuse and programs 
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also stuffed with scores of home-district projects,  
including $250,000 for a Philadelphia ballet school to serve poor 
children in southern New Jersey and $2.5 million to train 
construction workers in Fairbanks, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	But in truth, the measure was all about a GOP effort to gain  
leverage in upcoming budget bargaining by letting them assert they 
had finished Congress' spending business without dipping into 
Social Security's surpluses. Those talks will encompass differences 
over the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and 
five other Cabinet level departments, plus dozens of agencies and 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties spent Social Security surpluses for decades without  
affecting the program's benefits or solvency. Most analysts say it 
will take changes in the pension system's benefits and revenues to 
prop it up for the upcoming retirement of the baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the budget battle has been about politics. Underlining the  
political significance of Social Security, both sides produced 
similar documents from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office 
to buttress their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats distributed a table showing GOP spending bills would  
dip into Social Security for $17 billion. Republicans sent out the 
same table with an additional line showing $18 billion in 
``adjustments'' -- where the GOP ordered the budget office to count 
spending differently -- so that Social Security money would be left 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a giant fudge-ball of gimmicks by the Republican Party to  
pretend they are helping Social Security,'' Rep. David Obey, 
D-Wis., said of the spending measure and its reliance on budget 
contrivances. 
</P>
<P>
	House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said  
Republicans had delivered on their promises to protect Social 
Security and boost education and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``After this bill gets to the White House, the final phase will  
be to deal with the president's vetoes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the budget differences between Clinton and Republicans  
are relatively minor.

<HEADLINE> CBS Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. said today earned a  
better-than-expected $35 million in the third quarter on strong 
performance in its TV network operations and its Infinity 
Broadcasting radio and outdoor advertising division. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, which plans to merge with entertainment conglomerate Viacom  
Inc., reported income from continuing operations of $35 million, or 
5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $38 million, or 5 cents a 
share, in the third quarter of 1998, which included a special 
charge related to a corporate restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was $47 million, or 7 cents a share, in the  
July-September quarter, compared with a loss of $43 million, or 6 
cents a share, a year earlier. These results reflect one-time items 
including a $12 million gain for an accounting change in the latest 
quarter. The results in the latest quarter were a penny above 
analyst expectations. CBS' stock was up $3.31 at $48.50 a share on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $1.71 billion, up from $1.58 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Infinity said its net income rose to $111  
million, or 13 cents a share, in the third quarter from $67 
million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues were $619 
million, up from $534 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity stock trades separately on the NYSE. It was up $2.19 at  
$34.06 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Karmazin, president and chief executive officer of CBS, said  
in a statement the strong third-quarter performance reflected 
Infinity's showing as well as good results from CBS television and 
cable divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested this would continue into the fourth quarter, noting  
that ``the CBS Television Network enjoyed a strong start to the 
1999-2000 season, with ratings gains in prime time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement accompanying the earnings results said CBS expects  
to close its $2.5 billion purchase of King World Productions Inc. 
in the fourth quarter. King World supplies first-run syndicated 
programing. 
</P>
<P>
	Infinity, meanwhile, will be closing its purchase of Outdoor  
Systems Inc., one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom announced in September it planned to buy CBS Corp. for  
more than $35 billion in the largest media merger ever. Federal 
regulators could force divestiture of some television stations as a 
condition for approving the deal. The two companies have extensive 
interests in TV, movies, radio and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS report said income from continuing operations was $138  
million, or 19 cents a share, for the first nine months this year 
compared with a loss of $15 million, or 2 cents a share, in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, net income totaled $529  
million, or 74 cents a share, compared with a loss of $20 million, 
or 3 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $5.15 billion, up from $5.01 billion a year  
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	At Infinity, net income for the first nine months of the year  
was $259 million, or 30 cents a share, up from $166 million, or 24 
cents a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months, revenues were $1.69 billion compared  
with $1.32 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Twins Owner Griffith Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Minnesota Twins owner Calvin Griffith  
was remembered Thursday as a man who stood by his principles, never 
did anything conventionally, always had fun and -- most of all -- 
loved baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people, including former Twins players, employees,  
family members and friends, gathered to memorialize Griffith at 
Westminster Presbyterian Church in downtown Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith died Oct. 20 in Melbourne, Fla., at 87 of complications  
from pneumonia, a kidney infection and a high fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith delighted millions in the Upper Midwest -- and angered  
millions of Washington Senators fans -- when he moved the team to 
Minnesota after the 1960 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to Minnesota also created true happiness for the owner,  
said his son, Clark: ``Calvin seemed happier and freer than ever 
before,'' when the 1961 season opened at Metropolitan Stadium in 
Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis ``Cat'' Cleary, who played for the Senators in 1942 and  
'43 and then worked in various capacities for the Twins for four 
decades, said Griffith almost always seemed to be in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always managed to have fun somehow,'' Cleary, 83, said.  
``They printed in the Washington Post one time, `How can a team in 
last place always be so happy?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Griffith was always happy because he spent nearly his  
entire adult life involved in baseball, until he sold the Twins in 
1984. During a Metrodome ceremony for the sale to current owner 
Carl Pohlad, Griffith wept. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball was Calvin's life. Every day he was involved in  
baseball in some way or another,'' Cleary said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1920s, Griffith was a bat boy and the mascot for  
the Senators, the team for which his uncle and adopted father, 
Clark, became a Hall of Fame pitcher. Griffith also managed in the 
Senators' minor league system and worked in the front office. He 
took control of the team when Clark Griffith died in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheelock Whitney, a minority owner of the Minnesota Vikings and  
a Twins board member, said baseball in Griffith's time was simpler 
than today's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith represented ``green grass, black dirt, hot dogs,  
expensive Cokes, white uniforms and those magic nights at Met 
Stadium,'' Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith's baseball world began falling apart in the 1970s, when  
free agency began driving up salaries, teams discovered the need to 
advertise and market their product, and the role of corporate 
sponsors in the game increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins and Griffith refused to change with the times, Clark  
Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was told to manage his public relations,'' Griffith said.  
``Very few of us could have handled the negative press he received. 
He could. In fact, I think he liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was regularly criticized by the media during the  
last years he owned the Twins, Griffith received some credit for 
the Twins' success even after he sold the team to Pohlad, a banker. 
Several of the mainstays on the 1987 team that won the World Series 
were signed or drafted under Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith will be buried Saturday at Fort Lincoln Cemetery in  
Brentwood, Md.

<HEADLINE> Are the Rams Now America's Team? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With apologies to the Dallas Cowboys, the St. Louis Rams are now  
America's Team. 
</P>
<P>
	How else to explain why they're 3 1/2-point favorites in Nashville  
Sunday against the 5-1 Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	OK, the Rams have won their six games by an average margin of  
36-10, while four of Tennessee's five wins are by a total of eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Also consider:  
</P>
<P>
	--Kurt Warner now has played well in six straight games, an  
indication that he's not a fluke who will be shut down once 
opponents watch enough tape. 
</P>
<P>
	--Marshall Faulk has been brilliant the past two weeks. Who do  
you load up on? Faulk? Isaac Bruce and Warner? 
</P>
<P>
	--While everyone's been watching the St. Louis offense, the  
defense has allowed only 63 points, lowest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Titans, coming off a bye week, might have a rusty Steve  
McNair back at quarterback rather than Neil O'Donnell, the winner 
in four games since McNair went out. 
</P>
<P>
	No, the Rams haven't beaten a team with a winning record. But  
the Titans have done it only once, at Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	RAMS, 24-10.   	
</P>

seconds.

<P>
                   *Dallas (plus 3) at Indianapolis

	The Cowboys have lost their last two road games by the same  
score -- 13-10.

	This won't be 13-10.

<P>
                       *Miami (off) at Oakland    	
</P>
<P>
	The ``off'' is becuse of Dan Marino, who will sit while Damon  
Huard plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of Miami's five wins are by a total of 10 points. The  
Raiders haven't had a game decided by more than a touchdown.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Remembered at Texas Service  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- In a chilling start to the Tour Championship, a  
lone bagpiper marching through the fog played ``Going Home'' today 
as players gathered on the first tee of the Champions Golf Club to 
remember U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he died on Monday, a big part of us died, too,'' said Tom  
Lehman, who offered a prayer after a brief service that left 
everyone somber and most in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	About 45 minutes after the service, Duffy Waldorf teed off on  
No. 10 by himself in what will be a tournament like no other. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every one was convinced the tour should have proceeded with  
the $5 million Tour Championship for the top 30 on the money list. 
But PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and Davis Love III were among 
those who said it could be a platform to honor Stewart's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a winner of 18 tournaments around the world and three  
major championships, was as traditional as golf with his knickers 
and tam o'shanter cap. The scene at his memorial service likewise 
took on the very nature of golf's roots. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrouded by an eerie fog, the bagpiper walked 100 yards toward  
the first tee playing a song about a Scotsman finally returning to 
his homeland. Among those not in the field who came to the service 
were Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw, Steve Elkington and Doug 
Sanders, who like Stewart was renowned for his colorful attire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
on Monday took from us one of our great champions,'' Finchem said. 
``Payne Stewart was a great champion, a tenacious competitor -- no 
better example than the U.S. Open -- and a real showman. Payne 
represented the best of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important not to lose sight of the most important thing  
about Payne Stewart. He was a man of great faith, a devoted, 
compassionate and most energetic husband and father, and a man of 
tremendous generosity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service was short and simple, but long on emotion.  
</P>
<P>
	While not every player in the field gathered around the first  
tee, those who did had their heads bowed or stared vacantly as 
Lehman spoke about Stewart. Lehman then offered a prayer, asking 
for comfort for Stewart's wife and two children, and the families 
of the other five victims in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very emotional guy,'' Lehman said. ``He loved to  
laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not going to be ashamed of 
my tears this morning, and neither should you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He paused often to speak clearly through the tears.  
</P>
<P>
	After a moment of silence, the bagpiper, Steve Agan of Houston,  
played ``Amazing Grace.'' He then turned his back on the players 
and blew into the pipes once more, playing ``Going Home'' as he 
walked down the first fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the fog was beginning to lift.

<HEADLINE> Coke Eyes Price-Adjusting Machines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. is studying wireless technology  
that could allow bottlers to raise or lower soda prices by remote 
control at certain times -- say, during hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower prices during periods of slower sales would presumably  
bring in more business -- unless the higher prices at other times 
enraged customers. But a spokesman for the world's biggest soft 
drink maker said the company has no immediate plans to put such a 
machine into the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the pricing is something we don't see happening  
anytime soon, if ever,'' spokesman Rob Baskin said today. ``You 
could probably make a vending machine that could fly, too, but I 
don't think we would do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the company is testing a  
machine that can automatically raise prices for its drinks during 
hot weather. It also quoted chairman and chief executive M. Douglas 
Ivester's comments on the subject earlier this month to a Brazilian 
newsmagazine, Veja. 
</P>
<P>
	The desire for a cold drink increases during the summer heat,  
Ivester said, so ``it is fair that it should be more expensive. The 
machine will simply make this process automatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said Coke's research and development department is  
evaluating several technologies for new machines to allow the 
company to remotely collect data such as how full the machines are 
and how often they are visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke is one of several beverage makers interested in such data  
because the information could increase the machines' productivity, 
said Ron Sewell, president of Automated Network Solutions, a 
Roswell, Ga., company assisting Coke with the tests.

<HEADLINE> McKeon Accepts Extension With Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Jack McKeon, who managed the Cincinnati Reds  
to the threshold of the National League playoffs, accepted a 
one-year contract extension today that was less than he'd expected. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon, who will be 69 next month, had hoped for a multiyear  
deal after the Reds won 96 games, their best total since the days 
of the Big Red Machine during the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds offered only a one-year deal that improved slightly on  
the approximately $500,000 he made last season. After several days 
of discussions, he accepted rather than walk away from managing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Reds organization is pleased that Jack will be returning  
for 2000,'' chief operating officer John Allen said. ``His 
dedication to the major league club and to our player development 
plans were an important part of our success in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon replaced Ray Knight during the 1997 season and got  
one-year deals for the next two years, when the Reds were in the 
midst of a full-scale rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds were one of the biggest surprises in baseball this  
season, contending despite a $35 million payroll that was only half 
as large as the payrolls of some competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	McKeon's easy-going style allowed the Reds' young lineup to  
flourish. He gave coach Don Gullett control of the pitching staff, 
and the Reds managed to get by with an unreliable rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds were in line to make the playoffs as the NL wild card  
until losing three of their last four games, resulting in a tie 
with the New York Mets. The Reds lost a one-game playoff with the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden touted McKeon as NL Manager of the  
Year and assured that he'd return for 2000. The Reds had to wait to 
make McKeon an offer until a new ownership group took over for 
Marge Schott this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Although McKeon was initially unhappy with the offer made last  
Friday, he had few alternatives. He wasn't a candidate for any of 
the other managerial openings.

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Profit Nearly Triples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Third-quarter operating profits nearly tripled  
at MCI WorldCom, the telecommunications juggernaut that's acquiring 
Sprint in the biggest corporate takeover ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplier of long-distance and Internet services said today  
it earned $1.1 billion or 55 cents per share in the three months 
ended Sept. 30, excluding the impact of an investment in Embratel, 
a Brazilian telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with a profit of $359 million or 19 cents a share  
in the same period last year from the combined operations of 
WorldCom and MCI Communications, which didn't complete their merger 
until the end of that quarter. The year-ago figures also exclude 
Embratel and merger-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected an operating profit of 54 cents a share in  
this year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter revenues, excluding Embratel, totaled $8.52  
billion, an improvement of 11 percent as compared with the combined 
$7.67 billion generated by the same operations in the third quarter 
of 1998. Including Embratel, revenue for the just-ended quarter 
totaled $9.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest revenue tally reflects the loss of $29 million in  
service credits issued to customers in compensation for the widely 
publicized outages during August on one of the company's Internet 
``backbone'' networks. The problems, caused by an upgrade to the 
system software running the network, were resolved after 10 days of 
disruptions, at which point MCI WorldCom granted 20 free days of 
service to about 3,000 business customers, including America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also attributed its strong showing to savings on  
operating costs following the MCI merger, as well as the industry's 
shifting focus toward the volume of calling and Internet services 
being purchased rather than long distance vs. local access 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	While voice minutes increased 12 percent in the third quarter  
compared with the combined WorldCom and MCI operations in the same 
period last year, they continued to shrink as a percentage of the 
company's overall network volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet, data and other non-traditional telecom services now  
make up almost 40 percent of MCI WorldCom's total revenues, and 
account for more than three-quarters of the company's revenue 
growth. Internet usage, as measured by connect hours, increased 83 
percent year-over-year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to anticipate and respond to rapid change in our  
industry -- technology advances, regulatory change and most 
significantly customer expectations,'' said Bernard J. Ebbers, 
president and chief executive of MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebbers pointed to the record $115 billion deal signed earlier  
this month to acquire Sprint as another step toward meeting a 
growing preference for one-stop shopping for telephone and data 
services. The most crucial part of that purchase is the Sprint PCS 
wireless business, which will fill a gaping hole in MCI WorldCom's 
product lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our early successes in selling bundled packages of services on  
an end-to-end basis ... underscores the customers' desire to 
purchase 'all-distance' services from one provider,'' said Ebbers. 
``Customers -- consumers and businesses alike -- are seeking 
distance-independent packages of services with rates oriented 
towards bandwidth consumed, not distance. Our substantial and 
timely investments -- in local access, data, Internet, international 
and recently wireless -- favorably position the company to meet 
these changing demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first nine months of 1999, MCI WorldCom earned $2.66  
billion, or $1.38 per common share, including results from the SHL 
computer services operation that was sold in April to EDS. That 
compares with a profit of $815 million or 45 cents a share in the 
same period last year, including a full-nine months of results from 
MCI and SHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month revenues totaled $25.09 billion, up 12 percent from  
$22.4 billion in the same period last year. Including Embratel, the 
latest revenue tally amounted to $27.1 billion.

<HEADLINE> AMA Unveils Health Info Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The American Medical Association and several  
other physician groups on Thursday unveiled plans for their own 
health information Web site, trying to combat fears that their 
patients are getting inaccurate and misleading information over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the unfamiliar name of medem.com, its relatively late  
arrival on the Internet scene and the AMA's close connection to 
doctors rather than patients, the for-profit initiative will have a 
difficulty time attracting consumers, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is expected to be launched early next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have flocked online as an easy way to obtain detailed  
information about diseases affecting them and their family. Doctors 
have complained, though, about being barraged by patient queries 
sparked by questionable material found on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Though medem.com will offer the same health news and information  
available online from sites such as drkoop.com and America Online's 
Health Channel, the physician groups say their credibility give 
them an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medem, based in San Francisco, also hopes to attract consumers  
by providing a direct link to Web sites of physicians who sign up 
for the service. Through the link, medem.com will provide patients 
a secure service so patients and physicians can communicate via 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	The name medem is short for medical empowerment, and empowering  
consumers with health information they can use to live healthier 
lives is the site's main aim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medem.com will give our patients access to information they  
can trust and information they can use with their physicians in 
order to improve their health care,'' said Dr. H. Dunbar Hoskins 
Jr., chairman of the Medem board of directors and executive vice 
president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ``We felt much 
of the information being delivered on the Internet was inaccurate 
and out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the AMA and the AAO, the other groups participating  
are: the American Academy of Pediatrics; the American College of 
Allergy, Asthma &AMP; Immunology; the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists; the American Psychiatric Association; and the 
American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 writers and editors will provide daily health and  
medical research news. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is free for consumers, though doctors have to pay $70  
per month. Doctors can have their fee covered by a sponsoring 
company. No sponsors have been signed up yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The early prognosis for medem.com looks challenging at best,  
according to industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are facing an enormous amount of competition online  
that's already gone down the learning curve to acquire and retain 
customers,'' said Claudine Singer, an Internet analyst with Jupiter 
Communications in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major health-related Web sites include Intellihealth.com,  
WebMD.com and healtheon.com, all of which have been available for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the medical groups also will face a difficult balancing  
act in using corporate sponsors and advertising. That's because the 
AMA and other groups do not want to appear as promoting certain 
companies or products. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA last year suffered severe criticism from non-members and  
members alike over an endorsement deal with appliance maker Sunbeam 
Corp. The AMA eventually paid Sunbeam nearly $10 million after 
backing out of the deal, and several high-ranking executives were 
fired or quit 
</P>
<P>
	AMA trustee Dr. William Mahood said the new Internet site will  
make sure that problem does not occur, insisting that the site will 
clearly differentiate editorial content from advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Caplan, director of the center for bioethics at the  
University of Pennsylvania, said the AMA is on the right track 
helping doctors and patients use e-mail to communicate. Currently, 
less than 2 percent of doctors use e-mail with patients, though 
Caplan expects the numbers to soar as doctors realize they can more 
efficiently help consumers by answering their questions online. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA name will help attract some users to medem.com, Caplan  
said, though people like to seek information on the Internet 
because they can search a multitude of sources, all with different 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The glory of the Internet is it is wide open and freewheeling,  
but the problem with the Internet is it is open and freewheeling,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Ganassi Switching To Toyota Engines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Looking for the kind of edge that turned  
his team into a powerhouse four years ago, Chip Ganassi is 
switching to unproven Toyota engines for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to abandon Honda, whose engines have dominated the  
series since 1996, the year Target/Chip Ganassi Racing put them in 
their new Reynards, is another in a series of gambles by the team 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to stay ahead of the curve, baby,'' Ganassi said.  
``You look at those guys from Toyota and you see a hunger for 
winning that I haven't seen before. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you just look at (Toyota's) performance in the last couple  
of races, you'll see a big spike up,'' he added. ``And don't 
forget, Honda had only won one race before we went with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganassi, whose teams have won three straight CART FedEx Series  
championships, could make it four straight Sunday if rookie Juan 
Montoya can overcome a nine-point lead by Team Kool Green's Dario 
Franchitti, who also drives a Reynard-Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three drivers in the season standings have cars powered  
by Honda engines, one reason why Ganassi chose to make this chancy 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only so many teams out there that can win races, and  
if you've got the same equipment, it's very hard to get any kind of 
an edge on those other guys,'' Ganassi said. ``Besides, it's not 
just one component that wins races. It's a total team philosophy, 
team confidence and team makeup that wins races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully expect to stay at the front of the grid.''  
</P>
<P>
	Toyota, which entered CART with its brand new engine in 1996,  
has never had one of the top teams in the series to showcase its 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our progress hasn't been as swift as we'd like it to be,''  
said Les Unger, national motorsports manager for Toyota. ``We 
consider this another block in the building block process and we 
obviously hope it will help us move up to the podium (the top 
three). 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides are taking a big risk; Chip because he has a pat  
hand and Toyota because we're going to be in the spotlight now and 
we'd better deliver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Sunday's season-ending race at California Speedway,  
Toyota's best showing of the season -- and its best finish ever in 
the Champ Car series -- was a fourth place by rookie Cristiano da 
Matta early in the season in Nazareth, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Vasser, Montoya's teammate and the 1996 series champion --  
giving Honda its first PPG Cup title -- said, ``We've won a lot of 
races and had a lot of success because we had an edge on people. 
But there's a lot of competition from within our own camp and, by 
making the change, Chip hopes we'll gain an edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the best interest of the team at heart and he's been  
pretty accurate so far. It was a big gamble when he went with 
Honda, and that turned out pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although losing Ganassi is a big blow to Honda, the company is  
expected to keep the rest of its current teams and previously 
announced a new affiliation with Marlboro Team Penske, which will 
field cars for Gil de Ferran and Greg Moore next season.

<HEADLINE> Japan Air System To Cut 1,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan Air System Co. said Friday it plans to cut  
1,000 jobs, or about 18 percent of its total work force, in an 
effort to slash debt and return to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
	JAS, the country's third-largest airline, is negotiating with  
its ground and flight unions on the proposed five-year 
restructuring, said company spokesman Masuo Kasama. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, JAS will implement the cuts through natural  
attrition, curbs on new hiring and increased transfers of employees 
to related firms, Kasama said. 
</P>
<P>
	JAS, which along with its domestic routes flies to some foreign  
destinations, mostly in Asia, plans to transfer all its 
international operations to its subsidiary, Harlequin Air Corp., he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by Tokyo-based JAS comes just a few months before  
fierce competition among carriers is expected to begin. In 
February, airline fares in Japan will be completely liberalized. 
</P>
<P>
	JAS had $3.5 billion in accumulated, interest-bearing debt on a  
consolidated basis at the end of March, according to company 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Japan Airlines Co., Japan's largest carrier,  
announced it would cut its ground work force by 10 percent and 
nearly halve the number of its directors in a three-year 
restructuring drive through March 2002.

<HEADLINE> Braves Miss Plays and Pay the Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The third inning of Game 4 of the World Series  
started badly for the Atlanta Braves and got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, John Smoltz got a ground ball, the prescription for  
escaping trouble. Both times, though, it turned into big trouble 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great traits about that club is they're so  
opportunistic,'' shortstop Walt Weiss said. ``They're a tough club 
to pitch to. They get quality at-bats, up and down the order. They 
shoot the ball all over the field. They're tough to defend. You 
pretty much have to play them straight up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So when leadoff hitter Chuck Knoblauch rapped a ball in the hole  
between shortstop and third base, Weiss had a couple of extra steps 
to cover to get to the ball. On the mound, Smoltz thought it was 
rather routine, the kind of ball the smooth-fielding Weiss gobbles 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely could have made the play,'' Weiss said.  
</P>
<P>
	Only he didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	The ball glanced off his glove for an infield single, and the  
Yankees had an opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I might have a chance to throw him out,'' Weiss  
said. ``With him running, I tried to be real quick with the 
exchange and get the throw off. I think I was trying to throw the 
ball before I actually got the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did Weiss think he might be charged with an error?  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't sure,'' he said. ``With Knoblauch running, it made it  
a tougher play. It was going to be a bang-bang play at first 
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, there was no play.  
</P>
<P>
	Derek Jeter followed with a single to right field, sending  
Knoblauch to third. Then Jeter stole second as Paul O'Neill struck 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing the percentages, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox ordered  
cleanup batter Bernie Williams walked, loading the bases for Tino 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Smoltz needed another ground ball, and he got it when  
Martinez sent a shot to the right of first baseman Ryan Klesko. 
Williams hesitated for a moment, perhaps blocking Klesko's view for 
an instant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ball just jumped up on me,'' Klesko said. ``He hit it  
hard. It came up and hit me on the top of my arm. There was nothing 
I could do. I couldn't get a glove on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ball glanced off the first baseman and into short right  
field, where second baseman Bret Boone ran it down. By the time he 
retrieved it, two runs had scored and the Yankees were on their way 
to their 4-1 Series-clinching victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox shook his head over the way the game turned in that one  
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one inning, the two infield hits,'' he said. ``We didn't  
catch the ball good that inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klesko said when the ball was hit, he thought he might be able  
to turn it into a double play. Instead of two outs, though, the 
Braves got no outs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said he wasn't sure what happened on the play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was a bad hop or not,'' he said. ``We  
walked a guy, set up the double play. We got the ground balls. We 
didn't get an out. That's the way it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contrast with the Yankees' infield was dramatic, especially  
in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	With one out, shortstop Jeter ranged far to his left on a ball  
hit up the middle by Gerald Williams, crossed second base and made 
the play cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Boone walked, Chipper Jones hit a bouncer to third  
base. Scott Brosius, playing him to pull, got a good jump and 
backhanded the ball at the bag. Then he pivoted, jumped like an 
old-time quarterback throwing a pass and retired the runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays missed.  
</P>
<P>
	Two plays made.  
</P>
<P>
	They were the difference in the deciding game of the World  
Series.

<HEADLINE> Seymour: Bulldogs Ready for Gators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Richard Seymour doesn't get as excited about  
the Georgia-Florida game as most of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, he's from South Carolina, and he gets more pumped up  
when the Bulldogs take on the Gamecocks. 
</P>
<P>
	He does, however, recognize the importance of Saturday's game at  
Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville when the fifth-ranked Gators and No. 
10 Georgia match 6-1 records in their bid for first place in the 
Southeastern Conference East Division heading to the final month of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is going to be a big program game for us,'' Seymour said.  
``Coach (Jim) Donnan has done a good job here at Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a victory over the Gators would help Donnan's rebuilding  
job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 1-and-1,'' Seymour said. ``That's not too bad.''  
</P>
<P>
	Seymour remembers the 30-17 Georgia victory at Jacksonville two  
years ago, a win that snapped Florida's seven-game winning streak 
in the series. Florida resumed its winning ways last year, crushing 
the Bulldogs 38-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Seymour, a 6-foot-6, 295-pound defensive tackle from Gadsden,  
S.C., joins 300-pound Marcus Stroud to give the Bulldogs a solid 
interior defensive line. Seymour has been in on 39 tackles, 
including three quarterback sacks for 14 yards in losses. He's also 
been credited with six quarterback pressures, and has stopped 
running backs behind the line of scrimmage five times for losses of 
12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat Tennessee, and Tennessee has a good football team,''  
Seymour said of the Gators. ``They're a very balanced football 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seymour says he's always wanted to compete against the best, so  
he looks forward to games with Tennessee and Florida to face their 
outstanding offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
	He said one of the keys to Saturday's game will be putting  
pressure on Florida quarterback Doug Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to come out like we did against Kentucky and get Doug  
early and not let him get in sync. Our best athletes have got to 
shine in this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects Florida to try to jump on the Bulldogs the  
same way Tennessee did in pounding Georgia 37-20 three weeks ago in 
Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennessee had a great offensive line, and Tee Martin was  
hurting us on the runs,'' Seymour said. ``I'm not sure Doug is as 
elusive as Tee is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seymour said the least penalized team will have an advantage in  
Saturday's game, and that the play of the special teams will be 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a very beatable football team,'' he said.

	Economy Grows at 4.8 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, after a springtime pause,  
came roaring back in the summer, expanding at a sizzling annual 
rate of 4.8 percent from July through September, the fastest pace 
this year. The Commerce Department reported today that the increase 
in the gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and 
services -- in the third quarter followed a sluggish 1.9 percent 
rate of growth in the April-June quarter as America's soaring trade 
deficit cut sharply into growth. 

</P>
<P>
	Economy Growing Faster Than Thought  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's economic good times just got better,  
according to a major revision of government statistics released 
today. The new figures show that economic growth has been stronger, 
inflation lower and the dip in Americans' personal savings rate not 
quite as bad as previously believed. The changes were released by 
the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis as part of a 
twice-a-decade overhaul of the government's major economic 
statistic -- the gross domestic product. The revisions show that the 
GDP, the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by 4.3 
percent in 1998 and 4.5 percent in 1997, significantly higher than 
the 3.9 percent growth for both years that had been reported 
previously. 

</P>
<P>
	Employment Cost Index Rises  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department reported this morning  
that American workers' wages and benefits rose by 0.8 percent in 
the third quarter, slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase 
many economists were expecting, indicating little inflationary 
pressures coming from rising wages. 

</P>
<P>
	Jobless Claims Fall by 15,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department reported that new claims  
for unemployment insurance fell by 15,000 to 278,000 last week. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Surge Ahead; Dow Up 202  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher this morning after a  
new report showed that U.S. workers' wages and benefits are 
increasing at a slower than expected pace. The report raised hopes 
that inflation is not a threat to the economy's health. Just before 
11 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 202.00 at 
10,596.89, extending Friday's 92-point gain. Broader stock 
indicators also rose. The Nasdaq composite index was up 51.55 at 
2,854.07.

	MCI WorldCom Profit Nearly Triples  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Third-quarter operating profits nearly tripled  
at MCI WorldCom, the telecommunications juggernaut that's acquiring 
Sprint in the biggest corporate takeover ever. The supplier of 
long-distance and Internet services said today it earned $1.1 
billion or 55 cents per share in the three months ended Sept. 30, 
excluding the impact of an investment in Embratel, a Brazilian 
telephone company. That compares with a profit of $359 million or 
19 cents a share in the same period last year from the combined 
operations of WorldCom and MCI Communications, which didn't 
complete their merger until the end of that quarter. The year-ago 
figures also exclude Embratel and merger-related costs. Analysts 
had expected an operating profit of 54 cents a share. MCI WorldCom 
stock was up 2 3/8 at 79 15/16 in morning trading. 

</P>
<P>
	Senator Flags Viacom-CBS Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate's antitrust  
subcommittee says he's concerned that the proposed $35.89 billion 
merger of CBS and Viacom will limit competition and diversity in 
the media industry. ``The idea of another media conglomerate, with 
holdings in so many related market segments, seems, somehow, a 
little bit ominous,'' said Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio. Viacom and CBS 
announced Sept. 7 they wanted to merge their extensive interests in 
TV, movies, radio and outdoor advertising. CBS President Mel 
Karmazin and Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone were scheduled to 
testify before DeWine's Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee 
today.

<P>
	Little Growth in Health Coverage  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. employers have done little to expand health  
insurance coverage to their workers, despite a robust economy and 
years of relatively stable health insurance premiums, according to 
a study released today. In fact, companies that provide coverage 
have started to shift more insurance costs to their employees, 
reduced benefits for mental health care and limited assistance to 
retirees, according to the study. While nearly all companies with 
200 or more workers in 1999 offered health insurance benefits, just 
60 percent of smaller firms did so -- virtually the same level as in 
1996, said the report by Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent 
research organization, and the Health Research and Educational 
Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association.

from the Nasdaq Stock Market's Web site to their online brokerage 
accounts. National Association of Securities Dealers Chairman Frank 
Zarb said the Nasdaq's new service, to be called Mybroker, will 
allow the 23.5 million daily visitors to the Nasdaq's Web site to 
see news and the latest stock quotes, then go directly to their 
online trading account via links set up between the Nasdaq and the 
brokerage firms. Zarb said in a speech yesterday that no date has 
been set for when the service will begin. He said some online 
brokerage firms need time to get their technology connected to the 
Nasdaq's Web site.

	Amazon.com Results Top Estimates  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com's stock was down 7 5/16 at 68 5/8 in  
morning trading following its report that showed quarterly results 
better than expectations even though its losses more than tripled 
from a year ago as the Internet giant significantly boosted its 
spending to expand its online offerings. On the plus side, 
Amazon.com's sales grew by 132 percent from the year-ago period and 
its customer base climbed by 2.4 million to 13.1 million, three 
times larger than it was in September 1998. Amazon.com reported 
yesterday that it lost $197 million, or 59 cents a share, in the 
three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $45.2 million, 
or 15 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding $111.3 
million in merger, acquisition, investment-related costs and 
stock-based compensation charges, Amazon.com lost $85.8 million, or 
26 cents a share. That loss was smaller than the 28-cents-a-share 
loss expected by Wall Street analysts.

	Many See Lottery As Way to Wealth  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many Americans believe they stand a better  
chance of getting rich from lotteries or sweepstakes than from 
saving and investing, a poll found. Stephen Brobeck, executive 
director of the Consumer Federation of America, said the findings 
suggest that misconceptions about how small amounts of money can 
grow if saved or invested may be preventing some people from taking 
steps to improve their lot. The federation and the financial 
services firm, Primerica, released the poll and a companion study 
of household wealth today.

<HEADLINE> Albright Offers Help to Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring ``we have to see what we can do to  
lessen the pain,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on 
Thursday offered U.S. assistance to Armenia as the tiny former 
Soviet republic tries to cope with explosive nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright directed her deputy, Strobe Talbott, to return to the  
Armenian capital of Yerevan on Friday and said she would talk with 
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov next week about unrest in 
various areas of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott was in Armenia on Wednesday before gunmen, claiming a  
coup, stormed the parliament and killed the nation's prime 
minister, Vazgen Sarkisian, and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to save the Armenian people from perishing and  
restore their rights,'' said Nairi Unanian, an ardent nationalist 
who was detained along with four other alleged gunmen. ``Those 
responsible for robbing the country must face trial along with 
us,'' he said in Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she was concerned about any prospect of terrorism  
in restive regions, one of the charges leveled against the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott was in Armenia to talk with President Robert Kocharian  
and Sarkisian about Armenia's territorial dispute with Azerbaijan 
over Nagorno-Karakbakh, a territory in Azerbaijan populated mainly 
by Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the territory declared independence and separatists  
helped by Armenia drove out Azeri troops. A truce was signed in 
1994, but sporadic fighting has continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright -- who said she telephoned Kocharian ``to offer my  
personal condolences and sorrow'' -- said the United States wanted 
to try to make sure the former Soviet Union ``does not become an 
area for terrorism.'' She was directing her remarks also to the 
Russian offensive in the secession-inclined republic of Chechnya 
and unrest in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, meanwhile, told a White House news conference  
that he'd like to spur negotiations that would lead to a political 
settlement of the Chechnya situation, keeping civilian casualties 
to a minimum. He said a military solution was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin, meanwhile, condemned  
``the brutal attack'' on Armenia's leaders and lawmakers, and said 
the United States was grateful the incident ended without further 
loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has received no confirmed information about a  
motive for the attack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a travel advisory, the department said, ``This appears to be  
an isolated incident with no reports of related activity elsewhere 
in the country.'' American citizens were advised to take 
``appropriate security precautions,'' but they were not cautioned 
against traveling in the country of about 3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and Ivanov will meet next week in Oslo at a memorial  
for the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com reported a  
smaller-than-expected loss in the third quarter and said its sales 
more than tripled, but the Internet retailer's business still lags 
significantly behind its online rival Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based barnesandnoble.com lost $21.9 million, or 15  
cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss 
of $18.6 million, or 16 cents a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial  
had expected the company to lose 23 cents a share in the quarter. 
Barnesandnoble.com stock was up 25 cents to $19.93 3/4 in afternoon 
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales during the third quarter rose to $49 million from $15.56  
million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com began selling books on the Internet in May  
1997, and in recent months has expanded its offerings to include 
music, prints, posters and electronic greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offerings have helped boost its customer base, which  
climbed by 581,000 in the past three months to 2.9 million. 
Sixty-three percent of its orders in the third quarter came from 
repeat customers, up from 60 percent at the end of the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While barnesandnoble.com is growing, it does only a fraction of  
the business of Amazon.com, which had 13.1 million customers at the 
end of the third quarter and $355 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com, which also started with books, now offers music,  
videos, auctions, toys, electronics and online greeting cards on 
its Web site. It recently started allowing anyone -- from major 
manufacturers to creative housewives -- to sell merchandise on 
Amazon.com through its new zSHOPS program. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, barnesandnoble.com lost  
$64 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $51.8 million, or 
45 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose to $120.4 million, up from 
$35.9 million a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Earnings Rise in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Aetna's third-quarter operating profits  
rose 27 percent, exceeding forecasts, as the health insurance giant 
benefitted from strong enrollment gains in its health maintenance 
organizations and its ability to contain health costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission is  
conducting a review of its accounting practices, particularly 
related to Aetna's $1 billion purchase this summer of Prudential 
HealthCare. Aetna denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry shook investors, sending Aetna shares down $2.68 3/4 to  
$48.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating earnings were $193.1 million, or $1.27 per share. That  
compares with operating earnings of $152.2 million, or 96 cents per 
share, excluding certain other items, in the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected Aetna to have  
operating earnings of around $1.16 per share for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating earnings exclude capital gains or losses and include  
after-tax Year 2000 costs, which were $14.1 million in the 1999 
third quarter and $36.5 million in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income in the quarter was $165.3 million, or $1.09 per  
share. That's a 20 percent drop from earnings of $212.4 million, or 
$1.36 per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 third-quarter results included $27.8 million in net  
capital losses, primarily due to a loss on the sale of Aetna 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 third-quarter reflect the release of a $44.2 million  
after-tax reserve related to discontinued products in Aetna's Large 
Case Pensions segment. They also include capital gains of $16 
million and $24.3 million in earnings from the domestic individual 
life business, which was sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 29 percent, from $5.44 billion to $7.02  
billion, primarily due to the acquisition of Prudential HealthCare. 
</P>
<P>
	On a standalone basis, Aetna U.S. Healthcare's commercial HMO  
membership grew 9 percent from year end. Including Prudential 
HealthCare's 5.3 million members, total health membership was 21 
million at the end of the third quarter, including 10.3 million HMO 
members. 

</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, net income fell 11  
percent, to $571.9 million, or $3.74 per share, compared with 
$645.6 million, or $4.10 per share in the first nine months of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the first nine months increased 25 percent to  
$18.67 billion, compared with $14.91 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Honor Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Tour Championship used to be the  
end-of-the-year event for the rich to get richer. This year, it has 
become a stage to honor the memory of Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III was among those wondering why the PGA Tour didn't  
cancel the $5 million event for the top 30 on the money list, 
especially because golf was far from anyone's mind after Stewart 
died in a plane crash Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be weird this week,'' Love said. ``It doesn't  
feel right grinding it out on the range. It doesn't feel right 
laughing in the fairways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might feel hollow to win.  
</P>
<P>
	So, why play?  
</P>
<P>
	Love found that answer Wednesday at Champions Golf Club, his  
first day on the course and his first chance to see the PGA Tour 
family face-to-face for the first time since what Arnold Palmer 
said was the greatest tragedy in modern-day golf. 
</P>
<P>
	They remembered Stewart's passion and grace, his victories and  
losses, his flamboyant personality and needling humor from which no 
one was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Love came to the conclusion that it was time to  
share the memories of the two-time U.S. Open champion with everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can shed a lot of light on Payne Stewart by playing,'' he  
said, glassy eyes staring off into the distance. ``A lot of things 
are going to remind us of Payne Stewart for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship got off to an emotional start today with a  
brief memorial service for Stewart on the first tee. A lone 
bagpiper played ``Going Home,'' about a Scottish man finally 
returning to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
took from us one of our great champions,'' said PGA Tour 
commissioner Tim Finchem. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every player in the Tour Championship field was at the  
service. Many of those were visibly shaken as the bagpiper played 
``Amazing Grace,'' then ``Going Home'' one more time as he walked 
back down a fairway shrouded in fog. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very emotional guy,'' said Tom Lehman, who offered a  
prayer. ``He loved to laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not 
going to be ashamed of my tears this morning, and neither should 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players hugged each other as they left the first tee. Duffy  
Waldorf was on the putting green, preparing for his 8:39 a.m. tee 
time as the first player off. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will be the focus from the first round through the  
trophy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not playing golf, I don't know how else we can honor  
him,'' Finchem said Wednesday. ``There's not much of a forum to 
remind people about Payne. This provides us a way to tell what he 
was all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first day features 27 holes, followed by a day off to honor  
Stewart, whose memorial service will be at 11 a.m. Friday in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said a collection of private planes will take whoever  
wants to go to the service Friday morning. A larger jet has been 
chartered for players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in 
Mississippi to go to the services. 
</P>
<P>
	That tournament also is suspending play on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said Stewart's wife, Tracey, ``was very pleased that we  
were creating a situation where the players had an opportunity to 
attend the service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether all 29 players from the Tour  
Championship would attend. Love said he has had trouble going to 
such services ever since his father died, and would advise players 
not to go if they didn't feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to hug the guys that want to be hugged and  
cry with the guys that want to cry,'' said Love, who plans to leave 
tonight and spent time with Mark O'Meara in Orlando. ``Go ahead and 
get your grieving process started. I think that's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his two U.S. Opens and the PGA Championship, memories of  
Stewart usually start with his passion for the Ryder Cup. Love was 
paired with him in the first alternate-shot match on opening day, a 
halve against Padraig Harrington and Miguel Angel Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mystified why Ben Crenshaw would ever pair me with Payne  
Stewart,'' he said. ``After four or five holes I said, `Now I know. 
You want to teach me a lesson on how to take my excitement and my 
passion and my nervousness and my desire to win, and put it into my 
game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thanked Payne twice that day for what he taught me during  
that match,'' Love said. ``I said, `I'm sorry we didn't win, but 
it's going to help me in the future.' It did. It helped me on 
Sunday (a decisive victory over Jean Van de Velde). We all will 
remember the Ryder Cup for a lot of reasons, but now I think it 
will be even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship, the final PGA Tour event of the year, has  
a $5 million purse, with $900,000 going to the winner. Finchem said 
the $80,000 for last place would be given to Stewart's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the first-tee service at Champions, a service is  
scheduled tonight after the first round of the PGA Tour event in 
Mississippi. In Europe, players in the Volvo Masters in Spain said 
they would observe a moment of silence on the 18th green after 
Friday's round. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was concerned primarily with Stewart's two children,  
13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron, and with the families of 
the other five victims in the crash. He remembers what it was like 
to lose a father in a plane crash -- Davis Love Jr. was killed 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing I'm going to watch out for over the next few  
years is how we can help those children remember their father,'' 
Love said. ``Hopefully, we can help Aaron and Chelsea understand 
that eventually the memories of their father will be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will still live on -- definitely in golf, but he will live  
on as a great father.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gov. Rebukes Ramsey Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens urged the parents of JonBenet  
Ramsey to ``quit hiding behind their attorneys'' and help find 
their daughter's killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' comments came Wednesday as he announced his decision not  
to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the 1996 death of the 
6-year-old beauty pageant winner. 
</P>
<P>
	He said after initial mistakes, police and prosecutors are  
working with new evidence and headed in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, though, had strong words for the girl's parents.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I could speak to John and Patsy Ramsey,'' Owens said, ``I  
would tell them to quit hiding behind their attorneys, quit hiding 
behind their PR firm. Come back to Colorado and work with 
investigators in this case, no matter where that trail will lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who moved to the Atlanta area after the killing,  
have insisted they are innocent. In a statement issued late 
Wednesday, the Ramseys' attorneys called Owens' remarks 
``slanderous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming from a public official elected to the highest office of  
this state, his comments are unconscionable,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on KOA-AM radio today, Owens said he had a duty  
to inform Coloradans of the status of the nearly 3-year-old case, 
which has cost about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected criticism that his remarks unfairly targeted  
the Ramseys and suggested they give up constitutional rights to an 
attorney and to remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecutors and the police really can't talk, but I can,'' he  
said. ``I've done so carefully and it certainly brought a response 
from the PR firm or the Ramseys' attorney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early on Dec. 26, 1996, Mrs. Ramsey told police she found a  
ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter's safe return. 
Eight hours later, JonBenet's father said he found his daughter's 
body in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the investigation was compromised when  
detectives allowed the Ramseys and friends to roam through their 
mansion in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens said the guilty parties have been smart, stonewalling  
police and covering their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the killers, let me say this: You only think you have  
gotten away with murder. There is strong evidence to suggest who 
you are,'' Owens said. ``I think investigators are moving closer to 
proving their case. They will keep pursuing you. You will reap what 
you have sown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens declined to comment when asked if he was referring to the  
Ramseys when he cited more than one killer. He wouldn't say if he 
believed the Ramseys were involved in their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Owens said, ``it's been a  
very difficult process working with the Ramseys and I think that 
has delayed our ability to move on in this case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver legal analyst Andrew Cohen said the governor has made the  
strongest accusation yet against the Ramseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone, even a governor, should be allowed to  
accuse people of doing something, which they have a constitutional 
right to do, which is hide behind their lawyers,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, a Boulder County grand jury completed a 13-month  
investigation of the death without issuing any indictments. 
District Attorney Alex Hunter said there was not enough evidence to 
charge anyone, though he and police said the Ramseys remain under 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens also asked a seven-member task force to recommend whether  
a special prosecutor should be appointed. On Tuesday, Owens said he 
had decided that investigators were on the right track and were 
analyzing ``substantial new evidence.''

<HEADLINE> Miss. GOP Candidate Lures Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- With next week's gubernatorial election  
appearing tight, the Republican candidate has paid black leaders 
$30,000 to encourage minority voters to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Parker, a former congressman, gave a dozen people between  
$700 and $7,500 on Oct. 22, according to a campaign finance report 
filed this week. Parker had little to say about the payments 
Thursday, other than that he is ``not taking any part of the voting 
population for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi, Democrats traditionally have pumped money into  
black communities in so called ``get-out-the-vote'' efforts. 
Republicans have been openly critical of the process, especially 
Gov. Kirk Fordice, who has said the ventures are ripe for criminal 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese Partridge, senior attorney for the Mississippi secretary  
of state's office, said it is illegal for a candidate to finance 
efforts to induce someone ``to vote at any election for or against 
any person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it is legal to pay someone to provide transportation or  
perform campaign work. And that, according to Ed Cole, Parker's 
campaign coordinator, is what the Republican is doing. He said the 
money will be used by blacks with influence to promote Parker in 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parker said from day one he wanted to reach all sections of  
the community,'' Cole said. ``The simple truth is a lot of people 
are not motivated by radio or by television and you have to do 
canvassing in neighborhoods and rides to the polls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parker and his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove,  
are both white. 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove's campaign spokesman, George Shelton, said their  
get-out-the-vote efforts involved ``volunteers who are working very 
hard to increase voter awareness and participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Musgrove has not listed any payments to black leaders in his  
campaign reports. Any money spent after Oct. 24 does not have to be 
reported until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the people on Parker's list are Democrats, some are  
Republicans. All those reached by The Associated Press are black. 
One person who received money sent it back, another denied ever 
getting a check and a third refused to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Grenada County Supervisor Cecil Shelton said he was surprised  
when he got an $800 check in the mail and immediately sent it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a Mike Parker supporter,'' Shelton said. ``I'm a  
Democrat.''

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 4.8 Percent Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JEANNINE AVERSA

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, after a springtime pause,  
came roaring back in the summer, expanding at a sizzling annual 
rate of 4.8 percent from July through September, the fastest pace 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the increase in the  
gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- 
in the third quarter followed a sluggish 1.9 percent rate of growth 
in the April-June quarter as America's soaring trade deficit cut 
sharply into growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the trade deficit worsened further in the third  
quarter, it was offset by strength in most other categories, 
including robust consumer spending and a strong buildup in 
inventories held by businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.8 percent GDP growth was the fastest pace since a 5.9  
percent surge in the final three months of last year and was even 
better than many economists had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second report today, the Labor Department said American  
workers' wages and benefits rose by 0.8 percent in the third 
quarter, slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many 
economists were expecting, indicating little inflationary pressures 
coming from rising wages. In the past 12 months, employment costs 
rose a moderate 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which have been jangled in recent weeks over  
fears that the economy is growing so rapidly that the Federal 
Reserve could step in and raise interest rates for a third time 
this year, rallied on the benign employment-cost report. The yield 
on the 30-year bond, which had hit a two-year high in recent days, 
retreated in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists said the Fed is still likely to focus on the fact  
that the economy as shown by the GDP report is still growing at a 
much faster rate than Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The GDP report probably offsets the more benign employment  
cost report and leaves the Fed ready to tighten on Nov. 16,'' said 
Paul Kasriel, chief economist for The Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	An inflation gauge tied to the GDP also showed modest price  
pressures, rising at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third 
quarter. That was even better than the tiny 1.9 percent increase 
for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report, the government said that the number of  
Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by 15,000 
to 278,000, indicating that the labor market remains exceptionally 
tight. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming U.S. economy has been powered by robust consumer  
spending, which accounts for two-third of total economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that consumer spending in the third  
quarter rose at a solid annual rate of 4.3 percent, down slightly 
from 5.1 percent growth in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses, confident that consumers will keep spending,  
increased their stockpiles by $14.1 billion in the third quarter. A 
slowdown in inventory building and the worsening trade deficits 
were the major factors holding back growth in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	America's swelling trade deficit subtracted $343 billion from  
GDP in the third quarter at an annual rate, an even bigger drag 
than in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the continued robust consumer spending and solid gains in  
business investment in new plants and equipment and housing 
construction more than offset the drag from trade. 
</P>
<P>
	All of today's figures reflected a comprehensive overhaul in the  
way the government calculates the GDP, making changes in the 
figures back to 1959. The GDP revisions showed the economy grew at 
a significantly faster rate in recent years with an increase in 
1998 of 4.3 percent and even bigger 4.5 percent rise in 1997, the 
fastest surge in economic activity in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes also show lower inflation and Americans saving more  
than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of  
disposable income -- which had dipped to record lows in negative 
territory was 2.1 percent in the third quarter under the new 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new GDP methodology, savings associated with a  
worker's government pension plan will be counted as personal 
savings, rather than government savings. That doesn't affect the 
GDP, but it does boost the nation's personal savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major change the government made in its GDP  
calculations was a redefinition of how to account for business 
spending on computer software. Previously, these purchases were 
considered a raw material and not counted as part of GDP. Under the 
new approach, business purchases of software are considered an 
investment and do add to the GDP totals. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in its overhaul also changed the base year for  
prices from 1992 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	All the various changes show the GDP growing at an annual rate  
of $8.88 trillion in inflation-adjusted dollars in the third 
quarter of the year. Before adjusting for inflation, GDP in the 
third quarter totaled $9.28 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Profits Rise 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kellogg Co. reported its third-quarter earnings before one-time  
charges rose 20 percent as sales of convenience foods increased. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 cereal maker said it earned $170.8 million, or 42  
cents per share, excluding the charges, compared to $141.9 million, 
or 35 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results for the quarter ending Sept. 30 were slightly higher  
than Wall Street expectations of 41 cents per share, according to a 
survey of analysts by First Call/ Thomson Financial. Kellogg's 
stock rose 37 1/2 cents a share to $40.37 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg's one-time charges include $317.5 million from the sale  
of its Lender's Bagel business and the shuttering or sale of some 
operations. Including these charges, Kellogg lost $35.6 million, or 
8 cents per share, in the latest quarter. The earnings do not 
reflect the $307 million purchase earlier this month of Ohio-based 
Worthington Foods, a leading maker of vegetarian foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $1.87 billion from $1.81 billion a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Third-quarter net sales of convenience foods jumped nearly 15  
percent to $475 million, but cereal sales remained flat at just 
under $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of a good news, bad news quarter,'' said John  
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities. ``The bad news is 
sales growth was a little less robust, but the good news is 
bottom-line earnings were a little better than expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since assuming the top job in April, Kellogg chief executive  
Carlos Gutierrez has acted quickly to cut Kellogg's losses from an 
industry-wide slowdown in ready-to-eat cereal sales. With Americans 
pressed for time and eating on the run, fewer people are sitting 
down to a bowl of cereal for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg has been looking for new revenue sources, and branching  
out to new lines of business, including Worthington's vegetarian 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, union workers at four Kellogg plants  
approved a three-year contract without any raises, other than 
inflationary adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Kellogg's net earnings came  
to $237.4 million, or 59 cents a share, down from $455.8 million, 
or $1.12 a share, in the same period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding charges, Kellogg earned $469.4 million, or $1.16 per  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month sales came to $5.4 billion, up from $5.16 billion.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEAPACK, N.J. (AP) -- Drug maker Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's third  
quarter profits jumped 12 percent, excluding unusual items, driven 
by demand for its glaucoma and overactive bladder medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding some acquisition and restructuring charges,  
Pharmacia's net earnings were $246 million, or 47 cents a share, 
compared with $219 million, or 41 cents a share a year earlier. 
Results matched forecasts by analysts surveyed by First 
Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	The company took a $61 million charge in the quarter for merger,  
restructuring and other costs associated with its acquisition of 
Sugen Inc., a drug development company, and an investment in Sensus 
Drug Development Corp. Including those costs, earnings dropped 9 
percent to $185 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After adjusting for divestment of the company's nutrition  
business, Pharmacia's third-quarter sales were up 6 percent, to 
$1.8 billion from $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Xalatan drug for glaucoma generated $136 million  
in third-quarter sales, up 50 percent from last year, making it the 
company's top-selling product and the world's most-prescribed 
glaucoma medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Camptosar, for advanced colorectal cancer, rose 62  
percent to $81 million in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest sales jump was for Detrol and Detrusitol, related  
drugs for overactive bladder that have been heavily promoted in 
recent television ads. Together both drug had sales soar 169 
percent to $85 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Nicorette smoking-cessation products were up a modest 5  
percent to $50 million, while sales were flat for the injectable 
contraceptive Depo-Provera. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pharmacia on Thursday rose $2.75 to $54 in trading at  
5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Pharmacia's net income rose  
16 percent to $589 million or $1.09 per share, from $509 million or 
95 cents per share. Sales rose 8 percent to $5.3 billion from $4.9 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Favre Ready To Face Holmgren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Although Brett Favre and Mike Holmgren  
reached the top of their professions during their seven years 
together with the Green Bay Packers, their parting last January 
wasn't entirely sad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Mike wants any more of me,'' Favre said with a  
laugh. ``I think he's had enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As with many great collaborators, Favre and Holmgren were eager  
to see what one could do without the other. They both got that 
chance when Holmgren left the Packers to become coach and GM of the 
Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	But both men readily acknowledge the debt they owe each other,  
symbolized by their rings from the 1997 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre admits he wouldn't be the game's most feared quarterback  
without Holmgren's guidance through his development. Likewise, 
Holmgren admits he wouldn't have had some of his coaching success 
without the estimable talents of the three-time Most Valuable 
Player. 
</P>
<P>
	But Favre feels he has reached a point in his career where he  
wants to show what he can do without Holmgren's guidance, and 
Holmgren wanted total control of a football operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, I listened to him and became a smarter  
quarterback,'' Favre said. ``Now I think I'm able to leave out from 
under his wing and go on my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre and Holmgren meet as foes for the first time Monday night  
when the Seahawks visit Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre and Holmgren arrived in Green Bay in 1992, Favre from  
Atlanta and Holmgren from San Francisco. Favre was an almost 
completely undisciplined quarterback with a phenomenal arm, 
Holmgren a career assistant given the task of rebuilding a team 
that hadn't scared opponents in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren made Favre his starter right away, saying, ``We're  
going to win or lose with you,'' Favre recalled. For seven years, 
they worked side by side as Holmgren called the plays and Favre ran 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	While dozens of offensively gifted assistants like Steve  
Mariucci, Jon Gruden and Andy Reid shuttled in and out of Lambeau 
Field, Holmgren and Favre were constants. They studied film, 
practiced and argued over Favre's play and Holmgren's play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first couple of years, now that I look back, I don't know  
how I made it,'' Favre said. ``I never stopped to think of what was 
going on. He would talk to me, and it was in one ear and out the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	``But over time, I kind of started believing in what he was  
saying and knowing that he was right. I did start becoming more of 
the quarterback he wanted me to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks like the young Favre -- with dizzying physical gifts  
and considerably less acumen -- enter the league every year, and 
most disappear. From Todd Marinovich to Ryan Leaf, the list of 
could-have-beens is long. 
</P>
<P>
	But Favre had Holmgren and, make no mistake, Holmgren had Favre.  
The West Coast offense he teaches relies on a smart, strong 
quarterback, something Favre eventually became. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty tough to compare any other quarterback physically  
with Brett,'' Holmgren said. ``I think he's a very unique guy that 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre realized their relationship reached its zenith with the  
Super Bowl victory, which also coincided with the best season of 
Favre's career. After that, Favre said he needed room to grow 
outside of Holmgren's strict offense and control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got to a point where I had to make decisions on my own and  
to please myself, but I still had to do it the way he wanted,'' 
Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seahawks owner Paul Allen's lavish offer lured Holmgren away,  
and several Packers publicly expressed their displeasure, though 
Favre had little to say. About a month ago, Holmgren and Favre had 
a lengthy conversation for the first time since Holmgren left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I can turn him in. He was tampering. He was trying to  
work out something to get me to Seattle,'' Favre said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
	Some thought there were unresolved issues between the two, but  
Favre denies it. They were just two old friends, reminiscing on 
good times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no hard feelings towards Mike, and I would hope that he  
had none towards me,'' Favre said. ``I don't think anyone should 
ever be mad at a person for wanting to move up. That's been a goal 
of his for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean I won't love to beat him on Monday  
night.''

<HEADLINE> George Bush Absent From GOP Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Chicken George is squawking at another  
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Republican presidential candidates debated for the second  
straight week minus the leading contender, Gov. George W. Bush of 
Texas. His absence was a family matter, Bush argued from afar -- but 
opponents in both parties were not in a forgiving mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a chicken,'' said the chicken. Actually, it was a  
Democrat dressed as a yellow-feathered bird carrying a sign that 
read, ``Chicken George Won't Debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's rivals ran with the theme.  
</P>
<P>
	``The absent governor from Texas,'' conservative activist Gary  
Bauer said as the debaters gathered onstage Thursday night to warm 
up the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future, at a forum like this, if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' sniffed publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats first used the fowl tactic in 1992 during the  
re-election campaign of Bush's father, who was mocked for delaying 
debates with challenger Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, this Bush has less reason to be scared of Chicken  
George. He is scheduled to debate Dec. 2, and was given a 
front-runner's break Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	WMUR-TV, the New Hampshire station that co-sponsored the  
hourlong debate with CNN, gave Bush and his wife, Laura, the top 
few minutes of its evening newscast to explain why he didn't 
attend. She was receiving an award at Southern Methodist University 
in Dallas, and he had promised months ago to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the people, I think the people, understand I love my  
wife,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	No other candidate would have been given the air time, free from  
the risk of sharing a stage, his rivals said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was catering to someone who was giving people  
up here the brush-off,'' said Lyn Nofziger, Forbes' consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes himself said, ``One candidate thinks he can play by his  
own rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the fact is, Bush can. As long as he is the front-runner, he  
has the most ability to dictate the terms of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody thinks Bush hurt himself by missing this  
event,'' Republican consultant Scott Reed said after watching the 
debate at his suburban Washington home. ``If anything, he gained by 
having his five minutes to himself while most people in New 
Hampshire were watching television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those who watched the forum, there were no major  
developments. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, conservative activist Gary Bauer,  
commentator Alan Keyes, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Forbes 
differed little. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer criticized Forbes' ideas on a flat tax to replace the  
income tax, but the gloves never came off. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Bush is declared the winner for drawing the bye, McCain  
stands to gain the most from the night. Already gaining ground as 
the closest to Bush in the polls, he burnished his image as a 
reformer by turning several questions into a plea for overhauling 
campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's post-debate appearance drew crowds of reporters and a  
circle of TV lights, the kind of reception normally afforded the 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Gov. Bush will come to debates and we will have  
opportunities,'' McCain said, ``particularly since we're moving up 
so rapidly in the polls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Bush had planned to avoid debates until January but  
advanced his schedule to respond to McCain's gains. By issuing two 
statements explaining his absence and sitting for the WMUR 
interview, Bush also heeded the advice of New Hampshire supporters 
who warned that voters might soon think he was taking the state for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a warm-up for the main event, when the front-runner  
debates in December,'' Reed said.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrators: Edison Should Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit Edison should pay $45.15 million to  
settle race, sex and age discrimination allegations brought by 
nearly 1,400 current and former employees who were fired or 
demoted, an arbitrator ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's largest utility settled with the employees in 1998  
and agreed to let an arbitrator decide the final amount between a 
range of $17 million and $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The arbitrators have reached their decision by way of a fair  
process, and we both accept and respect their decision,'' said 
Anthony F. Earley Jr., Detroit Edison's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling settles three class-action lawsuits dating to 1993,  
after Detroit Edison pared its work force from roughly 11,000 to 
8,400. Workers alleged that women, racial minorities and older 
workers unfairly were targeted in the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility has since implemented programs with input from the  
plaintiffs, management and union and nonunion employees. The 
programs include training and development, employee testing and 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Each plaintiff's portion of the $45.15 million will be  
determined by a formula created by the plaintiffs, their attorneys 
and the court.

<HEADLINE> Washington Opera Stages `Le Cid' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Placido Domingo, musical director of the  
Washington Opera, is closing its last season of the century with 
Jules Massenet's French work ``Le Cid'' -- not fully staged in the 
United States since New York's Metropolitan Opera put it on at the 
century's start. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo will sing the main role of Rodrigue when it opens  
Saturday at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
Rodrigue, in a duel, kills the father of his fiancee Chimene 
(Elisabete Matos), and wins her forgiveness by leading the Spanish 
army to victory over the Moors. The story is loosely based on a 
classic French play by Pierre Corneille about a Spanish hero, 
Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, who died 900 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Opera has done the production in collaboration  
with the Teatro de la Maestranza of Seville, Spain. The opulent 
staging imitates the look of a medieval manuscript in a jeweled 
binding, with knights in armor and richly costumed religious 
processions.

	Economy Grows at 4.8 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy came roaring back in the  
summer, expanding at a sizzling annual rate of 4.8 percent from 
July through September, the fastest pace this year. The Commerce 
Department reported today that the increase in the gross domestic 
product -- the total output of goods and services -- in the third 
quarter followed a sluggish 1.9 percent rate of growth in the 
April-June quarter. Even though the trade deficit worsened further 
in the third quarter, it was offset by strength in most other 
categories, including robust consumer spending and a strong buildup 
in inventories held by businesses.

	Dow Gains 154; Nasdaq Rises 39  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher this morning with  
the Dow Jones industrial average up 154.51 points at 10,549.40 just 
before 10 p.m. EDT. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange held a 
3-1 lead over decliners. The Nasdaq composite index was up 39.74 
points at 2,842.26.

	Little Growth in Health Coverage  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite the robust economy and several years of  
relatively stable health insurance premiums, U.S. employers have 
done little to expand health insurance coverage to their workers. 
In fact, those companies that provide coverage have started to 
shift more insurance costs to their employees and limited 
assistance to retirees, according to a study released today. While 
nearly all companies with 200 or more workers in 1999 offered 
health insurance benefits, just 60 percent of smaller firms did so 
-- virtually the same level as in 1996, said the report by Kaiser 
Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust.

	Smith Dropping Presidential Bid  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith is dropping his long-shot bid  
for the White House and could be returning to the Republican Party. 
Smith spokeswoman Lisa Harrison said the conservative senator would 
announce today that he was quitting the presidential race. 
Meanwhile, congressional officials, who spoke yesterday on 
condition of anonymity, said Smith has made numerous overtures 
about returning to the Republican Party after barely 100 days as an 
independent. They said Smith's gestures include attendance at a 
party fund-raising dinner and conversations with senior 
Republicans.

	Bradley, Gore Face Off in N.H. Debate  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- In the first debate of the Democratic  
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley last 
night pledged their support to an overhaul of campaign finance 
laws, and agreed, in general terms, about the need to expand health 
care coverage. Five Republican presidential candidates -- absent 
front-runner George W. Bush -- will meet for their second debate 
tonight at the same site. Bush, a two-term Texas governor, does not 
plan to debate them until a Dec. 2 meeting in Manchester, N.H.

	Falun Gong Members Continue Protest  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Bruised and battered from beatings and on the run  
from Chinese police, members of the banned spiritual movement Falun 
Gong vowed to press their protest campaign to end the communist 
government's crackdown. As police searched across Beijing, group 
members converged on Tiananmen Square today for a fourth day. They 
kept quiet vigil while a national legislative committee met in the 
neighboring Great Hall of the People to consider a proposed law to 
suppress Falun Gong and other suspected cults. Police detained at 
least 20 people.

	Armenian Gunmen Surrender  
</P>
<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Nationalist gunmen whose attack on  
parliament killed eight top Armenian officials including the prime 
minister turned in their weapons and surrendered to authorities 
today, freeing the dozens of hostages they had held during their 
overnight siege. Hundreds of police and army troops had surrounded 
the parliament building in this former Soviet republic throughout 
the night. The takeover ended after President Robert Kocharian 
promised the gunmen a fair trial and a recorded statement by their 
leader was broadcast on national television.

	Woosnam in Reported Plane Scare  
</P>
<P>
	JEREZ, Spain (AP) -- Just two days after the death of U.S. Open  
champion Payne Stewart, European golf star Ian Woosnam had a scare 
in his own private plane. The Daily Mail of London reported today 
that Woosnam's twin-engine plane began depressurizing yesterday 
while the former Masters champion was flying in from his home in 
Britain's Channel Islands. Twenty minutes into the flight, oxygen 
masks dropped down. Woosnam and three others grabbed them and put 
them on. A loss of cabin pressure is suspected as being a factor in 
the crash Monday of Stewart's plane in which the golfer and five 
others were killed.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Cut Benjamin, Howard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers cut center Benoit  
Benjamin and forward Stephen Howard on Thursday, reducing their 
roster to 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin, a 34-year-old 7-foot center, is a 14-year NBA veteran  
who has played with eight teams and has career averages of 11.4 
points and 7.5 rebounds. He signed as a free agent with the Lakers 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin was the third pick in the 1985 draft by the Los Angeles  
Clippers. He has played for eight NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-9 Howard, who averaged 17.7 points and 8.8 rebounds  
playing in Greece last season, has played for four NBA teams. He 
signed with the Lakers as a free agent earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who cut forward Andy Panko on Wednesday, will likely  
start the season with Kobe Bryant, who has a broken right hand, and 
Travis Knight, who has a sprained right ankle, on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	In that case, they need to cut just one additional player or  
place someone else on the injured list to reach the opening-day 
roster limit of 12.

<HEADLINE> Estes Pays Tribute to Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Bob Estes will long be remembered for hitting the  
shortest drive in PGA Tour history Thursday, a 16-foot shot with 
the putter. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be fine with him.  
</P>
<P>
	The reason he used his putter for the first shot of the Tour  
Championship was so people would never forget Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first hole had so much emotion,'' Estes said. ``I wanted  
people to truly know how much Payne meant to all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes' eyes were swollen and red when he left the memorial  
service for Stewart about an hour before his tee time at Champions 
Golf Club. He had watched every minute of television possible on 
the plane crash that killed Stewart and five others on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	And he watched every tribute to Stewart, all of them containing  
that 15-foot putt Stewart made on the 72nd hole of Pinehurt No. 2 
to win the U.S. Open in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``The putt that I hit was somewhat symbolic of the putt that  
Payne made to win the U.S. Open,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It went about the same distance, coming a few feet short of  
going into the rough. Still on the tee box, Estes hit his second 
shot with a 3-wood and would up with a double bogey on the 466-yard 
par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the 27-hole first round, players started on the 10th  
tee Thursday morning. Estes turned to his caddie and asked if he 
should do something special for Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't know what I was going to do,'' he said. ``And I  
think when I reached for the putter, I kind of surprised him. But I 
don't think he minded too much because he was part of that, also. 
Payne treated the caddies the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estes kept a sense of humor after playing 27 holes at even-par.  
</P>
<P>
	He used a tee, even with a putter, because ``I was afraid I  
might hit it fat and I was kind of shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Estes noted that the ball stayed in the short cut of grass  
on the tee box. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been driving it all that great the last few months,  
and I don't know ... if you leave it on the tee box if that is 
still considered fairway,'' he said. ``I think it's the same cut. I 
need to check my stats to make sure they gave me a 'fairway hit' on 
that first one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In retrospect, Estes says his tribute was fitting. He had become  
close to Stewart over the past seven months, and said Stewart was 
teaching him how to enjoy himself more on the golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
	What would Stewart have said about using a putter on the tee  
box? 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thinking maybe he got a little chuckle out of it,''  
Estes said. ``Payne was so unique in everything he did. I just 
wanted to do a little something different to help us remember 
him.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton hosts Nigerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By SONYA ROSS 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the president of Nigeria by his side,  
President Clinton today called on international leaders to ease 
Nigeria's debt and on the Senate to loosen trade restrictions with 
the African continent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barriers to trade are barriers to opportunity for Africans  
working hard to catch up in a global economy and for Americans who 
want to work with them,'' Clinton said. ``That's why it is vital 
that the Senate approve the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
which is now pending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton extolled the leadership of President Olusegun Obasanjo,  
a former military leader who advocated democracy and was elected to 
his nation's top post earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to realize the promise of this moment for  
Nigeria, and for Africa,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he would work to ease Nigeria's $31 billion  
debt because it was ``neither morally rite nor economically sound'' 
to force Nigerians to choose between paying their debts or 
educating their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is seeking to help Obasanjo turn his nation into a  
stabilizing force for the rest of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	He met at the White House today with Obasanjo, who took office  
in May and is hoping his first official visit will yield a pledge 
of more U.S. aid and an end to a U.S. ban on flights because of lax 
airport security in Nigeria and drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has billions in oil  
wealth but is struggling with $31 billion in debt, a declining 
standard of living and widespread unemployment. Clinton, who has 
advocated debt forgiveness for poorer nations, is less concerned 
with that than with events that have unfolded since Obasanjo took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the White House notes that Nigeria acted as a  
mediator in Sierra Leone's civil conflict and has taken steps to 
curb corruption, such as canceling questionable government 
contracts and recovering assets stolen under the regime of late 
military leader Gen. Sani Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're witnessing here is a coming of age, if you will,  
for Nigeria under the Obasanjo government,'' said national security 
spokesman Jim Fallin. ``Obasanjo's leadership bodes well for our 
future relationship and successes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among matters on today's agenda was oil -- Nigeria provides about  
10 percent of the oil exported to the United States. Obasanjo wants 
U.S. help in reviving Nigeria's economy by leveraging its oil 
wealth; Clinton is interested in coordinating the assistance 
Nigeria is getting from 18 federal agencies under an umbrella 
effort, the U.S.-Nigerian Joint Economic Partnership Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's attempts to rebuild its economy are hampered by  
lingering concerns over corruption. Several powerful figures, 
including a main Obasanjo supporter, former military leader Ibrahim 
Babangida, got rich off of corruption and continue to live off of 
that wealth, anti-corruption activists assert. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Abacha's death in June 1998, Nigeria has convicted few  
people of corruption, and former officials suspected of corruption 
continue to live openly with little fear of prosecution. While 
Obasanjo forced dozens of senior military generals to retire, there 
have yet to be broad investigations of the military necessary to 
root out deeply entrenched corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Obasanjo's government has shown willingness to prosecute  
some of the most brutal officials of the Abacha regime. Abacha's 
son and one of his top security officials were recently arrested in 
connection with the slaying of pro-democracy activist Kudirat 
Abiola, a wife of the late Moshood Abiola, winner of the 1993 
presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Abiola died of a heart attack in prison a month after Abacha  
died.

<HEADLINE> Micron Makes Chip Deal With Gateway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Micron Technology Inc. has reached an  
agreement to become Gateway Inc.'s largest memory chip supplier -- 
its second such deal this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boise-based semiconductor company said Wednesday that it has  
entered the five-year agreement to provide a ``near majority'' of 
the personal computer manufacturer's memory chips. The announcement 
came two days after Micron Technology made a similar deal with 
Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ensures demand for Micron Technology's products  
and provides Gateway with a steady supply of chips. Details were 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts speculated the Compaq deal could mean $2 billion to $4  
billion in chip sales for Micron each year. No estimates were 
available for the Gateway agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway is the No. 2 direct-seller of personal computers in the  
United States, following top-seller Dell Computer Corp. Nampa-based 
Micronpc.com ranks third in direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really gives us another large, steady customer,'' Micron  
Technology spokeswoman Julie Nash said. ``If you look at the 
industry right now, it probably makes sense for them to ensure they 
have product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dynamic random access memory chips have been in short supply  
recently because of events such as September's earthquake in 
Taiwan. Prices jumped from about $4 for a 64-megabit DRAM chip this 
summer to $20 in September. They have settled to about $12. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things clients have a demand for is memory,''  
Gateway spokesman John Spelich said. ``We don't perceive supply 
issues for the fourth quarter. But supply is tight for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Micron Technology is Idaho's largest private employer, with  
nearly 12,000 workers.

<HEADLINE> McCain's First Campaign Ads Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- John McCain, seeking to build on his  
second-place standing in New Hampshire, today unveiled his first 
television ad -- a spot that focuses on his prisoner-of-war courage 
rather than his campaign platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides presented the commercial in Hanover, where McCain will  
face his rivals for the Republican nomination in a debate tonight. 
The ad will begin airing in New Hampshire on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 60-second spot features black-and-white still photos  
and footage of McCain as a young Navy pilot who was shot down over 
Hanoi in 1967. He spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war, at one point 
refusing an offer to be released early because he was the son and 
grandson of Navy admirals. 
</P>
<P>
	After an announcer extolls his ``commitment to country and  
fellow prisoners,'' McCain appears as a senator and on the campaign 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	The ad stays away from any stands in specific issues.  
</P>
<P>
	``I swear to you that from my first day in office to the last  
breath I draw, I will do everything in my power to make you proud 
of your government,'' McCain says in a snippet from a campaign 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said the ad cost about $30,000 to produce, but refused to  
say how much air time was purchased. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought enough to be very effective, but we're not going to  
tell the Bush campaign that this morning,'' said media consultant 
Greg Stevens, whose company, Stevens Reed Curcio and Company, 
produced the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens said future commercials will delve into the issues, but  
the first one was designed to tell McCain's story, much as his 
recent book ``Faith of My Fathers'' did. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theme of our campaign is that he has the character to do  
what's right and the courage to fight for it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Committee Approves Cancer Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women now eligible for a government program  
that provides free mammograms and pap smears also could get help 
paying for cancer treatment under legislation approved by a House 
committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Early detection is wonderful, but it has to be accompanied by  
medical treatment,'' said Rep. Karen McCarthy, D-Mo., a supporter 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 800,000 women nationwide have received free mammograms to  
screen for breast cancer and free pap smears to screen for cervical 
cancer under a program created by Congress in 1990 to help those 
who lack private health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	But thousands who have discovered through the program that they  
have cancer have no insurance to help pay for treatment. Either 
their incomes are too high or they are too young to qualify for 
Medicaid or Medicare, the government health insurance programs for 
the poor and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation passed by Thursday by a voice vote in the House  
Commerce Committee would allow states to make these women eligible 
for Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer treatment, which would cost the federal government  
$315 million over five years, has a good chance of getting final 
approval from Congress this fall. More than half the Senate's 100 
members have cosponsored a similar bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The version approved by the House committee included an  
amendment that has slowed progress. It would require condom 
manufacturers to label packaging with warnings that condoms do not 
prevent transmission of a sexually transmitted disease called human 
papillomavirus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., an obstetrician, has demanded the  
condom labeling because some strains of the virus, known as HPV, 
can lead to cervical cancer and nearly all women who contract 
cervical cancer have it first. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers question the value of such warnings because it is  
hard to stop transmission of HPV during sex and those infected 
often experience no symptoms for decades.

<HEADLINE> Shows Feature Master Photographers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At 91, photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson is  
getting his first major show in Washington -- portraits of 
celebrities from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to actress Sarah 
Bernhardt's former maid, who was a concierge in a museum when she 
was snapped in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartier-Bresson's subjects included satirist A.J. Liebling and  
writers Truman Capote, William Faulkner, Jean-Paul Sartre and 
Simone de Beauvoir. There's also Robert Kennedy, lolling in a beach 
chair, his hairy chest showing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Cartier-Bresson) never cropped a picture, shot almost  
always in black-and-white and from eye level,'' said Mary C. 
Panzer, the National Portrait Gallery's photography curator. 
</P>
<P>
	But eye level might be almost anywhere. Cartier-Bresson is  
5-foot-10 and wiry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw a film of him at work,'' Ms. Panzer said. ``He danced  
around like Fred Astaire, but he never climbed on the furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, which opens Friday, is called ``Tete a Tete,''  
French for ``face to face'' -- a reference to the intimacy typical 
of his photos. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartier-Bresson took the most recent photo two years ago. It  
shows Lucien Freud, one of Britain's best known painters, the back 
of his head against the back of an easel and the back of a 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leading French painters, pictured in 1944, were apparently  
caught in a cold winter of the German occupation in World War II. 
Georges Rouault, in heavy black homburg hat and bulky three-piece 
suit, stands against a radiator. Pierre Bonnard, a hat jammed over 
his ears, a muffler high and tight under his chin, rubs his hands 
as if thinking of his canvases in the background as potential 
heating fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of a show put on first at London's National Portrait  
Gallery, the 70 pictures in Washington do not include as many 
images but all can be seen in the catalog that goes with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit is the last before the gallery and the National  
Museum of American Art, which share the 136-year-old Patent Office 
Building, close for renovation. Gallery director Alan Fern said he 
plans to reopen in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cartier-Bresson exhibit is Washington's second by famous  
Paris photographers this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the National Gallery of Art opened a show of work  
by Brassai -- the pseudonym of Gyula Halasz. Although he is a 
Hungarian from Transylvania, Paris was his subject and most of his 
shots, like many of Cartier-Bresson's, have Paris backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Brassai did portraits too: artists Salvador Dali and Pablo  
Picasso and the American expatriate writer Henry Miller. But it was 
the Paris scene that fascinated him -- the Pont Neuf, the city's 
signature bridge, a masquerade at the Pre Catalan restaurant in the 
Bois de Boulogne, nude prostitutes in a brothel parlor, seen from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	He also brought a touch of Paris to a shot of a woman walking  
past a statue in front of a New Orleans antique shop, the curve of 
her skirt echoing the curve in Napoleon's coat. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Tete a Tete - Portraits by Henri Cartier-Bresson'' will be at  
the National Portrait Gallery through Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brassai -- the Eye of Paris'' will be at the National Gallery  
of Art until Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> CBS Earnings Beat Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. said Thursday it earned a  
better-than-expected $35 million in the third quarter on strong 
performance in its TV network operations and its Infinity 
Broadcasting radio and outdoor advertising division. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, which plans to merge with entertainment conglomerate Viacom  
Inc., reported income from continuing operations of $35 million, or 
5 cents a share, compared with a loss of $38 million, or 5 cents a 
share, in the third quarter of 1998, which included a special 
charge related to a corporate restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was $47 million, or 7 cents a share, in the  
July-September quarter, compared with a loss of $43 million, or 6 
cents a share, a year earlier. These results reflect one-time items 
including a $12 million gain for an accounting change in the latest 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results in the latest quarter were a penny above analyst  
expectations, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. CBS' stock 
rose $4.43 3/4 to $49.62 1/2 a share in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

	Revenues came to $1.71 billion, up from $1.58 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Infinity said its net income rose to $111  
million, or 13 cents a share, in the third quarter from $67 
million, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues were $619 
million, up from $534 million a year ago.

<P>
	Infinity stock trades separately on the NYSE. It was up $2.19 at  
$34.06 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Karmazin, president and chief executive officer of CBS, said  
in a statement the strong third-quarter performance reflected 
Infinity's showing as well as good results from CBS television and 
cable divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested this would continue into the fourth quarter, noting  
that ``the CBS Television Network enjoyed a strong start to the 
1999-2000 season, with ratings gains in prime time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement accompanying the earnings results said CBS expects  
to close its $2.5 billion purchase of King World Productions Inc.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Launches Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The advertising starts next week and will  
culminate in March as the Census Bureau tries to make sure everyone 
knows the national head count is under way. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency kicked off its effort Wednesday, focusing on the  
theme: ``This is our future. Don't leave it blank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials are trying to increase the share of people who fill  
out and mail back their Census forms because the agency's biggest 
expense is for the hundreds of thousands of people who go out in 
search of folks who do not respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is launching a $167 million paid advertising effort  
including television, radio, outdoor and print -- various ads in 17 
different languages -- seeking to reach everyone in America. 
</P>
<P>
	By next March the Census will be the third largest broadcast  
advertiser, trailing only McDonald's and Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
	``America cannot have a successful census without the support of  
the American people,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of 
the House Government Reform's Census subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Census Day is April 1, 2000. The results will be used to  
reapportion seats in the House and many state and local districts 
and to distribute $185 billion in federal aid to cities, states and 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Census promotions have relied on free public  
service announcements, which usually ran on television and radio at 
odd hours when few were tuned in. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the ads will present messages about Census 2000 for  
the general public, as well as specific messages for blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, American Indians, native Hawaiians and other 
Pacific Islanders and Alaska natives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's event underscores a broad-based commitment to ensure  
that Census 2000 is the most accurate, complete and fair count 
possible,'' said Commerce Secretary William M. Daley. The Census 
Bureau is part of the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the people's census,'' added Census Director Kenneth  
Prewitt. ``We believe everyone counts, and we want this message to 
reach every person living in the United States, Puerto Rico and the 
island areas.''

<HEADLINE> White House Nixes Appointment Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House will not give Sen. Jesse Helms  
government records as a condition for holding hearings on the 
ambassadorial nomination of former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a serious demand,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has  
said an ``ethical cloud'' hangs over Moseley-Braun's nomination to 
be ambassador to New Zealand. The Illinois Democrat, the first 
black woman elected to the Senate, lost her bid for re-election in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., offered to have a hearing and a vote next week --  
if his committee received an array of tax and Justice Department 
documents by ``no later than Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stalemate increased the likelihood that President Clinton  
would give Moseley-Braun a ``recess appointment'' as ambassador, 
Democratic officials suggested. That would enable her to serve -- 
without Senate confirmation -- until the end of this Congress in 
January 2001, when Clinton leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	But such a strategy could anger Senate Republicans, as it did  
earlier this year when Clinton used a recess appointment to install 
an openly gay San Francisco businessman, James Hormel, as 
ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to continue to work through the relevant  
committees to try to get movement,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Clinton, Helms said the documents were ``vital''  
to his committee's consideration of the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said the request was exhaustive, covering  
tax and other records of nearly everyone who had worked in the 
Senate for Moseley-Braun or in her campaigns. It could not and 
would not be honored, administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for Helms, said Helms' overture was  
``a very serious offer. ... If they don't want to take it, that 
would be an unfortunate choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessen said that Monday ``is not a drop dead deadline'' and  
could be extended, although that could delay the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	If administration officials cannot get the requested documents,  
it only suggests they did not do a very good job in vetting the 
nominee in the first place, Thiessen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues: allegations, never proven, that Moseley-Braun  
used leftover 1992 campaign funds to pay for personal luxuries. The 
accusations were raised during her unsuccessful 1998 re-election 
campaign against Republican Peter Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are accusing the other of playing politics.  
</P>
<P>
	Helms made his offer to hold a hearing next week after civil  
rights groups and congressional Democrats castigated him for 
apparently seeking to block the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms clashed with Moseley-Braun during her one term in  
Congress, most memorably on the Senate floor over use of the 
Confederate Flag. She later accused Helms of taunting her in an 
elevator by singing ``Dixie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution allows the president to make an end run around  
the Senate confirmation process by appointing an official while 
Congress is in recess. Congress is expected to begin a long recess 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and administration Democrats, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said that such a route was becoming 
increasingly attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	But the officials said they did not want to openly raise the  
option so long as the Senate was in session -- in order not to 
provoke retaliation by Helms and other Republicans against other 
Clinton nominees still pending confirmation.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Rail Against Calif. Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A California hazardous-materials law -- and  
private lawyers who enforce it -- are forcing small businesses 
nationwide that send products to the state to label as dangerous 
such things as sand, or face thousands of dollars of fines, 
business owners complained Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Strauss, president of Activa Products Inc. of Marshall,  
Texas, told a congressional hearing that the decorative sand he 
markets is technically called crystalline silica. That is one of 
600 substances requiring a label warning about health risks for 
cancer or reproductive ailments under California's Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Strauss said a Duke University toxicologist concluded the sand  
was a health threat only if used in a poorly ventilated room every 
day for 21 years. But the company is fighting a civil lawsuit 
threatening fines of $2,500 a day over the company's failure to 
carry a warning label in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sand essentially is no different than the sand you'd find  
at the beach, including beaches in California,'' he told the House 
Small Business Committee. ``The manner in which these bounty-hunter 
lawyers enforce Proposition 65 acts as a sledgehammer against small 
businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1986 California law lets private lawyers file a notice of  
intent to sue over alleged violations. If state authorities do not 
step in and take over within 60 days, the private attorneys can 
pursue the cases on their own. Such attorneys have obtained 
out-of-court settlements, and if successful in court, they are 
entitled to one-fourth of the fine the court imposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman James Talent, R-Mo., said he is considering  
ways to curtail such legal actions, saying he and other members of 
Congress are studying whether the state law could be pre-empted by 
a change in federal Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	By requiring labels for all products in California, the law  
reaches beyond the state's borders to any company producing 
something shipped to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of the California law acknowledged some abuses by  
aggressive lawyers but said the law has yielded good results such 
as the removal of lead in plumbing fixtures and ceramic dishes, and 
trichloroethylene in typewriter-correction fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe consumers need to know this so they can protect  
themselves,'' said Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Weil, deputy attorney general in California, said the law  
filled gaps in regulatory networks and prodded federal action to 
protect consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, a few unscrupulous private attorneys have made  
this law unduly burdensome for small business because of the manner 
in which they have sought to enforce it,'' he said. ``Of course, 
the great benefits of Proposition 65 clearly outweigh these 
problems, but we nonetheless are addressing them in several ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Skommesa, president of Ellis Paint Co. in Los Angeles,  
settled a lawsuit that cost $54,000 because fighting the case was 
considered more expensive. She said her case involved a dispute 
over the placement of a comma in the warning label.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Appear With David Letterman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's become a regular stop on the New York  
Yankees' victory tour: Win the World Series and head to the Ed 
Sullivan Theater for an appearance on the ``Late Show with David 
Letterman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several players and manager Joe Torre helped Letterman on  
Thursday with his nightly ``Top Ten'' list, which included shots at 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has claimed her support for the Bronx 
Bombers, as well as a poke at the Florida Marlins -- one of the 
worst teams in baseball this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the ``Top Ten Things the Yankees Have Always Wanted to  
Say'': 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Take off the Yankee hat, Hillary,'' catcher-first baseman  
Jim Leyritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``You know how you have to give 110 percent? When you play the  
Marlins, it's more like 40 percent or 50 percent,'' infielder Clay 
Bellinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Man, oh man, do I love betting on baseball,'' pitching coach  
Mel Stottlemyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- And, from Torre, ``I was rooting for the Braves.''  
</P>
<P>
	But when Letterman introduced Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter,  
``Late Show'' staffer George Clarke came onstage and pinch-hit for 
the heartthrob: ``Chicks dig me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Yankees appearing on the program included pitchers Roger  
Clemens, Jason Grimsley and Jeff Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre returned later for a sit-down with Letterman, giving him a  
baseball from the Series autographed by the team. He also let him 
try on his World Series championship ring, which Letterman 
playfully pocketed. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre retaliated by taking off one of Letterman's shoes.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're even,'' Torre said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh yeah, you're even now, oh yeah,'' Letterman replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Letterman asked Torre if he had been hoping for a Subway Series  
between the Yankees and the Mets. Torre said he wouldn't have been 
looking forward to the frenzy it would have created in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans missed out on a great Subway Series,'' but ``it would  
have been non-stop.''

<HEADLINE> Scene in Pearl Harbor Film Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- The National Park Service has cut a  
scene from a tourist film at the USS Arizona Memorial after 
Japanese-Americans complained it mistakenly portrayed the island's 
Japanese as World War II saboteurs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to cutting the scene, the Park Service added a  
disclaimer to the film saying no proven sabotage by Hawaii's 
Japanese ever occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, the film showed a Japanese man cutting sugar cane  
before the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. The narrator then 
talked about saboteurs among Hawaii's Japanese population, but it 
never mentioned that the FBI found no evidence of local Japanese 
saboteurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifelong Hawaii residents Yoshie and James Tanabe, who saw the  
film last year, complained to the Park Service with the support of 
the Japanese American Citizens League, the Pearl Harbor Survivors 
and the Americans of Japanese Ancestry Veterans Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``It leaves a doubt in viewers' minds, maybe that's why the  
Japanese were sent to detention camps,'' said Mrs. Tanabe, who was 
10 when the war began. ``I felt wronged when I am depicted as a 
possible saboteur.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Up on Sales Talk / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures rose sharply in early trading  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted for a second straight 
day by rumors that China is poised to buy large amounts of U.S. 
soybeans. Grains also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices extended their rally on unconfirmed reports that  
China may buy from 100,000 to 300,000 tons of U.S. soybeans by 
week's end. Soybeans had dipped to their lowest level in seven 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures moved higher after the U.S. Department of  
Agriculture reported weekly export sales that were exceptionally 
strong. Sales of 1.63 million tons represented a high for the 
marketing year. It was the second straight week that sales topped 1 
million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also rose as forecasts predicted no precipitation in the  
next six to 10 days in the already-parched U.S. winter wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 2 1/4 cents to $2.59 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1 cent to $2.01 1/2 a bushel; December oats rose 3/4

<HEADLINE> EU Nations Settle Chocolate Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union ministers today resolved  
a long-running dispute over what can be called chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers approved a directive that allows products with up to 5  
percent vegetable fat -- other than cocoa butter -- to retain the 
chocolate label, provided that it is stated clearly on the label 
that the product includes non-cocoa butter vegetable fats. B 
</P>
<P>
	elgium and the Netherlands voted against the compromise at a  
meeting in Luxembourg, but were overruled by the 12 nations that 
voted for it. Luxembourg abstained. 
</P>
<P>
	``This directive is an attack on quality chocolate,'' said a  
statement from the Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's chocolate debate dates back to 1992 and has pitted  
purists against those taking a more relaxed view of what can go 
into chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Germany,  
Greece and the Netherlands have banned cocoa-butter substitutes in 
home-produced or imported chocolate. Belgium has taken the lead in 
defending its famed chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain, Ireland, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Finland and Sweden  
allow other vegetable fats and object they can't call the resulting 
products chocolate when they want to sell them in the other EU 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries wanting to stick to a 100 percent cocoa butter rule  
said they feared diluting chocolate with palm oil and other fats 
would destabilize the economies of cocoa-exporting countries and 
undermine consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU consumes about half the world's cocoa crop.  
</P>
<P>
	Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, has argued that  
the draft law could cause a drop of up to 200,000 metric tons a 
year in EU cocoa consumption. World annual cocoa bean production is 
about 2.8 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.

<HEADLINE> House Bars Assisted Suicide Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is looking to the  
Senate to reverse a House vote as Congress wrestles with the 
emotional question of what role doctors should play in helping 
suffering patients die. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved a bill Wednesday that bars doctors from using  
federally controlled drugs to aid in a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The 271-156 vote came despite opponents' claims that such a  
bill, if it became law, would put federal drug agents in the role 
of making health care decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed in the vote, and we will working in the  
Senate to see what can be done,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said 
today. The Justice Department opposed the provision making 
physician-assisted suicide a federal crime with mandatory 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-abortion forces have made the bill by Rep. Henry Hyde,  
R-Ill., a priority this year. It would create a major headache for 
Oregon, the only state that has legalized physician-assisted 
suicide for patients with less than six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	All 15 patients who died under Oregon's landmark law during its  
first full year in 1998 used controlled substances to end their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats from Oregon were pleased they garnered more than  
the 146 votes that would be needed to sustain a veto -- although 
President Clinton has not yet said whether he would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version of the bill, by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.,  
has not yet come to the floor, but Nickles said he hoped to pass it 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has pledged to filibuster the bill, but  
said he faces a ``very uphill'' battle to defeat the measure given 
Nickles' No. 2 position as the majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate action on the bill, previously thought by many to be  
unlikely in 1999, becomes more of a possibility because of a 
federal budget fight that is expected to keep lawmakers in the 
nation's capital into next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's bill, while it penalizes doctors who aid in a suicide,  
encourages physicians to treat the pain of dying patients. The 
measure authorizes $5 million for more training and education to 
improve end-of-life care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suicide is the ultimate act of despair and facilitating the  
intentional killing of a human life is the opposite of healing,'' 
Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the bill would discourage pain treatment for  
millions of Americans. Doctors would be so worried about losing 
their licenses to prescribe drugs, and spending at least 20 years 
in jail for aiding in a suicide, that they would decline to 
dispense needed medication, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an extraordinary intrusion not only into states'  
rights, but into the practices of medicine,'' said Rep. Peter 
DeFazio, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde dismissed suggestions that his bill would create a medical  
``Gestapo,'' saying federal drug agents already review 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	During the House debate, some members spoke of the issue in  
personal terms -- a child who died of leukemia, a parent who died 
from cancer -- but used those experiences to draw opposite 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Hyde supporters compared physician-assisted suicide to  
euthanasia and abortion and invoked the name of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, 
the Michigan physician who has battled to make the practice legal. 
Kevorkian is serving a 10- to 25-year sentence for second-degree 
murder and drug delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Oregonians painstakingly tried to point out the protections in  
their law that limit the circumstances when people can take their 
lives. ``Please read the Oregon statute before you vote,'' pleaded 
Rep. David Wu, D-Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide opponents have been pressing for legislation  
since June 1998, when Reno ruled that federal drug agents cannot 
move against doctors who help terminally ill patients die under 
Oregon's Death With Dignity Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But while last year's version of Hyde-Nickles fell flat, this  
year's bill has won more support from medical groups because it 
encourages pain treatment and gives doctors some assurances they 
wouldn't be prosecuted if a patients died accidentally from pain 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and National Hospice  
Organization are among the groups that support the measure after 
opposing last year's bill, although several other medical groups 
and several state medical societies oppose this year's Hyde-Nickles 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben wrote Oct. 19 that the  
Clinton administration supported the part of the bill that 
encouraged pain treatment but opposed the section that would make 
physician-assisted suicide a federal crime with ``harsh mandatory 
penalties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Imposing such penalties would also effectively block state  
policy-making at a time when ... the states are still engaged in an 
earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality and 
practicality of physician-assisted suicide,'' Raben wrote.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Squawk at Bush's Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican candidates weren't the only ones  
squawking about George W. Bush's absence from Thursday's debate -- a 
man in a chicken costume paraded outside the theater with a sign 
saying ``Chicken George Won't Debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was reminiscent of his father's 1992 campaign for  
re-election, when ``Chicken George'' frequently showed up at 
President Bush's rallies to mock his reluctance to debate on 
candidate Bill Clinton's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Hanover, Joe Bramante wasn't dressed to look like  
poultry, but he carried a sign with the same chicken message. The 
other side of the sign read ``Stop hiding in the Bushs'', a jab at 
Bush's famous name. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're gonna run for president in New Hampshire on issues  
that affect my children and my senior citizen parents, don't hide 
behind your mother and father's name. I'm not going to tolerate 
that,'' Bramante said.

<HEADLINE> Woosnam in Reported Plane Scare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEREZ, Spain (AP) -- Just two days after the death of U.S. Open  
champion Payne Stewart, European golf star Ian Woosnam had a scare 
in his own private plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail of London reported today that Woosnam's  
twin-engine plane began depressurizing Wednesday while the former 
Masters champion was flying in from his home in Britain's Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty minutes into the flight, oxygen masks dropped down.  
Woosnam, two friends accompanying him and pilot Robin Richards 
grabbed them and put them on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bit scary. I don't want to make a big thing about it,  
especially after the tragedy of Payne, but it was a strange 
coincidence,'' Woosnam told the newspaper. ``We had just been 
talking about what happened to Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woosnam's pilot immediately dived to equalize outer and inner  
pressure on the plane, which had been at an altitude of 15,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pilot told us that a compression seal had gone and that  
everything was fine,'' Woosnam told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination of the plane revealed a fault in a compression  
seal, the newspaper said. A loss of cabin pressure is suspected as 
being a factor in the crash Monday of Stewart's plane. The golfer 
and five others were killed, 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have continued the flight at a lower level, but there  
were too many big mountains ahead and it would have been very 
bumpy,'' Woosnam said. ``So we returned to Jersey. After what 
happened to Payne, we did not want to take any chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woosnam flew in on another plane, then refused further comment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to talk about it,'' he said in the locker  
room of the Montecastillo Club before teeing off in the first round 
of the $1.6 million Volvo Masters.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Cut Gunderson and Shave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Left-handed reliever Eric Gunderson and  
utility infielder Jon Shave were cut Thursday from the Texas 
Rangers, who put them on unconditional release waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunderson had been on the disabled list since May 9 and has  
surgery July 17 on his pitching shoulder. He had a 7.20 ERA in 10 
innings, pitching in 11 games with no decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Shave appeared in 43 games last season, hitting .288 with no  
homers and nine RBIs. He started 13 games at shortstop, four games

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard Warns About Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Hewlett-Packard Co. is warning Wall  
Street it is uncomfortable with current estimates for 
fourth-quarter earnings, prompting several analysts to sharply 
reduce their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Company chief executive Carly Fiorina in early October warned  
the massive 7.6 magnitude earthquake last month in Taiwan would 
affect sales and result in earnings at the low end of expectations, 
prompting Wall Street at the time to lower its earnings and revenue 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But in calls made to analysts this week, company executives said  
even those lowered expectations were too high. Hewlett-Packard did 
not make a formal announcement of its earnings expectations for the 
fiscal quarter that ends Oct. 31, and a spokesman did not return 
phone calls seeking comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich said Wednesday in a  
daily report that ``HP appears less comfortable with analyst 
estimates for (the fourth-quarter), based on our conversations with 
the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed its problems on weaker-than-expected sales of  
its Unix servers line, a problem that also is likely to affect 
sales of storage devices. The company just weeks ago announced it 
was realigning its servers sales force to make them more 
accountable for shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Milunovich slashed the company's per share earnings prospects by  
5 cents, to 73 cents a share. He cut the company's prospects for 
revenue growth to 6 percent, or $10.8 billion, from its earlier 
projection of 10 percent growth, or $11.3 billion, in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Other analysts who follow the company lowered their per-share  
expectations within a range of 70 cents to 73 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is a major maker of  
computers, printers and imaging products. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard stock tumbled $6.25 on Wednesday to $70.37 1/2 and  
fell to $67 in after-hours trading. But it was regaining some of 
the lost ground today on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was 
trading at $71.81 1/4 at late morning.

<HEADLINE> Reuters Stock Up on Various Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Shares in British media business Reuters Group PLC  
surged 6 percent in trading today after publication of positive 
broker research and a speculative story in the Financial Times that 
the company might become a takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's repurchase of 4.7 million shares was also a factor  
in the 6 percent rise in its share price, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebound ended weeks of steep decline for Reuters shares. Its  
stock tumbled 15 percent on Sept. 23 after an analyst briefing in 
New York, and plunged another 13 percent last Thursday when the 
company posted flat third quarter sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent drubbing led Reuters chief executive Peter Job to  
take the unusual step of urging employees to ``keep their cool'' 
and not lose confidence in the company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``The volatility of a share price can build very quickly into  
self-feeding doubt,'' he wrote Tuesday in a message to the 
company's 17,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters stock peaked in trading Thursday at $9.74 per share  
before settling back to finish at $9.41, up 6 percent from 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters was trading at around $14.85 as recently as  
mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities dealers gave some credit for the stock's vigor  
Thursday to an encouraging report from U.S. investment bank Morgan 
Stanley Dean Witter. The bank reiterated its opinion that Reuters 
was a strong buy, even though it lowered its target for the 
company's share price to $12.54 from $17.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor was the company's announcement of the stock  
repurchase -- a move that improves its price-to-earnings ratio. 
Reuters has some 1.4 billion shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Newman, an analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, a  
London-based brokerage, attributed much of Thursday's rise to the 
stock buyback, along with a strong performance by Tibco Software 
Inc., a Nasdaq-listed Internet firm in which Reuters has a 
controlling stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times also helped buoy the stock, running an  
opinion column Thursday suggesting that the depressed value of 
Reuters shares might make it an attractive takeover candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some analysts expressed skepticism about the newspaper  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's coming from a direct competitor,'' said Lorna Tilbian, a  
media analyst at brokerage WestLB Panmure. ``Is it objective? I 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reuters' ownership structure would likely complicate any  
takeover offer. The company, which floated its first shares in 
1984, has two important shareholding restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	First, no individual or organization can own 15 percent or more  
of Reuters' issued shares. If it does, the shareholder loses all 
voting rights until the stake to less than 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, the company established The Reuters Founders Share  
Company in 1984 ``to safeguard Reuters' independence, integrity and 
freedom from bias in the gathering and dissemination of news and 
information.'' Of that body's 15 trustees, it takes only two of 
them to veto any attempt to gain control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is nothing stopping a potential buyer from making  
an offer for Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
	Job said at a Thursday luncheon in Tokyo that independence is  
widely regarded as the main asset of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody would want to pursue the company and  
throw that asset away. So I don't believe it will be very easy for 
anybody to deprive Reuters of its independence and nobody has 
succeeded in doing so in these last 150 years.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticized for Skipping Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush's excuse for missing his  
second consecutive Republican presidential debate ``doesn't wash'' 
with the people of New Hampshire, rival Steve Forbes said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' the millionaire conservative said in an interview 
hours before the debate in nearby Hanover. ``It will be noticed. 
Why won't he put himself at risk like the rest of us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' advisers said the debate's format, which calls for  
questions from the audience, may not give candidates an opportunity 
to criticize Bush. Forbes and four other GOP candidates will face 
off in a repeat of their Bush-less debate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor, the leading candidate in the GOP  
field, will interview with a local television station before the 
debate to explain his absence. Bush chose to remain in Texas to 
join his wife, who is being honored by Southern Methodist 
University tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said it was a ploy to keep Bush above the fray, out of  
danger of making a mistake that could cost him his lead in polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to say his wife had a commitment and he made a  
commitment to her. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah,'' Forbes said, sitting 
in a booth at a local diner after shaking hands for 30 minutes. 
``And he'll go through his slogans while we're on stage going 
through substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```His consultants probably say this is brilliant, but the  
people of New Hampshire will say this doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had no plans to debate until January, but agreed to a  
December showdown amid pressure from his rivals and the advice of 
New Hampshire supporters who said he was running a risk of looking 
afraid to engage. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Wenger, a retired book wholesaler who was sipping coffee  
at the diner an hour before Forbes arrived, said Bush must prove 
he's worth his high poll ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you push somebody so far up so fast, the only way to move  
is down,'' said the Forbes backer.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise Sharply; Dow Up 184.27 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today after a new  
report showed that U.S. workers' wages and benefits are increasing 
at a slower than expected pace. The report raised hopes that 
inflation is not a threat to the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 184.27 at 10,579.16, extending Friday's 
92-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 25.01 at 1,321.72, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 36.71 at 2,839.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its  
employment cost index rose by 0.8 percent in the third quarter, 
slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many economists were 
expecting. Economists view that index as a significant barometer of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Fed will raise interest rates for the third time this 
year in its continuing effort to ward off inflation. While the 
employment cost index did not suggest that the Fed will hold rates 
steady, it helped some investors believe that any rate increase 
would be modest, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the  
exclusion of a strong report on the nation's gross domestic 
product. The government reported today that the U.S. economy 
expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent from July through 
September, the fastest pace this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com fell 6 15/16 to 69. The online  
retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results 
topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as 
the company spent heavily to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 160.95 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 4.41 to 421.18.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.7 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAUSALITO, Calif. (AP) -- A California Supreme Court justice was  
arrested for investigation of drunken driving after an officer saw 
her driving on a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyce Kennard was pulled over Saturday night on Highway 101 in  
Sausalito after coming off the Golden Gate Bridge. A motorcycle 
officer saw her driving on the flat, said state Highway Patrol 
Officer Marcus Bartholomew. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he pulled the car over, he contacted the driver and  
observed symptoms of possible intoxication,'' Bartholomew said. 
</P>
<P>
	A blood sample was taken and a report was filed with the Marin  
County district attorney's office, Bartholomew said. Prosecutors 
said they were awaiting results of the blood test before deciding 
on charges. Test results were expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard, 58, was returning home from dinner with friends when  
she got the flat and was looking for a place to pull off the road, 
said Tiffany Rystrom, a friend and her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard did not immediately return calls Thursday. She was  
appointed in 1989 and is the second woman and first Asian American 
on the court.

<HEADLINE> Howitzer Picture Cut From Yearbook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEVIS, Minn. (AP) -- A high school is refusing to allow a picture  
to appear in the yearbook of a student sitting on a 155 mm 
howitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevis High officials said the photo of senior Samantha Jones  
violates the school's ``zero-tolerance'' policy toward weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy prohibits images of guns, knives or other weapons on  
shirts, hats or in pictures. It also bans squirt guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The snapshot shows Ms. Jones, who is joining the Army in June,  
perched on the small cannon outside a Veterans of Foreign Wars 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's in military, recreational or sporting form,  
anything shaped like a gun or knife is banned,'' said 
Superintendent Dick Magaard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones' mother, Sue Jones, petitioned for a vote by the  
School Board, which deadlocked 3-3 this week on publishing the 
photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I back my daughter 100 percent on this. The lawyer will be  
sending you papers,'' she told school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	School Board chairman Marv Vredenburg defended Ms. Jones by  
pointing to war photographs already hanging on school walls. ``She 
is honoring the flag and service,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Denver DA Wants Video in Hate Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Prosecutors want to present videotaped testimony  
from the star witness to the slaying of a West African immigrant, a 
woman whose erratic behavior led a judge to overturn the conviction 
of another suspect in the case, a defense lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Thill, 21, is accused of the racially motivated killing  
of Oumar Dia as he waited for a downtown Denver bus in 1997, and of 
paralyzing Jeannie VanVelkinburgh, who tried to help Dia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh, who is paralyzed from the waist down, has  
been scheduled to undergo surgery for some time and it would be 
more convenient to interview her on videotape, prosecutor Tim 
Twining said in filing his motion Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that because of this witness's physical  
infirmities, she will be unable to be present and testify at 
trial,'' the motion said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh's testimony helped convict Thill's companion,  
Jeremiah Barnum, in March. But a judge overturned the conviction, 
saying her emotional behavior jeopardized Barnum's right to a fair 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	While testifying, Ms. VanVelkinburgh, 37, screamed obscenities,  
belched loudly, told conflicting stories and sometimes refused to 
answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver District Judge Edward Simons said her behavior was the  
worst he had seen during 24 years as a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Public defender Kathleen Lord, who is representing Thill, would  
not comment on the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	While videotaped testimony is sometimes used in civil cases to  
save time and money, it is rare in a murder trial since jurors need 
to carefully evaluate the witnesses' credibility, legal analyst 
Andrew Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	To testify by tape, witnesses have to prove it would be a  
hardship to testify in person, he said. Usually that means they are 
unable to travel to the courthouse because of doctor's orders, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill's trial is to begin Monday in Pueblo, where it was moved  
over concerns that an impartial jury could not be seated in Denver. 
Pre-trial hearings are being held in Denver.

<HEADLINE> Soda Vending Can Be Price Sensitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Soft-drink makers including Coca-Cola are  
studying ``smart'' vending machines that would allow them to boost 
prices by wireless remote control if it's hot outside, and cut 
prices if business is slack. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke acknowledged on Thursday that it is conducting such tests,  
but the company sought to quickly assure customers that price 
increases aren't imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the pricing is something we don't see happening  
anytime soon, if ever,'' said Rob Baskin, a Coke spokesman. ``You 
could probably make a vending machine that could fly, too, but I 
don't think we would do that. Our plans for the technology aren't 
about raising the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, news of the research drew a snipe from Coke's main  
rival, Pepsico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think machines that raise prices in hot weather exploit  
consumers,'' said spokesman Jeff Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Coke would likely to be hesitent to impose large  
heat-related price increases for fear of alienating customers in a 
highly competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
	The research became public in an article earlier this month in  
Veja, a Brazilian news magazine. Coca-Cola's chairman and chief 
executive, M. Douglas Ivester was quoted on how hot weather can 
increase thirst. The New York Times excerpted Ivester's comments 
Thursday. The desire for a cold drink increases during the summer 
heat, Ivester said, so ``it is fair that it should be more 
expensive. The machine will simply make this process automatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology to create the smart vending machines isn't new.  
Most such applications consist of a cellular telephone connection 
and computer chips inside the machine. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to price increases related to heat, machines located  
at sports stadiums or theaters could also be programmed to charge 
more during big events. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology can also tell bottlers how full the machines are,  
how often they're visited and which brands are selling better than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Such data would allow delivery drivers to bypass machines they  
know are stocked, or only deliver brands they know are sold out, 
said Ron Sewell, president of Automated Network Solutions, a 
Roswell, Ga., company assisting with Coke's testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't heard much about using this as a tool to raise  
prices,'' Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skip Carpenter, a beverage analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette, predicted if Coke does increase prices, they will be 
minimal, so as not to alienate customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day it's not going to be $1.50 instead of a buck. We're  
very early in this whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a price jump on a sizzling summer day would alienate people  
like Sharona Litwin, a Miami Beach, Fla., resident who said she 
loves Diet Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's completely taking advantage of the consumer,''  
Ms. Litwin said. ``That's an outrageous concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outrageous or not, the idea demonstrates a basic application of  
the law of supply and demand, said Mark McCabe, an assistant 
economics professor at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Coke is merely tinkering with technology to assess  
customer behavior, much the way airlines have used sophisticated 
computer software to adjust prices on flights to fill more seats. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Visits Twin Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINA, Minn. (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan's visit Thursday to the Twin Cities included a book 
signing and a campaign fund-raiser, but no meeting with the highest 
officeholder of his newly adopted party. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Gov. Jesse Ventura wasn't interested in meeting with  
Buchanan, plenty of other Minnesotans were. More than 200 lined up 
for a book-signing at a suburban bookstore and chanted ``Go Pat 
Go'' as he entered the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, however, said his schedule was full and he didn't have  
time to meet with Buchanan, who signed copies of his book ``A 
Republic, Not an Empire.'' When asked whether he had any interest 
in talking to Buchanan, the governor said, ``no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who joined the Reform Party on Monday, is considerably  
more conservative than Ventura. The former Republican opposes 
legalized abortion; Ventura supports abortion and gay rights. 
Ventura always has said Buchanan is welcome in the party. But the 
governor also wants someone else to be the party's presidential 
nominee and even has left open the possibility of entering the race 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor's got a right to disagree with me,'' Buchanan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he's a good fit for the party because of his  
opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, support of 
campaign finance changes, pledge to keep U.S. soldiers out of 
foreign wars, push to stop illegal immigration and promise to stand 
up to China. 
</P>
<P>
	To those in the party who think he's too conservative, Buchanan  
said, ``They know Pat Buchanan. I bring to the party my beliefs and 
values and ideals and I don't change them because the weather 
changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he was ready to take on any Reform candidate  
Ventura might support. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Reform Party Chairman Rick McCluhan, who brought  
greetings to Buchanan from the governor, said he doesn't believe 
Buchanan will find much support in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	But those who met the candidate at a Barnes and Noble bookstore  
were enthusiastic, and many said they were impressed with his 
honesty. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's book has been criticized because he argues that  
Germany was not a threat to the United States after 1940. Although 
some of those waiting for his autograph hadn't read the book, they 
weren't buying into the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rampetsreiter, 28, a Republican and Minneapolis financial  
consultant, said he's a supporter because Buchanan ``doesn't back 
down and stands up for what he believes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Leibel, 60, a home contractor from St. Paul, nodded in  
agreement and said, ``I like what he stands for. He doesn't weasel 
out, doesn't back down. He has his beliefs and that's it.''

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Finds No NCAA Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The University of Tennessee will report  
to the NCAA that an internal investigation found no credible 
allegations of academic fraud among athletes, the university's 
chief lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result is pretty much what we have always said,'' said  
general counsel Beauchamp Brogan said. ``We found no violations of 
NCAA rules at all. No violation, period. No cover-up. Nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan's office has been reviewing allegations raised by EPSN's  
Internet magazine Sept. 26 of tutors doing homework for UT 
athletes, particularly football players, as far back as 1995, and 
administrators failing to tell superiors about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Four football players were suspended before the  
Tennessee-Memphis game but later reinstated after Tennessee's 
preliminary investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing. Those 
initial findings were turned over to the Southeastern Conference 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said the report on the full investigation will be  
released by athletics director Doug Dickey on Friday as it is 
mailed to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very short. It won't take you long to read it,'' Brogan  
said. ``It reports what the allegations were, what we did and what 
our findings are and conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said his office ``interrogated dozens of witnesses'' as  
part of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though it is an in-house counsel, we have to do as  
thorough job as possible,'' he said. ``We can't sugarcoat our 
report. We don't answer to ESPN.com or anything like that. But we 
have to answer to the NCAA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan said the NCAA ``always has the right to accept the report  
as it is written or to come in and question our findings or to look 
at whatever we did. So we have to be cognizant of that and that is 
why we he to do the best job that we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brogan's office has conducted similar investigations in recent  
years involving the fraudulent use of a long-distance calling card 
by dozens of athletes and recruiting violations by an assistant 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Football coach Phillip Fulmer levied individual sanctions  
against players in the phone fraud case and the university fired 
the assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, chancellor Bill Snyder said that while the  
investigation turned up no violations, the focus turned to 
practices and policies concerning academic assistance to 
student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of the university's Faculty Senate voted to set up a  
five-member subcommittee to look into academic integrity issues, 
including whether grades were changed to keep athletes eligible for 
competition.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Family Sells George Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Kennedy family has agreed to sell its half  
of George, the political magazine founded by the late John F. 
Kennedy Jr., to Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, which owned the 
other half. 
</P>
<P>
	The price was not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Wednesday ensures the survival of the  
4-year-old magazine, whose fortunes had been slipping. Kennedy's 
death in a plane accident July 16 deepened those concerns since he 
was also the magazine's editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister Caroline said in a statement that she was  
pleased that Hachette would continue to publish the magazine. 
``It's a tribute to John's vision. John believed in George, and in 
the public's interest in politics when presented in a fresh and 
vital manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kliger, president of Hachette, said the magazine had  
``terrific potential'' and that the company would make ``a 
significant investment in all aspects of George's operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hachette, a subsidiary of the French publisher Hachette  
Filipacchi Medias, publishes 28 consumer magazines, including Elle, 
Premiere, Road &AMP;Track and Mirabella.

<HEADLINE> Angels Search for GM Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels' search for a general  
manager continues, with five candidates apparently still in the 
running. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Tim Mead said Thursday there was no timetable for  
the hiring of a successor to Bill Bavasi, but added, ``It remains 
the intent of the organization to reach closure as soon as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mead confirmed that Danny Evans, assistant GM for the Chicago  
White Sox, will interview with Disney officials Friday for the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels hoped to have a general manager in place before the  
World Series, and it appeared Montreal Expos executive Bill 
Stoneman was in line to get the job late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While Stoneman was not yet hired, Mead confirmed the former  
major league pitcher remains a candidate along with Evans, former 
New York Yankees GM Bob Watson, and assistant New York Mets general 
managers Omar Minaya, and Jim Duquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Bavasi resigned as general manager on Oct. 1 -- two days before  
the team completed a disappointing 70-92 season and finished last 
in the AL West. Bavasi held the job for nearly six years.

<HEADLINE> Some Ex-Space Chimps Leaving Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Twenty-one chimpanzee veterans of the space  
program are headed for retirement. They will be moved from a 
research laboratory in New Mexico to a sanctuary in Florida under a 
court settlement with the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Center for Captive Chimpanzee Care, which is building the  
sanctuary for the animals, sued the Air Force after it turned over 
111 chimps to the Coulston Foundation lab last year. In September, 
the Agriculture Department accused the Alamogordo, N.M., facility 
of mistreating its 650 chimpanzees and forced it to give up 300 of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boynton Beach, Fla.-based center, whose board includes  
renowned primatologist Jane Goodall, had unsuccessfully tried to 
obtain the Air Force chimps before filing its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the American public will be thrilled with this  
outcome, as they have shown their concern and support for these 
wonderful chimps who involuntarily served in the Air Force,'' said 
Carole Noon, the center's director. 
</P>
<P>
	The chimps headed for Florida include Lil' Mini, the youngest  
offspring of Mini, the last surviving ``astro-chimp'' from the 
space program's early days who died last year at age 41. 
</P>
<P>
	The 111 chimps are descendants or companions of Ham, the first  
chimpanzee to fly in space, and of Enos, the first chimp to orbit 
the Earth. Some were used in early jet airplane research, including 
the development of ejection seats. In more recent years, more than 
half of the animals have been used in AIDS and hepatitis 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving the chimps to Coulston was the easiest and cheapest  
option for the Air Force, as Coulston was already in possession of 
the chimpanzees pursuant to a lease agreement,'' said Robert Symon, 
a lawyer for the Florida center. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulston had operated an Air Force research facility at Holloman  
Air Force Base near Alamogordo since 1993. In addition to giving up 
300 of its chimps, the Coulston lab has also agreed to improve its 
staff and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services  
restricted the lab's handling of animals used in agency-sponsored 
projects.

<HEADLINE> Rose To Announce Tie With Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fresh off his first appearance on a major league  
baseball field in 10 years, Pete Rose has agreed to a promotional 
contract with Sportcut.com, a Web site scheduled to launch in 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	Sportcut.com said Thursday it intends to offer insider access to  
sports, with pages devoted to news, fans, an on-line store, 
auctions and interactive games. Its deal with Rose runs through 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sportcut.com is excited to be able to offer sports fans an  
unbiased platform with which to address the issue of Pete Rose and 
his future with baseball,'' Jordan Schlachter, the company's chief 
executive officer, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, then manager of the Cincinnati Reds, agreed to a lifetime  
ban from baseball in August 1989 following an investigation of his 
gambling habits. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared at Turner Field in Atlanta before Game 2 of the  
World Series as part of baseball's All-Century team, and received a 
55-second ovation, the longest given to any of the 18 living 
members of the team at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose applied for reinstatement in September 1997, but  
commissioner Bud Selig repeatedly has said he has seen no new 
evidence that would make him alter the ban. As long as Rose is on 
the permanently ineligible list, he cannot appear on the Hall of 
Fame ballot.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A benign report on labor costs gave Wall Street  
its best day in seven weeks today as investors who had been selling 
or staying on the sidelines jumped back into the market on the 
belief that inflation is under control. At the close of trading on 
Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 227.64 at 
10,622.53, extending Wednesday's 92-point gain. Broader stock 
indicators also rose sharply, with the Nasdaq composite index up 
71.27 at 2,873.79. The rally was solid and broad-based, but some 
analysts believed the wave of buying was an extreme reaction to 
fairly modest government data.

	Economy Grows at 4.8 Percent Rate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Economic growth rebounded from a sluggish  
spring at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, while 
a modest rise in Americans' wages and benefits eased inflation 
fears and sparked a Wall Street rally. The two government reports, 
released today, paint a picture of a remarkably robust economy that 
is growing rapidly without sparking out-of-control inflation, 
economists said. Still, many economists believe the Federal Reserve 
will raise interest rates for a third time this year when 
policy-makers meet Nov. 16. The 4.8 percent increase in the gross 
domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- from 
July through September followed a 1.9 percent rate of growth in the 
April-June quarter, the Commerce Department said.. 

</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. Economic Figures Revised  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major revision of government statistics  
released today shows that economic growth has been stronger, 
inflation lower and the dip in Americans' personal savings rate not 
quite as bad as previously believed. The changes were released by 
the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis as part of a 
twice-a-decade overhaul of the government's major economic 
statistic -- the gross domestic product. The revisions show that the 
GDP, the nation's total output of goods and services, grew by 4.3 
percent in 1998 and 4.5 percent in 1997, significantly higher than 
the 3.9 percent growth for both years that had been reported 
previously. 

</P>
<P>
	Employment Cost Index Rises  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department said today that U.S.  
workers' wages and benefits rose by 0.8 percent in the third 
quarter, slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many 
economists were expecting. The figure indicates that there's little 
inflationary pressure coming from rising wages. The department also 
said new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 15,000 to 
278,000 last week. 

</P>
<P>
	Help Wanted Ads Reach Two-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major  
U.S. newspapers fell to a two-year low in September, the Conference 
Board reported today, but it predicted the labor market will remain 
strong and the unemployment rate will fall further as the new 
millennium begins. The business-financed research organization said 
its Help-Wanted Advertising index fell to 83 in September from 87 
in August and 85 in both June and July. The last time the index was 
lower was in May 1997, when it reached 82. The index is used as a 
gauge of changes in job supply. It is watched by economists as an 
indicator of labor market conditions to help form estimates of 
unemployment rates.

	Barnesandnoble.com Beats Forecasts  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com reported a  
smaller-than-expected loss in the third quarter and said its sales 
more than tripled, but the Internet retailer's business still lags 
significantly behind its online rival Amazon.com. The New 
York-based barnesandnoble.com lost $21.9 million, or 15 cents a 
share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $18.6 
million, or 16 cents a share a year ago. Analysts had expected a 
loss of 23 cents a share for the quarter. Barnesandnoble.com stock 
was up 5/16 at 20. 

</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom Profits Nearly Triple  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom nearly tripled its third-quarter  
profits, extending a magnificent growth spurt fueled by a stream of 
takeovers that now includes the biggest merger ever, a proposed 
$115 billion purchase of Sprint. The supplier of long-distance and 
Internet services said today it earned $1.09 billion, or 55 cents 
per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, excluding the impact 
of an investment in Embratel, a Brazilian telephone company. That 
compares with a profit of $359 million or 19 cents a share in the 
same period last year from the combined operations of WorldCom and 
MCI Communications, which didn't complete their merger until the 
end of that quarter. The year-ago figures also exclude Embratel and 
merger-related costs. Analysts had expected an operating profit of 
54 cents a share. MCI WorldCom stock was up 6 1/16 at 83 5/8.

	Clear Channel Net Earnings Are Down

<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Clear Channel Communications Inc. said today

said its net income was $1.5 million, or zero cents per share, down 
from $11.5 million, or 5 cents a share, last year. The results met 
the expectations of analysts who had anticipated the company would 
break even on a per-share basis. Shares of Clear Channel were up 3 
9/16 at 81 9/16.

	Kellogg Earnings Up 20 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Co. reported its third-quarter earnings before one-time

The No. 1 cereal maker said it earned $170.8 million, or 42 cents 
per share, excluding the charges, compared to $141.9 million, or 35 
cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. The results for the 
quarter ending Sept. 30 were slightly higher than Wall Street 
expectations of 41 cents per share.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s first-quarter profit

rose 4 percent. The nation's biggest consumer products maker had 
earnings before one-time charges of $1.27 billion, or 88 cents per 
share, compared with $1.17 billion, or 80 cents per share, in the 
same period last year. The results for the quarter ended Sept. 30 
met analysts' expectations.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. is studying wireless technology

during periods of slower sales would presumably bring in more 
business -- unless the higher prices at other times enraged 
customers. But a spokesman for the world's biggest soft drink maker 
has no immediate plans to put such a machine into the marketplace. 
The New York Times reported today that the company is testing a 
machine that can automatically raise prices for its drinks during 
hot weather.

<HEADLINE> Blind Bros. Charged With Cybercrime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The Badir brothers are blind from birth  
and grew up in an Arab village bypassed by the computer revolution 
-- not the typical hacker resume. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, Munther and Muzhar Badir went on trial for what  
prosecutors say is Israel's most elaborate cyberscam, a crime that 
has raised questions about whether the security-minded nation is 
equipped to fight cybercrime, or worse -- cyberterrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The ease with which the two young men allegedly broke into  
sensitive computer systems, including that of Armed Forces Radio, 
has stunned Israel, a high-tech powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	It took a special 10-member police task force 15 months to  
collect thousands of discs and documents and bring the Badirs' case 
to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers have pleaded innocent to 42 counts of fraud,  
bribery and blackmail. The indictment accuses them of breaking into 
computer systems to hijack phone lines and steal credit card 
numbers they later used for illegal purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	In perhaps the most daring scheme, Munther Badir, 22, hacked  
into the switchboard of Israel's Armed Forces Radio, the indictment 
said. Using phone lines in a shack in Tel Aviv, he created a setup 
that allowed residents of Palestinian-ruled Gaza City some 45 miles 
to the south to call abroad ``at the expense of the Israeli armed 
forces,'' the charge sheet said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were so worried the two might hack into the main  
police computer that they often worked on personal laptops while 
the investigation was still unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had some help from Israel's most famous hacker, Ehud  
Tenenbaum, or The Analyzer, who has been charged with breaking into 
the Pentagon's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badir brothers say they were targeted by Israeli authorities  
because they are Arab and gifted. But officials in the prosecutor's 
office say their ethnicity has nothing to do with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hearing in the case was Thursday. At the start of the  
closed-door session, a security guard rolled five large cardboard 
boxes of evidence into court on a warehouse cart. 
</P>
<P>
	Burly Munther Badir, the alleged ringleader, was in the  
defendant's dock when his parents led his brother, Muzhar, 23, 
toward him. The brothers hugged and whispered to one another. 
</P>

	``We were always close, we have a special chemistry,'' said  
Muzhar Badir, speaking outside the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers grew up in Kafr Qassem, an Arab village north of  
Tel Aviv. They felt an urge to prove their talents, largely because 
they were dismissed by their community as useless. 
</P>
<P>
	As children, they tinkered with TV and radio sets. Muzhar was 13  
when he and his brother took a computer course at the Center for 
the Blind in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
	With the stroke of a keyboard, a new world opened to them.  
</P>
<P>
	``We realized that we had a talent for this,'' said Muzhar.  
</P>
<P>
	Still teen-agers, they ran a computer consulting firm and  
created software for the blind. At home, they used a computer with 
a regular keyboard and a device that translated type into sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Munther Badir first got in trouble with the law in 1997 when he  
was given a suspended sentence of eight months for his role in a 
land fraud scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, prosecutors said, the Badirs were already  
running an illegal empire that yielded $10,000 a day in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Munther Badir's legal adversaries grudgingly describe him as a  
genius. Investigators say the defendant has boasted that the 
policeman who can catch him hasn't been born yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer specialist Avner Frank said the National Fraud Squad is  
up to the task, but understaffed.

<HEADLINE> Two Injured in Oil Tank Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONCA CITY, Okla. (AP) -- An oil tank at the state's largest  
refinery burst into flames Thursday morning, injuring two workers 
and sending school children scurrying off playgrounds to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	A plume of thick black smoke rose over the city, scattering  
charred chunks of foam-like debris up to 5 miles from the Conoco 
refinery. Kenneth Ray, director of external affairs for Conoco, 
said the smoke was non-toxic but warned people with respiratory 
problems to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray said the fire probably would be left to burn out and posed  
no danger of spreading. He said he didn't know what caused the 
80,000-gallon tank to explode. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Intergris Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma  
City said both injured workers, who had been on a lift inspecting 
insulation around the tank, had burns to the face, back and arms, 
and one had a fractured hip. Their conditions and the extent of 
their burns wasn't immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The refinery produces about 188,000 barrels of crude oil a day.

<HEADLINE> Houston Tops L.A. As Smog Capital </HEADLINE>

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Texas' largest city has achieved national  
supremacy, but not for something anyone is likely to brag about -- 
the sprawling industrial mecca now is considered the nation's 
smoggiest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston had been running neck-and-neck with Los Angeles in the  
air pollution stakes -- until Oct. 7, when Houston surpassed 
California's largest city by notching its 44th smog day this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A smog day is when the ozone level rises above a certain mark  
set by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles has had smoggy air for decades and has long been the  
butt of jokes about it. But as of Wednesday, the Houston count of 
smog days had reached 46. Los Angeles was still at 43. 
</P>
<P>
	Let the finger pointing begin.  
</P>
<P>
	Experts are trying to determine which industrial plant at the  
edge of the nation's fourth-largest city may be to blame for the 
excess pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an aberration, a spike,'' said Patrick Crimmins, a  
spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers know that large clouds of ethylene and propylene  
billowed over the city Oct. 7, and believe the gases were the 
product of one of the plants. The search has been narrowed down to 
25 factories, all clustered around the Houston Ship Channel, home 
of the nation's largest concentration of petrochemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Texas is staring at an EPA ultimatum. The state has  
until next month to come up with a plan to clean its skies by 2007. 
The federal government has threatened to take away money for Texas 
highway construction if the state doesn't make progress soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``These reductions are going to have to be extremely steep,''  
said Jeff Saitas, executive director of the conservation 
commission. ``It's going to press the limits of cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said unusually dry weather played a part in trapping  
dirty air over Houston, and Los Angeles may very well reclaim the 
title in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably pass it back and forth with each other for a  
few more years,'' said Gene McMullen, who has been monitoring 
pollution levels for the Health Department in Houston for decades. 
``It'll depend on whose weather is worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in California, air-quality regulators faced a vote  
today on stricter standards for products such as furniture wax, 
hair mousse, nail polish remover, windshield-washing fluid, 
insecticides and air fresheners, all believed to contribute to air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations would prohibit the sale or manufacture of  
products that exceed new pollution standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Air Resources Board's goal is to reduce  
ozone-depleting volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, by about 150 
tons a day by 2010, board spokesman Jerry Martin said.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Southern Baptist Convention official says he  
knows that critics say it is arrogant to target Hindus, Jews and 
Muslims for conversion on their holiest of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an arrogance in truth,'' says Don Kammerdiener of the  
International Mission Board. ``The Gospel message is a stumbling 
block for those who choose not to believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination enraged Hindu leaders in the United States this  
week when it released a booklet urging Southern Baptists to pray 
for Hindus on their major festival, Divali. Last month, it 
published a booklet aimed at Jews on the High Holy Days. An earlier 
book addressed Muslims on Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Christian critics say it's possible to share the  
Gospel's ``good news'' without pummeling the listener. The Southern 
Baptists, they charge, offend members of other faiths with 
campaigns designed to make headlines as much as win converts. 
</P>
<P>
	Evangelists have long confronted the ethical implications of  
proselytizing abroad, often in tense climates such as India, where 
Christians and Hindus compete for followers. As more immigrants 
bring their religious traditions to the United States, evangelicals 
are facing similar moral dilemmas at home. 
</P>
<P>
	What tactics are fair in the battle for souls? In a country with  
relatively unrestricted religious freedom, what limits should 
Christians place on their proselytizing? 
</P>
<P>
	Take away a Southern Baptist's right to evangelize and you've  
taken away his faith, says Kammerdiener, executive vice president 
of the mission board. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he proposes rules of engagement. Offering inducements to  
win converts is unethical, he says. ``And I think it is absolutely 
improper to falsely describe another religion in attempting to 
share your faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hindus object to the way their faith is characterized in the  
recent Southern Baptist prayer guide, which describes them as 
living under ``the power of Satan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even a former head of the convention's International Mission  
Board, Keith Parks, calls the Southern Baptists' proselytizing 
campaign abrasive. 
</P>
<P>
	Emory University law professor John Witte Jr., who directed a  
three-year project on proselytizing, believes that groups like the 
Southern Baptists should more closely monitor their own missionary 
activities -- beginning with a decision not to target religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hustling for Jesus is fine,'' says Witte, who heads the  
school's program on law and religion. But an overly aggressive 
strategy ``violates the universal quality of the Gospel message and 
the example of Christ himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he says, ``It will ultimately be self-defeating. It  
will stiffen the spines of religious groups being targeted and 
invite retaliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Eastern Europe, he notes, anti-proselytizing sentiment has  
risen in response to some missionaries' use of high-tech media and 
high-pressure tactics. A similar public opinion backlash could 
follow in this country, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to use the law to curb proselytizers by charging them  
with harassment or disturbing the peace have failed in the United 
States, beginning with attempts to stop Jehovah's Witnesses in the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. John Thomas, president of the United Church of Christ,  
finds missionaries who focus on converting Jews particularly 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's offensive ... when we have been part of a long history of  
abusive behavior ultimately leading to the Holocaust.'' Better, he 
says, to focus evangelizing the more numerous nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas thinks it is arrogant to claim that Christianity offers  
the one path to truth. Parks, on the other hand, has no problem 
telling potential converts that Jesus Christ provides the only way 
to salvation. After all, Jesus told his followers to go ``and make 
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father 
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.'' (Matthew 28:19) 
</P>
<P>
	Still, that does not justify aggressive or offensive  
proselytizing, says Parks, who left the Southern Baptist Convention 
to join the more moderate Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian missionaries' descriptions of other faiths should be  
respectful, he says. ``We need to cultivate personal relations 
rather than launch a new crusade that's confrontative,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Witte calls for ``gentle interaction, the fragile ethic that  
supports respect and toleration for each other. It also involves 
education about others' faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas agrees: ``Christians are called upon to bear witness to  
their faith in Jesus... But proselytizing and evangelizing needs to 
me more of a dialogue in which we both share and receive. It 
doesn't mean we are timid about sharing our faith or making 
judgments about the relative value of faith understanding. It means 
we have a kind of humility in our witness.''

<HEADLINE> Blair Witch Town Embraces Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURKITTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The Blair Witch believers are back,  
just in time for Halloween. And this time, Burkittsville is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, curiosity seekers overran the startled western  
Maryland hamlet where the hit hoax horror film, ``The Blair Witch 
Project,'' is set. They snatched road and cemetery signs and 
vandalized tombstones, prompting a beefed-up police presence in the 
quiet farming community. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkittsville has since wised up -- and cashed in.  
</P>
<P>
	With the movie's recent release on home video and Halloween this  
weekend, many of the 214 townsfolk are embracing -- rather than 
bracing for -- another wave of what local artist Trude Head calls 
``the Blair Witch virus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roll into town on the narrow road over densely wooded South  
Mountain and you'll see a hand-lettered cardboard sign, ``WITCH 
STUFF,'' on a telephone pole near Mrs. Head's 200-year-old yellow 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Her sidewalk display offers $7 versions of the rocks and  
stick-figure totems featured in the film, some crafted by Mrs. 
Head's granddaughter. A few dollars more buy a good-luck Blair 
Witch spell or a ``witch-chaser'' bag filled with smooth stones, 
garlic cloves and lavender sprigs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's play,'' she said, smiling brightly. ``I'm doing very  
well, selling things to the people who want to have something from 
the witch town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Margaret Kennedy, a painter and gallery owner whose sales  
have zoomed since she started selling Blair Witch T-shirts and 
totems to tourists from around the world. Her photographer friend 
Warren Morrow doesn't even live in Burkittsville but he made some 
stick figures, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get a little cash from the movie,'' he said.  
``Why not?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up and down Main Street -- the only street, really -- the Blair  
Witch has become a cottage industry, supported by several Internet 
sites and a market that expanded with the movie's international 
release and video sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie purports to show the final days of three student  
filmmakers who vanish mysteriously while traipsing through the 
Black Hills Forest to make a documentary on the legendary witch of 
Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	After the movie's release this summer, Blair Witch fever ran so  
high here that residents found ready buyers for their back yard 
rocks and dirt from the local cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kind of weird, isn't it?'' said Linda Prior, a Burkittsville  
grandmother who was among the first to see the sales potential, 
selling sticks and stones on the online auction site eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing craze extends to an outfitter offering weekend  
``witch hikes'' on the nearby Appalachian Trail. A suburban 
Baltimore entrepreneur organizes Blair Witch camping trips -- not to 
Burkittsville but to a state park near Washington, 50 miles away, 
where most of the mock documentary was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is pleased by the exposure.  
</P>
<P>
	The town council considered canceling trick-or-treating because  
of the expected influx of strangers. They decided to keep the 
tradition and pay for extra police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair Witch-related patrols have consumed half of the town's  
$3,000 contingency fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to let these people control our lives,'' said  
Deborah Burgoyne, mother of a 5- and a 10-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	A neighbor, A.K. Cox, has been bothered by drive-by tourists  
with video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that makes any parent nervous,'' she said as a white  
van with Ontario plates cruised by, camcorder rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillie Morris said vandalism at an abandoned church outside town  
got so bad that she and others recently held a prayer service there 
``to try to take back what Satan is trying to destroy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few residents say they have seen the film, not even Mayor Joyce  
Brown, though she plans to buy the video for the town archives. 
</P>
<P>
	She was miffed about the movie at first -- the filmmakers didn't  
seek permission to film here -- and even considered conferring with 
officials in Amityville, N.Y., where tourists flocked after ``The 
Amityville Horror'' came out 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents like Brenda Rupli, who has lived near the village  
crossroads for 27 years, said visitors have spoiled the serenity of 
a town that once seemed lost in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always felt like this was my hideaway,'' she said. ``Now  
I don't feel like that any more.''

<HEADLINE> Skater Kwan Has Tough Balancing Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- She isn't getting enough sleep.  
She's jittery for her practice sessions. Her patience is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet Michelle Kwan, UCLA freshman and sometime figure skater.  
</P>
<P>
	Oh, not sometime enough to set aside her stellar career on ice  
to be nothing more than a college student. Kwan wouldn't settle for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	So she has come to Colorado for Skate America, which begins  
Friday with the short program, fresh from a quiz on which she 
didn't fare too well. Skate America comes after two months of 
hectic shuttling between the dorms, classrooms, home, the practice 
rink in the north hills of Los Angeles, and her regular workout 
locale up in the mountains at Lake Arrowhead, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to get some bad habits and I'm not as consistent,''  
Kwan said Thursday. ``But I feel ready for this competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get impatient since at the rink I am on such a tight  
schedule. Every minute counts. When I get up to Lake Arrowhead, 
Frank looks at me and says, `What is wrong with you? Be calm.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, who is taking 12 credits at UCLA, knows her skating might  
suffer from such a frantic pace. She practices at 7:30 a.m. on 
Mondays and Wednesdays, then heads back to classes. On Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, she doesn't get on the ice, and on Fridays, she heads 
out to Lake Arrowhead for a full day of work with coach Frank 
Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's times I think, `After this skating, I have a test, did  
I study hard enough?' Or `I have to drive back to UCLA.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there is dorm life, during which she tries to be just one  
of the girls, not a two-time world and three-time U.S. champion who 
also happens to own an Olympic silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might have to say, `Shhh! I have to skate tomorrow,''' Kwan  
said with a chuckle. ``But they realize that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It makes for a very busy schedule.  
</P>
<P>
	``I find I have to tell her to chill out when she gets frantic  
with herself,'' Carroll said. ``Especially on Fridays when we're in 
Lake Arrowhead and we have a lot of time. There's no rush, she can 
skate as long as she wants or as little as she wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a pivotal year for Michelle and we will see  
how much she can handle. She is doing the right thing, because she 
is challenging her mind as well as her body, and it's the 
discipline of the mind that is determining in this sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan will compete in Skate America, then Skate Canada next week.  
If she qualifies for the Grand Prix final in Lyon, France in 
January, Kwan also will go to that, but it is held just three weeks 
before the U.S. nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of how many events she attends, Kwan must find that  
happy balance between school and skating. She doesn't expect it to 
be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I brought my computer and all my books this week,'' she said.  
``When I get back from Skate Canada, I have midterms. I'm missing 
several lectures. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I wanted the whole experience, the whole nine yards. A lot  
of people asked why I didn't just buy a beautiful house (near 
campus), and live there and go to school. That's not what I want. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going with the drift. There are so many people walking to  
class, if I stand still at all, I'll get pushed into the 
classroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just like any other student.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom's Profit Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom's profit fell 19 percent  
in the first nine months of the year, and the company blamed a 
price war in Germany's telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
	Net profit fell to 1.25 billion euros, or $1.3 billion, from  
1.55 billion euros a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit 
decline of about 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Group sales fell 3 percent to 25.5 billion euros, or $26.8  
billion, down from 26.25 billion euros last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom noted the revenue decline was not as steep as during the  
first half of the year, when it fell 5 percent, and said it was 
able to add to its share of the fixed-line telephone market 
``despite more intense competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it said the increased revenues in growth areas such as  
mobile communications were insufficient to compensate for enormous 
price cuts, especially for international long-distance calls, in 
its main fixed-line business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be remembered that the considerable tariff cuts made  
in the course of the year, which will save customers approximately 
3 billion euros ($3.15 billion) over the full year, contributed to 
this decrease in revenue,'' Deutsche Telekom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, Deutsche Telekom said the British mobile phone  
company it recently acquired, One2One, should boost its 
fourth-quarter revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	It reiterated its intention to sell its 10 percent stake in  
Sprint Corp. following the U.S.-based company's takeover by MCI 
Worldcom. Deutsche Telekom said the stake is worth $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom shares rose 93 3/4 cents, or 2.1 percent, to  
$46.31 1/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Food Inspectors Accused of Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Small farmers nationwide were victimized by  
eight federal inspectors who accepted thousands of dollars in 
bribes to lower grades on produce at a huge wholesale market in New 
York City, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight current and former inspectors were among 21 people  
charged with racketeering and bribery in the marketing of fruit and 
vegetables at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation named ``Operation Forbidden Fruit'' revealed a  
two-decade long bribery scheme. Indictments accused 13 owners and 
employees of 12 fruit and vegetable wholesalers with federal 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture inspectors are accused of  
routinely taking bribes from wholesalers in exchange for finding 
that certain fruits and vegetables delivered to the market were not 
of the quality promised in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings allowed wholesalers to demand that growers charge  
thousands of dollars less, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits to the wholesalers were obvious. They were  
routinely getting Grade A produce at Grade B prices and it was a 
safe bet they were not passing the benefits to the consumers,'' 
said FBI Assistant Director Lewis Schiliro. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the inspectors made more than $100,000 a year in bribes  
to supplement annual salaries of $38,000 to $48,000, Schiliro said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of racketeering, they could face up to 20 years in  
prison. The wholesalers could face up to 15 years in prison on the 
bribery charges.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton conceded Thursday that his  
impeachment scandal may hurt Vice President Al Gore's election 
hopes, acknowledging that ``a lot of people who may not like me may 
hold it against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton said any Americans who fault Gore also should give  
him credit for the administration's accomplishments, including the 
longest peacetime economic expansion in history, the lowest 
unemployment in 29 years and other achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, people are not dumb, they vote for what is in their  
interest,'' Clinton said.

<P>
	His remark came on the heels of blunt criticism from Gore about  
Clinton's conduct. In remarks that surprised and irritated some 
White House officials, Gore said during his debate Wednesday night 
with former Sen. Bill Bradley that Clinton's behavior had 
disappointed and angered him. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a joint news conference with the visiting  
leader of Nigeria, President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was elected 
earlier this year on promises to curb corruption and bring stable 
democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before cameras for 50 minutes, Clinton also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Appeared to abandon hope of winning congressional passage this  
year of measures to bolster the Social Security program and provide 
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But he said ``it would 
be a great mistake'' to scrap legislation dealing with 
environmental issues and forwarding his goal of hiring 100,000 new 
teachers and 50,000 new police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said Moscow should seek a negotiated settlement rather than a  
military victory over the breakaway republic of Chechnya. He said 
the United States hopes ``we will see a minimization of the 
casualties'' and a day soon ``when there will be a negotiated 
solution that all the parties can live with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Accused the National Rifle Association of distorting the record  
with ads asserting that the government is lax in prosecuting gun 
laws already on the books. Clinton said Washington has allowed 
local prosecutors to handle more cases and that the total number of 
prosecutions by federal and local officials is up. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said his meeting next week with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be ``just another 
step along the way'' toward a final Mideast settlement. ``I 
wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively,'' Clinton said. He 
will meet with the Mideast leaders at a conference in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's acknowledgment that he may be hurting Gore's campaign  
is in line with the findings of public opinion surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Gallup poll in May, 52 percent said they would be less  
likely to vote for Gore with Clinton actively campaigning for him. 
In a Fox News poll in June, more than 70 percent said Gore would be 
more successful as a candidate if he separated himself from Clinton 
than if he again praised him as ``one of our greatest presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, struggling to revive his ailing campaign, seemed to go out  
of his way to speak about Clinton's conduct during a televised 
forum Wednesday in New Hampshire with Bradley, his rival for the 
Democratic presidential nomination next year. In the first question 
to Gore, he was asked about Americans' cynicism about the behavior 
of the Republican-led Congress and members of Clinton's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	With no more prompting, Gore volunteered that, ``I understand  
the disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton 
and I felt it myself. I also feel that the American people want to 
move on and turn the page and focus on the future and not the 
past.'' Gore said he had tried to provide ``as much continuity and 
stability'' as he could during the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	A day later, Clinton denied that he was a drag on Gore's  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people who may not like me may hold it  
against him,'' the president said. ``But I don't think you hold him 
responsible -- I don't think mature people hold one person 
responsible for another person's conduct, do you? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if there had been some example of official misconduct  
in office which he had been a part of, that would be a different 
thing,'' the president said. ``But the American people are 
inherently fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of what Gore had expressed to him, Clinton said, ``He  
hasn't said anything I hadn't said.'' Clinton said that in voting 
next year, ``the public will make up their own mind based on what's 
best for them and their children, and not be deterred by other 
people who would like the election to be about something other than 
what's best for them and their children.''

<HEADLINE> George Lead Vikings Into Denver </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- When Jeff George leads the Minnesota Vikings into  
Mile High Stadium on Sunday, will it be the same underachieving 
quarterback from the past 10 seasons or another late-blooming star? 
</P>
<P>
	Like most of the rest of the NFL, the Denver Broncos can't  
understand why George hasn't had more success. 
</P>
<P>
	After George's impressive performance the last two weeks, the  
Broncos hope George's career hasn't finally begun to click. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous stints with Indianapolis, Atlanta and Oakland,  
George has faced the Broncos five times, winning only once -- 28-25 
while with the Raiders in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 10-year pro has had his moments -- he has thrown for  
300 yards 15 times in his career and set Atlanta and Oakland 
records with 4,134 and 3,917 yards passing, respectively, in 1995 
and 1997 -- he has never been a big winner. 
</P>
<P>
	In George's nine previous NFL seasons, his team has never won  
more than nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics point to his failure to realize his potential after  
being drafted No. 1 overall by the Colts in 1990. They also cite 
attitude problems, such as his sideline shouting match with former 
Falcons head coach June Jones and the fact that the Raiders, an 
organization that tends to embrace troubled players, released 
George after an injury-plagued 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But George seems to have gotten a second life in Minnesota. Two  
weeks ago, he relieved an ineffective Randall Cunningham at 
halftime and completed 10 of 12 passes for 214 yards, two 
touchdowns and an interception in a 25-23 loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he started and completed 15 of 28 passes for 250  
yards, three TDs and an interception in a 40-16 romp over San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos fullback Howard Griffith, one of George's teammates in  
college at Illinois, said George's struggles in the pros are 
puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been a teammate of his at this level, so it would be  
tough for me to speculate,'' Griffith said. ``I just know that he's 
a tremendous talent. He has that quick release and has such 
velocity on the ball. He can be throwing off his back foot and 
still throw 45 yards on a line. That's the type of talent and arm 
that he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith worries that George may, at last, have found a comfort  
zone in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he has some people around him now who can  
highlight what he can do,'' Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos safety Tyrone Braxton said George might not have been a  
good fit for the offensive systems he has played in, particularly 
in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was more the Raiders' system, where he couldn't  
show his true talents,'' Braxton said. ``His best attribute is his 
arm. I know a couple of times when I tried to pick off a couple of 
his passes, they went right through my hands. He throws it that 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said he, too, is mystified by  
George's mediocre record. 
</P>
<P>
	``To go back into his history and tell you why he has struggled,  
I can't answer that,'' he said. ``I just look at his production and 
I know what type of arm he has and I know what type of throws he 
can make and I know he can put a lot of points on the scoreboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos considered making a free-agent offer to George in  
the offseason, but according to Shanahan, ``decided not to go in 
that direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call, George said he signed with the Vikings  
knowing he probably wouldn't play unless there was an injury or 
Cunningham faltered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it had to happen, but it feels good to be  
back out there playing,'' he said. ``I don't know about getting a 
second life here, but it's a great situation for me. One of the 
reasons I came here is I think this style of offense best suits me 
as a quarterback. It's a good fit for me.''

<HEADLINE> Miss America, Ky. Lt. Gov. Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- It appears that Miss America Heather Renee  
French and Lt. Gov. Steve Henry are an item. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see where the future goes with this, but I enjoy  
spending time with Steve and talking to him on various issues,'' 
the former Miss Kentucky said in Thursday's Lexington 
Herald-Leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said, ``We're very close friends,'' but declined to  
characterize their relationship further and said questions should 
be directed to Miss French. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta Mayor Wendell R. High introduced Henry as ``someone  
close to Heather's heart'' when he accompanied Miss French a few 
weeks ago to her hometown of Maysville. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty good description of where our relationship is  
right now,'' Miss French said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two met about two years ago, but only in the past year have  
they gotten to know each other well, Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry is a 46-year-old orthopedic surgeon from Louisville who  
has never been married. Miss French is 24.

<HEADLINE> Rhetoric Takes Flight in GOP Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could it be true, as Steve Forbes said, that  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has the support of every single lobbyist 
in Washington? That Democrats have spent the budget surplus five 
times over, as Gary Bauer claimed? 
</P>
<P>
	Or that money sent to the United Nations simply disappears in a  
``rathole,'' as Alan Keyes put it? 
</P>
<P>
	The rhetoric took wing at times in the Republican presidential  
debate Thursday night, giving viewers some flights of fancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who studies rhetoric and watches issues  
at the University of Pennsylvania, seriously doubted those claims 
and more from the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's irresponsible,'' she said. ``This kind of wild, gross  
overstatement should not characterize the president of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She found the hyperbole more intense in the Republican debate  
than in the Democratic one the night before, and more likely to 
come from political novices than from those serving in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governance teaches you to hew a little more tightly to  
facts,'' said Jamieson, dean of the university's Annenberg School 
for Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	The format in both debates had citizens asking questions of the  
candidates with no rebuttal. Rivals did not have much of a chance 
to try to correct claims by others -- not that there was much 
disagreement in the GOP match-up. 
</P>
<P>
	But in both debates, major blunders in fact did not emerge as  
much as exaggeration did. 
</P>
<P>
	``All 67,000 lobbyists in Washington, they've all rallied around  
Governor Bush,'' publisher Forbes said, not pointing out for 
starters that liberal lobbyists favor Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk-show host Keyes, a former ambassador, contended it is right  
for Washington to hold back U.N. dues because the organization 
``takes our money, tosses it down the rat hole of United Nations 
waste, reaches into the pockets of the working people of this 
country in order to put our money into the pockets of the rich 
people in developing countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least some of it goes for programs such as vaccinations and  
human-rights enforcement, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes also said 60 percent of the money spent in the Superfund  
program to clean up toxic-waste sites goes to lawyers. That 
percentage circulated in some quarters years ago, when litigation 
played a larger role in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Environmental Protection Agency says that of the $1.5  
billion a year now being spent on Superfund, 10 percent is for 
litigation and 70 percent for cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	The two senators in the room, if not sending their hype meters  
quite so close to the red zone as the others did, proved a little 
shaky in their context. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona said he liked the idea of a flat tax  
so Americans could fill out their returns on a postcard ``and not 
have the fear of an audit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left unexplained was how cheaters would be caught if Americans,  
who still would have to report income and still might be able to 
claim some deductions, no longer faced the prospect of being 
audited. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, as he did in last week's Republican  
debate, suggested the nation's pharmaceutical costs have been 
halved because of 1984 legislation he pushed that encouraged the 
sale of generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Now ``our senior citizens don't have to go out and give up food  
in order to buy their pharmaceuticals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although specific generic drugs can sometimes be half the price  
of brand name drugs, U.S. spending on prescription drugs overall 
has exploded, increasing by 11 percent to 14 percent each year 
since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a woman questioning Forbes said some Americans go to  
Canada or Mexico for prescription drugs because they are so 
``exorbitant'' in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com Beats Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com reported a  
smaller-than-expected loss in the third quarter and said its sales 
more than tripled, but the Internet retailer's business still lags 
significantly behind its online rival Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based barnesandnoble.com lost $21.9 million, or 15  
cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss 
of $18.6 million, or 16 cents a share a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial  
had expected the company to lose 23 cents a share in the quarter. 
Barnesandnoble.com stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $20 in trading at 4 p.m. 
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales during the third quarter rose to $49 million from $15.56  
million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com began selling books on the Internet in May  
1997, and in recent months has expanded its offerings to include 
music, prints, posters and electronic greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
	The new offerings have helped boost its customer base, which  
climbed by 581,000 in the past three months to 2.9 million. 
Sixty-three percent of its orders in the third quarter came from 
repeat customers, up from 60 percent at the end of the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While barnesandnoble.com is growing, it does only a fraction of  
the business of Amazon.com, which had 13.1 million customers at the 
end of the third quarter and $355 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com, which also started with books, now offers music,  
videos, auctions, toys, electronics and online greeting cards on 
its Web site. It recently started allowing anyone -- from major 
manufacturers to creative housewives -- to sell merchandise on 
Amazon.com through its new zSHOPS program. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, barnesandnoble.com lost  
$64 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $51.8 million, or 
45 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose to $120.4 million, up from 
$35.9 million a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Clemens Proves Skeptics Wrong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens had spent his entire life waiting  
for this moment. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't win the big one, they said. Didn't have the heart,  
didn't have the guts. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, 30 minutes after he did it, he was up on top of the  
Yankees' dugout, leaning into the first row, hugging the fans and 
giving them high-fives, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight,'' he said, ``I kind of feel what it's like to be a  
Yankee for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen years after he first stepped on a major league field, he  
finally proved the doubters wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	With a chance to make history, Clemens didn't just beat the  
Atlanta Braves, he smothered them. 
</P>
<P>
	On baseball's greatest stage, the mound of Yankee Stadium with  
the World Series title just one win away, he threw four-hit ball 
for 7 2-3 innings and led the Yankees to a 4-1 win Wednesday night 
that gave them their second straight Series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was calm today,'' wife Debbie Clemens said. ``He studied  
his videotapes and was with the family. The whole family was 
around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Koby, 12, and Kory, 11, were out on the Yankees' infield now,  
digging up some dirt to save. Kacy, 5, and Kody, 3, were back at 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens had come back on the field, fans still cheering.  
</P>
<P>
	``Pump you fists. Pump your fists,'' Roger told his kids.  
</P>
<P>
	And the crowd kept yelling for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is what everybody said it's all about,'' Clemens said.  
</P>
<P>
	He remembered back to April 11, when the Yankees of '98 received  
their rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `We're going to get you one,''' Clemens recalled.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, he played a part, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Those five Cy Young Awards were nice -- more than enough for each  
kid -- but he couldn't flash one on a finger and proclaim himself a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he can.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to thank my family for pushing me to come here,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans never quite bonded with him. They loved Mr. Perfect,  
David Wells, a shot-and-a-beer guy. Clemens was more aloof. 
</P>
<P>
	And it didn't help that following consecutive Cy Youngs, he  
slumped to 14-10 after the spring training deal that sent him from 
Toronto to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed Wednesday, when they sensed title No. 25 as they  
walked off the subway and into the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Here was Clemens, bounding off the mound like a kid to field  
three comebackers. He didn't admit it, but he was juiced. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why he came here,'' Derek Jeter said, ``to win a  
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't allow a fly ball to an outfielder, didn't allow a  
runner past first base until the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to do it,'' Series MVP Mariano Rivera  
said. ``This guy was pumped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On his way to the mound before the first, Clemens stopped by  
Monument Park to give Babe Ruth's monument a little pat. And then 
he gave a performance that would make Ruth proud. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Lockhart in the fifth was the only batter to reach leading  
off an inning. He was quickly erased when Eddie Perez bounced into 
a double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens pumped his right fist, then pointed his right index  
finger, the one that has released so many fastballs, at second 
baseman Chuck Knoblauch as if to say, you can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't allow another hit until the eighth, when Walt Weiss  
reached on an infield hit -- replays showed first base ump Gerry 
Davis blew the call, that Clemens had caught the ball and had his 
right foot on the bag before Weiss stepped on the foot. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer came out, but Clemens stayed in, allowing a clean  
single to Gerald Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	That was it. New York manager Joe Torre decided Clemens should  
call it a night, even though players on the Yankees bench seemed to 
pull for him to remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to finish,'' Clemens said. ``I thought I was still  
pumping pretty good and Skip was going to give me an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly off the mound, Clemens walked. He waved his cap to the  
crowd. He was back to the clubhouse as Jeff Nelson allowed a single 
to Bret Boone that drove in Atlanta's lone run, but came back to 
the dugout for the triumphant ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	He had brought so much baggage with him to New York, including  
the hatred of Boston fans who felt he turned traitor when he left 
the Red Sox after the 1996 season to sign with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	After pitching seven shutout innings against the Rangers in the  
first round, he was bombed in Boston, didn't get out of the third 
inning. The Fenway fans said that was the real Clemens, the one 
with the 2-3 postseason record, not the one who went 247-134 during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget that, Clemens said Wednesday night. This is me.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very blessed to be a part of the team,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His career may not be complete, but his mission is.  
</P>
<P>
	``You did it. You stayed within yourself,'' Yankees owner George  
Steinbrenner said after Clemens gave him a big bear hug in the 
chaotic clubhouse. ``I'm really proud of you.''

<HEADLINE> Rivera Is World Series MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The slender right-hander with the buggy-whip  
fastball stood on the mound. Two outs. Ninth inning. Another World 
Series to close out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no contest.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second year in a row, Mariano Rivera closed the case for  
the New York Yankees, and this time he was rewarded with the MVP 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about it,'' he said. ``I just feel tremendous to  
be there. I want to be there when this happens. I was the guy 
throwing the last pitch. And I had the last out. It feels 
tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees couldn't think of anyone they'd rather have in that  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``He's the best  
closer I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers support that point of view.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera saved Game 1 of the Series, getting the last four outs in  
a 4-1 Yankees victory. He came back with two scoreless innings as 
the winning pitcher in the 6-5 victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, he came on in the eighth inning with the  
tying runs on base and retired Chipper Jones on a grounder to end 
Atlanta's last threat. Then he breezed through the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was done, Rivera had just added to an awesome postseason  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight postseason appearances this October, he had two  
victories and six saves. He has not allowed a run in his last 25 
2-3 innings of postseason play, with two victories and 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's postseason earned-run average of 0.36 -- two earned runs  
allowed in 47 1-3 innings -- is the lowest for any pitcher with at 
least 30 innings pitched in postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 4 save extended his streak to 12 1-3 consecutive  
scoreless innings over eight games in three World Series. The last 
time he gave up a run in a Series game was the eighth inning of 
Game 3 in 1996. The Yankees beat Atlanta that night, triggering a 
record-tying streak of 12 World Series victories for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	There would seem to be an obvious connection.

	``I love the challenge,'' he said. ``I love to be in that  
situation. I guess that's my motivation. Once you're there, you 
have butterflies in your stomach. You know you're there for real. 
You just want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was just as good in the regular season, finishing with a  
4-3 record and 1.83 ERA and converting 45 of 49 save opportunities, 
which tied his career high. He ended the regular season with a 
scoreless streak of 30 2-3 innings over 28 games and converted his 
last 22 save chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he gave up a run was July 16 against Atlanta, more  
than three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was the setup man for the '96 Yankees when bullpen  
partner John Wetteland saved all four Yankees victories to earn the 
MVP award of that Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was my teacher,'' Rivera said of Wetteland. ``We would  
sit together and spend time talking about baseball. I know I 
learned a lot from him and he learned a lot from me, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Wetteland signed as a free agent with Texas, Rivera  
inherited the closer role. The switch required a change in approach 
for Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're the setup man, you know somebody will come behind  
you,'' Rivera said. ``When you're the closer, you know there's 
nobody coming behind you. It's tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The setup man has a net. The closer has nothing. If he falls,  
he's dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Rivera as a closer, that rarely has been a problem for the  
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Italian Inflation Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Consumer prices in Italy rose 0.4 percent in October  
from the previous month and is running at 2 percent annual rate, 
the highest level since September 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The month-to-month increase reported Thursday was the sharpest  
rise since November 1997, when the inflation measure also rose 0.4 
percent over the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer prices had risen 0.2 percent in September from the  
previous month and September prices were up at an annual rate of 
1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Italy is one of the countries most vulnerable to fluctuations  
in raw material prices, especially crude oil,'' said Enrico 
Giovannini of the national statistics institute which released the 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising gas and energy prices pushed transport costs up 0.5  
percent from a month ago and 3.9 percent on the year. Housing costs 
rose 0.4 percent for the month and 2.8 percent for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's annual inflation rate is well above the European Union  
average of 1.2 percent in September.

<HEADLINE> Show Marries Classic, Modern Ballet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Choreographer Lar Lubovitch has created the  
beauty of a classical ballet using contemporary ballet movements 
with ``Meadow,'' his new dance for the American Ballet Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tuesday night's performance at City Center, much of the  
beauty and mystery of ``Meadow'' came from the dancers' dark blue 
costumes moving in dim light, seemingly through a space filled with 
white clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian MacDevitt did the lighting and Ann Hould-Ward designed the  
costumes. The orchestra played whispering string music, composed by 
William David Brohn, during a recording of Schubert's ``Die 
Nacht.'' Music by Busoni and Bryars also was used. Ermanno Florio 
conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Brown and Keith Roberts were the leading couple.  
</P>
<P>
	Lubovitch founded the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company 31 years ago.  
He choreographs for the modern dance company as well as ballet 
companies, Broadway musicals and ice dancers. His most recent large 
projects were the full-evening ``Othello,'' produced by ABT and the 
San Francisco Ballet with Lubovitch's company, and the musical 
``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' which opened in Berlin in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meadow'' was on a program that highlighted the dancers'  
versatility. It began with Martha Graham's 1948 ``Diversion of 
Angels,'' which entered ABT's repertoire this season, a bravura 
duet of Marius Petipa's 1899 ``Le Corsaire,'' danced by Paloma 
Herrera and Jose Manuel Carreno, and Twyla Tharp's 1998 ``Known by 
Heart.'' Principals in the latter were Julie Kent, Angel Corella, 
Susan Jaffe, Ethan Stiefel, Griff Braun and Roberts.

<HEADLINE> Green Beret Faces Marijuana Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Ill. (AP) -- An Army Special Forces sergeant responsible  
for helping elite Green Berets orchestrate deployments has been 
charged with growing marijuana on his southern Illinois farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Sgt. Ernest Eugene May, 48, also could face military  
charges for unauthorized military munitions police say they found 
in his home. 
</P>
<P>
	May, stationed at Fort Campbell, Ky., was charged Oct. 20 with  
four drug-related counts stemming from the discovery of marijuana 
growing in fields near his home, said State's Attorney Brian 
Trambley. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Maj. Tom McConnell, a spokesman for Army Special  
Forces headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., said the Army is awaiting 
the outcome of May's civil proceedings before determining whether 
military charges should be filed. He was unable to determine if May 
remained in his post. 
</P>
<P>
	May was free on $5,000 bond.  
</P>
<P>
	May's unit is one of five active duty Green Beret units  
stationed in the United States. Soldiers assigned to the units are 
considered among the military's elite.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Plays After Father Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Paul O'Neill is never one to hide his emotions.  
Usually, it's not tears that he shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as soon as Keith Lockhart's fly ball settled into Chad  
Curtis' glove, giving the New York Yankees the World Series 
championship Wednesday night, O'Neill broke down. His father's 
death that morning had finally hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously came out at the end,'' O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	As the Yankees celebrated their victory over the Atlanta Braves  
on the infield at Yankee Stadium, O'Neill's teammates gathered 
around and embraced him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your dad got to watch this one,'' manager Joe Torre said to  
O'Neill, who jogged off the field, wiping his eyes as he entered 
the dugout, no longer able to control himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hadn't seen him get emotional to that point,'' reliever Mike  
Stanton said. ``It was beautiful, the way everyone gathered around 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 18 hours after Charles O'Neill died after a long struggle  
with heart problems, his son was in the lineup in his usual spot, 
batting third and playing right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the one who taught me how to play,'' O'Neill said. ``I  
was going to play this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be here, I'm proud to be part of this team ...  
but believe me, I lost someone special,'' he said, his voice 
cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill is most known for his violent reactions to his mistakes  
at the plate. A bad swing can lead to a helmet flying across the 
diamond and a bat slamming to the ground. A bad call by an umpire, 
and the water cooler in the dugout is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	But during batting practice, their stood O'Neill, almost  
emotionless, practicing his sweet swing in a roped-off area behind 
the batting cage. Occasionally, teammates would come by and offer a 
pat on the back or a kind word. But mostly they left him to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with heavy hearts,'' winning pitcher Roger Clemens  
said. ``I don't know if I could've done what Paul O'Neill did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder O'Neill had come to New York from his Ohio home  
earlier this month for treatment. His son left the team for a day 
in June when his father underwent heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said O'Neill was not surprised by his father's death  
``because he had been in tough shape. It's a very sorrowful time 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill is the third Yankee whose father has died in the past  
two months. Scott Brosius' father died of colon cancer on Sept. 12. 
Luis Sojo missed the first two games of the Series after his father 
died Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bittersweet, no question,'' Brosius said. ``We feel just  
tremendous about what this team has done. But you put a lot of 
things in the back of your mind and now that it's over, there are 
some real issues to face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre knows that feeling. In 1996, when he won his first World  
Series title, Torre's brother Rocco died during the season and his 
other brother Frank needed a heart transplant during the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play this game you try to eliminate the highs and  
lows,'' he said. ``That has been difficult. There is nothing higher 
than playing in the World Series and nothing lower than mourning 
the loss of a family member. There has been a lot of this going on. 
We just have to fight through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration in the Yankees' clubhouse was tame by most  
standards. The harsh realities of a season that saw Torre and 
Darryl Strawberry recover from cancer and three parents die -- as 
well as Yankees Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio and Catfish Hunter -- 
came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a difficult year,'' Derek Jeter said. ``From Mr.  
Torre in spring training to what happened to O'Neill now. But we 
fought through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Yankees will prepare for another celebration. Mayor  
Rudolph Giuliani announced today that a tickertape parade will be 
held Friday.

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans To Promote Nuke Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Weeks after Japan's worst nuclear accident,  
government officials said Thursday that they will step up efforts 
to win support for the nation's nuclear power program. 
</P>
<P>
	From November, the ministry will hold seminars around the  
country to explain the virtues of nuclear energy to the public, 
said Yasuo Baba, an official at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to increase public understanding of nuclear energy, as  
it is the government's firm position to continue using nuclear 
power as a principal source of energy,'' Baba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's nuclear power program came under heavy fire after a  
Sept. 30 leak at a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant left at least 69 
people exposed to radiation and forced hundreds of thousands of 
people living near the plant to remain indoors for more than a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Anger has centered on the slipshod safety practices at the  
nuclear facility. The government has been criticized for failing to 
discover that JCO Co., the plant's operator, had allegedly been 
flouting operating guidelines for years. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the government's promotional program, two-day  
seminars will be held in about 12 different cities across Japan. 
Most cities have been chosen because they are close to nuclear 
power facilities, MITI's Baba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program will target academics, schoolteachers, and  
journalists, as well as members of the general public. The ministry 
wants to arrange visits to some of the nuclear plants, Baba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan gets about a third of its energy from nuclear power. The  
nation has 51 nuclear reactors, and the government hopes to 
increase that substantially over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Baba said the timing of the seminars was unrelated to the  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seminars were definitely not planned because of Tokaimura.  
Discussions about having these seminars have taken place since the 
end of last year,'' Baba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``there is a greater need to increase public  
understanding because of the accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the nuclear energy program agree the government  
should do more. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the government has been doing to promote nuclear power is  
clearly not enough,'' said Masaaki Kuwabara of the Japan Atomic 
Energy Relations Organization, a foundation funded by 30 corporate 
members, including nuclear power operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make sure the public has the right information, and  
is not simply moved by fear,'' Kuwabara said.

<HEADLINE> Braves' Nixon Files for Free Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than a day after his Atlanta Braves lost  
the World Series to the New York Yankees, outfielder Otis Nixon was 
among 20 players who filed for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati outfielder Greg Vaughn, who hit 45 homers and drove  
in 118 runs last season, was the biggest name to file. 
</P>
<P>
	Five players filed from the AL West champion Texas Rangers,  
beaten by the Yankees in the first round: second baseman Luis 
Alicea, left-hander Jeff Fassero, outfielders Tom Goodwin and 
Roberto Kelly, and third baseman Todd Zeile. 
</P>
<P>
	Four more filed from the the NL Central champion Houston Astros,  
beaten by Atlanta in the opening round: catcher Tony Eusebio, 
shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, outfielder Stan Javier and right-hander 
Brian Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, when the free-agent market was filled with  
some of baseball's biggest stars, the pickings are slim this fall, 
with few front-line players available. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the approximately 140 players potentially eligible to file  
before the Nov. 11 deadline are Yankees right-hander David Cone, 
Anaheim left-hander Chuck Finley, Seattle outfielder Jay Buhner, 
New York Mets first baseman John Olerud, Cincinnati right-hander 
Juan Guzman and Yankees catcher Joe Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players are waiting to find out if teams exercise their  
options, a group that includes the Yankees' Paul O'Neill, Texas' 
Juan Gonzalez and Houston's Craig Biggio. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, veteran players traded during multiyear contracts  
have the right to file trade demands between now and Nov. 11. That 
group includes Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens, who won the fourth 
and final game of the World Series. New York acquired him from 
Toronto at the start of spring training in a deal for David Wells.

<HEADLINE> House Committee Eyes Budget Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Budget Committee chairman wants to  
hear from federal employees if they know about wasteful government 
spending or if they see ``some crazy things that make your blood 
boil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's Internet site (http://www.house.gov/budget) has added a  
fill-in-the-blanks form to collect confidential tales from people 
who normally would not bring their complaints to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need your name but we want the details,'' Kasich,  
R-Ohio, said Thursday. ``In order to root out waste you have to 
root it out from the inside out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to give the American people the opportunity to  
help us police every federal agency,'' added Rep. Saxby Chambliss, 
R-Ga., the committee's vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapping out a note on an Internet site should make it easy,  
Kasich said, for frustrated public servants to get attention for 
wasteful practices that otherwise feel powerless to stop. 
</P>
<P>
	If the anonymous whistleblowers provide enough detail in their  
tales, ``We will take them and we will investigate them,'' Kasich 
said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke today urged  
Congress to pay the country's arrears to the United Nations, saying 
``we must match our rhetoric with resources'' in the fight against 
mass violence, war crimes and other atrocities. According to U.N. 
figures, the United States is currently $1.8 billion in arrears and 
must pay $350 million by Dec. 31 to keep its seat in the U.N. 
General Assembly. Its vote in the Security Council is secured. 
Congress has held up payment of arrears for years, demanding that 
the U.N. streamline its organization and institute a no-growth 
budget.

Saddam Hussein may be nearing an end. Leaders of three separate 
groups spoke as the largest gathering of opposition groups since 
1992 prepared for a weekend meeting in New York to discuss 
objectives. The New York Times reported today that the Clinton 
administration has authorized the first direct military training 
for Iraqi rebels. Starting next week, four Iraqi rebel leaders,

<HEADLINE> Edwards Chases Victory No. 250 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- LaVell Edwards is willing to talk about Air  
Force or Brigham Young's pursuit of the Mountain West title. 
</P>
<P>
	Just don't mention the possibility that Edwards could collect  
the 250th victory of his 28-year coaching career Saturday when the 
No. 16 Cougars (6-1, 3-0 MWC) meet Air Force (4-2, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even thought about it,'' Edwards said.  
</P>
<P>
	A week ago, the 69-year-old Edwards openly discussed Florida  
State coach Bobby Bowden's pursuit of his 300th career victory. 
Now, milestones aren't a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another game,'' Edwards said. ``The big thing is  
that we're in the hunt for the championship. That's the most 
important thing right now, and that's what we keep an eye on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some BYU players learned of the pending milestone from  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just heard about it,'' fullback Donny Atuaia said. ``I'm  
glad for him. If he could win 250 games, you'd want to make sure 
you give it to him on the first try. I hope we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards has a career record of 249-92-3. Through most of those  
344 games, he has roamed the sidelines with arms folded, his face 
bearing what appears to be a grumpy frown. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing could be farther from the real Edwards.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great human being. He's a great person,'' said Ron  
McBride, coach of BYU's archrival, Utah. ``The things that he's 
done for that university cannot be measured in wins and losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McBride said over the years, Edwards and his teams have raised  
awareness of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which 
owns and operates BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost respect for what he's done and how he  
represents that school,'' McBride said. ``He's got all the 
qualities that they want. In my opinion, he's probably the best 
spokesman they could have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards was a 10-year assistant when he was promoted in 1972.  
Some fans said he wouldn't last three years. Last month, he signed 
a five-year contract extension that will keep him coaching through 
2004. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of winning percentages for active coaches, Edwards  
ranks seventh at 72.8 percent. His 249 victories also rank seventh, 
six behind Nebraska's Tom Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards took a lackluster program from an obscure part of the  
country and raised it to prominence. The Cougars won the 1984 
national title after beating Michigan in the Holiday Bowl to finish 
13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	With a pass-oriented attack, Edwards became known as an  
offensive innovator. BYU grew into a quarterback factory, pumping 
out Jim McMahon, Steve Young and 1990 Heisman Trophy winner Ty 
Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Edwards, BYU quarterbacks have thrown for more than 56  
miles. The Cougars also won 18 Western Athletic Conference 
championships and played in 21 bowl games, including 17 years 
straight from 1978-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Michigan, Alabama and Nebraska have longer bowl streaks.  
</P>
<P>
	Impressive stuff, for sure, but for now Edwards is focused on  
the task at hand. The career retrospective can wait. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't thought back on it, really,'' he said. ``Maybe when  
I'm done coaching, I will. Who knows?''

<HEADLINE> Rockets Sign Cato to Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Center Kelvin Cato, who leads the NBA this  
preseason in shot blocking, has signed a multiyear contract 
extension with the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato's contract was extended by more than one year, but further  
terms were not disclosed Thursday by general manager Carroll 
Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato, a defensive specialist, was one of five players the  
Rockets picked up earlier this month when they traded Scottie 
Pippen to the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Iowa State player has averaged 5.29 blocks in  
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Cato has started in five of Houston's seven games. On Oct. 15  
against Cleveland, he notched a preseason triple-double with 20 
points, 13 rebounds and 12 blocks in 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, Cato has averages of 3.7 points, 3.4 rebounds  
and 1.28 blocks in 117 NBA games.

<HEADLINE> Anxiety Gnaws at Hurricane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Ever since Hurricane Floyd's ruinous  
floodwaters rolled through, Mary Tyson has had trouble sleeping. 
Joe Tyson finds other people are constantly picking fights. Ruby 
Best's children recoil from the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter says, `Momma, I don't want to go home again.' I  
tell her, `Baby, we've got to get a home to go to first,''' said 
Ms. Best, whose children associate the rain with the night they had 
to flee their Princeville home. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd did more than destroy homes, communities and livelihoods.  
It has damaged psyches. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross sent 244 mental health workers to eastern  
North Carolina -- more than it has dispatched to any other disaster 
except for the Oklahoma bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross counselors are seeing people suffering from anxiety,  
stomach problems, frequent illnesses and nightmares. Some flood 
victims are turning to alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are normal people having a normal reaction to an  
abnormal situation,'' said Dorothy Corless, assistant operations 
officer for the Red Cross mental health effort in eastern North 
Carolina. ``We see a risk of spouse, child and pet abuse, because 
people are frustrated, and no way are they ready to deal with 
something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which drenched the region with up to 20 inches of rain,  
was by far the worst of three hurricanes and a tropical weather 
system that besieged eastern North Carolina in September and 
October. More than 15,000 homes remain uninhabitable. Recovery is 
expected to take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Corless, who has no figures on how many people have received  
counseling from the Red Cross, said the ``roller-coaster effect'' 
of recovery and then another crisis has been worse than a single, 
drawn-out disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to help people get refocused and think about  
what they can do today,'' Red Cross counselor Gordon Drummond said. 
But ``around every corner there's another corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tyson, whose Princeville home was flooded, said worry has  
deprived her of the most elemental of comforts -- sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sleep? You just lay there thinking about how you're going to  
replace what you've lost,'' she said. ``Then you hear somebody is 
giving away some help, or a little money, and you worry you won't 
get there in time to get anything. There's people getting up at 
12:30 at night to get to where they're giving away things, sleeping 
there, so they can try to get a little something. It's pitiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Joe, said his acquaintances have turned testy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It don't take nothing for somebody to want to fight you now,''  
he said. ``You just say something, and people want to fight you. 
Folks is just under so much stress now they can hardly make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Charlie Albertson of Duplin County, where thousands  
of hogs and poultry drowned and waste lagoons were swamped, said: 
``Some are just taking it so calm, it's amazing. And others are 
just so angry. They're angry about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond's center, which serves eight counties, had 3,223  
counseling cases in the first five weeks after Floyd. Counselors 
found that rural residents, despite their storied independence, 
seemed to suffer more than urban dwellers because the floods wiped 
out their safety net of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're at a hotel. I'm in a trailer. Other neighbors are in a  
shelter,'' Drummond said. ``It just adds to the stress because 
you're used to being part of a group, and suddenly that support 
isn't there.''

<HEADLINE> Billions Proposed for Fast Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate railroad advocates proposed a plan  
Thursday to raise $10 billion over 10 years to help Amtrak 
introduce high-speed trains throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said his legislation would begin  
to address historic imbalances between money spent on highways and 
money spent on rail travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when everything goes as planned, air travel is now  
uncomfortable at best,'' Lautenberg said. ``High-speed rail offers 
a better way. It's comfortable, it's reliable, and it's getting 
faster and faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though railroads have long been considered a pet project of  
Northeast states, the high-speed rail initiative is designed to 
attract wide support by proposing fast trains for the Midwest, West 
and South. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has always been described as 'Northeast crowding' has now  
become a Southeast problem, and a Georgia problem, and certainly an 
Atlanta problem,'' said Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., a co-sponsor of 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Another advocate is Amtrak Chairman Tommy Thompson, the  
Republican governor of Wisconsin. He said other industrialized 
countries have left the United States behind on rail travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is under way on the first high-speed corridor, the current  
Metroliner route between Washington and Boston. Traveling at speeds 
up to 160 mph, new ``Acela'' trains will cut Boston-New York travel 
time to 3 hours and New York-Washington travel time to 2 hours, 45 
minutes. Amtrak has pushed back the start of Acela service from 
this year to next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight other corridors are being eyed for high-speed rail  
service: upstate New York; from San Diego to Oakland and Sacramento 
in California; Oregon to Washington; Harrisburg to Philadelphia in 
Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C., to Georgia and Jacksonville, Fla.; 
a Florida corridor linking Tampa, Orlando and Miami; a Gulf Coast 
corridor in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama; and a 
Midwest corridor linking Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Milwaukee, 
Minneapolis-St. Paul and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Lautenberg's plan would authorize Amtrak to raise $10 billion  
over 10 years by selling high-speed rail bonds. Rather than Amtrak 
paying interest to bondholders, the federal government would 
provide tax credits. States would have to match at least 20 percent 
of Amtrak's share. 
</P>
<P>
	It would cost the federal treasury about $3 billion over 10  
years, Lautenberg aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's backers say it has a chance thanks to support from  
Thompson and Republican co-sponsor Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak reported this week that it achieved record revenue in the  
past year. It lost $476 million overall in fiscal year 1999 but had 
expected to lose more, and officials say the railway is on track to 
wean itself from government subsidies by 2003. Congress has 
declared Amtrak will get no more operating subsidies after 2002.

<HEADLINE> Chromosome History Traced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The difference between women and men all  
started 300 million years ago when an ordinary chromosome took the 
first evolutionary step toward the X and Y chromosomes that now 
determine the gender of humans, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Lahn of the University of Chicago and Dr. David Page of  
the Whitehead Institute report that they traced the mutation 
history of the X and Y chromosomes to a common chromosome that 
started changing long before humans came along. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers traced the history of the gender genes by  
reconstructing mutations that make the X chromosome different from 
the Y chromosome. From this, they were able to estimate when the 
chromosomes were last identical, some 240 million to 320 million 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farther back in time we look, the more similar X and Y  
appear, boosting the theory that they arose from a pair of 
identical autosomes,'' said Lahn in a statement. An autosome is a 
non-sex determining chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
	The X and Y chromosomes decide whether a baby is boy or girl.  
Mothers carry two X chromosomes and fathers carry one copy each of 
the X and the Y. Sperm from the father has only half of the normal 
23 pairs of chromosomes and carries either a single X or Y 
chromosome. The mother's egg also has half the normal complement of 
chromosomes and includes a single X. If a Y chromosome from the 
sperm fertilizes the egg, then the baby is male because the 
resulting cells each have one Y and one X. If the sperm has an X 
chromosome, then the child is female, with two X chromosomes in the 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Lahn and Page did their research to find how this elegant  
solution to gender determination evolved. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cold-blooded reptiles, which preceded mammals in  
evolution history, sex of the offspring is determined by the egg 
incubation temperature. But the development of mammals, which are 
warm-blooded, required another sex determination system. 
</P>
<P>
	Lahn and Page found evidence that early in mammal history, a  
pair of chromosomes started evolving into the sex chromosomes. A 
mutation somehow created a gene called SRY -- for sex-determining 
region Y -- and it became the master switch for creating a male, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SRY-bearing chromosome became the Y chromosome and its  
SRY-deficient partner became the X chromosome,'' Lahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over evolutionary time, the male-determining Y chromosome became  
simpler and shared fewer and fewer genes of the more complex X 
chromosome. The Y now has only about a tenth of the genes that are 
present in the X chromsome, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> Changes to Guestworker Program Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of foreign migrant  
workers in the United States illegally could potentially qualify 
for legal status under newly introduced Senate legislation to 
overhaul the agricultural guestworker program. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsors, Sens. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., and Bob Graham,  
D-Fla., said the measure the introduced Wednesday would improve the 
lives of an estimated 600,000 undocumented farm workers while 
easing paperwork burdens on employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's immigration  
panel termed the Smith-Graham proposal ``unconscionable'' because 
of its demand that the workers spend five more years in the fields 
to qualify for legal permanent residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not be party to any plan that shackles illegal aliens  
in servitude with the hope of earning legal resident status,'' said 
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Farmworker Justice Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based  
migrant worker-advocacy group, said the legislation tilts too far 
in favor of farm interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, undocumented workers who can prove they worked  
at least 150 days as agricultural laborers within the past year 
could immediately gain legal status as temporary nonimmigrants, 
Graham said. Those who do farm work for at least 180 days annually 
in five of the next seven years would be eligible to apply for 
legal permanent residence. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond allowing hundreds of thousands of migrant laborers to  
legalize their status, the legislation would extend to them labor 
law protections that they currently lack, the Senate sponsors said. 
The bill also would ensure better wages, housing and transportation 
for domestic and foreign workers alike, they said.

<HEADLINE> Smith Drops Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edging closer to a likely return to the  
Republican party, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith today dropped a 
quixotic independent bid for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference outside the Capitol, Smith turned aside all  
questions relating to his political affiliation, or his interest in 
gaining a Senate committee chairmanship that came open earlier in 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was abandoning his presidential bid because he didn't  
have enough money to compete effectively. In politics, he said, 
``You have to be prepared to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who quit the GOP last summer with a vitriolic blast, also  
confirmed discussions over a period of weeks with GOP chairman Jim 
Nicholson and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott about ``coming back 
to the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would announce his intentions Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith first sought the GOP presidential nomination as a  
Republican. But he was mired in low single digits in the polls at 
the time he left the party, and faced likely defeat in his own 
state of New Hampshire, site of the first primary of the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement issued earlier, Smith said, ``It is  
certainly a disappointment to me, but I am satisfied knowing my 
campaign has brought many conservative issues to the forefront of 
the presidential debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith issued his statement one day after congressional  
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the New 
Hampshire senator had made numerous overtures about returning to 
the Republican Party after barely 100 days as an independent. They 
said Smith's gestures include attendance at a party fund-raising 
dinner and conversations with senior Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	These overtures began well before Sen. John Chafee's unexpected  
death Sunday, these officials say. But the process appears to be 
accelerating because the Rhode Island Republican's death created a 
vacancy at the head of the Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee -- a chairmanship Smith is eager to have. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, Smith told a reporter it was ``not  
appropriate'' to discuss political issues until after Chafee's 
funeral this weekend. However, he did not deny considering a return 
to the GOP, saying, ``I'm just not going to say anything right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma is currently in line to ascend to  
the chairmanship, holding the greatest seniority among the panel's 
GOP members. But several sources, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said Smith wants to retain his seniority rights if he 
returns to the GOP, which would allow him to take the chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republicans have publicly maintained that the issue won't  
be addressed until after Chafee's funeral, sources said Smith and 
Inhofe participated in a discussion of the chairmanship issue at a 
closed-door meeting of several conservative Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who had been seeking the GOP presidential nomination,  
quit the party in July with a blast at the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won the revolution on issues. We won the revolution on  
principle,'' he said in a Senate speech that retraced Ronald 
Reagan's rise to power and the GOP takeover of the House and Senate 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the desire to stay in power caused us to start listening  
to the pollsters and the consultants again, who were telling us for 
some inexplicable reason that we need to walk away from issues. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my party to stand for something,'' he said, contending  
that Republicans routinely ignored their own party platform on 
issues as diverse as abortion, foreign policy and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said then that he would seek the presidential nomination  
of a third party. But shortly thereafter, his wife became ill. His 
presidential campaign has been invisible for months. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days leading up to Smith's announcement, a string of GOP  
leaders criticized him. Jim Nicholson, the Republican National 
Committee chairman, wrote Smith a letter that called the defection 
a ``serious mistake for you personally, with only a marginal 
political impact -- and a counterproductive one at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's petty and it's vindictive and it's insulting,'' Smith  
said of Nicholson's missive when he announced his switch in July.

<HEADLINE> Drought Takes Toll in Tennessee / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee farmers are struggling to  
recover from a summer drought that has cut the state soybean crop 
nearly in half and severely damaged the yields of cotton, hay and 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's lots of experts who feel, unfortunately, we'll  
probably lose as many as 10 percent of our farmers this year, 
mainly because of economics,'' said Gene Danekas, Tennessee 
statistician for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers want to work, but many lenders will probably turn  
them down for loans, he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer produced one of Tennessee's two worst soybean crops  
since 1956. Based on yield predictions for the season, summer 
harvests are estimated at 17 bushels per acre, compared to an 
average of about 32 bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	Some crops were so poor, farmers simply abandoned them, Danekas  
said, leaving about 100,000 soybean acres unharvested, many cutting 
their crops for hay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cotton yields are also low -- less than a bale an acre, down from  
an average of about a bale and a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hay and tobacco yields are also down, but not devastated. Most  
corn and wheat crops were harvested before the drought and suffered 
little damage, Danekas said 
</P>
<P>
	The drought not only left farmers with less soybeans and cotton  
to sell, it also hurt the quality of the crops they had left, 
Danekas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee farmers were already suffering from a second straight  
year of low farm prices, due to an oversupply of crops from the 
Midwest, which was not affected by the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of farmers who were sort of on the edge  
financially, and this was sort of a make or break year,'' said John 
Bartee, extension leader in Montgomery County for the University of 
Tennessee Agriculture Extension Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it a 'double whammy' we got,'' Bartee said. ``Low  
prices and low yields both. It's unusual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drought has been particularly bad in West Tennessee. Andy  
Sniezak, meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said last 
summer was the 23rd driest in Memphis since 1872. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought prompted U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to  
declare Tennessee a disaster area in September. The designation 
makes farmers eligible for low-interest emergency loans from the 
Farm Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	That may help in the short term, said Daryll Ray, director of  
the Agriculture Policy Analysis Center at the University of 
Tennessee, but farmers need more than loans in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the nation as a whole, drought is not the problem,''  
according to Ray, who says farmers will face low prices as long as 
crops are in too much supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing a bankrupt person needs is another loan,''  
Bartee said 
</P>
<P>
	He said he expects up to 60 farmers to be out of business in the  
Montgomery County -- one of the state's biggest agricultural 
producers -- due to the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty devastating if you're a farmer. You've been on  
that land. You're a third generation. You've been doing your best, 
and you're looking at having to give it all up,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticized for Skipping Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush's excuse for missing his  
second consecutive Republican presidential debate ``doesn't wash'' 
with the people of New Hampshire, rival Steve Forbes said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' the millionaire conservative said in an interview 
hours before the debate in nearby Hanover. ``It will be noticed. 
Why won't he put himself at risk like the rest of us?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' advisers said the debate's format, which calls for  
questions from the audience, may not give candidates an opportunity 
to criticize Bush. Forbes and four other GOP candidates will face 
off in a repeat of their Bush-less debate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term Texas governor, the leading candidate in the GOP  
field, will interview with a local television station before the 
debate to explain his absence. Bush chose to remain in Texas to 
join his wife, who is being honored by Southern Methodist 
University tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said it was a ploy to keep Bush above the fray, out of  
danger of making a mistake that could cost him his lead in polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to say his wife had a commitment and he made a  
commitment to her. Blah. Blah. Blah. Blah,'' Forbes said, sitting 
in a booth at a local diner after shaking hands for 30 minutes. 
``And he'll go through his slogans while we're on stage going 
through substance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	```His consultants probably say this is brilliant, but the  
people of New Hampshire will say this doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had no plans to debate until January, but agreed to a  
December showdown amid pressure from his rivals and the advice of 
New Hampshire supporters who said he was running a risk of looking 
afraid to engage. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Wenger, a retired book wholesaler who was sipping coffee  
at the diner an hour before Forbes arrived, said Bush must prove 
he's worth his high poll ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you push somebody so far up so fast, the only way to move  
is down,'' said the Forbes backer.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke: Do More To End Atrocity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world must spend more time and money --  
``and on occasion use force'' -- to stop genocide and other 
atrocities that have marred the 20th century, U.S. Ambassador 
Richard Holbrooke said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must match our rhetoric with resources,'' the American  
ambassador to the United Nations said in a keynote address to the 
first high-level international conference of its kind on preventing 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Empty words (and) resolutions which governments don't even  
want to agree with are insufficient,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 peace accords for Bosnia, told  
a story of how he had tried before starting that job to learn what 
Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were like. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when I met them ... it became clear. They are just evil  
people,'' Holbrooke said of the pair, who have since been indicted 
by the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it's true of the people who organized the butchery in  
Rwanda and Cambodia. There is such a thing as evil in the world,'' 
Holbrooke said. He told diplomats, academics and others at the 
State Department conference held at the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum to ``first, recognize that evil really exists'' in 
the world and to ``denounce it in no uncertain terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The international community must also match its words with its  
wallet,'' he said, mentioning Europe, Africa and Asia in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
	``By resources, I mean money, I mean people ... and on occasion  
the use of force,'' Holbrooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day conference aims to work on a finding a way  
governments and non-governmental groups can identify ahead of time 
situations that may lead to mass violence or atrocities, to talk 
about preventing them and to talk about supporting or rebuilding 
traumatized societies after they occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Auschwitz to the killing fields of Cambodia to Srebrenica  
to Sierra Leone and Rwanda, this century has come face to face with 
evil repeatedly,'' Holbrooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And yet, here we are again as it's recurring in various parts  
of the world ... asking ourselves why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said he was going from the conference to Capitol Hill  
to try to convince legislators ``that the bare minimum'' is to pay 
late dues so the United States doesn't lose what influence it has 
at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, more importantly, for our policies to be implemented in  
East Timor, Sierra Leone'' and other nations trying to recover from 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week, the United States has supported U.N. Security  
Council resolutions authorizing deployment of 6,000 U.N. 
peacekeepers to Sierra Leone and more than 9,000 to East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Home Ownership Rate Hits High Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's home ownership rate climbed to an  
all-time high of 67 percent in the July through September quarter 
as a record number of minorities bought houses, the government said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 70.5 million families -- 67 percent of American  
households -- owned their homes in the third quarter, the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development said. 
</P>
<P>
	That breaks down into 58 million white families; 6.1 million  
blacks; 4.2 million Hispanics; and 2.2 million Asian Americans, 
Native Americans and Pacific Islanders owning homes. All are record 
numbers, HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong economic growth, low unemployment and stock and bond  
market gains are making Americans feel wealthy and in the buying 
mood, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, 66.6 percent of American families owned  
their own home, HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter gain reflected big gains in ownership rates  
among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ownership rate for blacks rose to 47 percent in the  
third quarter, up from a 45.8 percent rate in the April-June 
quarter. The rate for Hispanics was 45.5 percent in the third 
quarter compared with a 44.9 percent rate in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rate of growth in the third quarter was faster for  
minorities than for whites, the share of minorities owning their 
own home continues to lag behind whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ownership rate for whites in the third quarter was 73.5  
percent, up from 73.2 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're closing the homeownership gap dividing whites from  
minorities and city residents from suburbanites, but the gap 
remains far too wide, said HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ownership rate among central-city residents rose to  
50.5 percent in the third quarter, up from 50.1 percent, and the 
rate for suburban residents held steady at 73.7 percent, HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the home ownership rate rose to 63.6 percent from  
62.8 percent in the Northeast. In the Midwest, it grew to 72.1 
percent from 71.2 percent. In the South home ownership was up to 
69.3 percent from 68.9 percent and in the West it fell to 60.8 
percent from 61.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Braves: How To Win the Big One? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Please, no more questions about the Team of the  
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves kept coming up short in that category, year  
after tantalizing year. Now, it's time to figure out how they can 
win a few more championships in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	John Smoltz has been on hand for the unprecedented run of eight  
straight playoff appearances, yet he still has only one World 
Series ring on his fingers. Without question, the philosophy that 
works so well during the regular season isn't getting it done in 
the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't play the season one way and turn on another way when  
you get to the playoffs,'' said Smoltz, the loser Wednesday night 
when the New York Yankees completed a four-game sweep of the World 
Series with a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always relied on pitching and power hitting. But when  
you don't execute the little things, it sticks out like a thorn. 
The Yankees may be in the American League, but they play like a 
National League team. They play the right way. They do all the 
little things you need to do to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His implication was clear: The Braves are lacking when it comes  
to the nuances of the game. Unlike the Yankees, they don't have a 
bunch of patient hitters who are capable of working deep into the 
count, then pounce on a pitcher's mistake. Unlike the Yankees, they 
failed to make key defensive plays that could have turned around 
the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves hit .200 against New York -- even with a 14-hit  
outburst in Game 3 -- and managed only one homer and nine runs. 
Facing Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Roger Clemens, Atlanta 
finally ran up against a team that could match its marvelous 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensively, Brian Hunter made a couple of errors at first base  
in the eighth inning of Game 1, ruining a 1-0 lead. Brian Jordan 
dropped a fly ball in Game 3, letting in an unearned run in a 6-5 
loss. Ryan Klesko watched a double-play grounder bounce off his 
right arm in Game 4 -- generously ruled a hit by the official 
scorers but judged an error by just about everyone else in Yankee 
Stadium. New York took advantage with three runs and effectively 
brought a close to the final game of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``When there are chinks in the postseason, every little things  
stands out,'' Smoltz said. ``We may have to learn to create a few 
more opportunities and not rely so much on the three-run homer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won their third title in four years, while the  
Braves were left with a more infamous title: the only team other 
than the New York Giants (1910-19) to lose four World Series during 
a 10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta also lost in 1991, '92 and '96, winning its only title  
in '95. The Braves were beaten in the NL Championship Series three 
other times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure we don't feel near as bad as all those people sitting  
at home watching on TV,'' closer John Rocker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Things might have been different if the Braves had been at full  
strength. Cleanup hitter Andres Galarraga missed the season after 
being diagnosed with cancer, while catcher Javy Lopez and pitchers 
Kerry Ligtenberg, Rudy Seanez and Odalis Perez sustained 
season-ending injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	They would have turned the tide in the World Series, right?  
Smoltz isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you can say that,'' Smoltz said. ``The Yankees  
played an absolutely perfect series. I can't think of one mistake 
they made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves will return basically intact for 2000. Galarraga is  
hopeful of making a comeback, though his age -- he will be 39 in May 
-- raises some doubts that he'll be the same hitter he was before. 
Lopez and Ligtenberg expect to be ready for the start of spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipper Jones is a potential free agent, but the club is working  
on a long-term deal and has an option for 2000 if negotiations 
stall. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other possible losses: outfielders Gerald Williams and  
Otis Nixon, shortstop Jose Hernandez, catcher Greg Myers, Hunter 
and pitchers Seanez and Russ Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also will have to get a new hitting coach. Don  
Baylor, who held the job for a year, is expected to land another 
managing job in a matter of days, probably with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a big overhaul,'' Jones said. ``A lot of guys are  
coming back. Everyone will be healthy. Andres and Javy are two big 
weapons in our arsenal. We should be better next year.''

<HEADLINE>  GOP Hopefuls Debate in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By WALTER R. MEARS    	
</P>
<P>
                      *AP Special Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls discussed  
abortion, health care and taxes Thursday night in a generally 
polite campaign debate spiced by jabs directed by Steve Forbes and 
Gary Bauer at the absent front-runner, George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' Forbes said of the Texas governor, 
whom he accused of skipping campaign events to raise funds for his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was on the receiving end on another issue, when  
conservative activist Bauer said his flat tax proposal would let 
some corporations escape taxes ``while you (the taxpayers) are 
paying 25 percent between the income tax and the payroll tax.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary you're wrong,'' Forbes rebutted, and noted proudly that  
while he was alone among GOP hopefuls in supporting a flat tax four 
years ago, others have now joined the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the most part, the five men on stage stuck to the  
issues, refraining from attacking one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Stressing his opposition to abortion, Sen. John McCain of  
Arizona said the Republican Party must nevertheless reach out to 
voters who differ and ``have respectful disagreements'' -- and not a 
single one of his four rivals on the Dartmouth College stage 
offered any immediate challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a wealthy magazine publisher, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Bauer  
and radio commentator Alan Keyes all said the nation's health care 
system needs reforming. Each offered slightly different 
prescriptions, and none made any immediate attempt to draw 
distinctions with his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the five men participated in a debate sponsored by CNN  
and WMUR-TV. It was the second such event in two nights in the 
state where the first presidential primary ballots of 2000 will be 
cast in February. Vice President Al Gore and Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley patrolled the same stage on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP event was interrupted briefly when an unidentified woman  
rose to demand a cut in military spending to benefit health care 
and education. Moderators swiftly regained control of the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	There were moments of self-deprecating humor: McCain, asked a  
question about legalizing marijuana, said: ``Thank you, that is an 
excellent question, which I would prefer to duck.'' He didn't, 
explaining his opposition to legalization of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage before the television cameras began rolling, the  
candidates fielded questions from the audience on gay rights and 
China. Bauer, a conservative activist, used the pre-debate to get 
the first jab at Bush, calling him ``the absent governor from 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the subject midway through the debate when he  
referred again to the governor's decision to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who emphasized his signature issue of campaign finance  
during the evening, has emerged as Bush's closest rival in the 
polls, particularly in the wake of Elizabeth Dole's recent 
withdrawal from the race. Curiously, though, Forbes and Bauer 
ignored him in favor of jabbing at the absent Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the GOP front-runner by far, decided in advance not to  
attend. But he made his presence felt, granting an interview to the 
Manchester television station two hours before the camera was 
switched on for the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with his wife, Laura, Bush said he knows the forum is  
important, but that his family comes first and it is more important 
to him to be at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she 
was being honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New  
Hampshire will recognize that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he'll campaign in New Hampshire next week. ``At every  
stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for America and it 
seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept my vision and 
want me to be the nominee,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has agreed to participate in the next GOP debate, in  
Manchester on Dec. 2. ``I'm looking forward to participating,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' Forbes said, campaigning at a diner in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a week the Republicans have debated  
without Bush. There were no breakthrough moments and no sharp 
disputes in the debate last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is bankrolling his own campaign, said Bush will  
suffer for his absence now. ``The people of New Hampshire will say 
this just doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that Forbes has been selling shares  
in the financial magazine that bears his name to raise money for 
his presidential bid. Forbes said he is not breaching campaign 
finance laws, but would not disclose the price people are paying. 
Bauer demanded that he do so.

<HEADLINE> Employers Stingy on Health Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Employers are no more likely to offer health  
insurance coverage today than they were in 1996, even as insurance 
premiums have remained stable and the U.S. economy prospered. 
</P>
<P>
	Those companies that provide coverage have started to shift more  
insurance costs to their employees, reduced benefits for mental 
health care and limited assistance to retirees, according to a 
study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While nearly all companies with 200 or more workers in 1999  
offered health insurance benefits, just 60 percent of smaller firms 
did so -- virtually the same level as in 1996, said the report by 
Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent health care philanthropic 
research organization, and the Health Research and Educational 
Trust, an affiliate of the American Hospital Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found surprisingly strong support among  
employers, particularly of small firms, for the right of patients 
to sue their health plan, which is contentious issue being debated 
in Congress. Though employer groups have fought the proposal along 
with HMOs, saying it will increase health costs, 61 percent of 
small firms agreed with the provision, compared to 26 percent of 
large firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of small and medium-sized employers to add coverage  
is one reason the number of Americans without health insurance has 
increased from 39 million in 1994 to 44 million in 1998, employee 
benefits experts say. Though more Americans are working today, many 
of the new jobs do not include insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	If employers are unwilling to expand coverage in times of  
economic prosperity, that does not bode well for what will happen 
if the economy sours, said Jon Gabel, an author of the report and 
vice president with the Health Research and Education Trust. 
``We're treading water. If we can't expand coverage now, we never 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employers contend health insurance premiums still remain too  
high and they're worried that if they start providing the coverage, 
they would not be able to keep up with rising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many employers are scared to death of health care insurance,''  
said Becky Cherney, president of the Central Florida Healthcare 
Coalition, which represents about 100 employers. That's because 
they see giant private and government health insurance programs 
struggling to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employers realize once you give the benefit, you can never  
take it away because it becomes a right,'' Cherney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health insurance premiums for all employers increased an average  
of 4.8 percent in 1999, the highest increase since 1994, according 
to the study, which was based on a survey of 1,934 public and 
private employers conducted last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But smaller employers (those with less than 200 employees), who  
have less negotiating clout with insurers, this year saw premiums 
increase 6.9, compared to a 2.1 percent rise in 1996, the study 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance premiums are expected to increase about 8 percent next  
year, largely due to rising cost of prescription drugs, other 
surveys have found. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tight job market most small employers want to offer  
health insurance benefits but can't afford it, said Jim Weidman, a 
spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, 
which represents 600,000 small firms. He said employers would 
prefer to use any extra profits to give employees raises. ``Despite 
the good economy, profits are not keeping up with increases in 
health insurance premiums.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other key findings in the study showed:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Employees paid on average $145 per month this year for family  
health insurance coverage, up from $52 in 1988. Employees now pay 
32 percent of the costs of family coverage, up from 29 percent in 
1988. Employees opting for single coverage now pay 16 percent of 
the total cost, up from 11 percent in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	-- During the past two years, 35 percent of large companies that  
offered retiree coverage capped their maximum contribution, and 7 
percent dropped traditional indemnity coverage in favor of managed 
care plans. About 41 percent of large companies provide retiree 
coverage, the same as in 1996. -- About 21 percent of workers in 
large firms had unlimited outpatient mental health benefits, down 
from 36 percent in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only good news in the report for workers was this: The  
percentage of women employees in health maintenance organizations 
who can select an obstetrician/gynecologist as a primary care 
doctor rose to 67 percent in 1999, up from 49 percent a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Gore Lumps Bradley, Bush Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Sharpening his attack, Vice President Al  
Gore lumped Bill Bradley and George W. Bush together Thursday, 
saying both would return the United States to deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after a Democratic debate in New Hampshire, Gore compared  
Bradley's health plan to the Texas governor's tax-cut package, 
which Gore said would destroy the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the Bradley campaign and the Bush campaign have had  
serious problems with fiscal responsibility,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding on an attack he launched Wednesday, Gore said either  
Bradley's health plan or ``the Republicans' risky tax scheme'' 
would ``put us right back into deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a big idea, but it's not a good idea,'' said Gore.  
``Alchemy was a big idea, but it wasn't a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Bradley pointedly noted that Gore  
has yet to detail the costs of most of his own proposals. ``I think 
it's important to do that if you're going to be honest with the 
American public,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore additionally warned that Bradley's proposal to help seniors  
pay for prescription drugs is inadequate, and would force the 
elderly to pay up to $800 in premiums and deductibles before 
getting any help. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley would impose no upper limit on help for seniors with  
catastrophic or chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's Medicare plan would, in exchange for a $24 monthly  
premium, would pay half of all prescription costs up to a total of 
$2,000 a year, for a maximum government subsidy of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore met with about 200 at a senior community center.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters afterward if he sensed vulnerability, he  
declined to answer directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Medicare is a huge issue,'' said Gore. ``I think most  
people assume that serious campaigns will treat it with care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser replied that the Medicare Trust  
Fund ``is in better shape than it has been recently and we're going 
to continue to make sure that's the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hauser also noted that Bradley has proposed improving Medicare  
with coverage of social services such as housekeeping that can keep 
seniors out of expensive nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradley has closed the gap in polls in key early states like  
Iowa and New Hampshire, Gore has become more aggressive in 
challenging him. The initial town meeting in New Hampshire saw Gore 
focus heavily on his criticism of Bradley health care proposal and 
the threat he sees it causing to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of issue that ought to be debated in a  
presidential campaign,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of Gore's argument is that the looming retirement of  
the Baby Boom generation means more money will be needed for 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue resonate well in Iowa, where precinct caucuses next  
January launch the nominating season. It is the third oldest state 
in the nation, and Gore was questioned closely about the issue 
during Thursday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown Gore with a lead in the state, but Bradley has  
moved within striking distance.

	``He wants to explain to the people of New Hampshire why he  
isn't going to be there and to answer questions that might have 
been asked at the debate,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
presidential nomination, is feeling the heat for missing GOP 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said a scheduling conflict kept him from the first debate  
among Republicans last week in the state. He will miss tonight's 
debate because he wants to be with his wife Laura when she receives 
an alumni award from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has accepted an invitation to a GOP debate on Dec. 2 in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Bush's rivals branded his absence from last Friday's  
debate as an ``insult'' to the people of New Hampshire, and the 
criticism continued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is George Bush skipping a debate for the second  
consecutive time but he's thumbing his nose at the people of New 
Hampshire,'' said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for GOP presidential 
rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, for his part, spent Wednesday in Iowa, focusing for a  
second straight day on reducing the number of problem pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	He toured a crisis pregnancy center in Dubuque, where he touted  
the ``beauty of adoption'' but said he wasn't prepared to extend 
direct federal help to churches that finance such programs. 
However, he said he saw no conflict with providing taxpayer support 
for the programs that these centers refer women to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of my job, should I become president, is to herald the  
beauty and love of adoptions and to recognize that in centers like 
this women find loving alternatives,'' Bush said at the Tri-State 
Pregnancy Center in blue-collar, heavily Catholic Dubuque -- the 
heart of Iowa's anti-abortion movement. The center counsels women 
who have had abortions as well as those who continue their 
pregnancies. It is financed by local churches. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, Bush said he would try to draw attention to such  
centers, but he ruled out any federal backing for churches that 
band together to support them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to fund the programs or individuals who are  
trying to help, not the church from which the program draws its 
strength,'' explained Bush. ``That would step over the separation 
of church and state.''

<HEADLINE> World Series Ratings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television ratings for the World Series  
increased 14 percent but were still the second-lowest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees' four-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves on  
NBC got a 16.0 national rating and a 26 share, up from a 14.1 
rating and 24 share for the Yankees' sweep of the San Diego Padres 
last year on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Before last year, the low had been a 16.4 rating for the 1989  
earthquake-interrupted World Series between the San Francisco 
Giants and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's 4-1 victory in Wednesday night's Game 4 got a 17.8  
rating, up 7 percent from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC estimates that more than 63 million people watched Game 4,  
which was the second-highest rated World Series game in three 
years. Game 7 of the 1997 Series between the Florida Marlins and 
Cleveland Indians had a 24.5 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's Game 1 had a 14.2-26, up 15 percent from last season.  
Game 2, on Sunday night, posted a 15.0-23, up 19 percent from 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC posted a 16.8-27 for Tuesday night's Game 3, up 9 percent  
from last season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chairman Dick Ebersol said that the network still  
made money, even though it was a four-game Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the National League championship series went so well,  
there wasn't the final pressure like in the past,'' Ebersol said. 
``We made a little bit of money. ... Not a real big profit, 
though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NLCS went six games and had two extra-inning games, which  
resulted in additional advertising dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of television households in the  
nation tuned to a program. Each ratings point represents about 1 
million households. Share represents the percentage of sets tuned 
to the show.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices Plunge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas prices plunged 8 percent Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange on forecasts of warmer-than-usual U.S. weather 
for early November. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures and other energy commodities also sank.  
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, gold bounced back over $300 an ounce and  
coffee yo-yoed higher on investors' expectations of drier weather 
in already-parched regions of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices, abnormally low last winter due to  
unseasonably mild weather in the northern United States, had shot 
up on expectations that this winter will be colder than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	But new six-to-10-day forecasts show that temperatures during  
the first week of November will be higher than average across most 
of the continental U.S., likely resulting in lower demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for December delivery sank 25.8 cents to $2.965 per  
million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, we got schnockered,'' Tim Evans, senior energy analyst  
for the Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, said of the wave of 
gas selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the selling was in sympathy to what was going on in  
the crude oil market,'' he said. ``But it was largely an 
overreaction to a bearish forecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't know how fast the market can bounce back after  
a day like this,'' the analyst added. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude tumbled 5 percent to a two-week low on the New York Merc  
after Sunoco Inc. and Tosco Corp. cut production at refiners in 
Philadelphia and New Jersey, respectively, citing poor profit 
margins on fuel sales. 
</P>
<P>
	December crude dropped by $1.24 to $21.68 a barrel, November  
heating oil fell 3.06 cents to 57.70 cents a gallon, and November 
unleaded gasoline fell 2.02 cents to 62.16 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for December delivery fell  
$1.17 to $21.42 on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold rallied for a second consecutive day, regaining the  
$300-per-ounce threshold after giving back half of the astonishing 
gains of this fall's runup in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the fall to $286 earlier this week had spurred a  
round of buying by gold producers. 
</P>
<P>
	December gold rose $6.20 to $300.40.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures settled slightly higher on New York's Coffee,  
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange after rising 4 percent to just shy of $1 a 
pound amid expectations for drier weather in Brazil. Low soil 
moisture levels have exacerbated fears of damage to the 2000-01 
crop that is flowering now. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been fluctuating wildly all month depending on  
the latest forecast for Brazil. Earlier predictions of a bumper 
crop of over 40 million bags have been replaced by expectations it 
could be in the mid-30 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	But all estimates are preliminary, and price changes are being  
driven by educated guesses. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee rose 1.05 cents to 96.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican, US Officials To Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello will send his  
chief of staff to the Pentagon on Monday for talks aimed at 
breaking a deadlock over Navy use of its bombing range on the 
Puerto Rican island of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Rossello aide, Angel  
Morey, will meet with Rudy deLeon, the undersecretary of defense 
for personnel, to discuss a recommendation by a presidential panel 
that the Navy be allowed to resume limited training on Vieques but 
pull out within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Training on Vieques was halted after a civilian guard on the  
range was killed in a bombing accident on April 19. The Navy says 
it must resume training soon, however, in order to properly prepare 
the USS Eisenhower battle group before it begins a six-month 
overseas deployment in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossello insists there be no further live-fire training and that  
the range be returned to civilian use only. The Navy insists there 
is no adequate alternative site for such training, and the 
presidential panel supported that conclusion. The dispute has taken 
on deeper political overtones recently. Last week, Hillary Rodham 
Clinton publicly called for the Navy to stop using the bombing 
range immediately -- a position at odds with that of the commission 
her husband appointed to study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said it was possible that Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton,  
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the four service chiefs 
would travel to San Juan to discuss the matter with Puerto Rican 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's certainly a reasonable suggestion,'' Bacon said, adding  
that a decision on that would depend on the outcome of Monday's 
talks.

<HEADLINE> Yankees No Longer Bronx Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter was in the middle of the champagne  
celebration just like he was in the middle of almost every Yankees 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	He sprayed an entire bottle of the bubbly on Joe Torre's head.  
Then he got really adventurous and let loose on owner George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Boss was in a forgiving mood. And why not?  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees had just completed their second straight  
World Series sweep, beating the Atlanta Braves 4-1 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeter is in deep trouble,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Tell him I'm  
kidding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Past Yankees dynasties have been led by sluggers like Babe Ruth,  
Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson. For this group of 
Yankees -- the first team in 25 years to win three titles in four 
years -- no player defines it more than Jeter, the happy-go-lucky 
shortstop who arrived at the start of this run in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to give Yogi a run for his money,'' general manager  
Brian Cashman said, referring to Berra's 10 World Series titles. 
``We're just fortunate to have him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because these Yankees aren't really the Bronx  
Bombers anymore; they didn't rely on the longball to win the World 
Series. Jeter, known for his defense and clutch hitting, was one of 
the players who helped make sure the Yankees didn't need many home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York scored three runs in the third inning without an  
extra-base hit and Jim Leyritz added a homer as the Yankees became 
the first team in 60 years to sweep back-to-back Series. New York 
was also the last team to accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we play for,'' Jeter said in a slightly subdued  
celebration that was dampened by the death of Paul O'Neill's father 
earlier in the day. ``We want to be the last team on the field. 
People wrote us off earlier in the season but we did it when we had 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating with machinelike efficiency, the Yankees of the 1990s  
joined DiMaggio's teams of the 1930s and Mantle's of the 1950s as 
the only Yankees teams to win three Series titles in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside of a four-homer performance in Game 3 that brought  
back memories of the Bronx Bombers, this group of Yankees prefers a 
much slower method of offensive torture. 
</P>
<P>
	A majestic blast from Ruth, Mantle or Jackson typified great  
Yankees teams of the past. But Torre's Yankees, who didn't have a 
30-homer hitter for the second straight year, would rather foul off 
tough pitches, string together singles and work out walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What helps us is that we're just thinking, 'jab, jab, jab,' as  
opposed to knockout punch,'' Torre said. ``We're thinking of a line 
drive. That's basically our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big third-inning rally in Game 4, like so many for the  
Yankees, was started by their pesky one-two duo at the top of the 
lineup. In their second year as teammates, Jeter and Chuck 
Knoblauch have become close friends and frequent dinner partners. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the work they do against opposing pitchers that is most  
important to the Yankees, scoring nine of New York's 21 runs in the 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just try to get on base and let the other guys get us in,''  
Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch started the rally with an infield single that bounced  
off the glove of shortstop Walt Weiss, who couldn't make the 
backhand play. Jeter then lined an inside-out single to right 
field, sending Knoblauch to third base. 
</P>
<P>
	The table had been set. Now it was up to the middle of the  
lineup to finish the job. Of course, they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter stole second as O'Neill struck out. After Bernie Williams  
was intentionally walked by John Smoltz, Tino Martinez hit a hard 
grounder off first baseman Ryan Klesko's right arm for a two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	One out later, Jorge Posada -- catching Roger Clemens for the  
first time in two months -- lined an RBI single to right to make it 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is 25 men all contributing to a goal,'' Cashman said.  
``We give Joe a number of players and he utilizes them perfectly. 
It's a different player every time.''

<HEADLINE> Brunswick Loses Tax Court Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brunswick Corp., a major recreation company  
that makes boats, bowling balls and billiard equipment, lost a U.S. 
Tax Court case Wednesday over partnerships the court found were 
sham tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
	The case marked another in a string of corporate tax shelter  
victories for the Internal Revenue Service, including Tax Court 
decisions involving United Parcel Service, Compaq Computer Corp. 
and The Limited. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said this week that the agency  
will begin a new effort to identify and crack down on corporate tax 
shelters ``which have no real business purpose other than tax 
savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Brunswick case, the Tax Court determined that the company  
joined with a Dutch bank to form two investment partnerships whose 
transactions in 1990 and 1991 had ``no other purpose other than to 
generate fictional tax losses'' for the company. The idea was to 
generate capital losses that would offset capital gains from 
Brunswick's sale of some operating units. 
</P>
<P>
	``The disputed transactions are shams that will not be respected  
for federal income tax purposes,'' the court said in its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	With sales of $3.9 billion in 1998, Lake Forest, Ill.-based  
Brunswick is a leader in the global leisure products industry. 
Among its well-known brands are Sea Ray and Bayliner boats, Mercury 
outboard engines, Zebco fishing equipment, Igloo coolers and 
Brunswick pool tables. 
</P>
<P>
	Brunswick attorneys had argued that the investment partnerships  
had several non-tax purposes, such as establishing a useful 
relationship with the Dutch bank and warding off unwanted leveraged 
buyouts by tying up excess cash. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court rejected these arguments, ruling that the  
partnerships were in fact a ``well-scripted attempt to take 
advantage of an unintended loophole'' in federal rules regarding 
installment sales executed by the partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital losses reported by the two partnerships totaled  
$142.9 million in 1990 and $32.6 million in 1991, but the court did 
specify how much Brunswick might owe in back taxes, interest or 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at company headquarters said they could not  
immediately comment because they had not reviewed the 133-page 
decision.

<HEADLINE> Actor's Son Arrested on Drug Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The son of actor Michael Douglas was arrested  
for cocaine possession, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron Douglas, 20, was charged with criminal possession of a  
controlled substance, a misdemeanor. He was released on his own 
recognizance and is due back in court Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Douglas was not in court Wednesday -- his son told police  
his father was out of town, said Deputy Inspector Denis McCarthy, 
head of the Manhattan South narcotics unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Burry, Douglas's publicist in California, declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Cameron Douglas was arrested Tuesday in the lobby of a Fifth  
Avenue apartment building, McCarthy said. He allegedly had one gram 
of cocaine on him that cost him $60, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Brafman, Cameron Douglas's attorney, said he believes  
the charges will be dismissed.

<HEADLINE>  Marino Likely To Miss 2 More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The news from Dan Marino's doctor could have  
been worse. 
</P>
<P>
	A pinched nerve in the neck will likely sideline Marino for at  
least two more games, and possibly longer, he said Wednesday. But 
Marino was relieved to be reassured that he doesn't need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one positive thing. If it was worse, surgery is  
something that could happen,'' he said. ``I just wanted to be sure 
we were all on the same page and that I can come back and play 
again. That's the important thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino left the Miami Dolphins' game Oct. 17 at New England in  
the first quarter because of the injury, and hasn't played since. 
He flew Tuesday to Los Angeles for a second opinion from 
neurosurgeon Dr. Robert Watkins, who confirmed the assessment of 
the Dolphins' team doctor that surgery was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be out this week and probably out the next  
week,'' Marino said. ``We'll re-evaluate it in a couple of weeks 
and see where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, who led the Dolphins to victory last week against  
Philadelphia in his first NFL start, will again replace Marino on 
Sunday at Oakland. Huard has helped Miami (5-1) climb into first 
place in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has done great,'' Marino said. ``He's a smart kid. He can  
make plays for us. He'll do fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Druckenmiller, who joined Miami just last month, will be the  
backup quarterback. Rather than re-sign Craig Erickson, who was 
released Sept. 3, the Dolphins signed veteran Scott Zolak on 
Wednesday as insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolak will be the No. 3 quarterback Sunday, and Marino won't be  
in uniform. Coach Jimmy Johnson declined to speculate on Marino's 
long-term prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a doctor; I have no idea,'' Johnson said. ``I'm just  
trying to get this bunch ready for Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino hurt his neck in Miami's victory Oct. 10 at Indianapolis.  
The pinched nerve created weakness in his right shoulder, which has 
hindered his ability to throw. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the injury weren't immediately apparent. Marino  
missed practice for the first time Oct. 15, then played just two 
series against New England. Last week, his streak of 49 consecutive 
starts ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 seasons before this year, Marino missed 16 games because  
of injuries to his ankle, knee, hip and Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arm has been there for me, no matter what happens,'' he  
said. ``When my legs don't work, my arm has always been something I 
can rely on. That's the difference this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said his arm strength has improved recently. He'll  
continue therapy to strengthen his triceps and back muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be OK,'' he said. ``It's just going to take time. That's  
what the doctor said.''

	Blue Angels Plane Crashes in Ga.  
</P>
<P>
	MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. (AP) -- A plane from the Navy's Blue  
Angels precision flying team crashed today during a training flight 
in southern Georgia. ``We have a plane that went down at Moody Air 
Force Base,'' said Ron Newsome, a spokesman for the Blue Angels. 
The Navy public affairs office at the Pentagon said the plane,

	House Passes Stopgap Spending Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly today to keep  
federal agencies functioning another week as President Clinton and 
Congress work through their budget fight. The 424-2 vote signaled 
that neither side wanted to force a government shutdown. But big 
disputes remain, including battles over a huge package that 
includes money for social programs, the District of Columbia plus 
across-the-board spending cuts in all federal agencies. The Senate 
is expected to approve the stopgap spending measure quickly, and 
Clinton is poised to sign it. The bill is the third temporary 
measure since fiscal 2000 began on Oct. 1. The current one expires 
tomorrow night.

the Capitol, Smith turned aside all questions relating to his 
political affiliation, or his interest in gaining a Senate 
committee chairmanship that came open earlier in the week. He said 
he was abandoning his presidential bid because he didn't have 
enough money to compete effectively. Smith said he would announce 
his intentions Monday.

full diplomatic relations with Israel and defended the action 
against Arab criticism. ``It is a sovereign decision, taken by us 
as a sovereign state,'' Mauritania's foreign minister, Ahmed Ould 
sid Ahmed, said after exchanging documents with David Levy, the 
Israeli foreign minister, at a State Department ceremony. Egypt 
broke ranks from its Arab League allies in 1979 and was ostracized 
for making peace with Israel. Jordan took the step in 1994.

	U.S. Army Investigates No Gun Ri  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A U.S. Army investigative team came to  
South Korea today to consult with officials and meet survivors of 
an alleged assault on civilians by American soldiers during the 
Korean War. The eight U.S. investigators, headed by the Army's 
inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, will meet with their 
South Korean counterparts tomorrow. The Americans will then meet 
five South Koreans who say they survived an attack by U.S. soldiers

	Congress Urged To Pay U.N. Arrears  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke today urged  
Congress to pay the country's arrears to the United Nations, saying 
``we must match our rhetoric with resources'' in the fight against 
mass violence, war crimes and other atrocities. According to U.N. 
figures, the United States is currently $1.8 billion in arrears and 
must pay $350 million by Dec. 31 to keep its seat in the U.N. 
General Assembly. Its vote in the Security Council is secured. 
Congress has held up payment of arrears for years, demanding that 
the U.N. streamline its organization and institute a no-growth 
budget.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks soared today after a Labor Department  
report showed U.S. workers' wages and benefits are increasing at a 
slower than expected pace, raising hopes that inflation is not 
threatening the economy's health. Just before 2 p.m. EDT, the Dow 
Jones industrial average was up 213.40 to 10,608.29. The Nasdaq 
Composite Index was up 45.89 at 2,848.41.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. is studying wireless technology  
that could allow bottlers to raise or lower soda prices by remote 
control. Lower prices during periods of slower sales would 
presumably bring in more business. A spokesman said the world's 
biggest soft drink maker has no immediate plans to put such a 
machine into the marketplace. ``The issue of the pricing is 
something we don't see happening anytime soon, if ever,'' Rob 
Baskin said today. The New York Times reported today that Coca-Cola 
is testing a machine that can automatically raise prices for its 
drinks during hot weather.

	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Federal investigators said today they expect  
to finish picking up the pieces of U.S. Open champion Payne 
Stewart's shattered Learjet by the end of the day, and confirmed 
they are looking at three other crashes for similarities to this 
week's tragedy. In Houston, a lone bagpiper marching through the 
fog played ``Going Home'' today as players gathered on the first 
tee of the Champions Golf Club to remember Stewart.

<HEADLINE>  Marino Likely To Miss 2 More Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The news from Dan Marino's doctor could have  
been worse. 
</P>
<P>
	A pinched nerve in the neck will likely sideline Marino for at  
least two more games, and possibly longer, he said Wednesday. But 
Marino was relieved to be reassured that he doesn't need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the one positive thing. If it was worse, surgery is  
something that could happen,'' he said. ``I just wanted to be sure 
we were all on the same page and that I can come back and play 
again. That's the important thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino left the Miami Dolphins' game Oct. 17 at New England in  
the first quarter because of the injury, and hasn't played since. 
He flew Tuesday to Los Angeles for a second opinion from 
neurosurgeon Dr. Robert Watkins, who confirmed the assessment of 
the Dolphins' team doctor that surgery was unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be out this week and probably out the next  
week,'' Marino said. ``We'll re-evaluate it in a couple of weeks 
and see where we're at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damon Huard, who led the Dolphins to victory last week against  
Philadelphia in his first NFL start, will again replace Marino on 
Sunday at Oakland. Huard has helped Miami (5-1) climb into first 
place in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has done great,'' Marino said. ``He's a smart kid. He can  
make plays for us. He'll do fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Druckenmiller, who joined Miami just last month, will be the  
backup quarterback. Rather than re-sign Craig Erickson, who was 
released Sept. 3, the Dolphins signed veteran Scott Zolak on 
Wednesday as insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Zolak will be the No. 3 quarterback Sunday, and Marino won't be  
in uniform. Coach Jimmy Johnson declined to speculate on Marino's 
long-term prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a doctor; I have no idea,'' Johnson said. ``I'm just  
trying to get this bunch ready for Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino hurt his neck in Miami's victory Oct. 10 at Indianapolis.  
The pinched nerve created weakness in his right shoulder, which has 
hindered his ability to throw. 
</P>
<P>
	The effects of the injury weren't immediately apparent. Marino  
missed practice for the first time Oct. 15, then played just two 
series against New England. Last week, his streak of 49 consecutive 
starts ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 seasons before this year, Marino missed 16 games because  
of injuries to his ankle, knee, hip and Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arm has been there for me, no matter what happens,'' he  
said. ``When my legs don't work, my arm has always been something I 
can rely on. That's the difference this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino said his arm strength has improved recently. He'll  
continue therapy to strengthen his triceps and back muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be OK,'' he said. ``It's just going to take time. That's  
what the doctor said.''

<HEADLINE> Food Inspectors Accused of Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Small farmers nationwide were victimized by  
eight federal inspectors who accepted thousands of dollars in 
bribes to lower grades on produce at a huge wholesale market in New 
York City, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight current and former inspectors were among 21 people  
charged with racketeering and bribery in the marketing of fruit and 
vegetables at the Hunts Point Terminal Market in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation named ``Operation Forbidden Fruit'' revealed a  
two-decade long bribery scheme. Indictments accused 13 owners and 
employees of 12 fruit and vegetable wholesalers with federal 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture inspectors are accused of  
routinely taking bribes from wholesalers in exchange for finding 
that certain fruits and vegetables delivered to the market were not 
of the quality promised in contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings allowed wholesalers to demand that growers charge  
thousands of dollars less, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits to the wholesalers were obvious. They were  
routinely getting Grade A produce at Grade B prices and it was a 
safe bet they were not passing the benefits to the consumers,'' 
said FBI Assistant Director Lewis Schiliro. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the inspectors made more than $100,000 a year in bribes  
to supplement annual salaries of $38,000 to $48,000, Schiliro said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of racketeering, they could face up to 20 years in  
prison. The wholesalers could face up to 15 years in prison on the 
bribery charges.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Drug Policy Czar Faces 'Outlaw' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Mayor Lee Brown, the former U.S. drug-policy czar  
who got elected on a law-and-order platform, is a sure thing to win 
re-election against an Outlaw and a Jailbird. But he's taking no 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown has spent more than $733,000 on the campaign. That is  
nowhere near the $2.7 million he spent to defeat businessman Rob 
Mosbacher in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But it dwarfs the $1,360 reported by one of his opponents this  
year, ``Jailbird'' Jack Terence, who publishes a weekly newspaper. 
Brown's other opponents are a wrestling promoter, ``Outlaw'' Josey 
Wales IV, and write-in candidate Laura Garza, a member of the 
Socialist Workers Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take anything for granted,'' Brown said recently. ``I  
think our record speaks for itself, but we certainly want people to 
get out and vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How did Brown escape serious opposition?  
</P>
<P>
	``Term limits,'' said Bob Stein, dean of Rice University's  
School of Social Sciences. ``It's as simple as that. Nobody's going 
to run against an incumbent mayor unless he or she is doing 
something so awful that public support for them has eroded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston elected officials are limited to three, two-year terms.  
Mosbacher decided early on not to challenge Brown, who at most 
would have four years left in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's race has taken a back seat to the hotly debated  
question of whether to funnel tax money to a $160 million 
basketball arena, a deal Brown brokered with the Houston Rockets. 
Bond issues for a new courthouse and a big port expansion also have 
received more attention than the mayor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown counts downtown revitalization, the city's economic health  
and a lower crime rate among his successes. He points to 
transportation and pollution issues as second-term priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the citizens of our city are very happy with what  
we're doing,'' said Brown, 62, a former police chief in New York, 
Houston and Atlanta. ``We're on a positive roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Orlando Sanchez, a frequent critic of Brown's, said  
the mayor could provide more leadership and questioned whether he 
has honored a 1997 pledge to promote ``neighborhood-oriented 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's opponents -- Wales, Terence and write-in candidate Laura  
Garza -- all identify Brown as a friend to Houston's power elite. 
They offer themselves as working-class alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Terence said the Brown campaign's spending hurts the democratic  
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not use a sledgehammer to drive a tack,'' he said. ``I  
think it's obscene to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
beat Jack Terence when there are homeless people in Houston.''

<HEADLINE> Change in Rating Hurricanes Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Forecasters are considering changing the way they  
rate hurricanes, perhaps adding a scale that evaluates storms based 
on rain and flood potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, said  
he and other forecasters already are seeking funds to develop the 
new scale. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will allow us to more directly target the threat --  
rainfall, storm surge, tornadoes, whatever,'' Jarrell said in 
today's Miami Herald. ``And then you could get public attention 
focused on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such a system would complement the well-known Saffir-Simpson  
scale, which divides hurricanes into five categories determined by 
sustained wind speed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Irene, which dumped 18 inches of rain on Florida  
earlier this month, was rated as a Category I storm when it 
arrived. It might have been a Class 8 storm on the still-unnamed 
rainfall and flooding scale of 1-to-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents say the high rating would have generated the  
appropriate sense of urgency among residents and emergency 
preparedness authorities, many of whom seemed surprised by Irene. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Saffir-Simpson scale is great as far as it goes, but it  
doesn't give the complete story,'' said Stephen Leatherman, one of 
several proponents and director of the International Hurricane 
Center, a research center at Florida International University. ``We 
need a parallel scale, a rating system for rainfall and flooding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Max Mayfield, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center,  
called the additional scale ``a wonderful idea,'' though he raised 
some concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to put too much emphasis on a lot of new  
scales,'' Mayfield said. ``You could end up with a scale for wind, 
a scale for rainfall, for tornadoes, for building codes. That 
bothers me a bit. We could end up confusing people more than they 
are now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The change must be approved by the National Oceanic and  
Atmospheric Administration and other groups.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mourns Blue Angels' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called Thursday's deadly  
crash of a jet from the Navy's Blue Angels precision flying team 
``a loss that we all share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash, during a training flight in south Georgia, killed two  
of the ``bravest and most distinguished'' aviators in the Navy, the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a nation, we all owe our military service members a  
tremendous debt of gratitude,'' Clinton said. ``At this time of 
great loss -- a loss that we all share -- my heartfelt prayers go to 
their families, their shipmates and to the entire Navy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The F/A-18 Hornet went down around midday on a farm near Moody  
Air Force Base in southernmost Georgia, plowing into a stand of 
pines. The Blue Angels were scheduled to perform at the base this 
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Chromosome History Traced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The difference between women and men all  
started 300 million years ago when an ordinary chromosome took the 
first evolutionary step toward the X and Y chromosomes that now 
determine the gender of humans, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Lahn of the University of Chicago and Dr. David Page of  
the Whitehead Institute report that they traced the mutation 
history of the X and Y chromosomes to a common chromosome that 
started changing long before humans came along. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers traced the history of the gender genes by  
reconstructing mutations that make the X chromosome different from 
the Y chromosome. From this, they were able to estimate when the 
chromosomes were last identical, some 240 million to 320 million 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farther back in time we look, the more similar X and Y  
appear, boosting the theory that they arose from a pair of 
identical autosomes,'' said Lahn in a statement. An autosome is a 
non-sex determining chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
	The X and Y chromosomes decide whether a baby is boy or girl.  
Mothers carry two X chromosomes and fathers carry one copy each of 
the X and the Y. Sperm from the father has only half of the normal 
23 pairs of chromosomes and carries either a single X or Y 
chromosome. The mother's egg also has half the normal complement of 
chromosomes and includes a single X. If a Y chromosome from the 
sperm fertilizes the egg, then the baby is male because the 
resulting cells each have one Y and one X. If the sperm has an X 
chromosome, then the child is female, with two X chromosomes in the 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Lahn and Page did their research to find how this elegant  
solution to gender determination evolved. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cold-blooded reptiles, which preceded mammals in  
evolution history, sex of the offspring is determined by the egg 
incubation temperature. But the development of mammals, which are 
warm-blooded, required another sex determination system. 
</P>
<P>
	Lahn and Page found evidence that early in mammal history, a  
pair of chromosomes started evolving into the sex chromosomes. A 
mutation somehow created a gene called SRY -- for sex-determining 
region Y -- and it became the master switch for creating a male, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SRY-bearing chromosome became the Y chromosome and its  
SRY-deficient partner became the X chromosome,'' Lahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over evolutionary time, the male-determining Y chromosome became  
simpler and shared fewer and fewer genes of the more complex X 
chromosome. The Y now has only about a tenth of the genes that are 
present in the X chromsome, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Discuss Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
                      *AP Special Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls --  
front-runner George Bush not among them -- politely discussed 
abortion, health care and gun control Thursday night in a town hall 
meeting in the nation's first primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	Stressing his opposition to abortion, Sen. John McCain said the  
Republican Party must nevertheless reach out to voters who differ 
and ``have respectful disagreements -- and not a single one of his 
four rivals on the Dartmouth College stage offered any immediate 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes all  
said the nation's health care system needs reforming. Each offered 
slightly different prescriptions, and none made any immediate 
attempt to draw distinctions with his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the five men shared the stage for a debate sponsored  
by CNN and WMUR-TV. It was the second such event in two nights in 
the Granite State -- Vice President Al Gore and Democratic rival 
Bill Bradley patrolled the same stage on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The only discord in the first 30 minutes came when an  
unidentified woman interrupted the proceedings to demand a cut in 
military spending to benefit health care and education. Moderators 
swiftly regained control of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	There were moments of self-deprecating humor: McCain, asked a  
question about legalizing marijuana, said: ``Thank you, that is an 
excellent question, which I would prefer to duck.'' He didn't, 
explaining his opposition to legalization of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage before the television cameras began rolling, the  
candidates fielded questions from the audience on gay rights and 
China. Bauer, a conservative activist, used the pre-debate to get 
the first jab at Bush, calling him ``the absent governor from 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the subject midway through the debate when he  
referred again to the governor's decision to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the front-runner by far, decided in advance not to attend.  
But he made his presence felt, granting an interview to the 
Manchester television station that was co-hosting the debate. 
Recent polling shows McCain as Bush's closest rival, particularly 
in the wake of Elizabeth Dole's recent withdrawal from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours before the debate, Bush was interviewed about his  
absence on WMUR-TV, which was televising the event along with CNN. 
Appearing with his wife Laura, Bush said he knows the forum is 
important, but that his family comes first and it is more important 
to him to be at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she 
was being honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New  
Hampshire will recognize that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he'll campaign in New Hampshire next week. ``At every  
stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for America and it 
seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept my vision and 
want me to be the nominee,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has agreed to participate in the next GOP debate, in  
Manchester on Dec. 2. ``I'm looking forward to participating,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' Forbes said, campaigning at a diner in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a week the Republicans have debated  
without Bush. There were no breakthrough moments and no sharp 
disputes in the debate last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is bankrolling his own campaign, said Bush will  
suffer for his absence now. ``The people of New Hampshire will say 
this just doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that Forbes has been selling shares  
in the financial magazine that bears his name to raise money for 
his presidential bid. Forbes said he is not breaching campaign 
finance laws, but would not disclose the price people are paying. 
Bauer demanded that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain got a head start with a stop in Hanover on Wednesday,  
drawing a crowd at a news conference in the lull before the first 
Democratic debate, between Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will accept every invitation that there is to debate, and I  
would hope that Gov. Bush will change his strategy so that people 
can observe all of us in candidate forums,'' the Arizona senator 
said. He said New Hampshire voters expect and deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had said he wouldn't participate until next year because  
people are not yet paying attention to the campaign. But with signs 
that might backfire in New Hampshire, he changed his mind and 
accepted the December date. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes scoffed at his explanation for skipping this one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Blah, blah, blah, blah,'' Forbes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in New Hampshire last Friday, but left for a  
fund-raising event in Vermont before the first of the 
five-candidate debates.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise Sharply; Dow Up 184.27 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today after a new  
report showed that U.S. workers' wages and benefits are increasing 
at a slower than expected pace. The report raised hopes that 
inflation is not a threat to the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 184.27 at 10,579.16, extending Friday's 
92-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was up 25.01 at 1,321.72, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 36.71 at 2,839.23. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its  
employment cost index rose by 0.8 percent in the third quarter, 
slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many economists were 
expecting. Economists view that index as a significant barometer of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Fed will raise interest rates for the third time this 
year in its continuing effort to ward off inflation. While the 
employment cost index did not suggest that the Fed will hold rates 
steady, it helped some investors believe that any rate increase 
would be modest, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the  
exclusion of a strong report on the nation's gross domestic 
product. The government reported today that the U.S. economy 
expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 percent from July through 
September, the fastest pace this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com fell 6 15/16 to 69. The online  
retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results 
topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as 
the company spent heavily to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 160.95 million 
shares, well ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index rose 4.41 to 421.18.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.7 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feds Freeze Indian Tribe's Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTEE, Neb. (AP) -- Leaders of the Santee Sioux have vowed to  
keep their Ohiya Casino open despite the latest attempt by federal 
authorities to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to let him get away with this. We are ready  
to fight,'' tribe chairman Butch Denny said Wednesday after 
learning U.S. Attorney Tom Monaghan had taken action to freeze 
tribal bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Monaghan said he intends to seize the assets to help pay more  
than $1 million in fines the tribe owes the government for 
operating its casino in defiance of court orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first step in the collection process,'' he said  
Tuesday. ``The tribe has not made any effort to pay those 
court-ordered fines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santee leaders said the money includes federal funds earmarked  
for health-care and social service programs. None of the money was 
generated from the casino, Denny said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an attack on our elderly and children,'' Denny said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest development in a three-year effort by state  
and federal officials to close the casino on the Santee reservation 
near the South Dakota line in northeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe opened the casino in 1996 even though the state  
refused to approve it. Casino-style gambling, including slot 
machines, is illegal in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 requires states to  
negotiate agreements with tribes to set rules and limits on 
gambling. The tribe sued the state, alleging it failed to negotiate 
in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribe says the casino's 23 jobs are much needed on the  
reservation, where the unemployment rate is 74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the tribe or Monaghan knew exactly how much money was in  
the frozen accounts at two banks. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge started fining the tribe $3,000 per day in  
February for refusing to close the casino. The fine was doubled in 
July. None of the fines have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	Monaghan also seized about $87,000 from a Santee account in  
South Dakota in 1997. The tribe responded by filing a lawsuit and 
opening secret accounts.

	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic gave general manager John  
Gabriel a four-year contract extension Thursday that runs through

<HEADLINE> Smith Quits Race, May Rejoin GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a coveted committee chairmanship at  
stake, Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire quit his independent 
campaign for president on Thursday as he moved toward a likely 
return to the Republican Party he abandoned with a scathing attack 
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the conservative New Hampshire lawmaker  
responded ``yes'' when asked whether he still believes what he said 
on leaving the GOP in July. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Capitol lawn news conference, Smith said he was folding his  
presidential campaign, citing as a reason the prohibitive cost of 
running as an independent. In politics, he said, ``you have to be 
prepared to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he wouldn't answer any questions about his political  
affiliation until after weekend funeral services for Sen. John 
Chafee, R-R.I., who died unexpectedly Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But he confirmed he had spoken in recent weeks with Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, GOP National Chairman Jim Nicholson and 
others ``about coming back to the Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith made clear that his contacts occurred before Chafee died.  
</P>
<P>
	The timing is a sensitive issue, because the Rhode Island  
Republican was chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee, and Smith is seeking to inherit the post. If he had 
remained a Republican, the chairmanship would have belonged to 
Smith by virtue of seniority. But Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., is 
now the panel's senior Republican, and he, too, wants the post. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he would make a formal announcement about his plans  
Monday. But he did nothing to discourage speculation that he would 
return to the GOP at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that people in the party have been reaching out to  
me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., said he expects Smith to return to the GOP fold.  
Asked whether the senator had apologized for his comments about the 
party, Lott replied, ``Well, no. But I feel like he knows we were 
not too pleased with that. We're beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson issued a statement during the day that said of Smith:  
``I have come to know him well, to respect him greatly and I have 
assured him that if he were to return to our party, he would be 
welcomed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith bolted the GOP last summer when he was faring poorly in  
the presidential public opinion polls. He said then that he would 
likely run as a third party contender. 
</P>
<P>
	He exited with a blistering speech in the Senate.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won the revolution on issues. We won the revolution on  
principle,'' he told his colleagues then. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the desire to stay in power caused us to start listening  
to the pollsters and the consultants again, who were telling us for 
some inexplicable reason that we need to walk away from issues.... 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my party to stand for something,'' he said, contending  
Republicans routinely ignored their own party platform on issues as 
diverse as abortion, foreign policy and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's remarks angered some fellow Republicans, but he said  
Thursday, ``It wasn't personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His departure speech was still posted on his Senate Web site on  
Wednesday, but was removed overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	If he rejoined the party, the balance of power would return to  
55 Republicans and 45 Democrats, although he generally voted with 
the Republicans as an independent.

<HEADLINE> Albright Offers Help to Armenia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring ``we have to see what we can do to  
lessen the pain,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on 
Thursday offered U.S. assistance to Armenia as the tiny former 
Soviet republic tries to cope with explosive nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright directed her deputy, Strobe Talbott, to return to the  
Armenian capital of Yerevan on Friday and said she would talk with 
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov next week about unrest in 
various areas of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott was in Armenia on Wednesday before gunmen, claiming a  
coup, stormed the parliament and killed the nation's prime 
minister, Vazgen Sarkisian, and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to save the Armenian people from perishing and  
restore their rights,'' said Nairi Unanian, an ardent nationalist 
who was detained along with four other alleged gunmen. ``Those 
responsible for robbing the country must face trial along with 
us,'' he said in Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said she was concerned about any prospect of terrorism  
in restive regions, one of the charges leveled against the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott was in Armenia to talk with President Robert Kocharian  
and Sarkisian about Armenia's territorial dispute with Azerbaijan 
over Nagorno-Karakbakh, a territory in Azerbaijan populated mainly 
by Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the territory declared independence and separatists  
helped by Armenia drove out Azeri troops. A truce was signed in 
1994, but sporadic fighting has continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright -- who said she telephoned Kocharian ``to offer my  
personal condolences and sorrow'' -- said the United States wanted 
to try to make sure the former Soviet Union ``does not become an 
area for terrorism.'' She was directing her remarks also to the 
Russian offensive in the secession-inclined republic of Chechnya 
and unrest in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, meanwhile, told a White House news conference  
that he'd like to spur negotiations that would lead to a political 
settlement of the Chechnya situation, keeping civilian casualties 
to a minimum. He said a military solution was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin, meanwhile, condemned  
``the brutal attack'' on Armenia's leaders and lawmakers, and said 
the United States was grateful the incident ended without further 
loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has received no confirmed information about a  
motive for the attack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a travel advisory, the department said, ``This appears to be  
an isolated incident with no reports of related activity elsewhere 
in the country.'' American citizens were advised to take 
``appropriate security precautions,'' but they were not cautioned 
against traveling in the country of about 3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright and Ivanov will meet next week in Oslo at a memorial  
for the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

<HEADLINE> Analyzing McCain's Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	An analysis of Sen. John McCain's television commercial opening  
his advertising effort in the 2000 presidential campaign: 
</P>
<P>
	TITLE: ``Ready to Lead''  
</P>
<P>
	LENGTH: 60 seconds  
</P>
<P>
	PRODUCER: Stevens Reed Curcio &AMP; Company  
</P>
<P>
	AIRING: New Hampshire, beginning Friday  
</P>
<P>
	SCRIPT: Male Announcer: He was a young Navy pilot who  
volunteered for duty in Vietnam and was shot down over Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Commander John McCain, dragged off by an angry mob. When  
found to be the son and grandson of admirals, was offered early 
release. He refused. McCain's commitment to country and fellow 
prisoners bought him repeated beatings and 5 1/2 years in prison. He 
returned home, spirit unbroken, again devoting himself to his 
country. Navy officer, Congressman, Senator, taking on the 
establishment and defying special interests. And never forgetting 
those heroes with whom he served. Today John McCain is ready to 
lead America into the new century, his mission to fundamentally 
reform government. More experience and more courage than anyone. 
Ready to be president and leader of the free world. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain: I swear to you that from my first day in office to the  
last breath I draw, I will do everything in my power to make you 
proud of your government. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcer: John McCain for president.  
</P>
<P>
	KEY IMAGES: Black and white photo of McCain as a young Navy  
pilot; footage of a plane being shot down and a soldier parachuting 
to the ground; photo of McCain's capture in a Hanoi lake; prisoners 
of war marching; close-up footage of a bruised McCain lying on a 
prison cot. Color footage of McCain getting off a plane when he 
returned from Vietnam; Sen. McCain walking on the White House 
grounds with President Ronald Reagan; McCain walking through 
Arlington Cemetery; McCain shaking hands with supporters; McCain 
giving a campaign speech with his wife Cindy, next to him and 
surrounded by a cheering crowd and confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	GOAL: To introduce McCain as a war hero willing to risk his life  
for his country, and to implicitly contrast his foreign policy 
credentials with those of the lesser experienced Republican 
front-runner, George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	ANALYSIS: McCain is banking on character and experience being  
key to this campaign, and hoping to leave voters with a warm first 
impression. Like his best-selling memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' 
the ad focuses on McCain's heroic personal history and military 
career -- something neither Bush nor Steve Forbes can touch -- but 
glosses over any substantive platform, and even his Senate record, 
with generalities like ``defying special interests'' and ``a 
mission to fundamentally reform government.'' By placing the spot 
exclusively in New Hampshire, McCain is trying to solidify his 
growing popularity there. Since he has all but forfeited the Jan. 
24 Iowa caucuses by not campaigning there, McCain counts on 
bouncing quickly back into the critical, early season headlines 
with a strong showing in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.

<HEADLINE> Consecutive Series Sweeps Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ruth and Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio. And now Bernie  
Williams, Derek Jeter and the '99 Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	For just the third time in baseball history, a team swept the  
World Series in consecutive years. By beating the Atlanta Braves 
4-1 Wednesday night, these Yankees, who swept San Diego last year, 
joined the Murderers' Row Yankees that swept Pittsburgh in 1927 and 
St. Louis in 1928, and DiMaggio's Yankees, which swept the Chicago 
Cubs in 1938 and Cincinnati in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when it sounded like a mixture of Verdun, St.  
Mihiel, Ypres and the Somme as the `slammerese twins' rolled their 
heavy artillery into position and once more opened up the big 
blast,'' Grantland Rice wrote in the New York Herald Tribune after 
Ruth homered three times and Gehrig once in a 7-3 victory that 
capped the '28 Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Babe and Lou stalked through this series like the Four  
Horsemen of the Sock Eclipse -- Dyanmite, Demolition, Destruction 
and Death. And that spins out only part of the story. In addition, 
they were a pounding pestilence, a mauling misery, a clouting 
contagion, a black plague of mighty wallops that continued to clear 
out the right-field wall and threaten the lives and homes of those 
benighted denizens who lived in gunfire range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth game at St. Louis, the Yankees trailed 2-1 before  
a four-run seventh. After going 110-44 in 1927, New York had 
``slumped'' to 101-53 and was the underdog going in, hampered by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the cripples came through,'' Ruth wrote in a  
first-person account in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ``And whatever 
may be said about our playing or our pitching or our hitting, 
there's one thing I don't think anyone can deny. They can't say we 
didn't have courage. I never expected to win this series in four 
straight games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth was 10-for-16 (.625) in the four games with three doubles,  
three homers and four RBIs. Gehrig was 6-for-11 (.545) with four 
homers and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 11 years later, the Yankees did it again, with Charlie  
Keller going 7-for-16 (.438) with a double, a triple, three homers 
and six RBIs. Bill Dickey drove in five runs and DiMaggio went 
5-for-16 (.313). 
</P>
<P>
	New York trailed 4-2 in the ninth but tied the score, then won  
it with a three-run 10th. DiMaggio hit a go-ahead single to right, 
with Frank Crosetti scoring, and Keller slid home for a 6-4 lead as 
the ball got away from catcher Ernie Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi fell as Keller crossed the plate and no one went after  
the ball, and DiMaggio wound up coming all the way around on what 
the Herald Tribune called a `home-run' single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signor Schnozzola is sleeping beauty of a strange spectacle,''  
said a headline in the New York Journal-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Much was made how manager Joe McCarthy matched Miller Huggins'  
feat of leading teams to consecutive sweeps. After the win, 
McCarthy led the team in the clubhouse singing ``East Side, West 
Side,'' and ``Roll Out the Barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No other manager, no other team has equaled that record in  
baseball's first 100 years,'' Bill Corum wrote in the 
Journal-American. ``None will in its second 100. ... The way it 
looks now, the Yankees' complete dominance of the baseball world is 
not for a month and not for a year, but for always.''

<HEADLINE> Another Hearing for Mike Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Biting an opponent's ears, as Mike Tyson did to Evander  
Holyfield, is not a common foul by fighters, even hungry fighters. 
Hitting after the bell is something that happens more often. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't make it right, of course, but it is more  
understandable than chomping an opponent's ear. 
</P>
<P>
	People know what Tyson did as the bell clanged the end of the  
first round Saturday night. They also know that Norris went down, 
and in falling he dislocated his right kneecap and could not 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no doubt the punch was a foul, but referee Richard  
Steele ruled it was an accidental foul, and the fight was called a 
no contest. Even Norris said he didn't think Tyson nailed him on 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every foul committed in a fight is intentional, or flagrant.  
If the punch had been ruled a deliberate foul, Tyson could have 
been disqualified, and a hearing would have been required to 
consider revoking his license. That is what the Nevada State 
athletic commission did after Iron Mike made his mark on Holyfield 
on June 28, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Tyson's late punch was ruled an accidental foul, it has to  
be assumed the commission's hearing on Friday will be just a matter 
of going through the motions. It's unlikely the five commissioners 
will reverse their referee's judgment call. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing is that it was an accidental foul, and  
that was the determination that was made,'' said Marc Ratner, the 
commission's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Luther Mack, however, has said he is in favor of  
fining Tyson. Tyson, fined $3 million after the Bite Fight, had his 
purse withheld pending the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got $8.7 million,'' Mack said. ``I don't have a number in  
mind. It has to be a sum that he knows we're serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Tyson is fined, the reason for it shouldn't be based on the  
size of his purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he is fined or not, the latest incident in Tyson's  
turbulent career was costly, another tear in an already tattered 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy has long been a saleable commodity in boxing, but  
controversy involving Tyson is becoming commonplace. There are 
indications that fans who shell out big bucks to see a Tyson fight 
live or $50 to watch at home could become bored with Iron Mike. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, something unusual could happen in a Tyson fight, but how  
more unusual can it get? So why buy? 
</P>
<P>
	A Tyson fight that should sell, however, is a Feb. 26 bout  
against Shannon Briggs in a pairing of Brooklyn natives in New 
York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's advisors also would like to see him fight in December.  
If he does, it might be wise to have him fight outside the United 
States, where his name and an easy opponent would be more readily 
accepted than here. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point in time, the 33-year-old Tyson needs someone who  
will make him look spectacular. He does not need another incident, 
in or out of the ring.

<HEADLINE> Cellist and Scorpions To Perform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Ten years after his impromptu concert in front of  
the collapsing Berlin Wall, cellist Mstislav Rostropovich is coming 
back for an encore. This time, he's bringing the German rock band 
Scorpions with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostropovich, along with 165 other cellists, and the rockers  
will play a joint concert on the 10th anniversary of the Wall's 
opening -- Nov. 9 -- in front of Berlin's signature Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rostropovich played on the spot 10 years ago as people from the  
East and the West celebrated the collapse of the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Rostropovich and the other cellists will accompany  
the Scorpions as they play their international rock anthem ``Wind 
of Change.'' Scorpions singer Klaus Meine said the band wanted to 
commemorate ``what people have achieved with the desire for 
peace.''

<HEADLINE> Forbes Sells Stock To Finance Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes is selling shares in his  
privately held publishing company to help fund his presidential 
campaign, a move criticized Thursday by one of his Republican 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes declined to say how much of Forbes Inc. he has sold, what  
price was paid, how the value of the shares was determined or what 
percentage of the company he now owns. But he said he followed all 
campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve has disclosed all he is required to disclose,'' said his  
national campaign chairman, Ken Blackwell. ``There has been no 
jacking up the price of the stock to finance this campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell said Forbes would disclose additional information  
about his financial status before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign finance laws require that stock sales be at fair market  
value; sales at higher prices could constitute illegal campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, Blackwell said, plays ``by the established rules  
and by the book. We have in fact disclosed everything. We will 
continue to err on the side of more disclosure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Thursday that, as a result of the  
sales, Forbes no longer holds a majority of the company's voting 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has pumped $16.3 million into his own campaign and raised  
another $4.5 million. He has spent almost $19 million, including $4 
million on advertisements, through Sept. 30, according to reports 
filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential rival Gary Bauer said Forbes' stock  
sales highlight the need for campaign finance reform. He said he 
supports a ban on soft-money contributions to political parties and 
an increase in the size of donations individuals can make to 
campaigns coupled with instantaneous reporting of such donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's great cynicism among the public. Steve needs to be  
more forthcoming,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for his reaction, Larry Makinson, executive director of  
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks 
campaign financing, said: ``It's hard enough tracking a regular 
campaign. The problem the Federal Election Commission has here is 
there's nothing to audit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the letter of the law doesn't require him to produce  
these records, but the best policy for the campaign would be to be 
upfront about this. In today's world, people are suspicious.''

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Landscape Shifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the year since the antitrust trial opened  
against Microsoft Corp., the nation's high-tech industry has made 
some of its most dramatic shifts since consumers began discovering 
the Internet in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Netscape Communications Corp., whose pioneer browser  
software helped popularize the Web, has a powerful new owner in 
America Online Inc., plus another strong new ally whose chief 
executive is no friend to Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of the nation's largest computer makers are selling some  
machines without Microsoft's Windows software already installed. 
Consumers previously tied to bulky desktop computers can surf the 
Internet using handheld devices, even fancy cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to raise the question: Can the slow wheels of  
justice keep pace in ``Internet time,'' where four years is roughly 
the equivalent of a generation? 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could announce his  
factual findings in the Microsoft trial as early as Friday, the 
first step toward a final verdict. That decision also was expected 
to serve as a barometer for whether the judge believes the company 
broke antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts expect the landmark case to wind through  
appeals courts for as long as two years. That kind of delay would 
complicate decisions about possible punishments against Microsoft 
that might still be applied in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you write a prescription that the patient is ultimately  
going to take 24 months later in an industry that moves this 
fast?'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George 
Washington University. ``It's a terrible problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cutting new ground here,'' agreed Rob Enderle, an  
industry analyst with Giga Information Group. ``Whatever (the 
judge) does will set a precedent that will be followed and cursed 
or blessed for decades to come. This is likely to be his biggest 
moment in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Thursday, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Joel  
Klein said the fast pace of the Microsoft trial ``demonstrates that 
both the Department of Justice and the court system can move in 
Internet time.'' Other important government antitrust actions, such 
as a lawsuit against IBM, dragged on for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also dismissed talk about possible remedies as premature,  
saying it would be ``putting the cart before the horse.'' People 
close to the case said the government still is deciding what type 
of punishment yet to recommend against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate speech elsewhere in New York on Thursday, Gates  
didn't discuss the courtroom fight against his company. He talked 
instead about children growing up already embracing the Internet, 
an era he called ``Generation I, I for Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyers have forcefully argued these dramatic shifts  
in the industry undermine allegations that competition among 
high-tech companies is so inadequate that a judge's intervention is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	They used AOL's recent $10 billion purchase of Netscape to  
dispute the government's allegation that it illegally wielded its 
influence to crush rivals, including Netscape. They cited e-mail 
from AOL chief executive Steve Case figuring that if AOL began 
distributing Netscape's browser to its 19 million subscribers, its 
portion would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also has noted that some major computer makers now  
offer models running Linux software, suggesting the company's 
reputed stranglehold isn't as tight over the industry as portrayed 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice lawyers reject those arguments, citing figures showing  
that Microsoft Windows continues to run the vast majority of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also cite evidence from the trial that even the largest  
computer companies expressed fear at upsetting Microsoft. Compaq 
Computer Corp. once wondered in an internal presentation about the 
software giant, ``How retaliatory could they get?''

<HEADLINE> MSN Unveils Internet Call Waiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft's MSN Web service and Nortel Networks  
are offering an Internet version of call waiting and caller ID that 
lets people with one phone line log on and still know when they're 
getting a call and who's calling. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service, costing an extra $5 or $6 a month, uses a  
pop-up window on a computer screen to show when there's an incoming 
phone call, displaying the name and phone number of the caller. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop-up window offers a few alternatives if the person  
getting the call doesn't want to pick up the phone and end their 
Internet connection. The call can be forwarded to another number 
such as a voice mail line or mobile phone. The user can also send a 
recorded or generic ``call back'' message to the caller. Or, for 
those with the necessary equipment in their personal computer, the 
call can be answered through that PC without terminating the 
Internet connection. 
</P>
<P>
	MSN launched the service Thursday for its subscribers in  
Atlanta, Seattle and San Diego, and plans to offer it 50 major U.S. 
markets over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nortel's technology is somewhat new in this country, it  
has been available in Canada for more than a year. A similar 
service using Nortel's system was recently introduced in Chicago by 
Ameritech, the Baby Bell phone company that's been acquired by SBC 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	To use the service, subscribers also need to order ``call  
forward busy'' from their local phone companies, which costs from 
50 cents to $2 per month in most parts of the country, but can go 
as high as $3.35 a month in California communities served by 
Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no activation fee from Nortel or MSN, which hopes to  
integrate the monthly charge for Internet call waiting into its 
monthly bill. Nortel will operate the service for MSN and bill 
customers directly at first. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the added expense, the service could prove very  
attractive to consumers and small businesses, who might otherwise 
miss calls or have to pay the $15 to $25 a month it costs to have a 
second phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, although the new high-speed offering called DSL, or  
digital subscriber line, enables a simultaneous Internet and 
telephone connection over a single phone line, the service 
generally costs from $40 to $60 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Group, an industry research firm, predicts that 10  
million households will subscribe to Internet call waiting services 
by 2001, growing to 26 million by 2003. International Data Corp., 
another research firm, expects these services to generate $400 
million a year in revenues by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel, which usually doesn't operate the high-tech  
communications equipment it develops and manufactures, hopes to 
sell the service through numerous Internet service providers and 
local telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in discussions with a number of channel partners and  
we'll be making announcements over the next several months,'' said 
Irving Ebert, a product manager for Nortel Internet telephony 
products. He declined to provide further details.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Plays After Father's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the middle of a joyous World Series  
celebration on the field, Paul O'Neill hugged his manager and wept. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill's father had died earlier Wednesday after a long  
struggle with heart problems, and Joe Torre had a special message 
for his right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your dad got to watch this one,'' Torre told O'Neill.  
</P>
<P>
	Then, O'Neill jogged off the field, wiping his eyes as he  
entered the dugout, no longer able to control his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It obviously came out at the end,'' O'Neill said.  
</P>
<P>
	He broke down again in the clubhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud to be here, I'm proud to be part of this team ...  
but believe me, I lost someone special,'' he said, his voice 
cracking. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was in the lineup in his usual spot in Game 4 against  
the Atlanta Braves, batting third and playing right field. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he showed up, I assumed he was going to play,'' Torre  
said before the Yankees beat the Braves 4-1 to sweep the Series. 
``That's why he was here. This can keep his mind off the grieving 
for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paulie does what he does. As George Steinbrenner likes to say,  
he's a warrior. He's here even though it is tough to concentrate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles O'Neill, 79, died at a New York hospital about three  
hours after the Yankees beat the Braves 6-5 in 10 innings in Game 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder O'Neill had come to New York from his Ohio home  
earlier this month for treatment. His son left the team for a day 
in June when his father underwent heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played with heavy hearts,'' said winning pitcher Roger  
Clemens. ``I don't know if I could've done what Paul O'Neill did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said O'Neill was not surprised by his father's death  
``because he had been in tough shape. It's a very sorrowful time 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, who did not want to talk about his father's death  
before the game, stretched and took batting practice with his 
teammates on the field. He went 0-for-3 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understood that his father wanted him to go out there,''  
said Joe Girardi, who is a close friend of O'Neill's. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill is the third Yankee whose father has died in the past  
two months. Scott Brosius' father died of colon cancer on Sept. 12. 
Luis Sojo missed the first two games of the Series after his father 
died Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how he did it in a game like this,'' Brosius  
said. ``It took a lot of strength. I know how difficult it is to do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre knew as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you play this game you try to eliminate the highs and  
lows,'' he said. ``That has been difficult. There is nothing higher 
than playing in the World Series and nothing lower than mourning 
the loss of a family member. There has been a lot of this going on. 
We just have to fight through it.''

<HEADLINE>  GOP Hopefuls Debate in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By WALTER R. MEARS    	
</P>
<P>
                      *AP Special Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Next time, Gov. George W. Bush's rivals for  
the Republican presidential nomination will be debating against him 
instead of about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Gov. Bush will be very active in this campaign,  
particularly since we're moving up so rapidly in the polls,'' said 
Sen. John McCain, who trails Bush but is gaining. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he'd have preferred to have Bush participate in the  
forum at Dartmouth College on Thursday night because New Hampshire 
voters deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative  
activist Gary Boer, commentator Alan Keys and Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah went ahead without Bush, meeting for the second time in a week 
in a 60-minute question-and-answer format. 
</P>
<P>
	They sparred at times, but it was no slugfest as they stated  
their positions on taxes, abortion and assorted other issues, 
without much argument. It was not direct debate. They got questions 
in turn, 90 seconds to answer, no rebuttal time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New Hampshire polls, McCain trails Bush by 12 to 16  
points. The others are far behind, registering in single digits. 
McCain said he does not discount them, recalling that he was down 
there, too, not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he is gaining traction, and he sought to add to it  
Thursday night by sticking to his message of reform, a point he 
made on almost every question put to him. He said patients' medical 
rights, school voucher funding, money to meet the needs of military 
families, and his standard, political finances, are all in need of 
reform that can't happen until the power of special interest money 
is curbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes took the hardest shot of the night at Bush for his  
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future, at a forum like this, if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' said the magazine heir, who is 
financing his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has said he will come to the Republicans' debate in  
Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2. And the absentee got a solo interview 
on WMUR-TV, a local station, two hours before the hourlong debate 
it co-sponsored with CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he regretted missing it, but preferred to be at a  
ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at Southern Methodist University 
in Dallas. ``I'm sorry I'm not there, I look forward to the 
debates, I've got a lot to say,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a front-runner would get that TV treatment. But it also  
showed that Bush is wary of the absentee argument against him. His 
campaign issued statements explaining his absence. He had planned 
to stay out of debates until January. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer did take a slap at Forbes on another point, saying that  
his proposed flat tax would favor corporations over families. 
``Gary, you're wrong,'' Forbes countered. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain urged Republican openness to differences on the abortion  
issue, repeating that he is firmly opposed to the practice. None of 
the more conservative candidates challenged him on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have respectful disagreements on specific issues, and  
we can work together on this one,'' he said of the party's most 
divisive social policy dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,  
the Democratic candidates, met in their first question-and-answer 
debate Wednesday night. When the moderator at the GOP forum asked 
who in that crowd had watched the Democrats, McCain's hand was one 
of those that went up. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the Democratic contest might have a bearing on his,  
because about one-third of New Hampshire voters are independents 
and can vote in either party primary on Feb. 1. So independents 
could be pivotal. ``Sen. Bradley is appealing to a lot of 
independents,'' he said before the debate. ``I am, too.''

<HEADLINE> Pilots' Union Seeks Debt Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The airline pilots' union is discussing  
making contract concessions to American Airlines in exchange for 
the company erasing a $45.5 million debt imposed on the union by a 
judge, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Allied Pilots Association and American issued a joint  
statement late Wednesday, saying the union's board of directors 
``will consider a number of mutually developed concepts and 
proposals aimed at resolving a number of past and current disputes 
and improving the working relationship'' between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	The board's directors have been given authorization to enter  
negotiations about possibly extending the union's contract, which 
normally would not come up for talks until summer 2001, the 
statement said. The two sides would consider limited changes and 
improvements, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement didn't mention the $45.5 million debt -- imposed  
for the pilots' union sickout earlier this year. The Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram, quoting sources familiar with discussions between 
American and the pilots, said the talks could lead to the erasing 
of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	American had no additional comment. Union spokesman Gregg  
Overman wouldn't comment on whether the talks included paying off 
the debt through contract concessions. He said the union board 
would be discussing various proposals over the next few days, aimed 
at ``improving our working relationship'' with American. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's debt evolved from a sickout by pilots that forced  
the cancellation of nearly 6,700 flights between Feb. 6 and Feb. 
16. The pilots were upset because after American bought Reno Air, 
the union and the carrier differed over how to absorb the 
lower-paid Reno Air pilots into the American system. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall ordered the pilots back to work  
Feb. 10. Three days later, he found the union in contempt for 
failing to comply with his order. He ordered the union, its 
president and vice president to pay the airline $45.5 million, the 
amount he calculated the airline lost because of the noncompliance.

<HEADLINE> National Geographic Goes High Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans now have two ways to enjoy the maps  
of the National Geographic Society -- a new edition of the famed 
world atlas and an Internet site where the maps can be called up on 
any computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not too many years ago, maps were pretty passive things. Back  
then, maps were kind of like nouns, now they've become active 
verbs,'' society chief cartographer Allen Carroll said of the 
book-Internet combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The new material was premiered at a news conference Wednesday,  
38 degrees 54 minutes 18 seconds north latitude, 77 degrees 2 
minutes 18 seconds west longitude -- the society's M Street 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The seventh edition of the society's atlas includes such changes  
as the breakup of Yugoslavia, the creation of the native territory 
Nunavut in Canada, new provincial boundaries in Poland and changing 
country names in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	It also marks the completion of a three-year $3 million effort  
to computerize all society maps -- a project that allows them to be 
put on the Internet at http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mapmachine. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the book costs $125 while the Internet is free --  
supported by advertising and sponsors -- society officials are 
confident a market exists for both. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think they are a perfect combination,'' Carroll said.  
``They are not redundant, they are complimentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book gives better resolution, looks better on a coffee  
table, is quicker and easier to use and makes a nice gift, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But any map book is out of date the minute it's printed, while  
the Internet can be kept up to date. 
</P>
<P>
	So, when there are changes that affect the printed atlas, people  
will be able to find the corrected map on the Web site, print it 
out at the correct scale, and paste it in their book, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it already has happened. The Black Canyon of the  
Gunnison, formerly a national monument, is now a national park. The 
printed correction can be pasted on plate 39 of the atlas. 
</P>
<P>
	Every map in the new atlas has been redone from the sixth  
edition, Carroll said, adding improved shaded relief. The volume 
also contains a new satellite mosaic map of the world, a 136-page 
index and an expanded section providing flags and descriptions of 
the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The atlas will generate complaints, Carroll admitted, as have  
all the society's past atlases, because of the many disputed areas 
in the world. He said the society receives angry letters from 
people ``who want us to show the world as they think it should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The society's policy is to show the world as it is, listing  
which country is in actual control of an area, even if that control 
is disputed by some other country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor, for example, which recently voted for independence  
from Indonesia but has not yet become a recognized country, 
generated discussion, Carroll said. The atlas shows Timor as part 
of Indonesia with a notation in red that, as of 1999, authorities 
were finalizing plans to give the island's eastern section 
political autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas generating the most letters, he said, are Cyprus, Taiwan,  
East Timor and Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Stocks End Sharply Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Bullishness in U.S. equity markets catapulted  
Mexican stocks Thursday, which closed sharply higher as the release 
of some U.S. economic indicators calmed jitters related to a 
potential interest rate hike in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers said positive earnings reports from local  
companies also backed Thursday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The market's key IPC index closed up 186.30 points or 3.6  
percent to 5,328.52, the third-largest rise in nominal terms so far 
this year. At the end of 1998, the IPC stood at 3,959.66. 
</P>
<P>
	A heavy 121.2 million shares were traded, compared to  
Wednesday's volume of 61.0 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 65 gainers, 12 losers and 19 issues unchanged.  
</P>
<P>
	``Today's rise confirms a bullish trend for IPC in the  
short-term, inching closer to the key resistance mark of 5,335 
points,'' said Hector Jimenez, technical analyst at Inverlat 
brokerage. ``Once above the 5335-mark, the IPC could extend gains 
to reach 5500 points in the near-term, backed by a positive outlook 
for the local equities market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The local market got solid support from the opening, as U.S.  
equities surged on the back of positive economic indicators 
released early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Labor Department said its employment cost index rose  
0.8 percent in the third quarter, slightly lower than the 0.9 
percent increase many economists were expecting. Economists view 
the index as a significant barometer of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.2 percent at  
10,622.53.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Earnings Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp. Ltd. said today its first-quarter  
earnings exceeded analysts' expectations despite lower income from 
its entertainment division, which was buoyed last year by video 
sales of the motion picture ``Titanic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profit after taxes was $165 million, or 16 cents a  
share, down from $196 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago. The 
results in the latest quarter were 2 cents above analysts' 
predictions. News Corp. shares were trading at $28.38, up 69 cents 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue came to $3.16 billion, compared with $3.19 billion a  
year earlier, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said consolidated operating income in the quarter  
was $395 million, down from $407 million a year ago. Income in the 
filmed entertainment division fell to $46 million from $123 
million, the report said.

	Meanwhile, Fox Entertainment Group, which is 82 percent owned by  
News Corp., said its net income for the July-September quarter was 
$43 million, or 6 cents a share, down from $57 million, or 10 cents

</P>
<P>
	Much of the difference again was attributed to last year's

<HEADLINE> Bulls Sign Willoughby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bulls signed free agent guard  
Dedric Willoughby on Thursday and waived forward-center Doug 
Swenson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Willoughby, who played the last two seasons in an  
Italian league, has been working out the past few days with the 
Bulls. Willoughby is expected to serve as a backup point guard 
until B.J. Armstrong returns from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Orleans native played for Bulls coach Tim Floyd at Iowa  
State, where he averaged 19.8 points in two seasons and left with 
school records for 3-pointers made (190) and attempted (487). 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson, 6-10, sat out the preseason with a left calf injury.  
Swenson averaged 11.8 points and 5.2 rebounds in helping Creighton 
win the Missouri Valley Conference tournament title and earn a 
berth in the NCAA tournament last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Bulls waived Cory Carr, their only healthy  
point guard behind starter Randy Brown. Armstrong is still three 
weeks from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of Willoughby's contract were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Eye Health Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bill Bradley tallies his ``big idea'' remedies  
for the poor and uninsured in billion-dollar bundles -- $10 billion 
here, $65 billion there. But will they, as rival Al Gore charges, 
blow the budget surplus, throw the national budget back into 
deficits or force higher taxes? 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president, in Wednesday's debate with Bradley, seized  
on an hours-old analysis by a former Clinton-Gore administration 
official putting the cost of Bradley's health plan at $1.2 trillion 
over 10 years -- more than the entire federal budget surplus and 
leaving nothing to shore up Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to shred the social safety net,'' Gore told  
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who generally dismisses Gore's more modest proposals as  
baby steps toward enormous problems, worked on his health proposal 
for two years and spent nine months running it by independent 
economists before giving it a $65 billion annual price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	``We each have our own experts,'' he retorted.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, budget experts who discount all election-year  
calculations as phony, said Bradley's proposals are no more budget 
busting than Gore's -- only Gore has yet to say much about his 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, Bradley has offered health, child care and  
anti-poverty programs that he estimates will cost a total of $78 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really are the tax and spend twins,'' said Mark Miller,  
executive director of the Republican Leadership Council. 
</P>
<P>
	In their race to be the Democrats' pick for president, the first  
modern presidential election set against budget surpluses instead 
of deficits, both have appealed to the party's liberal wing by 
offering expensive new programs: Gore's universal kindergarten, 
Bradley's universal health insurance, a promise by each to expand 
Medicare coverage to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both have chosen the easy road to financing their programs,  
saying the non-Social Security portion of the surplus -- projected 
to be $1 trillion over the next decade -- will cover the bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Alice-in-Wonderland-type math on both sides,'' said  
Brookings Institution economist Isabel Sawhill. ``It's very much a 
spitting match in which we're cloaking the debate in a false fiscal 
framework.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surplus projections are based on the assumption that Congress  
and the White House will stick to spending caps they set in 1997 
but have blown every year since. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chances of that surplus being there to allocate to new  
priorities is only slightly greater than the possibility that the 
ice cap will melt tomorrow and inundate us all,'' said former 
Congressional Budget Office director Robert Reischauer. 
</P>
<P>
	In his effort to flatten Bradley's rise in polls, Gore has honed  
in on the former New Jersey senator's health plan as ``way 
excessive.'' But while the vice president held up as gospel half of 
the side-by-side cost analysis by Emory University professor 
Kenneth Thorpe, the administration veteran responsible for pricing 
the 1993 Clinton health plan, he ignored other Thorpe estimates: 
</P>
<P>
	--That Gore's health plan will cost $312 billion over 10 years,  
or about $50 billion more than the cost Gore publicly assigned for 
the first time Wednesday night, and will yield just over 12 million 
newly insured Americans -- 1 million or 2 million less than Gore 
claimed to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Bradley and Gore are going to suffer the vagaries of not  
being precise in outyears,'' Thorpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts working with Bradley, including Stanford University  
economist Alan Garber, fault Thorpe's calculations for not taking 
account of subsidy caps, the reallocation of $23 billion that the 
federal government now spends on Medicaid, and other fine details. 
</P>
<P>
	Technological advances will also yield lower costs, said Margy  
Heldring, Bradley's top health policy adviser.	   ''As we increasingly learn how to get the right treatment to the 
right people at the right time -- and to put serious investment into 
prevention, in helping people to get and stay healthy -- there are 
savings to be had,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, countered Elaine Kamarck, Gore's chief policy adviser,  
Bradley's own estimates still ignore the $256 billion that the 
Office of Management and Budget says will be needed over the next 
decade to shore up Medicare for the Baby Boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's plan would eliminate Medicaid and give poor people  
government subsidies to buy into federal workers' health plans or 
purchase private insurance. Additionally, every American would be 
able to deduct from their taxable income whatever they pay in 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Using existing programs, Gore proposes to expand health coverage  
for children and parents without guarantees. Both candidates offer 
Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Greenstein, director of the liberal Center for Budget and  
Policy Priorities, said a look at each candidate's record shows 
``neither of them had a history in the Senate of putting together 
big expensive things that they couldn't pay for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's work on the 1986 Tax Reform suggests he would meet any  
costs stretching beyond the surplus by ``among other things, 
proposing to close a number of tax loopholes,'' Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But he's unlikely too talk much about that in the campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Ark. Arena Opens to Fanfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Attention shifted from cracks in  
support beams to the crack of hockey sticks hitting the puck as 
Alltel Arena was finally able to hold its inaugural event. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two weeks after its scheduled opening, Alltel Arena  
welcomed fans Thursday for its first event, a minor league hockey 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Structural problems that originated during construction caused  
cancellation of an Oct. 12 NBA exhibition game and last Saturday's 
scheduled opener for the Arkansas RiverBlades. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans appeared to enjoy the festivities that preceded the  
face-off shortly before 7:30 p.m. But boos flowed down from the 
stands when North Little Rock Mayor Patrick Henry Hays and Pulaski 
County Judge Buddy Villines took the ice in tuxedos for a 
ceremonial face-off before play began. Arena board president Bob 
Russell, who announced previous cancellations, was greeted more 
warmly. 
</P>
<P>
	One fan strutted around wearing a toy yellow hardhat but the  
focus was mainly on the $80 million arena's opening, rather than 
the two-week scramble to repair unsound upper-deck beams. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim and Kim Keiser of Cabot were on hand with their two  
children, ages 7 and 2. Mrs. Keiser said she was nervous but her 
husband was able to persuade her to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said it's part of Arkansas history so, I said let's go,''  
Jim Keiser said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said neither he nor his wife know anything about hockey.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to learn tonight,'' he said. The  
RiverBlades played the South Carolina Stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Wednesday, the RiverBlades said they sold about 7,000  
tickets for the arena, which seats about 16,000 for hockey.

<HEADLINE> Mother of Columbine Victim Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLANDS RANCH, Colo. (AP) -- For more than six months, the  
residents of Littleton have worked to put things back together in 
the aftermath of the nation's deadliest school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Those efforts were shattered last week, when Carla Hochhalter --  
whose daughter was critically wounded in the Columbine High School 
shootings -- committed suicide at a pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people attended her funeral Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't seem to quit,'' said Bob Palmer, a member of  
Christ Lutheran Church, where about 700 people, including many from 
the Columbine community, filled the church's main sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things seemed to be settling down and getting back to normal,  
and now this has happened,'' Palmer said. ``It's terrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Mrs. Hochhalter, 48, walked into an Englewood pawn  
shop Friday and asked to see a handgun. When the clerk was 
distracted, she loaded it with her own ammunition and killed 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives have said she suffered from clinical depression since  
1996, and that the Columbine massacre and her daughter's grave 
injuries were more than she could handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stress was mounting, and Carla was dealing with an  
illness,'' pastor David Jensen told mourners. ``It became too much, 
not just for Carla, but for many of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her daughter, Anne Marie, was shot in the spinal cord when  
seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began their gun and bomb 
attack at Columbine on April 20. Twelve students and a teacher died 
and more than 20 others were wounded before the gunmen killed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hochhalter, 17, who was partially paralyzed, was released  
from a rehabilitation hospital in August. Several days before her 
mother's death, she said she moved her legs for the first time 
during a therapy session. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hochhalter's suicide was the latest blow to a community  
still reeling after the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a Columbine student was arrested after allegedly  
saying he planned to ``finish the job'' started by Harris and 
Klebold. Several wounded students, including Miss Hochhalter, face 
difficult roads to recovery.

<HEADLINE> Doubts for Stewart Crash Inquiry </HEADLINE>

<P>
	MINA, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators picked through Payne Stewart's  
shattered Learjet on Thursday for valves and other small parts that 
might help answer whether the golfer's flight was doomed by a loss 
of oxygen in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board also said it is looking  
closely at three similar Learjet crashes over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, investigators are concerned that the cause of Stewart's  
crash will never be known because the plane and the bodies were so 
severely damaged, according to a high-level government official who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll ever be able to tell what happened from  
what we dug out of that hole,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and five other people died Monday aboard the plane,  
which crashed into a cow pasture near Mina four hours after it left 
Orlando, Fla., for Texas. The plane flew 1,400 miles across the 
country, apparently on autopilot, before it ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials and pilots have said one possible  
explanation is that the jet lost cabin pressure soon after taking 
off, causing everyone on board to die or lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Benzon, who is in charge of the investigation for the NTSB,  
said crews were particularly interested in finding valves, parts of 
the doors and windows and other components that help seal the 
cabin. All of what remained of the wreckage had been recovered and 
gathered in a hangar by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB also is reviewing three Learjet accidents that appear  
similar to Monday's crash. ``They continued to fly on autopilot 
after the crew became incapacitated. We don't know why in a couple 
of them,'' Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, a Learjet crashed in Ohio soon after taking off from  
Michigan for Kentucky. The reasons remained unknown because the 
plane was ``shredded,'' the government official said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Learjet took off in Europe in 1983 and flew 1,600 miles before  
crashing into the Atlantic Ocean, but there was no investigation 
because the plane was never found. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, two Americans died when their Learjet from Tennessee  
inexplicably bypassed its Texas destination and crashed into a 
mountain in Mexico. Pilots in an F-16 and another plane tried to 
contact the Learjet's pilot after it climbed above 40,000 feet but 
got no response. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before sundown Wednesday, investigators found the cockpit  
voice recorder in the wreckage of Stewart's plane. It has a 
30-minute tape loop that usually records over itself, and officials 
do not expect to hear anything from when the plane veered off 
course and radio contact was lost, because that happened hours 
before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the tape could have picked up cockpit sounds, such as  
the rush of air or the whine of the engines, that would help 
determine what was happening at the end of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking for unusual noises that may indicate some kind  
of breach of the hull of the airplane,'' Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon said the recorder was being flown to NTSB offices in  
Washington on Thursday, and a preliminary analysis of the tape 
would be done overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	About two dozen workers in blue, yellow and white plastic  
coveralls, picked through the wreckage in the pasture Thursday in 
search of parts not more than a couple of inches across. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, investigators will sort through the plane debris in a  
hangar at the nearby Aberdeen airport. If any key pieces are 
missing, metal detectors might be used to search the crash site 
again, Benzon said.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Even now, a year later, ``The Leap'' still amazes Illinois coach  
Ron Turner. 
</P>
<P>
	The reference is to the play in which Penn State linebacker  
LaVar Arrington hurdled over Illinois' offensive line, looking like 
a seventh-grader playing leapfrog with a bunch of kindergartners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll remember that when I'm 85,'' Turner said. ``I've never  
seen a play like it. The guy was like Superman. He timed the snap 
count perfectly and he came flying through the air. He'll be around 
a long time on Sundays. I just wish he was playing on Sundays this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, coach, but Arrington still is terrorizing the Big Ten.  
And on Saturday, he and the No. 2 Nittany Lions are coming to 
Champaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for one play, Penn State's 27-0 victory over the Illini  
last year was entirely forgettable. But that one play is something 
people will talk about for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	With Illinois facing fourth-and-1 at the Penn State 31,  
Arrington timed the snap perfectly, flew over the center and landed 
right on top of fullback Elmer Hickman just as he got the handoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'What the (heck) was that? Where did he come from?' ''  
Turner said. ``It was a phenomenal play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It made every highlight reel and brought the then-sophomore  
national recognition. Suddenly, he wasn't just another player in a 
white helmet and black shoes. He was possibly the best linebacker 
ever to come out of ``Linebacker U.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But ask Arrington about ``The Leap,'' and he's not that  
impressed. He said there's more to his game than just leaps and 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever you do something out of the ordinary, a lot of things  
happen that are overlooked,'' he said. ``People would rather be 
entertained. People would rather see you jump over the line than 
read the play and analyze it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington's on-field antics have gotten much attention this  
year, particularly his not-so-warm-and-fuzzy treatment of opposing 
punters. Against Pittsburgh, he got two personal fouls on a single 
play for slapping around punter Greg DeBolt. After knocking DeBolt 
to the ground, he kicked DeBolt and punched him. Then, with two 
referees watching, he gave DeBolt another shove. 
</P>
<P>
	The next week, he and Miami punter Andy Crosland got into a  
shoving match on the Hurricanes' first series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the feeling he doesn't like punters much,'' Turner said.  
``So we'll get Steve (Fitts) to behave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Arrington's done a lot more than just pick on punters.  
Against Pittsburgh game, he picked off a pass, knocked down another 
one and blocked a 52-yard field goal attempt with four seconds left 
to preserve a victory. Last weekend against Purdue, he sacked Drew 
Brees and caused a fumble, which he picked up and returned two 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	And in his vote for his favorite Arrington moment, he blocked a  
37-yard field goal against the Boilermakers. He shot into the air 
as the kick went off, leaping so high he blocked the ball with his 
chest as he fell back to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of athletic ability,'' he said, ``that was my  
greatest display of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Saturday, No. 1 Florida State is at Virginia, No.  
3 Virginia Tech at Pittsburgh, South Carolina at No. 4 Tennessee, 
No. 10 Georgia at No. 5 Florida, Baylor at No. 6 Kansas State, 
North Carolina State at No. 7 Georgia Tech, No. 8 Nebraska at 
Kansas, No. 11 Wisconsin at Northwestern, No. 12 Texas at Iowa 
State, Northern Illinois at No. 13 Marshall, and No. 20 Southern 
Mississippi at No. 14 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, No. 15 Michigan at Indiana, Air Force at No. 16 Brigham  
Young, No. 17 East Carolina at Houston, No. 18 Purdue at Minnesota, 
Iowa at No. 21 Ohio State, Oklahoma State at No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M, West 
Virginia at No. 23 Miami, No. 24 Oklahoma at Colorado, and No. 25 
Mississippi at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 9 Mississippi State and No. 19 Michigan State are idle.  
</P>
<P>
	The game between Georgia (6-1) and Florida (6-1) is one of only  
two matchups pitting Top 25 against each another. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Spurrier is going for his 100th victory as Florida's  
coach. Florida has won eight of the last nine matchups in a series 
Georgia dominated until the 1990s. The winner of this game will 
take the Southeastern Conference East lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The other game between two Top 25 teams features Southern  
Mississippi (5-2) and Alabama (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama is trying to rebound from a tough loss to Tennessee and  
might go into the game without its two best players. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisman hopeful running back Shaun Alexander and quarterback  
Andrew Zow each finished the game with sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaun and Andrew are better, but both are very doubtful at  
this point,'' Alabama coach Mike DuBose said. ``If things stay the 
way they are, they won't start Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (8-0) comes off a three-point victory over Clemson  
in which Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden won his 300th career game 
against his son, Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State can clinch at least a share of its eighth straight  
ACC title with a victory over Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles have the ACC's top defense against the run and  
will try to stop 1,109-yard rusher Thomas Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a better running back in college football than  
him,'' Bowden said of Jones.

<HEADLINE> Gore Lumps Bradley, Bush Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Sharpening his attack, Vice President Al  
Gore lumped Bill Bradley and George W. Bush together Thursday, 
saying both would return the United States to deficit spending. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after a Democratic debate in New Hampshire, Gore compared  
Bradley's health plan to the Texas governor's tax-cut package, 
which Gore said would destroy the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the Bradley campaign and the Bush campaign have had  
serious problems with fiscal responsibility,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding on an attack he launched Wednesday, Gore said either  
Bradley's health plan or ``the Republicans' risky tax scheme'' 
would ``put us right back into deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be a big idea, but it's not a good idea,'' said Gore.  
``Alchemy was a big idea, but it wasn't a good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Bradley pointedly noted that Gore  
has yet to detail the costs of most of his own proposals. ``I think 
it's important to do that if you're going to be honest with the 
American public,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore additionally warned that Bradley's proposal to help seniors  
pay for prescription drugs is inadequate, and would force the 
elderly to pay up to $800 in premiums and deductibles before 
getting any help. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley would impose no upper limit on help for seniors with  
catastrophic or chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's Medicare plan would, in exchange for a $24 monthly  
premium, would pay half of all prescription costs up to a total of 
$2,000 a year, for a maximum government subsidy of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore met with about 200 at a senior community center.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters afterward if he sensed vulnerability, he  
declined to answer directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Medicare is a huge issue,'' said Gore. ``I think most  
people assume that serious campaigns will treat it with care.''

<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser replied that the Medicare Trust  
Fund ``is in better shape than it has been recently and we're going 
to continue to make sure that's the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hauser also noted that Bradley has proposed improving Medicare  
with coverage of social services such as housekeeping that can keep 
seniors out of expensive nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradley has closed the gap in polls in key early states like  
Iowa and New Hampshire, Gore has become more aggressive in 
challenging him. The initial town meeting in New Hampshire saw Gore 
focus heavily on his criticism of Bradley health care proposal and 
the threat he sees it causing to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the kind of issue that ought to be debated in a  
presidential campaign,'' said Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of Gore's argument is that the looming retirement of  
the Baby Boom generation means more money will be needed for 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue resonate well in Iowa, where precinct caucuses next  
January launch the nominating season. It is the third oldest state 
in the nation, and Gore was questioned closely about the issue 
during Thursday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown Gore with a lead in the state, but Bradley has  
moved within striking distance.

<HEADLINE> Anxiety Gnaws at Hurricane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Ever since Hurricane Floyd's ruinous  
floodwaters rolled through, Mary Tyson has had trouble sleeping. 
Joe Tyson finds other people are constantly picking fights. Ruby 
Best's children recoil from the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter says, `Momma, I don't want to go home again.' I  
tell her, `Baby, we've got to get a home to go to first,''' said 
Ms. Best, whose children associate the rain with the night they had 
to flee their Princeville home. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd did more than destroy homes, communities and livelihoods.  
It has damaged psyches. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross sent 244 mental health workers to eastern  
North Carolina -- more than it has dispatched to any other disaster 
except for the Oklahoma bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross counselors are seeing people suffering from anxiety,  
stomach problems, frequent illnesses and nightmares. Some flood 
victims are turning to alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are normal people having a normal reaction to an  
abnormal situation,'' said Dorothy Corless, assistant operations 
officer for the Red Cross mental health effort in eastern North 
Carolina. ``We see a risk of spouse, child and pet abuse, because 
people are frustrated, and no way are they ready to deal with 
something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which drenched the region with up to 20 inches of rain,  
was by far the worst of three hurricanes and a tropical weather 
system that besieged eastern North Carolina in September and 
October. More than 15,000 homes remain uninhabitable. Recovery is 
expected to take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Corless, who has no figures on how many people have received  
counseling from the Red Cross, said the ``roller-coaster effect'' 
of recovery and then another crisis has been worse than a single, 
drawn-out disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to help people get refocused and think about  
what they can do today,'' Red Cross counselor Gordon Drummond said. 
But ``around every corner there's another corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tyson, whose Princeville home was flooded, said worry has  
deprived her of the most elemental of comforts -- sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sleep? You just lay there thinking about how you're going to  
replace what you've lost,'' she said. ``Then you hear somebody is 
giving away some help, or a little money, and you worry you won't 
get there in time to get anything. There's people getting up at 
12:30 at night to get to where they're giving away things, sleeping 
there, so they can try to get a little something. It's pitiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband, Joe, said his acquaintances have turned testy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It don't take nothing for somebody to want to fight you now,''  
he said. ``You just say something, and people want to fight you. 
Folks is just under so much stress now they can hardly make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Charlie Albertson of Duplin County, where thousands  
of hogs and poultry drowned and waste lagoons were swamped, said: 
``Some are just taking it so calm, it's amazing. And others are 
just so angry. They're angry about everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond's center, which serves eight counties, had 3,223  
counseling cases in the first five weeks after Floyd. Counselors 
found that rural residents, despite their storied independence, 
seemed to suffer more than urban dwellers because the floods wiped 
out their safety net of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're at a hotel. I'm in a trailer. Other neighbors are in a  
shelter,'' Drummond said. ``It just adds to the stress because 
you're used to being part of a group, and suddenly that support 
isn't there.''

<HEADLINE> Former MSU Coach Anderson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Former Michigan State basketball  
coach Forrest ``Forddy'' Anderson, who led the Spartans to the 
Final Four in 1957, has died. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Forrest Anderson Jr., said Anderson died Monday in  
Oklahoma City from complications of pneumonia, the Lansing State 
Journal reported today. Anderson was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson coached from 1954-65. He had a 125-124 record that  
included a tie for the Big Ten title in 1956-57 and an outright 
championship in 1958-59. He was fired in 1965 after a 5-18 season 
and a last-place finish in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson also is survived by daughters Connie Swets, Barb  
Anderson and Tracey Bookout.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Tries To Block Computer Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department wants to block  
Compuware Corp.'s acquisition of Viasoft Inc. on grounds the deal 
could result in higher prices for certain mission-critical 
mainframe computer software. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said Thursday it intends to file a lawsuit soon  
to stop the transaction, which was announced last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuware agreed to pay $9 a share to acquire the Phoenix-based  
provider of information technology management. Compuware, based in 
Farmington Hills, Mich., provides management and development 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are head-to-head competitors worldwide for mainframe  
testing and debugging software and for mainframe fault management 
software, which the government said is crucial for some mainframe 
computer users to maintain efficient operations. For some 
consumers, Viasoft is the only alternative supplier to Compuware, 
the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless this acquisition is blocked, major companies,  
governmental entities and universities will suffer the loss of 
competition, resulting in higher prices, less innovation and poorer 
service and support,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. 
Klein, head of the antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing and debugging software is used to find errors as program  
code is being written and to fix code during production in the 
event of a processing failure. Fault management software detects 
and diagnoses errors that cause processing failures, which can save 
hours of labor and downtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuware dominates both markets, but Viasoft is its closest  
competitor in testing and debugging software and is a new entrant 
in fault management software with a promising product, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuware had revenues of $1.6 billion in fiscal 1999. Viasoft  
has fiscal 1999 revenues of $104 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aides Meet With Helms Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a conciliatory gesture, White House  
officials met Thursday with Sen. Jesse Helms' staff to try to reach 
agreement on confirmation hearings for former Sen. Carol 
Moseley-Braun. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, who has said the Illinois Democrat's nomination to be  
ambassador to New Zealand was under ``an ethical cloud,'' announced 
he will hold a Foreign Relations Committee hearing as early as 
Tuesday -- and a vote the following day -- if ``relevant documents'' 
were received. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is nothing to hide in these documents, then there  
should be no reason for the White House to withhold them,'' Helms, 
R-N.C., the committee chairman, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton nominated Moseley-Braun, the nation's first  
black female senator, earlier this month. Civil rights groups and 
congressional Democrats have criticized Helms for seeking to block 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said Thursday that ``her nomination can and will be  
approved next week'' if the administration submits the documents 
and if they clear her of allegations of ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials on Wednesday pronounced Helms' request  
``unreasonable.'' But on Thursday, they were taking a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the inflated rhetoric, the fact is that staff for  
the committee and the White House have already been meeting very 
amicably in an effort to narrow substantially the request for 
information,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that can be accomplished soon and we will as quickly  
as we can provide the agreed-upon information,'' Toiv said. ``At 
that point, we will welcome a committee hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms requested an array of Internal Revenue Service and Justice  
Department documents into Moseley-Braun's background and 
allegations, never proven, that she used leftover 1992 campaign 
funds to pay for personal luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Helms was more specific on exactly what his panel  
was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee must be provided with key documents that shed  
light on why the Clinton Justice Department twice refused routine 
requests by the IRS Criminal Tax Division to have a grand jury 
investigate charges that Ms. Moseley-Braun diverted more than 
$200,000 in campaign funds for private use,'' Helms said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these included ``purchases of jewelry, luxury cars,  
designer clothes, stereo equipment, and expensive personal 
vacations to Hawaii, Africa and Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee must also be provided with the documents that  
explain exactly who paid for her three expensive visits to Nigeria 
at the invitation of the late dictator Sani Abacha,'' Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both allegations had surfaced previously, most recently as part  
of Moseley-Braun's unsuccessful 1998 re-election bid against 
Republican Peter Fitzgerald.

<HEADLINE> Intel Says Y2K, Quake No Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Intel Corp., the world's largest  
maker of computer chips, said Thursday production of its products 
this year will not be disrupted by the earthquake in Taiwan or the 
Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other large technology companies that have signaled  
profits in the current fiscal quarter will be hurt by last month's 
massive earthquake in Taiwan, Intel executives said shipments were 
on a record-setting pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies such as IBM also have said sales of its more  
profitable database servers could slow as customers cut back on 
orders to focus on the Y2K problem. Intel executives said they saw 
no signs of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see little to no Year 2000 impact on our business,'' said  
Sean Maloney, Intel's executive vice president.'' He and other 
executives, including the company's chairman and chief executive, 
spoke to analysts during a fall briefing that was broadcast on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also announced it will begin shipping the latest  
generation, super-speedy Pentium III chips running at 800 megahertz 
in the first half of the new year, followed by chips running at 1 
gigahertz in the second half of the year. Intel's current fastest 
chip operates at 733 megahertz. 
</P>
<P>
	The company last week reported operating profit rose 21 percent  
in the third quarter because of strong sales of its more profitable 
Pentium III chips, as well as soaring sales of cheaper chips. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara-based company reported Thursday that it's  
lower-priced Celeron chips now are in about 60 percent of personal 
computers in the sub-$1,000 market -- which has experienced rapid 
growth this year as consumers purchase new PCs with more processing 
power. Intel in February had less than 30 percent of the sub-$1,000 
PC market. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives also reiterated plans to push for a greater  
share of the lucrative business database server market. 
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s stock fell sharply earlier in the week after 
the company told analysts its fiscal fourth-quarter profits will be 
below expectations because of weaker-than-expected server sales.

<HEADLINE> Billboard Man Hired Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A man who posted billboards against illegal  
immigration in spots around New York City admits he hired 
undocumented workers at a Mexican restaurant he co-owned with his 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Nelson said Wednesday that he sold his stake in the  
Manhattan restaurant in January, four months before he posted his 
first billboard calling for deep cuts in legal immigration and an 
end to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
	The billboards carry messages such as, ``Because of mass  
IMMIGRATION, U.S. population will exceed half a BILLION in my 
lifetime. Help us, Congress. -- an American kid, age 6.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration advocates said Nelson paid for the billboards with  
the money he earned at a restaurant staffed by the people he wants 
to keep out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind every great anti-immigrant man, there is an  
undocumented worker,'' said Patrick Young, chairman of the New York 
Immigration Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson said relied on immigrant workers as a way to compete with  
other fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who co-owned the restaurant with his brother, Darrell  
Nelson, said he never asked employees about immigration status and 
he did not withhold taxes or offer benefits to the contract 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	An employer's admission of hiring illegal immigrants could lead  
to fines up to $10,000 per worker, Immigration and Naturalization 
Service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nelson said businesses, helped by poor enforcement of  
immigration laws, are forced to hire illegal immigrants to stay 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole country is addicted to illegal labor,'' Nelson  
said. ``It's the fault of the government for allowing it.''

<HEADLINE> N.C. Mayor Ends Proclamations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Mayor Leni Sitnick says she will no  
longer issue proclamations honoring people or groups after her 
recent recognition of pagan religions sparked protest and anger in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply saddened that a gesture of good intention to  
support religious tolerance and freedom has caused division in our 
community,'' Sitnick said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitnick last week proclaimed the week of Oct. 25 as Earth  
Religions Awareness Week -- a recognition of pagan religions, or 
Earth-centered beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics feared the event might spark students' interest in  
witchcraft and the occult. Local ministers protested and asked the 
mayor to instead designate ``Lordship of Jesus Christ Awareness 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Ballard, high priestess of a witches' circle known as  
Notre Dame del Herbe Mouillee, said she returned the proclamation 
because it caused infighting in the Christian community. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was never, never our intention,'' Ballard said. ``We just  
wanted to raise awareness that there are people in this community 
who have this particular spiritual path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitnick had planned to sign the ``Lordship'' proclamation, but  
abandoned it at the request of some local ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers said the proposed gesture was appreciated, but it  
would mean the government overstepping the constitutional boundary 
separating church and state.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Honor Payne Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Tour Championship used to be the  
end-of-the-year event for the rich to get richer. This year, it has 
become a stage to honor the memory of Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III was among those wondering why the PGA Tour didn't  
cancel the $5 million event for the top 30 on the money list, 
especially because golf was far from anyone's mind after Stewart 
died in a plane crash Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be weird this week,'' Love said. ``It doesn't  
feel right grinding it out on the range. It doesn't feel right 
laughing in the fairways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might feel hollow to win.  
</P>
<P>
	So, why play?  
</P>
<P>
	Love found that answer at Champions Golf Club on Wednesday, his  
first day on the course and his first chance to see the PGA Tour 
family since Stewart was killed in what Arnold Palmer called the 
greatest tragedy in modern-day golf. 
</P>
<P>
	The players remembered Stewart's passion and grace, his  
victories and losses, his flamboyant personality and needling humor 
from which no one was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when Love came to the conclusion that it was time to  
share the memories of the two-time U.S. Open champion with everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can shed a lot of light on Payne Stewart by playing,'' he  
said, glassy eyes staring off into the distance. ``A lot of things 
are going to remind us of Payne Stewart for a long, long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship got off to an emotional start today with a  
brief memorial service for Stewart on the first tee. A lone 
bagpiper played ``Going Home,'' about a Scottish man finally 
returning to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still in shock, 72 hours after the terrible plane crash  
took from us one of our great champions,'' PGA Tour commissioner 
Tim Finchem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every player in the Tour Championship field was at the  
service. Many of those were visibly shaken as the bagpiper played 
``Amazing Grace,'' then ``Going Home'' one more time as he walked 
back down a fairway shrouded in fog. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very emotional guy,'' said Tom Lehman, who offered a  
prayer. ``He loved to laugh and he was not ashamed to cry. I'm not 
going to be ashamed of my tears this morning, and neither should 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players hugged each other as they left the first tee. Duffy  
Waldorf, playing alone because Stewart's death left an odd number 
of players in the field, was on the putting green, preparing for 
his 8:39 a.m. tee time as the first player off. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will be the focus from the first round through the  
trophy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not playing golf, I don't know how else we can honor  
him,'' Finchem said Wednesday. ``There's not much of a forum to 
remind people about Payne. This provides us a way to tell what he 
was all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first day features 27 holes, followed by a day off to honor  
Stewart, whose memorial service will be at 11 a.m. Friday in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said a collection of private planes will take whoever  
wants to go to the service Friday morning. A larger jet has been 
chartered for players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic in 
Mississippi to go to the services. 
</P>
<P>
	That tournament also is suspending play on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Finchem said Stewart's wife, Tracey, ``was very pleased that we  
were creating a situation where the players had an opportunity to 
attend the service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear whether all 29 players from the Tour  
Championship would attend. Love said he has had trouble going to 
such services ever since his father died, and would advise players 
not to go if they didn't feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good for us to hug the guys that want to be hugged and  
cry with the guys that want to cry,'' said Love, who plans to leave 
tonight and spend time with Mark O'Meara in Orlando. ``Go ahead and 
get your grieving process started. I think that's the important 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his two U.S. Opens and the PGA Championship, memories of  
Stewart usually start with his passion for the Ryder Cup. Love was 
paired with him in the first alternate-shot match on opening day, a 
halve against Padraig Harrington and Miguel Angel Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mystified why Ben Crenshaw would ever pair me with Payne  
Stewart,'' he said. ``After four or five holes I said, `Now I know. 
You want to teach me a lesson on how to take my excitement and my 
passion and my nervousness and my desire to win, and put it into my 
game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thanked Payne twice that day for what he taught me during  
that match,'' Love said. ``I said, `I'm sorry we didn't win, but 
it's going to help me in the future.' It did. It helped me on 
Sunday (a decisive victory over Jean Van de Velde). We all will 
remember the Ryder Cup for a lot of reasons, but now I think it 
will be even more special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour Championship, the final PGA Tour event of the year, has  
a $5 million purse, with $900,000 going to the winner. Finchem said 
the $80,000 for last place would be given to Stewart's family. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the first-tee service at Champions, a service is  
scheduled tonight after the first round of the PGA Tour event in 
Mississippi. In Europe, players in the Volvo Masters in Spain said 
they would observe a moment of silence on the 18th green after 
Friday's round. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was concerned primarily with Stewart's two children,  
13-year-old Chelsea and 10-year-old Aaron, and with the families of 
the other five victims in the crash. He remembers what it was like 
to lose a father in a plane crash -- Davis Love Jr. was killed 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing I'm going to watch out for over the next few  
years is how we can help those children remember their father,'' 
Love said. ``Hopefully, we can help Aaron and Chelsea understand 
that eventually the memories of their father will be fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will still live on -- definitely in golf, but he will live  
on as a great father.''

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Sink on S. America Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures plunged lower Thursday in a wave  
of selling just before the closing bell on the Chicago Board of 
Trade, wiping out two days of gains in the last 10 minutes. Grains 
were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	Technical fund selling coupled with forecasts for weekend rains  
in South America prompted the decline, soybean traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	After dipping to their lowest level in seven weeks, soybean  
futures had been rallying for a second day on rumors that China may 
buy from 100,000 to 300,000 tons of U.S. soybeans by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures closed mostly lower, as farmer hedging negated an  
early rally on unexpectedly strong weekly export sales. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study: Climate Can Change Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a study that may sound a warning about  
global warming, researchers have found evidence that the world's 
climate can change suddenly, almost like a thermostat that clicks 
from cold to hot. 
</P>
<P>
	A new technique for analyzing gases trapped in Greenland  
glaciers shows that an ice age that gripped the Earth for thousands 
of years ended abruptly some 15,000 years ago when the average air 
temperatures soared. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a 16-degree abrupt warming at the end of the last  
ice age,'' said Jeffrey P. Severinghaus of the Scripps Institution 
of Oceanography, lead author of a study to be published Friday in 
the journal Science. ``It happened within just a couple of decades. 
The old idea was that the temperature would change over a thousand 
years. But we found it was much faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Severinghaus said the rapid rise in air temperature in Greenland  
may have been touched off by a surge in warm currents in the 
Atlantic Ocean that brought a melting trend to the vast ice sheet 
that covered the northern hemisphere. It still took hundreds of 
years for the ice to recede, but the start of the great thaw was 
much more sudden than scientists had once thought. 
</P>
<P>
	This suggests, Severinghaus said, that the Earth's climate is  
``tippy'' -- prone to be stable for long periods, but then suddenly 
change when the conditions are right. This raises a red flag of 
caution for the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that over the next 100 years the Earth will probably  
warm because of the greenhouse effect and there is a remote 
possibility that we might trigger one of these abrupt climate 
changes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts have predicted that global warming, caused by an  
increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, will be 
gradual, with temperatures smoothly rising over many decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But Severinghaus said the Greenland ice core study suggests that  
changes in the Earth's climate may not be smooth, but sudden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't really say how much carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas)  
is okay or not okay,'' he said. ``We might do well to expect 
surprises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The greenhouse effect is global warming caused by the build up  
in the atmosphere of man-made carbon dioxide and other gases that 
trap the sun's heat. The carbon dioxide rise is thought to be from 
increased burning of fossil fuels, such as gasoline and coal, and 
the rising concentration of certain gases, such as methane, that 
are linked to the industrial age.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Trading Is Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- After-hours stock trading goes mainstream Friday,  
with the first traditional exchange staying open late to compete 
with upstart electronic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the bell rings signaling the start of the inaugural  
two-hour extra session at the Chicago Stock Exchange, most 
investors are expected to be on the sidelines -- content to keep 
their activity to trading's prime time. Many apparently are heeding 
warnings of the pitfalls of delving into a more volatile market. 
</P>
<P>
	While touted as the wave of the future, after-hours trading has  
a long way to go to catch on. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move by the Chicago exchange is seen as a momentous --  
if symbolic -- step toward round-the-clock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``the beginning of a sea change,'' said Junius Peake, a  
longtime Wall Street broker and consultant, now a finance professor 
at the University of Northern Colorado. ``Finally customers are 
getting what they want, which is cheap trading, longer hours and 
... a single place where they can trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of being locked into traditional hours -- last  
expanded in 1985 to 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time -- the trading 
world has been shaken up by off-hours trading offered to 
individuals by alternative trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Several regional stock exchanges, including Chicago, offer a few  
minutes of late trading for institutional investors, such as 
pension funds. But individuals who want the protection offered by 
traditional exchanges had been left out. 
</P>
<P>
	Beating its better-known New York competitors to the punch, the  
Chicago exchange is offering trading starting at 4:30 p.m. Eastern 
time and running through 6:30. The New York Stock Exchange and 
Nasdaq Stock Market tentatively plan to open their own after-hours 
sessions next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to knock anyone's socks off'' Friday, said  
Andrew Davis, vice chairman of the downtown Chicago exchange, the 
nation's third largest behind New York and Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're a little bit early,'' he said. ``But it beats the  
hell out of being late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange officials anticipate only a handful of trades Friday  
and an estimated 1,000-2,000 daily by mid-2000. After-hours trading 
won't really take off, they expect, for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	While some 120 brokerages and dealers have the capability to  
place customers' orders with the exchange, many are sitting out for 
now, reluctant to commit extra staff and time without customer 
demand to justify the expense. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 311 most-active stocks from the NYSE, Nasdaq and the  
American Stock Exchange will be traded initially in Chicago, where 
more than 90 percent of all transactions are handled 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect investors from wide price swings that might take  
place when only a small number of people are trading, investors 
will only be allowed to buy and sell through ``limit orders.'' This 
means customers must state maximum and minimum prices at which they 
are willing to buy or sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, there are concerns about greater risks associated with  
after-hours trading until the number of players grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not for me,'' said Ted Lauder, 44, a Chicago insurance  
agent. ``Like a lot of other people, I got sucked into playing 
around with a few thousand dollars in after-hours trading. I got 
burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Markese, president of the American Association of  
Individual Investors, sees no reason for individual investors to 
indulge yet in after-hours trading, which he calls ``a different 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are more vulnerable after hours, he said, because with  
low volume and a marketplace scattered among disconnected 
electronic trading systems, it may be difficult to find the best 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get the world hooked up and communicating, it'll be a  
much broader market,'' the Chicago-based investment expert said. 
``Right now, we're not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The after-hours debut nevertheless is a coup for Chicago, which  
despite processing 65 million-70 million shares a day is still 
trying to shake its label as a regional exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional exchanges -- Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati,  
and the Pacific with dual operations in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco -- started out trading in local or regional stocks but 
increasingly offer national and international issues. 
</P>
<P>
	After-hours trading could hasten their demise or force them to  
merge, Peake said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something for everybody,'' acknowledged Chicago  
exchange chief executive Bob Forney. ``There's probably not enough 
demand to justify more than a couple of exchanges in it for the 
foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to be one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Financial Overhaul Bill Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite protests over consumer privacy,  
legislation to rewrite the financial services laws appears headed 
toward enactment by the GOP-controlled Congress and a likely 
signature by President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Top administration officials on Wednesday defended the sweeping  
measure but failed to win over liberal Democrats in the House who 
assail it as a threat to consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would lift Depression-era barriers and allow  
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. It has 
vocal opponents who are disturbed by provisions that would allow 
affiliated businesses of the newly merged companies to share 
customers' personal financial data as they offer one-stop shopping 
for loans, insurance and investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Clinton's top economic  
adviser, Gene Sperling, met with the Democrats in the House as 
several prominent liberals among them called on Clinton to veto the 
legislation. Many moderate House Democrats support it, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there will be a divided vote'' among Democrats,  
Summers said after the closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill. But he 
insisted that the legislation would protect consumers' financial 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This hard-fought compromise ... represents a very significant  
step forward for the American economy and for American consumers,'' 
Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks would not be allowed to provide customers' data to  
telemarketers under the new legislation, but would be able to share 
it with affiliated financial companies under the same corporate 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
	With the White House having lifted its long-standing veto threat  
and now supporting it, the financial overhaul measure is being 
given the best chance ever of adoption after 20 years of 
congressional battles and intense lobbying by the financial 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a leader in the fight for  
liberal House Democrats on the privacy issue, said after 
Wednesday's meeting he was not persuaded by the administration's 
defense of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no protection'' for consumers, he said. ``Their  
privacy is now for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer activists, who have complained bitterly about the  
privacy impact of the legislation, continued their criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a crying shame that the secretary of the  
Treasury is a cheerleader now for Wall Street,'' said Frank Torres, 
legislative counsel for Consumers Union. ``This bill isn't about 
helping consumers, it's about giving the industry what it wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markey and several other Democrats on Tuesday started  
circulating a letter among colleagues that urges Clinton to veto 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, conservative Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has  
broken with Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over 
the privacy issue and said he would vote against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Privacy is a pivotal issue in the transformation of the  
financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Data sharing is a major reason why financial companies want to  
merge, as it opens numerous opportunities for the companies to 
market a range of products and services. Proponents of the 
legislation maintain it will save American consumers billions of 
dollars a year by providing them more financial choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Many consumers are alarmed, however, at the prospect that their  
personal financial data could be shared and sold by companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad coalition of consumer groups, privacy advocates, the  
American Civil Liberties Union and Phyllis Schlafly's conservative 
Eagle Forum sent its own letter to Clinton on Tuesday urging his 
veto.

<HEADLINE> Mariano Rivera Is World Series MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The slender right-hander with the buggy-whip  
fastball stood on the mound. Two outs. Ninth inning. Another World 
Series to close out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no contest.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second year in a row, Mariano Rivera closed the case for  
the New York Yankees, and this time he was rewarded with the MVP 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about it,'' he said. ``I just feel tremendous to  
be there. I want to be there when this happens. I was the guy 
throwing the last pitch. And I had the last out. It feels 
tremendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees couldn't think of anyone they'd rather have in that  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``He's the best  
closer I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers support that point of view.  
</P>
<P>
	Rivera saved Game 1 of the Series, getting the last four outs in  
a 4-1 Yankees victory. He came back with two scoreless innings as 
the winning pitcher in the 6-5 victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, he came on in the eighth inning with the  
tying runs on base and retired Chipper Jones on a grounder to end 
Atlanta's last threat. Then he breezed through the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was done, Rivera had just added to an awesome postseason  
record. 
</P>
<P>
	In eight postseason appearances this October, he had two  
victories and six saves. He has not allowed a run in his last 25 
2-3 innings of postseason play, with two victories and 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera's postseason earned-run average of 0.36 -- two earned runs  
allowed in 47 1-3 innings -- is the lowest for any pitcher with at 
least 30 innings pitched in postseason history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Game 4 save extended his streak to 12 1-3 consecutive  
scoreless innings over eight games in three World Series. The last 
time he gave up a run in a Series game was the eighth inning of 
Game 3 in 1996. The Yankees beat Atlanta that night, triggering a 
record-tying streak of 12 World Series victories for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	There would seem to be an obvious connection.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the challenge,'' he said. ``I love to be in that  
situation. I guess that's my motivation. Once you're there, you 
have butterflies in your stomach. You know you're there for real. 
You just want to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was just as good in the regular season, finishing with a  
4-3 record and 1.83 ERA and converting 45 of 49 save opportunities, 
which tied his career high. He ended the regular season with a 
scoreless streak of 30 2-3 innings over 28 games and converted his 
last 22 save chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he gave up a run was July 21, more than three  
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera was the setup man for the '96 Yankees when bullpen  
partner John Wetteland saved all four Yankees victories to earn the 
MVP award of that Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``John was my teacher,'' Rivera said of Wetteland. ``We would  
sit together and spend time talking about baseball. I know I 
learned a lot from him and he learned a lot from me, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Wetteland signed as a free agent with Texas, Rivera  
inherited the closer role. The switch required a change in approach 
for Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're the setup man, you know somebody will come behind  
you,'' Rivera said. ``When you're the closer, you know there's 
nobody coming behind you. It's tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``The setup man has a net. The closer has nothing. If he falls,  
he's dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Rivera as a closer, that rarely has been a problem for the  
Yankees.

<HEADLINE> Lodge Sued in Yosemite Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A lodge that employed the handyman who  
allegedly killed three Yosemite National Park sightseers should be 
held liable for their deaths, the victims' families allege in two 
wrongful death lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of victims Carole Sund, 42, her 15-year-old  
daughter, Julie, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16, contend 
employees of The Cedar Lodge in rural Mariposa County were wrong to 
assign the women to an isolated room and failed to do a proper 
background check on former employee Cary Stayner, who has been 
charged with their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuits were filed Wednesday in Fresno County Superior  
Court. Both families seek unspecified sums for punitive and other 
damages, and reimbursement for funeral expenses and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The lodge is one of six area motels owned by Gerry Fisher and  
his family. In a short statement, their company said it had not 
seen the lawsuits and declined comment on the specific allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, 38, is named as a codefendant in the complaints, adding  
another legal layer in a case already compounded by parallel 
federal and state prosecutions and potentially thorny defense 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, who is being held at the Fresno County Jail, was  
charged last week by a state prosecutor in the three mid-February 
deaths. He is yet to be arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has pleaded innocent in the July 21 death of Yosemite  
naturalist Joie Armstrong. He will be tried in U.S. District Court 
in that case because the park falls under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are still working out how and when the cases will  
proceed. Stayner faces the death penalty in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints are similar, though the Sund complaint is more  
specific in faulting the lodge for keeping Stayner on staff, saying 
managers should have known that he acted in an ``unusual, bizarre 
or violent manner'' on prior jobs.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Debate in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By WALTER R. MEARS    	
</P>
<P>
                      *AP Special Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls discussed  
abortion, health care and taxes Thursday night in a generally 
polite campaign debate spiced by jabs directed by Steve Forbes and 
Gary Bauer at the absent front-runner, George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' Forbes said of the Texas governor, 
whom he accused of skipping campaign events to raise funds for his 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was on the receiving end on another issue, when  
conservative activist Bauer said his flat tax proposal would let 
some corporations escape taxes ``while you are paying 25 percent 
between the income tax and the payroll tax,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary you're wrong,'' Forbes rebutted, and noted proudly that  
while he was alone among GOP hopefuls in supporting a flat tax four 
years ago, others have now joined the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the most part, the five men on stage stuck to the  
issues, refraining from attacking one another. 
</P>
<P>
	Stressing his opposition to abortion, Sen. John McCain said the  
Republican Party must nevertheless reach out to voters who differ 
and ``have respectful disagreements'' -- and not a single one of his 
four rivals on the Dartmouth College stage offered any immediate 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a wealthy magazine publisher, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Bauer  
and radio commentator Alan Keyes all said the nation's health care 
system needs reforming. Each offered slightly different 
prescriptions, and none made any immediate attempt to draw 
distinctions with his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the five men shared the stage for a debate sponsored  
by CNN and WMUR-TV. It was the second such event in two nights in 
the state where the first presidential primary ballots of 2000 will 
be cast in January. Vice President Al Gore and Democratic rival 
Bill Bradley patrolled the same stage on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP event was interrupted briefly when an unidentified woman  
rose to demand a cut in military spending to benefit health care 
and education. Moderators swiftly regained control of the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	There were moments of self-deprecating humor: McCain, asked a  
question about legalizing marijuana, said: ``Thank you, that is an 
excellent question, which I would prefer to duck.'' He didn't, 
explaining his opposition to legalization of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage before the television cameras began rolling, the  
candidates fielded questions from the audience on gay rights and 
China. Bauer, a conservative activist, used the pre-debate to get 
the first jab at Bush, calling him ``the absent governor from 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the subject midway through the debate when he  
referred again to the governor's decision to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who emphasized his signature issue of campaign finance  
during the evening, has emerged as Bush's closest rival in the 
polls, particularly in the wake of Elizabeth Dole's recent 
withdrawal from the race. Curiously, though, Forbes and Bauer 
ignored him in favor of jabbing at the absent Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the GOP front-runner by far, decided in advance not to  
attend. But he made his presence felt, granting an interview to the 
Manchester television station two hours before the camera was 
switched on for the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with his wife, Laura, Bush said he knows the forum is  
important, but that his family comes first and it is more important 
to him to be at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she 
was being honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New  
Hampshire will recognize that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he'll campaign in New Hampshire next week. ``At every  
stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for America and it 
seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept my vision and 
want me to be the nominee,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has agreed to participate in the next GOP debate, in  
Manchester on Dec. 2. ``I'm looking forward to participating,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' Forbes said, campaigning at a diner in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a week the Republicans have debated  
without Bush. There were no breakthrough moments and no sharp 
disputes in the debate last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is bankrolling his own campaign, said Bush will  
suffer for his absence now. ``The people of New Hampshire will say 
this just doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that Forbes has been selling shares  
in the financial magazine that bears his name to raise money for 
his presidential bid. Forbes said he is not breaching campaign 
finance laws, but would not disclose the price people are paying. 
Bauer demanded that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain got a head start with a stop in Hanover on Wednesday,  
drawing a crowd at a news conference in the lull before the first 
Democratic debate, between Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will accept every invitation that there is to debate, and I  
would hope that Gov. Bush will change his strategy so that people 
can observe all of us in candidate forums,'' the Arizona senator 
said. He said New Hampshire voters expect and deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had said he wouldn't participate until next year because  
people are not yet paying attention to the campaign. But with signs 
that might backfire in New Hampshire, he changed his mind and 
accepted the December date. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes scoffed at his explanation for skipping this one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Blah, blah, blah, blah,'' Forbes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in New Hampshire last Friday, but left for a  
fund-raising event in Vermont before the first of the 
five-candidate debates.

<HEADLINE> Help Wanted Ads Reach Two-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major  
U.S. newspapers fell to a two-year low in September, the Conference 
Board reported Thursday, but predicted the labor market will remain 
strong and the unemployment rate will fall further as the new 
millennium begins. 
</P>
<P>
	The business-financed research organization said its Help-Wanted  
Advertising index fell to 83 in September from 87 in August and 85 
in both June and July. The last time the index was lower was in May 
of 1997, when it reached 82.	   The index is used as a gauge of changes in job supply. It is 
watched by economists as an indicator of labor market conditions to 
help form estimates of unemployment rates. 
</P>
<P>
	While the pace of hiring is a little lower, ``there is little  
evidence that the labor market will lose steam as the new 
millennium gets under way,'' said Ken Goldstein, chief economist 
for the Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The unemployment rate, already at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent,  
will fall to 4 percent, possibly even lower by early 2000, for the 
first time since 1970, Goldstein predicted, saying other indicators 
of economic activity seem to point to more economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``These conditions will not prevail in perpetuity. But expecting  
the national labor market to stall out now, while consumption, 
investment, construction and home and car buying remain so strong, 
is not a bet likely to pay off,'' he said in a statement releasing 
the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted help-wanted index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
unemployment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	From July through September, help-wanted advertising fell in  
four separate regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The steepest decline took place in the South Atlantic region --  
Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte, N.C.; Miami and Jacksonville in 
Florida; Richmond, Va.; and Washington, D.C., down 8.4 percent. 
Advertising fell 5.5 percent in the Middle Atlantic region, 
including New York and Pennsylvania; declined 3.5 percent in the 
East North Central region, including Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, 
Indiana and Wisconsin; and was down 3.3 percent in the Mountain 
region, which includes Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases occurred in the Pacific region, which includes, Los  
Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento and San Bernardino, 
Calif., and Seattle, up 3 percent; the New England region, 
including Boston, Hartford, Conn., and Providence, R.I., up 2.8 
percent; the West South Central region, including Dallas, Houston, 
San Antonio, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, Okla., up 1.3 
percent; and the West North Central region, which includes Kansas 
City, Mo., Minneapolis, Omaha, Neb., and St. Louis, up 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unchanged in the East South Central region, which  
includes Birmingham, Ala.; Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville in 
Tennessee; and Louisville, Ky.

<HEADLINE> Republicans To Debate, Chase Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican rivals for the White House  
warmed up for a campaign debate Thursday night, with Sen. John 
McCain trying to use the forum for headway against the absent 
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush. While he is the closest 
challenger, McCain said he doesn't discount the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, conservative activist Gary Bauer, radio  
commentator Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch are getting single 
digit ratings in the New Hampshire public opinion polls. But McCain 
said he was, too, not long ago. ``I take them all seriously,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush is the candidate to catch. McCain is offering to  
accept any and all debate invitations, and seeking in this one to 
add to what he describes as increasing traction for the Feb. 1 New 
Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is encouraged by the polls that show him edging up,  
behind Bush by margins of 12 to 16 percentage points, since 
Elizabeth Dole dropped from the GOP contest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor was appearing in a pre-debate interview on  
WMUR, the New Hampshire station televising the GOP candidate forum. 
CNN is carrying it nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' Forbes said, campaigning at a diner in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a week the Republicans have debated  
without Bush. There were no breakthrough moments and no sharp 
disputes in the debate last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has agreed to a debate in Manchester on Dec. 2, and issued  
a statement on Thursday saying ``I'm looking forward to 
participating ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is bankrolling his own campaign, said Bush will  
suffer for his absence now. ``The people of New Hampshire will say 
this just doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that Forbes has been selling shares  
in the financial magazine that bears his name to raise money for 
his presidential bid. Forbes said he is not breaching campaign 
finance laws, but would not disclose the price people are paying. 
Bauer demanded that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain got a head start with a stop in Hanover on Wednesday,  
drawing a crowd at a news conference in the lull before the first 
Democratic debate, between Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will accept every invitation that there is to debate, and I  
would hope that Gov. Bush will change his strategy so that people 
can observe all of us in candidate forums,'' the Arizona senator 
said. He said New Hampshire voters expect and deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had said he wouldn't participate until next year because  
people are not yet paying attention to the campaign. But with signs 
that might backfire in New Hampshire, he changed his mind and 
accepted the December date. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he couldn't make this one because he has to be in  
Dallas, where his wife is being honored by Southern Methodist 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blah, blah, blah, blah,'' Forbes said of that explanation.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in New Hampshire last Friday, but left for a  
fund-raising event in Vermont before the first of the 
five-candidate debates.

<HEADLINE> Canucks' Ohlund's Vision Is Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Although medical reports on  
his progress remain positive, Vancouver Canucks defenseman Mattias 
Ohlund continues to have limited vision in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters for the first time Thursday since being  
hit in the eye with a puck in during a preseason game in Ottawa 
last month, Ohlund held his hand about six inches from his face 
saying that that was the extent of his vision on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see a little bit. But I don't see really. It's not a big  
help for me,'' said Ohlund, considered the Canucks best all-around 
defenseman. ``I just have to wait until it comes back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Originally expected to miss 10 to 14 days after suffering the  
injury Sept. 21, Ohlund is not sure when he will be able to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to speculate,'' Ohlund said. ``(The doctors) feel  
positive about the whole thing. I do so, too. It's improving and as 
long as it's improving, you know ... I'm sure it's going to come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing no one appears to know is whether Ohlund will regain  
full sight in the eye, which remains puffy and red. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I'm going to get 100 percent back, but I'm  
going to get it back,'' said Ohlund, who was drafted 13th overall 
in 1994 and was preparing for his third NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred when an Ottawa player's shot deflected off  
the stick of Vancouver's Dave Scatchard and struck Ohlund across 
the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he will consider wearing a visor upon his return,  
Ohlund smiled and said, ``I don't know yet. I'm pretty sure my mom 
will force me to wear one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While concerned, the Canucks are buoyed by the medical reports  
indicating Ohlund's regaining his vision at a gradual pace, and as 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's continuing to improve, so that's a positive side of it,''  
said Canucks coach Marc Crawford. ``I think for Matty, he's the guy 
that's the most scared about this because it's happening to him. 
... All we can do is really rely on what Matty's saying and what 
the doctors are saying, and they're telling us that it's 
progressing and progressing in the way that they thought it would. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been slow. But the positive side is that it's been  
improved every time that it's been tested.''

<HEADLINE> EToys' Earnings Top Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Online retailer eToys reported  
Thursday that its sales and customer base soared during the second 
quarter as the company expanded operations beyond toy sales, 
widening its losses. 
</P>
<P>
	EToys lost $32 million, or 27 cents per share, on sales of $13.3  
million. The results compared to a loss of $3.2 million, or 4 cents 
per share, or sales of $600,000 in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings beat the 28-cent-per-share loss forecast by  
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Customer accounts totaled 611,000 when the quarter ended Sept.  
30, up more than 1,000 percent from a year ago. Repeat customer 
orders accounted for 42 percent of orders during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months eToys has expanded beyond toys to include sales  
of children's books, movie and music videos, software and other 
products as it gears up to compete with other online vendors 
including Amazon.com and Toys R Us.com. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, eToys bought BabyCenter Inc., which operates a Web site  
that sells products for expectant parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, eToys launched a retail Web site in the  
United Kingdom, its first international expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly results were announced after the close of regular  
trading. EToys shares fell $2.56 1/4, or 3.5 percent, to close at 
$70.62 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Thursday. The shares rose to 
$72 in after-hours trading.

<HEADLINE> Mike Isom Out As Cent. Ark. Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONWAY, Ark. (AP) -- Mike Isom will step down as head football  
coach at the University of Central Arkansas after the Bears' final 
game Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Isom, 51, will be assigned to other duties at the school,  
although the job ``likely will be outside athletics,'' said John 
Smith, vice president for financial and administrative services 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Isom told him of his decision this week and made his  
request formally in a letter today, which did not provide a reason 
for the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me he made his decision now to give the university an  
opportunity to secure a replacement quickly enough so that 
recruiting would not suffer,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears are 2-5 this season with three games remaining.  
</P>
<P>
	Isom became head coach in 1990 after serving as defensive  
coordinator for eight years under coach Harold Horton. Isom's 
coaching record going into this season was 65-32-4. 
</P>
<P>
	UCA won the NAIA national championship in 1991 and made the  
playoffs each of the following two years. During that time, Isom 
was named NAIA national coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears switched from the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference  
to the Gulf South Conference in 1993 and had a winning record each 
season until last year, when they finished 5-5.

<HEADLINE> Magaw Stepping Down From ATF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Magaw, head of the Treasury Department's  
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, submitted his resignation 
Thursday. Magaw was involved in several high-profile investigations 
including the Oklahoma City bombing, the crash of TWA flight 800 
and the bombing at the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Magaw told Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers in his  
resignation letter that he plans to leave Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Magaw, took over in late 1993 from Stephen Higgins, who resigned  
after ATF's top leadership was criticized for its handling of the 
assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said praised Magaw's ``distinguished and versatile law  
enforcement career of 39 years has proven him to be a stellar 
leader of great integrity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started his law enforcement career as a trooper with the Ohio  
State Patrol and has held a number of posts at the U.S. Secret 
Service. Former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten named Magaw 
director of ATF in October 1993.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns on Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy has benefited in recent years  
from a significant upturn in the growth of productivity which has 
helped keep inflation under control, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan warned the Fed must be particularly alert to any  
signs that productivity gains are faltering and be ready to contain 
inflationary forces that could derail America's long period of 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to the Business Council, made up of chief executives  
from some of America's largest corporations, Greenspan did not 
directly address whether the central bank was preparing to raise 
interest rates when policy-makers meet again next month. But he 
left no doubt that Fed officials are on heightened alert. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the extra vigilance was needed in part because the U.S.  
economy was in uncharted waters with productivity -- the amount of 
output per hour of work -- accelerating in recent years after two 
decades of lagging gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said Greenspan gave no clear signal in his  
remarks about what the central bank may do next. Some noted that 
Greenspan did discuss the fact that long-term interest rates set by 
market forces have already risen this year and this increase could 
be working to slow economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This process of containment may already be significantly  
advanced,'' Greenspan said in citing the impact higher market 
interest rates could be having. 
</P>
<P>
	But other analysts said Greenspan did not seem to be closing any  
options, either in raising rates or leaving them unchanged, and 
much will likely hinge on upcoming economic reports between now and 
the November Fed meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mr. Greenspan still views the risks as tilted toward  
the upside with the potential for higher inflation still there,'' 
said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher U.S. productivity growth has allowed the Fed to let  
the economy grow at faster rates without worrying about inflation 
sparked by rising wage demands. 
</P>
<P>
	If workers are more productive, then employers can afford to pay  
them more for the increased output without being forced to raise 
product prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan linked the upturn in productivity in recent years to  
the massive amounts of spending businesses have done on new types 
of equipment and innovations to keep ahead of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``But how long can we expect this remarkable period of  
innovation to continue?'' Greenspan asked in his prepared remarks, 
copies of which were made available in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``A leveling out or decline in the growth of productivity would  
have a profound effect on the intermediate outlook should it 
occur,'' Greenspan said. ``The rate of growth of productivity 
cannot continue to increase indefinitely. At some point it must, at 
least, plateau.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When that occurs, Greenspan warned, the current tight labor  
market could quickly translate into inflation pressures if wages 
continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	``That scenario of rising cost and price pressure is one  
policy-makers have dealt with before, and the actions called for, 
while by no means easy, are readily discernible,'' Greenspan said -- 
in an obvious reference to the Fed's ability to slow economic 
growth by raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	On previous occasions, Greenspan has said the Fed is ready to  
move promptly at the first sign of accelerating price pressures to 
raise interest rates to slow economic growth to a more sustainable 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has already raised the federal funds rate, the interest  
that banks charge each other, twice this year and many economists 
believe that a third rate increase will occur when Fed 
policy-makers next meet on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan suggested that a rise this year in long-term interest  
rates, which are set by market forces, may already be working to 
slow economic growth and relieve some demand pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going forward, the Federal Reserve must monitor not only this  
response, but also the evolving capacity of our economy to meet 
higher levels of demand,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maintaining balance between these forces will be essential to  
preserving the stable price environment that has provided a firm 
foundation for this period of extraordinary innovation and progress 
in the U.S. economy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Coach Kent Signs New Deal With Ore. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- University of Oregon men's basketball coach  
Ernie Kent has signed a new four-year contract that could pay him 
more than $420,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent, in his third year, has led the Ducks to a 32-27 record in  
his first two seasons. Oregon reached the semifinals last spring in 
the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement replaces a four-year deal signed in April of 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	The new deal calls for a $40,000 increase in base pay to  
$140,000 and an additional $115,000 from radio and television 
contracts with the Oregon Sports Network and shoe and sportswear 
agreements with Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest comes from deferred compensation and benefits such as  
automobiles and club memberships.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Local News Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Money pressures may explain a ``startling'' drop  
in the amount of enterprise reporting on local TV news broadcasts, 
according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project for Excellence in Journalism said it found that  
enterprise was sharply on the decline despite clear evidence that 
viewers support stations that produce high-quality reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, issued Thursday, ranked newscasts at 59 stations in  
19 cities over two weeks earlier this year. The definition of 
enterprise included investigative stories and reports produced at a 
reporter's initiative, instead of just reactions to events. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent of the stations received a ``D'' or failing  
grade from the study for their amount of enterprise. A similar 
study last year found only a quarter of the stations with such low 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 stories on local TV news originate from police  
scanners or planned news events, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	News executives surveyed by the project said their biggest  
obstacle to quality is a lack of staff and demands on them to fill 
an expanding amount of broadcast time. Many require their reporters 
to produce at least one story a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found a clear relationship between quality and high  
ratings: stations given the lowest grades were twice as likely to 
be failing commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in television news should be quite heartened by a study  
like this because it shows that if you want to do good journalism, 
you can do well,'' said Carl Gottlieb, PEJ deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that an investment in staff is more likely to  
pay off in higher ratings than getting new technology, like news 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime news is still easily the most popular topic on local  
broadcasts, but it doesn't dominate them as it used to. The 
percentage of crime news on the broadcasts dropped from 28 percent 
last year to 22 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also found that in New York and Boston, stations  
aired their best newscasts at 6 p.m., even though they had more 
viewers at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project said the five best newscasts it found were on WFIE  
and WEHT in Evansville, Ind., WSVN and WTVJ in Miami and KRON in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project for Excellence in Journalism is affiliated with the  
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Its study was 
funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.

	The cows -- which city officials say have garnered more media  
attention for Chicago than the 1996 Democratic National Convention 
-- are a city-sponsored outdoor art exhibit that has brought 
tourists and locals into downtown Chicago by the droves. 
</P>
<P>
	The whimsical cows are fashioned in the style of Magritte and  
Miro, or outfitted with boxer shorts, skateboards, skis or other 
oddball accessories. The Construction Cow has a crane coming out of 
its back and toy construction equipment strewn around it. 
</P>
<P>
	Another cow wears big glasses like the late Chicago Cubs  
sportscaster Harry Caray. The cow also holes in it like a piece of 
Swiss cheese, a sly allusion to Caray's catchphrase ``Holy cow!'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, however, the roundup begins. Many of the cows will be  
auctioned (by Sotheby's, no less) to benefit charity. 
</P>
<P>
	But what made Chicago -- a city forever trying to shrug off a  
reputation as a cow town -- embrace the cows? Why did every cow seem 
to come with its own herd of snapshot-taking, mooing, grinning 
people? And why did people come from as far away as Australia 
(Melbourne is now planning a similar exhibit, probably with horses) 
and Japan to see them? 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a benevolent animal that's non-threatening and it  
strikes something back in early childhood. People can somehow find 
that place where they used to play,'' theorized Michael Lash, 
director of public art for the city Department of Cultural Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the mooing-out-the-window factor:  
</P>
<P>
	``The first noises you learn to make as a child are animal  
noises,'' Lash said. ``You're driving in a car and ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the next thing you know, you're paying $14,000 for the  
Gateway Cow at the Green Tie Ball, as happened in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five cows will be auctioned by Sotheby's Nov. 9, and 71  
more will be auctioned on the Internet. The rest are being kept by 
their corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cows will leave fatted coffers behind. The city says sales  
were up between 8 percent and 20 percent along the North Michigan 
Avenue shopping district over the summer, while hotels offered 
special cow packages and stores sold out of disposable cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the city believes more than 2 million extra visitors  
came downtown this summer because of the cows, and they spent an 
average of $112 each, Lash said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no clue it would be this big,'' Lash said. ``It's been  
a glorious summer.''

<HEADLINE> Spurrier Goes for 100th Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steve Spurrier is looking for his 100th victory as Florida  
coach, and fittingly, it might come against rival Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 5 Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC) and No. 10 Georgia (6-1, 4-1) face  
off Saturday with a Southeastern Conference title game berth likely 
on the line. The winner takes the lead in the SEC East. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 25 years before Spurrier became coach, Florida went 8-17  
in the rivalry. Eleven times in the history of the 95-year-old 
series, Georgia (6-1, 4-1) beat the Gators to knock them out of SEC 
title contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since he got here, everyone has said, `You have to beat  
Georgia,''' offensive lineman Cheston Blackshear said. ``That has 
carried on over the years. People put pressure on him and he put 
pressure on himself to win that game. It's because they lost it so 
many times before he got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has defeated Georgia in eight of the last nine meetings,  
but that one loss was tough to take. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators' 37-17 loss two seasons ago was Spurrier's first to  
Georgia as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurt us a lot,'' receiver Darrell Jackson said. ``We were  
getting ready for the SEC title. That loss broke all our dreams and 
hurt our hearts. We knew we were the better team and we didn't play 
like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier was part of another heartbreaking loss to Georgia, in  
1966, his senior year as Florida's quarterback. The Gators blew a 
10-3 lead and lost 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talks about it,'' longtime sports information director Norm  
Carlson said. ``And the way he is, he remembers the whole game. He 
can tell you what happened in that game from beginning to end. He 
can tell you about the second half when Georgia ran the ball down 
our throats and kept it 20 minutes. He can tell you exactly how 
they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier, 99-19-1 at Florida, said backup quarterback Jesse  
Palmer needs to be ready to replace Doug Johnson in case Johnson 
falters. Johnson and Spurrier have been at odds seemingly all 
season over the quarterback's decision-making skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to quit getting so upset at some things that  
happen,'' Spurrier said. ``And we've got to go back to coaching the 
way we've always coached since I've been here. That is, if one guy 
is struggling, you put another guy in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Georgia, a victory could put some of the doubts about  
Georgia's high ranking to rest. It would also give the Bulldogs 
something overwhelmingly positive to judge the season by -- a 
victory over their biggest rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another game, but it's a more special game this week,''  
Georgia tackle Jonas Jennings said. ``The mighty Gators have the 
big name. We need this game to be considered contenders in the SEC 
or for a big bowl. We all know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game between Georgia and Florida is one of only two matchups  
pairing Top 25 teams against each another. The other features No. 
20 Southern Mississippi at No. 14 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Saturday, No. 1 Florida State is at Virginia, No.  
2 Penn State is at Illinois; No. 3 Virginia Tech at Pittsburgh, 
South Carolina at No. 4 Tennessee, Baylor at No. 6 Kansas State, 
North Carolina State at No. 7 Georgia Tech, No. 8 Nebraska at 
Kansas, No. 11 Wisconsin at Northwestern, No. 12 Texas at Iowa 
State, and Northern Illinois at No. 13 Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, No. 15 Michigan at Indiana, Air Force at No. 16 Brigham  
Young, No. 17 East Carolina at Houston, No. 18 Purdue at Minnesota, 
Iowa at No. 21 Ohio State, Oklahoma State at No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M, West 
Virginia at No. 23 Miami, No. 24 Oklahoma at Colorado, and No. 25 
Mississippi at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 9 Mississippi State and No. 19 Michigan State are idle.  
</P>
<P>
	Alabama is trying to rebound from a tough loss to Tennessee and  
might go into the game without its two best players. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisman hopeful running back Shaun Alexander and quarterback  
Andrew Zow each finished the game with sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaun and Andrew are better, but both are very doubtful at  
this point,'' Alabama coach Mike DuBose said. ``If things stay the 
way they are, they won't start Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (8-0) comes off a three-point victory over Clemson  
in which Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden won his 300th career game 
against his son, Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State can clinch at least a share of its eighth straight  
ACC title with a victory over Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles have the ACC's top defense against the run and  
will try to stop 1,109-yard rusher Thomas Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a better running back in college football than  
him,'' Bowden said.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Theodore H. Benzinger, inventor of the ear  
thermometer and a pioneer in the field of biothermodynamics, died 
Tuesday at Maplewood retirement community in Bethesda, Md. He was 
94. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Stuttgart, Germany, Benzinger became director of  
aero-medical department of the German air force in 1934. During the 
next decade, he studied decompression and physiology in pilots and 
was a test pilot himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, Benzinger joined the U.S. Naval Medical  
Research Institute in Bethesda, where his discoveries included the 
thermodynamic quantities of biochemical reactions and the mechanism 
for measuring temperatures in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	His invention 40 years ago of a highly accurate ear thermometer,  
later modified by other researchers, made it possible to zone in on 
the ``human thermostat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benzinger held patents for a dozen inventions. He retired from  
the Naval Research Medical Institute in 1970 as director of its 
bioenergetics division but continued working at the National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology.

	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- William W. Crawley, longtime director of  
corporate communications for Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, died 
Tuesday of cancer. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	He was manager of advertising for PSO's parent company, Central  
and South West Corp., and director of PSO corporate communications. 
Crawley had been with PSO since 1983 in various roles, and had been 
director of the department since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Crawley worked for the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise and the

<P>
	YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- Karen Demirchian, the Parliament Speaker  
who was admired by many Armenians for providing a stability that 
Armenia has lacked so severely over the past decade, was killed by 
gunmen in Armenia's parliament on Wednesday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Demirchian was prominent in politics during two strongly  
contrasting periods. He was Armenia's Communist Party chief for 14 
years when it was part of the Soviet Union. He then returned to 
politics in 1998, becoming parliament speaker after losing his bid 
to become independent Armenia's president. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, he directed a semi-privatized electrical  
equipment factory. The factory stayed open even as Armenia's 
economy collapsed, and Demirchian's supporters saw that as evidence 
of business acumen. 
</P>
<P>
	Demirchian also represented stability to them: he was the  
Communist boss from 1974 to 1988, a period when life was relatively 
predictable, when pensions and wages were paid on time.

Communist Party who pushed for economic growth in the booming 
southern province of Guangdong, died Wednesday of an unspecified 
illness in Guangzhou. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Xie had been a member of the party's policy-setting Politburo  
since 1992. As the party's boss of Guangdong between 1991 and 1998, 
he pushed for rapid growth to help strengthen the province's 
position as a powerhouse of the Chinese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	After senior leader Deng Xiaoping toured the province in 1992,  
Xie told aides to draw up plans to catch up economically with Hong 
Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea within 20 years, according 
to a report at the time by the official Xinhua News Agency.

</P>
<P>
	He served for close to a decade as chairman of the parliamentary

	Two years later, Sarkisian joined the nationalist movement aimed  
at wresting the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh from 
the control of the neighboring Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> Republicans To Debate, Chase Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican rivals for the White House  
warmed up for a campaign debate Thursday night, with Sen. John 
McCain trying to use the forum for headway against the absent 
front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush. While he is the closest 
challenger, McCain said he doesn't discount the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes, conservative activist Gary Bauer, radio  
commentator Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch are getting single 
digit ratings in the New Hampshire public opinion polls. But McCain 
said he was, too, not long ago. ``I take them all seriously,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush is the candidate to catch. McCain is offering to  
accept any and all debate invitations, and seeking in this one to 
add to what he describes as increasing traction for the Feb. 1 New 
Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is encouraged by the polls that show him edging up,  
behind Bush by margins of 12 to 16 percentage points, since 
Elizabeth Dole dropped from the GOP contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours before the debate, Bush was interviewed about his  
absence on WMUR-TV, which was televising the event along with CNN. 
Appearing with his wife Laura, Bush said he knows the forum is 
important, but that his family comes first and it is more important 
to him to be at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where she 
was being honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New  
Hampshire will recognize that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said he'll campaign in New Hampshire next week. ``At every  
stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for America and it 
seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept my vision and 
want me to be the nominee,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has agreed to participate in the next GOP debate, in  
Manchester on Dec. 2. ``I'm looking forward to participating,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just underscores that one candidate thinks he can play by  
his own rules,'' Forbes said, campaigning at a diner in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a week the Republicans have debated  
without Bush. There were no breakthrough moments and no sharp 
disputes in the debate last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who is bankrolling his own campaign, said Bush will  
suffer for his absence now. ``The people of New Hampshire will say 
this just doesn't wash,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported that Forbes has been selling shares  
in the financial magazine that bears his name to raise money for 
his presidential bid. Forbes said he is not breaching campaign 
finance laws, but would not disclose the price people are paying. 
Bauer demanded that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain got a head start with a stop in Hanover on Wednesday,  
drawing a crowd at a news conference in the lull before the first 
Democratic debate, between Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will accept every invitation that there is to debate, and I  
would hope that Gov. Bush will change his strategy so that people 
can observe all of us in candidate forums,'' the Arizona senator 
said. He said New Hampshire voters expect and deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush had said he wouldn't participate until next year because  
people are not yet paying attention to the campaign. But with signs 
that might backfire in New Hampshire, he changed his mind and 
accepted the December date. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes scoffed at his explanation for skipping this one.  
</P>
<P>
	``Blah, blah, blah, blah,'' Forbes said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush was in New Hampshire last Friday, but left for a  
fund-raising event in Vermont before the first of the 
five-candidate debates.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise This Week / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 7.96 percent this week, the highest 
level since mid August. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.93 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. The average for the week ending Oct. 29 was the highest 
since the week ending Aug. 13, when the 30-year rate was at 8.15 
percent, the high for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb this year. The  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and the high of 8.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.57 percent this week, also up from the average of 7.53 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.35 percent this week, up from 6.30 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing concerns over inflation and possible Fed action  
kept interest rates on the higher side this week,'' said Robert Van 
Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending Oct. 22 
increased 3 percent from the previous week but were down 59.2 
percent compared to the same week last year.

	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- It appears that Miss America Heather Renee  
French and Lt. Gov. Steve Henry are an item. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see where the future goes with this, but I enjoy  
spending time with Steve and talking to him on various issues,''

	Augusta Mayor Wendell R. High introduced Henry as ``someone  
close to Heather's heart'' when he accompanied Miss French a few 
weeks ago to her hometown of Maysville. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty good description of where our relationship is  
right now,'' Miss French said. 
</P>

they gotten to know each other well, Henry said.

<HEADLINE> Economy Growing Faster Than Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's economic performance in the 1990s,  
not too shabby to begin with, is looking even better due to a major 
revision in government statistics released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the new calculations, economic growth has been  
stronger, inflation lower and Americans' personal savings rate, 
which had plunged into negative territory, was revised upward to a 
more respectable level. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes were released by the Commerce Department's Bureau of  
Economic Analysis as part of a twice-a-decade overhaul in the 
government's main economic statistic -- the gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
	The revisions showed that in the current eight-year-old economic  
expansion, already the longest in peacetime history, the GDP has 
been rising at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent, even better 
than the previously reported 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The upward gains were even more pronounced in the past two years  
with growth in 1998 revised up to 4.3 percent and 1997 growth 
boosted to 4.5 percent, the best showing in 14 years. Before the 
revisions, GDP growth had been put at 3.9 percent for the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and others in his administration who are  
hoping the good economy will help Vice President Al Gore in his run 
for the White House wasted no time hailing the stronger figures as 
further evidence the economy is enjoying the best of times with 
strong growth and low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Baily, the president's chief economist, told reporters at  
the White House that the new figures depicted ``a really 
extraordinary record over any period and certainly well into an 
extended boom, potentially the longest boom in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the new-found growth in the revised statistics came from  
changes in how the government totes up the various components of 
America's $9.3 trillion economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest impact came from changing the way the government  
accounts for purchases of computer software by businesses and 
government agencies. Those purchases will be treated as an 
investment that will add directly to GDP output. Previously, 
software purchases were treated as a current expense that did not 
get captured in the GDP's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1998 alone, the different treatment of computer programs  
added $160 billion to GDP, accounting for two-thirds of the 
revision for that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another classification change helped boost Americans' personal  
savings rate by including government contributions to government 
employees' pension plans. That change lifted the personal savings 
rate, which had fallen to a record low of a negative 1.3 percent, 
in the spring of this year, back into positive territory of 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the inflation front, a price measured tied to the GDP, was  
revised to show rates over the past few years of about 0.1 
percentage point lower than the already low levels. For 1998, the 
GDP price gauge rose by just 0.7 percent after an increase of just 
1.4 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists generally welcomed the various changes the government  
made in the GDP accounts, saying they corrected long-recognized 
flaws in how the GDP accounted for investments in computer programs 
and how personal savings were computed. Various analysts said that 
because the changes have pushed up total output, they should 
translate into even stronger gains in worker productivity, the key 
factor supporting rising living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never believed that consumers were not saving to the extent  
that the government numbers have said. The revisions give a more 
realistic picture of what's going on in the household sector,'' 
said Ken Mayland, economist at KeyCorp in Cleveland.

<HEADLINE> Publishing Dangers Seen in Bush Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The recent scandal over the author of a  
controversial George W. Bush biography wasn't the first involving a 
writer with a sketchy past. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not be the last, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``If someone really wants to fool you, they can. You pretty much  
take at face value that an author is who he says he is,'' Sally 
Richardson, president and publisher of St. Martin's Press, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her firm published -- then hastily withdrew -- James Howard  
Hatfield's biography of Bush, ``Fortunate Son.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After publication, it was revealed Hatfield had a criminal past.  
St. Martin's recalled all 70,000 copies of the book and suspended 
sales, shipment and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	The flap follows similar incidents at other publishing houses.  
</P>
<P>
	The German publisher Suhrkamp Verlag two weeks ago withdrew the  
hardcover version of ``Fragments'' from bookstores following 
concerns that author Binjamin Wilkomirski had fabricated his story 
of living through the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	And Atlantic Monthly Press of Grove/Atlantic Inc. last month  
canceled distribution and destroyed 7,500 copies of the new 
biography ``I Have Not Yet Begun to Fight: A Life of John Paul 
Jones,'' after author James Mackay was found to have been accused 
of plagiarism in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield's background included a 1988 conviction for hiring  
someone to plant a bomb under a co-worker's car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has a process for checking previously published authors  
to see if they are car bombers,'' said David Kaye, head of St. 
Martin's legal division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lawyers do not check authors' backgrounds. They go through the  
manuscript line by line and check the manuscript,'' Kaye said. 
``I'm not sure anyone thinks we have a way to check the 2,000 
authors we sign up every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how many car bombers there are who can write this  
well, but we are looking into all aspects of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson and Kaye both said Hatfield's credibility wasn't  
questioned because he had a reputable agent, wrote several other 
books and his manuscript passed muster with editors and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The book's most controversial material alleges that Bush, now  
Texas governor and a favorite for the Republican presidential 
nomination, was arrested in 1972 for cocaine possession but only 
did community service after his father, President Bush, intervened. 
The author cited anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush has called the allegation ``science fiction''  
and ``totally ridiculous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said Hatfield's book ``was edited fine. It went  
through a legal review fine. He had a lot of sources for lots of 
the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had Hatfield been honest about his past, the book probably would  
have gone forward, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the fact that he was lying about (his past) that raised  
our hackles,'' she said. ``It was the coverup that bothered us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield's literary agent, Richard Curtis, said agents typically  
check an author's publication credits and other materials, but not 
criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no morals clauses in any book contract that I know  
of,'' said Curtis, former president of the Association of Authors' 
Representatives. ``It's an industry based on trust and 99.999 
percent of the time it's a positive experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Wallace, the editor in chief of St. Martin's Press who  
resigned because he did not want to be associated with the Bush 
biography, said the fundamental check in the editing process should 
be between the editor and the author. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important that editors ... think a little more  
like journalists when they're looking at an author,'' said Wallace, 
who has taken a job as editorial director at Talk magazine. ``You 
have to get a strong sense that there's no conflict of interest and 
no hidden agenda.''

<HEADLINE> Metcalf In Spotlight With Panthers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Eric Metcalf has come a long way in less  
than eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut by the Baltimore Ravens Sept. 5 and left to ponder whether  
his 10-year NFL career was over, Metcalf was signed by the Carolina 
Panthers two days later. On Sunday, he'll start at wide receiver 
when the Panthers (2-4) play the Falcons (1-6) at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting the opportunity to play because of injuries, but  
the key is me making the most of it,'' Metcalf said. ``That's all I 
have to concentrate on, just playing hard every snap and trying to 
be productive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	History suggests Metcalf will do just that. He came into the  
season with 16,280 all-purpose yards, seventh on the NFL's career 
list. He has played both running back and wide receiver, and he is 
the only player in NFL history to return 11 kicks for touchdowns -- 
nine punts and two kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Metcalf, 31, admits he isn't as fast as he used to be, but he  
still has good speed. With that in mind, he wasn't ready to walk 
away from the NFL when the Ravens cut him at the end of camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have been comfortable with it because I know that I  
still have the talent to play this game,'' he said. ``I can go out 
there and do a lot of things. I've played running back. Granted, 
I'm not a running back who can carry the ball 25, 30 times a game. 
I've played receiver, too, but I don't consider myself one of the 
premier receivers in the league. But at the same time, I think that 
I do have a lot of ability. That's why I never thought about giving 
it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metcalf has spent Carolina's first six games primarily as the  
team's punt returner, averaging only 5.8 yards on 12 returns with a 
long of 27. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved up the depth chart at wide receiver when Rae Carruth  
went down Oct. 17 with a sprained left ankle. Carruth's 
replacement, Patrick Jeffers, was sidelined in last week's loss to 
Detroit by a groin pull, bumping Metcalf into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	He has caught four passes for 38 yards while familiarizing  
himself with the Panthers' offense. Metcalf said that with the 
exception of some terminology, Carolina's playbook is similar to 
what was used last year when he was with the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much the same thing,'' he said. ``It's just a matter of  
going out there and applying it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach George Seifert said he has no hesitancy about starting  
Metcalf, who is with his sixth NFL team. When he was with Atlanta 
in 1995, Metcalf set career highs of 104 receptions for 1,189 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a positive addition,'' Seifert said. ``He'll get a  
lot of exposure this week. He's done a good job with special teams 
and he's ready to fill this spot.''

<HEADLINE> Mauritania, Israel Form Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By BARRY SCHWEID    	
</P>
<P>
                        *AP Diplomatic Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over Arab and Palestinian objections,  
Mauritania made history by establishing full diplomatic relations 
with Israel on Thursday in a show of support for peacemaking in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who will take up the peace drive Monday in  
Norway with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat, said he was encouraged by their steady 
progress toward a final settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively, but they've  
but themselves on an aggressive timetable'' he said at a White 
House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both the leaders want to make peace. I believe  
they're committed to it,'' Clinton said, suggesting the two sides 
had begun ``imagining'' what a final agreement would look like. 
``They're down to the difficult issues now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oslo meetings come as the leaders mark the fourth  
anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin. Norway played an important and secret role in promoting 
talks between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Middle East peacekeeping also figured prominently at the State  
Department where Mauritania's foreign minister, Ahmed Ould sid 
Ahmed exchanged diplomatic documents with David Levy, the Israeli 
foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a sovereign decision, taken by us as a sovereign  
state,'' the Mauritanian official said after the ceremony. ``We 
hope that this decision will foster efforts to arrive at a 
solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The northwest African nation is only the third Arab country to  
have full relations with Israel. The two others are Egypt and 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cairo, Syria's ambassador to the Arab League, Issa Darwish,  
said ``it's an unparalleled precedent in Arab relations ... and a 
violation of the 1996 Arab summit resolutions'' that reject the 
normalization of relations with Israel unless major progress is 
made in the Mideast peace process. The comments were carried by 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the 22-member Arab League, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, said  
Thursday it ``is a move that doesn't come at the right time 
concerning the Arab cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian ambassador to the league, Mohammed Sobeih, said  
Mauritania's decision ``strongly shocked the Arabs and led to a 
feeling of sorrow and sadness among Arabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sobeih said Mauritania had been under external pressure to take  
the step. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel is in the midst of negotiations with the Palestinians,  
and the Clinton administration is urging Israel to give up land for 
pledges of peace to the Palestinian Authority and Syria, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, beaming as the Mauritanian and Israeli foreign  
ministers shook hands and agreed to exchange embassies, urged other 
Arab countries to take the cue. Privately, U.S. officials said the 
United States also was asking European governments to take Israel 
into their regional group at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	This would enable Israel to take a seat on the Security Council  
on a rotating basis with other nations and participate in some 
other U.N. sessions over Arab objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed, at a news conference, said his government had not decided  
whether its embassy would be placed in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. The 
decision could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the countries that have relations with Israel only Costa Rica  
and El Salvador have embassies in Jerusalem. President Clinton has 
blocked a shift of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, which would have 
bolstered Israel in its determination to keep the city as its 
eternal and undivided capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy hugged Albright. ``What Mauritania does today is very wise  
and courageous,'' he said, while also offering assurance Israel was 
seeking a settlement with the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright concurred. ``We are seeing now that the Israeli  
government wants to move forward in getting a comprehensive 
peace,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the ceremony, Albright and Levy discussed ongoing  
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and whether Israel 
and Syria are moving to open their own talks.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Prices Plunge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas prices plunged 8 percent Thursday on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange on forecasts of warmer-than-usual U.S. weather 
for early November. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures and other energy commodities also sank.  
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, gold bounced back over $300 an ounce and  
coffee yo-yoed higher on investors' expectations of drier weather 
in already-parched regions of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices, abnormally low last winter due to  
unseasonably mild weather in the northern United States, had shot 
up on expectations that this winter will be colder than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	But new six-to-10-day forecasts show that temperatures during  
the first week of November will be higher than average across most 
of the continental U.S., likely resulting in lower demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for December delivery sank 25.8 cents to $2.965 per  
million British thermal units. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, we got schnockered,'' Tim Evans, senior energy analyst  
for the Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, said of the wave of 
gas selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the selling was in sympathy to what was going on in  
the crude oil market,'' he said. ``But it was largely an 
overreaction to a bearish forecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't know how fast the market can bounce back after  
a day like this,'' the analyst added. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude tumbled 5 percent to a two-week low on the New York Merc  
after Sunoco Inc. and Tosco Corp. cut production at refiners in 
Philadelphia and New Jersey, respectively, citing poor profit 
margins on fuel sales. 
</P>
<P>
	December crude dropped by $1.24 to $21.68 a barrel, November  
heating oil fell 3.06 cents to 57.70 cents a gallon, and November 
unleaded gasoline fell 2.02 cents to 62.16 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent crude for December delivery fell  
$1.17 to $21.42 on the International Petroleum Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold rallied for a second consecutive day, regaining the  
$300-per-ounce threshold after giving back half of the astonishing 
gains of this fall's runup in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the fall to $286 earlier this week had spurred a  
round of buying by gold producers. 
</P>
<P>
	December gold rose $6.20 to $300.40.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures settled slightly higher on New York's Coffee,  
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange after rising 4 percent to just shy of $1 a 
pound amid expectations for drier weather in Brazil. Low soil 
moisture levels have exacerbated fears of damage to the 2000-01 
crop that is flowering now. 
</P>
<P>
	The market has been fluctuating wildly all month depending on  
the latest forecast for Brazil. Earlier predictions of a bumper 
crop of over 40 million bags have been replaced by expectations it 
could be in the mid-30 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	But all estimates are preliminary, and price changes are being  
driven by educated guesses. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee rose 1.05 cents to 96.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Poll Numbers on Assisted Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some poll numbers from questions about assisted suicide. When  
totals don't equal 100 percent, the remainder either didn't know or 
declined to answer. Note in the first two questions how small 
differences in question wording can result in dramatically 
different results on a sensitive topic. 

</P>
<P>
	If a person has a disease that will ultimately destroy their  
mind or body and they want to take their own life but cannot do it 
by themselves, should a doctor be allowed to administer lethal 
drugs to end the person's life or not? (CBS News -- November 1998) 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yes, 75 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	-- No, 14 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	When a person has a disease that cannot be cured and is living  
in severe pain, do you think doctors should be allowed by law to 
assist the patient to commit suicide if the patient requests it, or 
not? (Gallup/CNN/USA Today -- March 1999) 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yes, 61 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	-- No, 35 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	If a terminally ill relative or close friend asked you to help  
him or her commit suicide to end his or her suffering, do you think 
you would help him or not? (CBS News -- November 1998) 
</P>
<P>
	-- Would/probably would, 16 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Would not, 71 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Maybe, 4 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	Do you think that in 2025 physician-assisted suicide will  
generally be legal or not legal in the United States? 
(Gallup/CNN/USA Today -- September 1998) 
</P>
<P>
	-- Legal, 60 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Not legal, 39 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	Now a hypothetical question, if you personally had a disease  
that could not be cured and were living in severe pain, would you 
consider committing suicide or not? (Gallup/CNN/USA Today -- March 
1999) 
</P>
<P>
	-- Yes ... would consider suicide, 40 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	-- No ... would not, 51 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	The polls taken at various times generally have error margins of  
approximately 3 percentage points, plus or minus.

<HEADLINE> Favre Ready To Face Holmgren </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- About a month ago, Mike Holmgren and  
Brett Favre had a lengthy conversation for the first time since 
Holmgren left the Green Bay Packers for the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	They spent nearly an hour talking about their seven years  
together. The coach and his quarterback endured good times and bad, 
everything from countless shouting matches and disagreements to 
their triumph in the 1997 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I can turn him in. He was tampering. He was trying to  
work out something to get me to Seattle,'' Favre joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Who could blame either man for wanting their relationship to  
continue? 
</P>
<P>
	Favre admits he wouldn't be the game's most feared quarterback  
without Holmgren's guidance through his development. Likewise, 
Holmgren admits he wouldn't have had some of his coaching success 
without the estimable talents of the three-time Most Valuable 
Player. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre and Holmgren meet as foes for the first time Monday night,  
when the Seahawks visit Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he has the physical tools that no one can match right  
now in the game,'' Holmgren said. ``Beyond that, he's become a very 
smart quarterback. You can see that in the way he's played this 
year. He's become one of the smartest quarterbacks ... ever to play 
the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though they rose to prominence together, their parting in  
January wasn't entirely sad. In particular, Favre felt he had 
reached a point in his career where he wanted to show what he could 
do without Holmgren's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over time, I listened to him and became a smarter  
quarterback,'' Favre said. ``Now, I think I'm able to leave out 
from under his wing and go on my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre and Holmgren arrived in Green Bay in 1992, Favre from  
Atlanta and Holmgren from San Francisco. Favre was an almost 
completely undisciplined quarterback with a phenomenal arm, 
Holmgren a career assistant given the task of rebuilding a team 
that hadn't scared opponents in years. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren made Favre his starter right away, saying, ``We're  
going to win or lose with you,'' Favre recalled. For seven years, 
they worked side by side as Holmgren called the plays and Favre ran 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	While dozens of offensively gifted assistants like Steve  
Mariucci, Jon Gruden and Andy Reid shuttled in and out of Lambeau 
Field, Holmgren and Favre were constants. They studied film, 
practiced and argued over Favre's play and Holmgren's play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first couple of years, now that I look back, I don't know  
how I made it,'' Favre said. ``I never stopped to think of what was 
going on. He would talk to me, and it was in one ear and out the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	``But over time, I kind of started believing in what he was  
saying and knowing that he was right. I did start becoming more of 
the quarterback he wanted me to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterbacks like the young Favre -- with dizzying physical gifts  
and considerably less acumen -- enter the league every year, and 
most disappear. From Todd Marinovich to Ryan Leaf, the list of 
could-have-beens is long and infamous. 
</P>
<P>
	But Favre had Holmgren and, make no mistake, Holmgren had Favre.  
The West Coast offense he teaches relies on a smart, strong 
quarterback, something Favre eventually became. With another 
signal-caller, who knows if Holmgren would be known as an offensive 
genius now? 
</P>
<P>
	Favre realized their relationship had reached its zenith with  
the Super Bowl victory, which also coincided with the best season 
of Favre's career. After that, Favre said he needed room to grow 
outside of Holmgren's strict offense and control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got to a point where I had to make decisions on my own and  
to please myself, but I still had to do it the way he wanted,'' 
Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a rocky 1998 season that ended with a first-round playoff  
loss, Favre had little public comment when Holmgren accepted 
Seattle's offer to become executive vice president, general manager 
and coach. Some thought there were unresolved issues between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no hard feelings towards Mike, and I would hope that he  
had none towards me,'' Favre said. ``I don't think anyone should 
ever be mad at a person for wanting to move up. That's been a goal 
of his for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that doesn't mean I won't love to beat him on Monday  
night.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Skip Over Some Realities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore bragged -- twice -- about obeying the  
campaign finance laws. Bill Bradley spoke of costly programs that 
have analysts wondering how he can ever pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first debate, the two rivals for the Democratic  
presidential nomination appeared to avoid major misstatements of 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they let loose with some rhetorical excesses and  
skipped over an uncomfortable reality or two. 
</P>
<P>
	On money and politics, Gore declared ``I follow a higher  
standard in my campaign'' and as an example of that said ``I 
strictly abide by the $1,000 contribution limit,'' the most an 
individual can give. He said twice he won't go over the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a good reason to do that,'' observed Kathleen  
Jamieson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School 
of Communication. ``That's the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ordinarily don't say, 'Yes, I drive on the right side of  
the street -- congratulate me,''' said Jamieson, who is tracking the 
candidates on issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also did not mention the controversy he got into over  
political money-raising in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Bradley projected ``enormous savings'' in  
administrative costs from his $65-billion-a-year health care plan -- 
savings he may be hard-pressed to find. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated administrative costs in health care at $250 billion  
a year. Bradley has used the figure before -- in a Sept. 28 health 
care speech, but said then that the $250 billion included more than 
just administrative overhead, such as redundant tests and 
unnecessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implication that there is a lot of that to save is one  
that is questionable,'' Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health reformers often talk of saving money by cutting waste,  
she said. ``But when people start looking at that, they don't find 
(that much) waste, fraud and abuse to eliminate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore made much of forecasts that Bradley's big programs -- among  
them, $10 billion to fight child poverty, more than $2 billion for 
working families and $5 billion for struggling farmers -- could eat 
up the budget surplus and more. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Gore's programs so far may not be as expensive, he has  
been slower to spell out what those costs might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore attacked Bradley for supporting school vouchers that would  
use tax money to send children to private schools. ``That's one 
area where we disagree,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bradley has not endorsed school vouchers. He says he doesn't  
think they are the answer to the problems of public education, but 
is awaiting results from a few experimental programs. He had voted 
in the Senate for some pilot voucher programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also used an Emory University report to suggest Bradley has  
underestimated the costs of his health plan. Gore said the report 
showed Bradley's plan over 10 years would cost closer to $1.2 
trillion and soak up the entire projected federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not mention that the study was written by a former  
Clinton administration health-policy analyst, Kenneth Thorpe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he had his own analysts who put the costs of his  
plan much lower. 
</P>
<P>
	After the last election, Gore was forced to admit that he had  
made fund-raising calls from his White House office despite federal 
laws barring fund-raising on federal property. He said his lawyers 
had advised him there was no illegality in his calls but said in 
hindsight he wished he hadn't made them. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also belatedly acknowledged that he knew an event he  
attended at a Buddhist temple was a fund-raiser. He originally 
tried to portray it as a ``community outreach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors concluded that donations made at the event were  
illegal, but Gore was accused of no wrongdoing in either the temple 
event or the fund-raising calls.

<HEADLINE> Carolina Hurricanes' New Arena Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hockey's nomads finally have a home.  
</P>
<P>
	After two years of playing ``home'' games at the Greensboro  
Coliseum 80 miles down Interstate 40 and starting this season with 
an NHL record-tying nine-game road trip, the Carolina Hurricanes 
will open the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a strange feeling,'' defenseman Glen Wesley  
said about playing in the team's new 18,700-seat arena. ``You can 
probably go all the way back to Hartford to where we felt like we 
had a home -- until we found out we were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been tough sleeping at night because you are so excited  
about coming down to the new rink and seeing the new things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Hartford Whalers left Connecticut for North Carolina  
following the 1996-97 season, but construction delays in the new 
building forced the team to play two years in Greensboro, where it 
was last in the NHL in attendance both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of times during that I-40 drive you wondered if the  
end would ever come,'' center Jeff O'Neill said of the 160-mile 
round trip for each home game. ``But we saw the light at the end of 
the tunnel and we stuck together as a team. Since I came into the 
league they have been talking about the Whalers moving and for me 
this is the end result. I've finally got a home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's home opener against the New Jersey Devils is sold out,  
not a very common occurrence for the Hurricanes. The team sold out 
only four games last season in Greensboro, where the coliseum had a 
black curtain lowered in the upper deck to hide empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain what the guys have quietly put up with over  
the last two years,'' coach Paul Maurice said. ``We didn't get a 
lot of complaining out of our locker room about the circumstances 
and I'm happiest for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's solid 4-2-3 start during the season-opening nine-game  
road trip and the opening of the new arena has created somewhat of 
a hockey buzz throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice and the players hope the sport can catch on and give the  
team a home-ice advantage, something that was missing the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost a quarter of the way into our road schedule, now  
we have to make hay at home,'' said Maurice, whose team has 11 home 
dates in November. ``That will be a big test for us Friday. Are we 
going to be able to keep our emotions in check enough to play our 
game and not open it up too much and try to put on too big a 
show?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having 11,000 seats in the arena's lower bowl could make the new  
place rather loud, Maurice said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect it to be loud just based on the fans that we had  
last year and how loud they were,'' Maurice said. ``They came to 
yell and scream. There are some places that are like libraries 
around the league ... and that works against the home team. This 
building doesn't have any of those characteristics. They've done a 
great job with the slant of the lower bowl.''

<HEADLINE> MIT Frat Punished for Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two MIT fraternities are in trouble, with one  
losing its dormitory license and members of another facing possible 
criminal charges over a Halloween prank gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Licensing Board on Thursday gave residents of the  
off-campus Sigma Alpha Epsilon house until Nov. 15 to find new 
lodging. The fraternity is accused of serving alcohol to an 
underage Wellesley College student. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to be told they aren't children anymore,'' said  
chairman Daniel Pokaski. ``I don't think they even have a clue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a party at Sigma Alpha, fraternity members drove a  
group of women back to Wellesley on Sept. 3 and dropped the 
intoxicated student off at a hospital. She was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Licensing Board revoked the dorm license of  
another Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternity, Phi Gamma 
Delta, after an 18-year-old freshman, Scott Krueger, drank himself 
into a coma and died. The fraternity eventually disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Sigma Alpha lawyer Carl King said the fraternity was  
disappointed by the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	MIT campus police also said Thursday they were seeking charges  
against three students and one alumnus after a classroom prank 
exploded Tuesday. The incident involved members of the Phi Kappa 
Sigma fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were promoting a Halloween fraternity party to  
raise money to fight leukemia when the device one of them was 
carrying exploded accidentally. No one was seriously injured.

<HEADLINE> Huang May Testify About Ickes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee today cleared the way for  
public testimony by former Democratic Party fund-raiser John Huang 
after revealing that he supplied the Justice Department with new 
information about political donations regarding both of President 
Clinton's campaigns for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee voted unanimously to grant  
Huang, a government witness, limited immunity from prosecution 
after the panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, stated that Huang: 
</P>
<P>
	--Was asked by the architect of Clinton's 1996 re-election,  
then-deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes, to raise money 
for the congressional campaign of Jesse Jackson Jr. in 1995, a 
period in which Jackson's father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, posed a 
threat to Clinton's re-election. Jackson was considering a run for 
president as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Embarked on an illegal fund-raising scheme in 1992 after his  
boss, Indonesian businessman James Riady, promised presidential 
candidate Bill Clinton $1 million in political donations. ``Why 
wasn't James Riady indicted?'' asked Burton. Clinton greeted Riady 
while shaking hands on the president's recent trip to New Zealand. 
Riady has not returned to the United States since allegations of 
campaign fund-raising abuses erupted in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton said Huang has told investigators that after Clinton and  
Riady took a car ride in 1992, Huang helped arrange the scheme in 
which Riady employees could be reimbursed for their political 
donations. Burton said Riady made the promise of $1 million during 
the ride. The car ride and Riady-connected donations were 
previously known, but Riady's alleged $1 million personal 
commitment to Clinton had not been known until Huang began 
cooperating with the Justice Department earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said today that the Justice  
Department examined allegations regarding Ickes to determine 
whether an independent counsel should have been appointed to 
investigate the man who now is a key strategist for Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's bid for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reviewed all of these instances and look at it to  
determine whether it triggers the independent counsel,'' Reno told 
her weekly news conference. ``In this instance, we determined that 
it did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, The Associated Press disclosed that Huang, who has  
been a central figure in the fund-raising probe, has been secretly 
telling the Justice Department that Ickes was behind an effort in 
1995 in which he asked Huang to support the congressional candidacy 
of the Jesse Jackson Jr., son of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the White House was closely watching the plans of  
the elder Jackson, who was weighing a possible challenge against 
Clinton as an independent presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes at the time was overseeing Clinton's re-election effort  
from the White House; Huang was a Commerce Department employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits government employees like Ickes from  
soliciting campaign donations from subordinates. It is a felony 
punishable by up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes denies breaking any fund-raising laws. He and his lawyers,  
Robert Bennett and Amy Sabrin, did not return calls this week to 
their offices. Huang's lawyer, Ty Cobb, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department conducted an initial inquiry into Huang's  
allegations but concluded the facts as outlined by Huang didn't fit 
the elements of a federal crime and there was no need to seek an 
independent counsel to investigate Ickes, according to legal 
sources familiar with Huang's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans repeatedly have criticized Reno for not seeking an  
independent counsel to investigate Democratic fund raising in the 
1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang told the investigators he donated $1,000 to Jackson and  
raised an additional $6,000 to satisfy Ickes' request. 
</P>
<P>
	According to legal sources, Huang told Justice last winter that  
Ickes called him at his government office and set up an Oct. 2, 
1995, job interview at the White House. Ickes said he was trying to 
``round up people'' to support Jackson and asked Huang to raise 
$10,000 to $15,000 for Jackson from Asian-Americans, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ickes testified to Congress that, at the president's request, he  
called Huang and met with him on that Oct. 2 about going to work at 
the Democratic National Committee, where Huang's activities 
eventually triggered the fund-raising controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Huang was a deputy assistant secretary at the  
Commerce Department but was seeking Ickes' help to land a job with 
the Democratic Party for the 1996 election. Huang became a key 
fund-raiser for the party in the Asian-American community, a job 
that landed him in hot water. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang has been sentenced to probation after pleading guilty to  
charges he conspired to violate federal fund-raising laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Jackson, who took an active role fund raising and  
campaigning for his son, said Wednesday he spoke often to Ickes 
during that period, but doesn't recall ever discussing whether the 
White House could assist the congressional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not pursue them to support Jesse's campaign,'' the  
elder Jackson said of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he'd talked to presidential aides about the White  
House supporting his son, the elder Jackson replied, ``No. I have 
no knowledge of that, no recollection of that at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's son, now a congressman from Illinois, said the FBI  
interviewed him about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not talk to Mr. Ickes during my campaign about fund  
raising, about raising any money for our efforts, and I indicated 
this to the FBI,'' the younger Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Time To Set Clocks Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just in time for the tiny goblins to go  
``trick-or-treating,'' dark will come an hour earlier Sunday with 
the return of standard time. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the early darkness, safety experts are urging extra  
caution for drivers and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
	For one night, the shift will give people an extra hour of sleep  
as clocks are set back one hour at 2 a.m. Sunday, local time. 
</P>
<P>
	The change also moves an hour of darkness to the evening,  
meaning brighter early mornings. 
</P>
<P>
	It also means this is the weekend some people get stuck working  
an extra hour -- factory workers on the overnight shift, all-night 
convenience store clerks, bartenders, police and even some news 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	For most people, though, it simply means having to remember to  
set the clock back an hour -- that's right, back -- before retiring 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, in the words of the Uniform Time Act, which set up the  
system of switching between daylight and standard times, clocks are 
``retarded'' an hour at 0200 on the last Sunday in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Daylight-saving time returns April 2.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Tokyo Shares Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen today on a  
remark by a Japanese government official who shrugged off worries 
about an overly strong yen. Tokyo share prices rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 31.35  
points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 17,413.71 points. On 
Wednesday, the average closed down 289.43 points, or 1.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 104.06 yen at 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT), down 0.26  
yen from late Wednesday and also below its late New York level of 
104.17 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 103.88 yen to 
104.45 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, a comment by Japan's economic planning  
chief sent the dollar falling, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya said he wasn't worried about an overly strong  
yen, and that the the government would need to step in to support 
the Japanese currency only if the dollar fell below 100 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sakaiya's comment invited another round of dollar selling,''  
said Tetsu Aikawa, vice president of foreign exchange at Sanwa 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, however, did not stay below 104 yen due to continued  
fears about possible intervention by the Bank of Japan to weaken 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen is seen as damaging to Japan's big exporters, as it  
makes their products less cost-competitive overseas and lowers the 
value of repatriated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been rising against the greenback recently on  
expectations that the government will spend a significant amount of 
money to buoy the economy. A second supplementary budget is being 
submitted in the parliamentary session, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese as well as overseas players are increasingly  
attracted back to the yen,'' said Hirokazu Note, assistant general 
manager of foreign exchange at Sumitomo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.14 yen, down  
from 110.69 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, players were encouraged by a sharp  
rise in U.S. stocks overnight in New York. The Dow Jones industrial 
average gained 92.76 points to 10,394.89. 
</P>
<P>
	But some pessimism set in after Sakaiya's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sakaiya's comments will allow the yen to strengthen further,  
and the stock market will not escape the impact of a stronger yen, 
even if it did not react much to the comments today,'' said Tsuguya 
Onozuka, a dealer at Yamatane Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.72 points, or 0.24 percent, to finish at 
1,527.10. The TOPIX closed down 19.71 points, or 1.28 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 534.44 million  
shares, up from 517.56 million shares Wednesday. Decliners 
outnumbered advancers 706 to 470, while 159 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8550 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8300 
percent. Its price fell 0.21 point to 99.53.

<HEADLINE> Patients Must Be Gene-Savvy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- You've heard that scientists expect to map all  
100,000 or so human genes by 2002. You've seen headlines claiming 
discovery of ``the breast cancer gene'' or ``the Alzheimer's 
gene.'' Maybe you've considered taking a gene test to discover if 
you're at risk of a dread disease. 
</P>
<P>
	And you've probably seen breathless claims that gene therapy's  
miraculous cures are just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	But genetics isn't that simple.  
</P>
<P>
	There isn't just one gene that goes wrong to cause a complex  
disease like breast cancer or Alzheimer's -- it's a mix of different 
genes that may interact with environmental factors still being 
discovered. There are questions about the value of testing for 
certain genes until scientists better understand how they work. As 
for gene therapy, it is promising but researchers still have lots 
of obstacles to overcome before anyone should expect cures. 
</P>
<P>
	All the caveats mean Americans must become gene-savvy to reap  
the most benefit from genetic discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health is taking an unusual step to  
help them: an unprecedented daylong class on Nov. 12 to teach 
anyone who's interested the nuts-and-bolts of genetics. Some 
participants even will be taken inside NIH laboratories to watch 
DNA sequencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions the program will try to answer:  
</P>
<P>
	--How does my genetic heritage influence my risk of disease?  
</P>
<P>
	--Are illnesses like heart disease and diabetes triggered mostly  
by genes, or do genes interact with diet, smoking and other 
factors? 
</P>
<P>
	--If my family is prone to a certain disease, should I take a  
gene test? If I have a ``bad gene,'' can I do anything to protect 
my health? Can I keep the test results private and away from my 
insurer and employer? 
</P>
<P>
	--How soon are genetic discoveries going to change the way my  
primary care physician, cardiologist or other doctor diagnoses and 
treats me? 
</P>
<P>
	Class participants should leave the NIH's Bethesda, Md., campus  
with answers. Geneticists want consumers to understand basic 
genetic principles enough to ask their own doctors the best 
questions about their health -- and to critically assess media 
reports of the latest discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consider it a primer in genetics,'' said Craig Higgins, chief  
of outreach and education at the NIH's National Human Genome 
Research Institute. That institute spearheads the Human Genome 
Project, the massive effort to catalog all the human genes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Virtually every disease has a genetic component,'' Higgins  
explained. ``The better people understand genetics and its impact 
in medicine, the better the interaction between the health care 
provider and the patient is going to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Genes are bundles of DNA that control how cells act by  
instructing them to produce certain proteins vital for bodily 
processes. Those instructions are written in a chemical code, which 
scientists have named using the letters A, G, C and T to represent 
DNA's chemical makeup. The order of the letters is a gene's DNA 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
	If the letters get altered, the cell may not behave properly,  
mistakes that can lead to disease. On the other hand, some 
alterations are just harmless variations between people. 
</P>
<P>
	NIH geneticists describe sequencing the human genome as reading  
the book of life. Understanding the code -- the letters in the book 
-- will help scientists hunt what goes wrong in disease and 
hopefully, one day, prevent or fix it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene mutations can be inherited, or they can develop over a  
lifetime. Every time a cell reproduces, there's a chance for error 
as the DNA code is copied. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes just a single inherited gene mutation is enough to  
cause disease, like in sickle cell disease or Huntington's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But other illnesses like heart disease, cancer or diabetes are  
complex enough that multiple genetic alterations and environmental 
factors all can play a role. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing you have a particular gene mutation may mean you have an  
increased risk of a disease, but how big a risk? For most diseases, 
scientists don't yet know. But with new discoveries daily, it's 
important for doctors and patients to keep track. 
</P>
<P>
	To register for NIH's free gene class, check  
http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/conf/ on the Internet. If public demand 
for the class is high, as expected, the science agency will 
consider additional genetics tutorials next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who want to learn on their own can find  
easy-to-understand genetics primers at: 
www.nhgri.nih.gov/Policy--and--public--affairs/Communications/Publicati 
ons or www.accessexcellence.org/ae/AE/AEPC/NIH.

	One Series title in 10 years is not enough to secure a loftier  
place in baseball history. Too many potential championships got 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's unfair,'' Chipper Jones said in protest. ``We've won  
more championships than about 25 or 26 other teams. When you look 
at our organization, you can only call it a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, these are the moments that endure:  
</P>
<P>
	--In 1991, Lonnie Smith stops running and Minnesota wins Game 7  
in the 10th inning. That one was excused in the tomahawk-chopping 
euphoria over a miraculous worst-to-first season. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1992, the Braves expected to win against Toronto and were on  
their way to a 2-0 lead in the Series until pinch-hitter Ed Sprague 
homered in the ninth against ancient Jeff Reardon. The Blue Jays 
went on claim the title in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1996, after winning their lone Series title of the decade  
over Cleveland the previous year, the Braves were poised to 
establish themselves as one of the great teams in baseball history. 
They won the first two games of the '96 Series at Yankee Stadium by 
a combined score of 16-1, only to lose the next three at old 
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The collapse was completed back in 
New York, and the Braves have never been so close to another 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Wednesday night, the decade of lost chances ended on a  
dismal note. The Yankees finished off the Braves with a four-game 
blitz, marking the first time this decade that Atlanta lost a 
best-of-7 series in fewer than six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did it all,'' Jones said. ``They're awesome. They pretty  
much played a perfect series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Braves, their plight was summed up by the placard  
carried by a Yankees fan. ``Hey Atlanta. Ever Heard of the Buffalo 
Bills?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message was clear: The Braves now have a place alongside the  
NFL team that lost four straight Super Bowls in the first half of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things that have been written about us are unfair,'' said  
John Smoltz, who took the loss in Game 4. ``But this is the level 
we've established for ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The totality of this defeat overshadowed what had been an  
amazing season for the Braves. They managed to win 103 games 
despite losing five players to season-ending illness and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no solace in scratching and clawing to get here,''  
Smoltz said. ``There's just an overwhelming feeling that we've got 
to win when we get here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the final chance for Team of the Decade honors turned out to  
be a debacle. The Yankees showed Atlanta how it's supposed to be 
done, celebrating their third title in four years while their fans 
mocked the Braves with a Bronx version of the ``Tomahawk Chop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta finished the decade with three straight 100-win seasons  
and nary a Series title to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a bit of drama to the final game of the '90s,  
unlike the previous night when the Braves squandered their best 
chance to make a Series of it by blowing a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored all of their runs in the third, taking  
advantage of a potential double-play grounder that bounced off the 
right arm of first baseman Ryan Klesko. 
</P>
<P>
	While judged a hit by the official scorers, it was clearly a  
miscue -- the kind of play the Yankees always seem to make, the kind 
of play the Braves couldn't make at critical times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best team won,'' Smoltz said. ``The Yanks are head and  
shoulders above most when it comes to this time of the year. We 
lost to the best team, simply put.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Andres Galarraga and Javy Lopez watching from the dugout,  
sidelined by cancer and a bum knee respectively, the free-swinging 
Atlanta hitters were thoroughly dominated by New York's starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Hernandez allowed one hit in Game 1. David Cone matched  
him in Game 2. Roger Clemens surrendered four hits in the clincher, 
allowing just one Atlanta runner to reach second base when he left 
with two outs in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox will take his share of blame for letting this  
one get away, too. In Game 1, when the Braves took a 1-0 lead into 
the eighth, he left starter Greg Maddux in the game four hitters 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 -- a contest the Braves had to have -- flu-ridden Tom  
Glavine was sent back to the mound in the eighth with a 5-3 lead, 
even though Cox said beforehand that all he wanted was seven solid 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Two batters later, the game was tied on Chuck Knoblauch's  
315-homer down the right-field line. Two innings later, the series 
effectively ended when Chad Curtis hit a ball considerably farther 
into the Braves bullpen for a 6-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Braves bid adieu to the 1990s. Good riddance.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be nice that we don't have to listen to all that  
stuff,'' Jones said. ``We can start a new decade and certainly 
everyone will come in looking to get it kicked off the right way.''

<HEADLINE> Coke Studies Vending Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. is studying wireless technology  
that could allow bottlers to raise or lower soda prices by remote 
control at certain times -- say, during hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower prices during periods of slower sales would presumably  
bring in more business -- unless the higher prices at other times 
enraged customers. But a spokesman for the world's biggest soft 
drink maker said the company has no immediate plans to put such a 
machine into the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of the pricing is something we don't see happening  
anytime soon, if ever,'' spokesman Rob Baskin said today. ``You 
could probably make a vending machine that could fly, too, but I 
don't think we would do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported today that the company is testing a  
machine that can automatically raise prices for its drinks during 
hot weather. It also quoted chairman and chief executive M. Douglas 
Ivester's comments on the subject earlier this month to a Brazilian 
newsmagazine, Veja. 
</P>
<P>
	The desire for a cold drink increases during the summer heat,  
Ivester said, so ``it is fair that it should be more expensive. The 
machine will simply make this process automatic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baskin said Coke's research and development department is  
evaluating several technologies for new machines to allow the 
company to remotely collect data such as how full the machines are 
and how often they are visited. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke is one of several beverage makers interested in such data  
because the information could increase the machines' productivity, 
said Ron Sewell, president of Automated Network Solutions, a 
Roswell, Ga., company assisting Coke with the tests.

<HEADLINE> Viacom-CBS Heads Defend Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top executives from CBS and Viacom tried  
Thursday to quell opposition on Capitol Hill to their pending $36 
billion merger, promising that the combined media powerhouse only 
would enhance consumers' options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Viacom's merger with CBS would allow us to serve the full  
array of today's fragmented audiences even better,'' Viacom 
Chairman Sumner Redstone said at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee 
hearing. ``We see the combined assets as highly complementary. All 
of this, I assure you, will be to the consumers benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers were unswayed.  
</P>
<P>
	``A proliferation of new media outlets does not guarantee any  
greater diversity of viewpoint,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. 
``After all, one corporate conglomerate can still exercise control 
over the content of media that reaches citizens through many 
different outlets. The safest and best way to ensure diversity of 
viewpoint is through diversity of ownership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary  
subcommittee on antitrust, business rights and competition, also 
said he had ``some concerns'' about the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Viacom and CBS announced Sept. 7 that they wanted to merge their  
extensive interests in television, movies, radio and outdoor 
advertising. Federal regulators must approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	By adding CBS to its studios and cable TV networks, which  
include Paramount, MTV and Nickelodeon, the new Viacom would rival 
Time Warner Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, CBS President Mel Karmazin told lawmakers, ``I  
think there is plenty of competition for this new company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today our competition is all of the cable channels. Our  
competition is Yahoo! Our competition is AOL (American Online),'' 
Karmazin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger faces some regulatory hurdles, some of which Redstone  
and Karmazin criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Communications Commission regulations prevent one  
broadcaster from operating television stations that reach more than 
35 percent of the nation's homes. CBS comes close to this limit 
now, and company officials have said the deal would give the new 
Viacom about 41 percent of the national audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also prohibit companies from owning two or more  
networks in certain combinations, a regulation that would hit the 
new Viacom, with its half-interest in the UPN television network. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies may have to shed some of their stations to comply  
with the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared testimony, the two company leaders said while they  
will ``come into compliance as quickly as possible with whatever 
rules are in place at the time of their closing, the two companies 
firmly believe that the 35 percent national TV ownership limit and 
the dual-network rules no longer serve the public interest of 
viewers and those rules should be relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were particularly concerned with the fate of UPN.  
</P>
<P>
	``No party is lining up to assume responsibility for a network  
that is still losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year,'' 
the statement said. ``The only other option therefore might be to 
shut down UPN altogether.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Closing it would not serve the public good,'' the two said,  
pointing out that the network is off to a good start this year. 
They noted that UPN serves minority viewers particularly well. The 
network had a 5.8 rating among black households and airs 10 of the 
top 50 rated television programs among blacks.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Soar; Dow Ends Up 227.64 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>

                         *AP Business Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A benign report on labor costs sparked a  
broad-based rally on Wall Street Thursday as investors who had 
abandoned stocks jumped back into the market, believing once again 
that inflation is under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.64 to 10,622.53,  
extending Wednesday's 92-point gain. It was the Dow's biggest 
advance since it rose 235.24 on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 45.73 to 1,342.44, and the Nasdaq  
composite index rose 72.70 to 2,875.22. Still, some analysts 
believed the wave of buying was an extreme reaction to fairly 
modest government data. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market was looking for an excuse to go up,'' said Bernie  
Schaeffer, chairman of Schaeffer's Investment Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks shot higher after the Labor Department said its  
employment cost index rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter, 
slightly lower than the 0.9 percent increase many economists were 
expecting. Economists view the index as a significant barometer of 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the third 
time this year in its continuing effort to ward off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the employment cost index might not deter the Fed  
from implementing another rate hike when its policy-writing Open 
Market Committee meets Nov. 16, but they believed the next increase 
could be the last for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not closed, of course,'' said Michael Moran,  
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America, noting that the Fed 
will also carefully monitor next week's employment report for 
October. ``But inflation pressures are not problematic at this 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose for a second straight session, pushing the  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.25 percent from 6.33 
percent late Wednesday. Stocks drew some additional support from 
the retreat in bond yields, which earlier this month rose high 
enough to lure some investors away from stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The promise of stabilizing interest rates boosted bank stocks  
for a second straight session. Citigroup rose 3 to 54 1/8, and 
American Express soared 10 3/8 to 161. Chase Manhattan rose 5 13/16 to 
88 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks are especially sensitive to rising rates because higher  
rates can discouarge customers from borrowing money, cutting into 
lending volume. Also, higher rates can reduce the value of a 
financial firm's fixed holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the employment cost numbers to the  
exclusion of a strong report on the nation's gross domestic 
product. The government said the U.S. economy expanded at an annual 
rate of 4.8 percent from July through September, the fastest pace 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On a less optimistic day, the GDP report could have prompted  
selling, analysts said. But the employment cost index prevailed in 
shaping investor sentiment, calming an uneasy market. 
</P>
<P>
	``There seems to be a sense that whatever the Fed does, once we  
get it out of the way, the market can move higher,'' Schaeffer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Nasdaq, Amazon.com fell 4 15/16 to 71. The online  
retailer said late Wednesday that while its third-quarter results 
topped expectations, losses more than tripled from a year ago as 
the company spent heavily to expand its online offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom rose 6 1/16 to 83 5/8 after saying third-quarter  
operating profits nearly tripled from the same period in 1998. The 
telecommunications company earned $1.09 billion, or 55 cents per 
share, beating analysts' expectations of 54 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 1.12 billion 
shares, compared with 894.40 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.04 to 422.81.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent. The  
rally on Wall Street boosted European markets, lifting Germany's 
DAX index 2.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 index 1.7 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 index 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Houston Mayor Taking Race Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- No one expects Mayor Lee Brown, who rode a  
law-and-order career to City Hall, to lose an election-day shooting 
match with an Outlaw and a Jailbird. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown, the former U.S. drug-policy czar, is taking no  
chances. He has spent more than $733,000 on the campaign. That is 
nowhere near the $2.7 million he spent to defeat businessman Rob 
Mosbacher in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But it dwarfs the $1,360 reported by one of his opponents this  
year, ``Jailbird'' Jack Terence, who publishes a weekly newspaper. 
Brown's other opponents in Tuesday's election are a wrestling 
promoter, ``Outlaw'' Josey Wales IV, and write-in candidate Laura 
Garza, a member of the Socialist Workers Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't take anything for granted,'' Brown said recently. ``I  
think our record speaks for itself, but we certainly want people to 
get out and vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How did Brown escape serious opposition?  
</P>
<P>
	``Term limits,'' said Bob Stein, dean of Rice University's  
School of Social Sciences. ``It's as simple as that. Nobody's going 
to run against an incumbent mayor unless he or she is doing 
something so awful that public support for them has eroded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston elected officials are limited to three, two-year terms.  
Mosbacher decided early on not to challenge Brown, who at most 
would have four years left in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's race has taken a back seat to the hotly debated  
question of whether to funnel tax money to a $160 million 
basketball arena, a deal Brown brokered with the Houston Rockets. 
Bond issues for a new courthouse and a big port expansion also have 
received more attention than the mayor's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown counts downtown revitalization, the city's economic health  
and a lower crime rate among his successes. He points to 
transportation and pollution issues as second-term priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the citizens of our city are very happy with what  
we're doing,'' said Brown, 62, a former police chief in New York, 
Houston and Atlanta. ``We're on a positive roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Orlando Sanchez, a frequent critic of Brown's, said  
the mayor could provide more leadership and questioned whether he 
has honored a 1997 pledge to promote ``neighborhood-oriented 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's opponents -- Wales, Terence and write-in candidate Laura  
Garza -- all identify Brown as a friend to Houston's power elite. 
They offer themselves as working-class alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Terence said the Brown campaign's spending hurts the democratic  
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not use a sledgehammer to drive a tack,'' he said. ``I  
think it's obscene to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
beat Jack Terence when there are homeless people in Houston.''

<HEADLINE> Bush To Explain Absence From Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush, who is skipping tonight's debate with his GOP rivals, plans 
to do an interview with a local television station to explain his 
absence to New Hampshire voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will appear by satellite from Dallas on WMUR-TV at 6 p.m.  
EDT, two hours before the start of the town hall forum at Dartmouth 
College. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to explain to the people of New Hampshire why he  
isn't going to be there and to answer questions that might have 
been asked at the debate,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Texas governor and front-runner for the GOP  
presidential nomination, is feeling the heat for missing GOP 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said a scheduling conflict kept him from the first debate  
among Republicans last week in the state. He will miss tonight's 
debate because he wants to be with his wife Laura when she receives 
an alumni award from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has accepted an invitation to a GOP debate on Dec. 2 in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Bush's rivals branded his absence from last Friday's  
debate as an ``insult'' to the people of New Hampshire, and the 
criticism continued Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only is George Bush skipping a debate for the second  
consecutive time but he's thumbing his nose at the people of New 
Hampshire,'' said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for GOP presidential 
rival Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, for his part, spent Wednesday in Iowa, focusing for a  
second straight day on reducing the number of problem pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	He toured a crisis pregnancy center in Dubuque, where he touted  
the ``beauty of adoption'' but said he wasn't prepared to extend 
direct federal help to churches that finance such programs. 
However, he said he saw no conflict with providing taxpayer support 
for the programs that these centers refer women to. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of my job, should I become president, is to herald the  
beauty and love of adoptions and to recognize that in centers like 
this women find loving alternatives,'' Bush said at the Tri-State 
Pregnancy Center in blue-collar, heavily Catholic Dubuque -- the 
heart of Iowa's anti-abortion movement. The center counsels women 
who have had abortions as well as those who continue their 
pregnancies. It is financed by local churches. 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, Bush said he would try to draw attention to such  
centers, but he ruled out any federal backing for churches that 
band together to support them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we ought to fund the programs or individuals who are  
trying to help, not the church from which the program draws its 
strength,'' explained Bush. ``That would step over the separation 
of church and state.''

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s first-quarter profit  
rose 8.5 percent before one-time restructuring charges as sales 
rose 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest consumer products maker had earnings before  
one-time charges of $1.27 billion, or 88 cents per share, compared 
with $1.17 billion, or 80 cents per share, in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results for the quarter ended Sept. 30 met the expectations  
of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. P&AMP;G stock 
rose $5.37 1/2 to $104.62 1/2 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	When one-time charges of $120 million related to the company's  
restructuring program are included, P&AMP;G earned $1.17 billion, or 80 
cents per share, in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales increased by 4 percent from a year ago to $9.92 billion  
from $9.51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G said it increased the volume of its product shipments by 2  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G is in the midst of a reorganization designed to streamline  
decision-making and help it react more quickly to market demands. 
The company said it was beginning to see results from the 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported a 10 percent increase in its fabric and  
home care business, which includes brands such as Tide detergent; a 
2 percent decline in paper products earnings and a 5 percent gain 
in food and beverage earnings, on products such as Folgers coffee, 
Pringles snacks and Jif peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G's beauty care business had a 4 percent drop in earnings and  
health care, which includes the newly-acquired Iams pet food 
business, was up 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	P&AMP;G sells about 300 brands in more than 140 countries, also  
including Crest toothpaste and Pampers disposable diapers.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has awarded former President Gerald  
Ford and his wife, Betty, its highest civilian honor, praising them 
for their leadership in a time of national crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``You did right by your country,'' said Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., at a ceremony presenting the Fords with the 
Congressional Gold Medal 25 years after the couple was pressed into 
service when President Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford served out the final 2 1/2 years of Nixon's second term. His  
pardon of Nixon earned him harsh criticism at the time from 
Democrats and Republicans alike. However, many now credit that 
action and Ford's quiet resumption of the nation's business with 
helping the shocked country move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was easy for us to criticize you because we got caught up  
in the moment. You didn't get caught up in the moment and you were 
right,'' President Clinton told Ford the award ceremony on Capitol 
Hill on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ford was also recognized for her candidness about personal  
frailties, which has been a source of comfort or enlightenment to 
many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Ford helped heal America's soul, Mrs. Ford helped  
heal our bodies,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the same year her husband became president, Mrs. Ford  
announced that she had breast cancer and would undergo a 
mastectomy, an illness and procedure not often openly discussed 
prior to that. Her action is credited with encouraging many women 
to seek lifesaving early detection of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Ford shared with Americans how, after her husband lost  
his 1976 bid for re-election to Jimmy Carter, she had become 
addicted to alcohol and pills her doctor had prescribed for her. 
</P>
<P>
	After recovering, she became founder and president of the  
now-famous Betty Ford Center for alcohol and substance abuse in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda was something of  
a homecoming. The former president served in the House as 
representative for the 3rd district of Michigan, beginning in 1949, 
and as minority leader from 1965 until he became vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., recalled how Ford's  
congressional colleagues voted overwhelmingly for him assume his 
fateful vice presidency under Nixon in 1973, after Spiro Agnew 
resigned under the shadow of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gerald Ford did not become president because of polls, he did  
not become president because of campaign promises, he became 
president because of character,'' Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ford said that in spite of their unexpected years at the  
other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, in the White House, ``this House, 
to Gerry and me, the people's House, will always be our home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford himself took the visit as an opportunity to remind  
lawmakers, now embroiled in a nasty partisan fight over the 
nation's budget, of the virtue of cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clash of ideals should never be confused with a holy war.  
Some people equate civility with weakness and compromise with 
surrender. I strongly disagree,'' said Ford.

<HEADLINE> Washington Opera Stages `Le Cid' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Placido Domingo, musical director of the  
Washington Opera, is closing its last season of the century with 
Jules Massenet's French work ``Le Cid'' -- not fully staged in the 
United States since New York's Metropolitan Opera put it on at the 
century's start. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo will sing the main role of Rodrigue when it opens  
Saturday at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
Rodrigue, in a duel, kills the father of his fiancee Chimene 
(Elisabete Matos), and wins her forgiveness by leading the Spanish 
army to victory over the Moors. The story is loosely based on a 
classic French play by Pierre Corneille about a Spanish hero, 
Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, who died 900 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Opera has done the production in collaboration  
with the Teatro de la Maestranza of Seville, Spain. The opulent 
staging imitates the look of a medieval manuscript in a jeweled 
binding, with knights in armor and richly costumed religious 
processions.

<HEADLINE> Young Facing Long Odds on Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young can't let go of the  
season or the game just yet. Soon, he might not have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying what Young couldn't, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve  
Mariucci on Wednesday said Young's concussion problems almost 
certainly would keep him sidelined for the rest of the season. And 
the health risks associated with getting another could prevent him 
from ever playing again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a small part of me that would love to see him running  
around, throwing touchdown passes again,'' Mariucci said. ``I think 
the whole world would love to see that. But there's a larger part 
of me that has to be ready to have him unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that Steve could play again someday. He is trying to  
get to that point. He knows that it's a long shot, but I don't know 
that he wants to admit that every day. It's like being down 20 
points. He's not going to concede the loss because he's a 
fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young, in his first public comments in two weeks, said he  
continues to hold out hope of playing again, though he conceded he 
has no idea when or if he'll receive medical clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has not been the easiest thing to deal with,'' Young  
said. ``I will not play unless Dr. (Gary) Steinberg and the 
coaching staff and myself feel that it's the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sidelined since suffering his fourth concussion in three years a  
month ago, the 38-year-old quarterback refused to rule out a 
comeback this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you can put percentages on it, but today I'm  
not on the field, so it's zero percent,'' he said. ``I'm not going 
to play in the next couple weeks or the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to put a time frame on it. But I think in time I  
will be able to put enough time between the incident, that the 
unknowable might become knowable. If time runs out on the season, 
so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the team has discussed putting Young on injured  
reserve, which would finish him for the year. But Young has pleaded 
for patience, and out of respect to him the team is allowing more 
time before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't want to leave it or let it go,'' Mariucci said.  
``He wants to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci added that the injured reserve list could be inevitable  
for Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, we don't need that roster spot. Now, if we get  
an injury or two, we may reconsider. And Steve knows that,'' 
Mariucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young insists he is indeed serious about his health. He says the  
death of a San Jose high school football player following a 
concussion was ``sobering to all of us, not just myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he needs more time and information before deciding  
on his future. Young continues to consult with specialists and 
speak with players who have been driven from the game by repeated 
concussions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will ultimately abide by his doctor's recommendations  
and does not fear being forced to quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been preparing for retirement since I started playing  
football,'' Young said. ``I went to law school. I've done a lot of 
other things. So when that comes, that will be fine. We'll just 
move right on in and do something new. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize these concussions can have their effects, so I'm  
not in any way in denial about it. But certainly I've talked about 
the possibility of coming back and I would like to explore that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver J.J. Stokes said Young's teammates are coming to  
realize their quarterback won't be back any time soon, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought until just recently he would be back at some point  
in time this season,'' Stokes said. ``The fact that he will 
probably not be back is going to be rough, but we just have to go 
with Jeff Garcia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young's latest concussion came during a game at Arizona on Sept.  
27. He lapsed into unconsciousness for about 30 seconds after being 
leveled by blitzing cornerback Aeneas Williams, and then hit his 
head on tackle Dave Fiore's knee before hitting the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Young has been bothered by headaches, lethargy and  
general wooziness though he said most of the post-concussion 
symptoms have now dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, his chief neurologist, made a recommendation about  
his future. Young still wouldn't say what it was in his first 
public comments in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's telling me I can't play right now,'' Young said. ``It's  
like any injury. You have to give it time to heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, Mariucci and the rest of the 49ers are preparing  
for life without Young. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, we're all prepared not to have him. Sure, we'd like  
to have him, but that may not be what ends up happening,'' Mariucci 
said.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Local News Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The amount of enterprise reporting on local TV  
news broadcasts appears sharply on the decline despite clear 
evidence that viewers will flock to stations that produce 
high-quality journalism, a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
	Money pressures appear to be behind the ``startling'' drop in  
enterprise stories, according to the report by the Project for 
Excellence in Journalism issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study ranked newscasts at 59 stations in 19 cities over two  
weeks earlier this year. Its definition of enterprise included 
investigative stories and reports produced at a reporter's 
initiative, instead of just reactions to events. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 percent of the stations received a ``D'' or failing  
grade by the study for their amount of enterprise. A similar study 
last year found only a quarter of the stations with such low 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine out of 10 stories on local TV news originate from police  
scanners or planned news events, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	News executives surveyed by the Project said their biggest  
obstacle to quality is a lack of staff and demands on them to fill 
an expanding amount of broadcast time. Many require their reporters 
to produce at least one story a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found a clear relationship between quality and high  
ratings: stations given the lowest grades by the Project were twice 
as likely to be failing commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in television news should be quite heartened by a study  
like this because it shows that if you want to do good journalism, 
you can do well,'' said Carl Gottlieb, PEJ deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
	The study found that an investment in staff is more likely to  
pay off in higher ratings than getting new technology, like news 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Crime news is still easily the most popular topic on the local  
broadcasts, but it doesn't dominate them as it used to. The 
percentage of crime news on the broadcasts dropped from 28 percent 
last year to 22 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also found that in New York and Boston, stations  
aired their best newscasts at 6 p.m., even though they had more 
viewers at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project said the five best newscasts it found were on WFIE  
and WEHT in Evansville, Ind., WSVN and WTVJ in Miami and KRON in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The Project for Excellence in Journalism is affiliated with the  
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Its study was 
funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.

<HEADLINE> USDA Proposes Farm Policy Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says the  
``farm economy stinks'' and promises to have some proposals to 
overhaul the market-oriented 1996 farm law that will provide more 
assistance to farmers when commodity prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lurching, ad hoc style, from one patchwork emergency bill to  
the next is not the most effective way to help farmers,'' Glickman 
said at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said last week that Congress needed to  
``revise, revamp and improve'' the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law 
because it did not take adequate care of farmers. The law was 
intended to make farmers less dependent on government assistance. 
But commodity prices dropped sharply last year and Congress has 
responded by passing successive multibillion-dollar bailout 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	But USDA has come under fire from Republicans over the past year  
for not offering legislative proposals of its own on crop insurance 
and emergency farm assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an obligation to come up ... with some specific  
proposals,'' Glickman said. ``We've tried to do that, but we're 
going to have to do a better job in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Texas  
Republican Larry Combest, said he doubted Glickman's proposals 
would be sufficiently detailed. Ideas that sound good in theory 
often have undesirable ramifications when put in practice, Combest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't work hypothetically, they have to be specific. The  
more they are specific the more they will be players in the final 
outcome,'' said Combest. 
</P>
<P>
	Combest plans hearings, starting early next year, on possible  
changes to the 1996 law. USDA will offer its proposals at that 
time, said August Schumacher Jr., deputy undersecretary for farm 
and foreign agricultural services. 
</P>
<P>
	Glickman has previously proposed raising subsidy rates for crops  
and subsidizing grain storage so farmers could keep crops off the 
market when prices were low. He also has indicated interest in an 
insurance program proposed by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, that 
would allow farmers to guarantee a minimum income based on 
fluctuations in crop yields and prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The first checks from this year's assistance package started  
going into the mail Monday, and additional payments will be going 
out into next year, depending on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers who lost crops to drought and flooding likely will get a  
35 percent advance payment with the rest to come after Agriculture 
Department totals up all the claims, Glickman said. Congress 
provided $1.2 billion for weather-related crop losses. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be many months before USDA implements a new program for  
reporting the prices that meatpackers pay for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporting program was included in the bailout measure but  
Congress did not allocate any money to operate it. Glickman said it 
would cost $4.7 billion to run the system over the next year. The 
program cannot start until Congress provides an appropriation for 
it or the department finds another source of funds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to start the organization of the program. You  
can't implement the program without the money,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> FAA Proposes New Fuel Tank Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government announced steps Thursday to  
make airplane fuel tanks less susceptible to explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a proposed regulation, the Federal Aviation Administration  
wants aircraft makers to review the safety features of their fuel 
tanks and develop new maintenance programs for them within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs must incorporate findings about tank safety made  
since the 1996 explosion of TWA Flight 800, and assume that fuel 
tanks always contain an explosive mixture of fuel and air during 
all maintenance, ground and in-flight operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Once that program is developed, aircraft operators such as the  
commercial airlines would be given six months to adopt maintenance 
programs that incorporate the tasks identified by the aircraft 
builders, under the FAA proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule also proposes that new planes -- those being designed  
and those on the assembly line -- contain fuel systems that minimize 
the development of flammable vapors. Alternatively, manufacturers 
would have to design tanks so that an aircraft does not suffer 
catastrophic damage if there is ignition in a tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth Erickson, director of the FAA's aircraft certification  
service, said such a review of existing technology ``is unusual in 
this magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation would affect 6,000 U.S. airplanes -- the bulk of  
the country's transport fleet -- including such familiar models as 
the Boeing 737, the Boeing 747 and most models made by the European 
manufacturer, Airbus Industrie. 
</P>
<P>
	Applying to planes with more than 30 seats, the regulation would  
extend also to turboprop aircraft used by commuter airlines.	   John Dern, a Boeing spokesman, said the company welcomed the 
proposal in principle and would be filing comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some cases, these are systems that have been in service for  
30 or 40 years, so we're confident they're safe,'' Dern said. ``But 
we've also learned some things in the last few years, so we're 
trying to figure out how to integrate what we've learned with the 
proven design concepts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA action stems from research into fuel tank safety that  
started with the July 1996 explosion of TWA Flight 800. During that 
flight, a 747 bound for Paris exploded shortly after takeoff from 
New York, killing all 230 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board is planning to release  
a final report about the cause of that accident early next year, 
but investigators have concluded the airplane's near-empty center 
fuel tank exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the FAA has required new inspections and maintenance  
work on the wires, tubing and fuel quantity measuring systems in 
the tanks, all with the intent of eliminating the risk of an 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new regulation is aimed at further improving the safety  
margin around fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the existing design of the Boeing 747 likely would  
not be allowed under the proposed regulations, because air 
conditioning equipment -- which produces heat -- is next to the 
center fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA estimates the new program will cost $170 million over 10  
years. The agency also estimates it will have $260 million in 
benefits, in part from reduced property losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency will begin a 90-day comment period once the  
regulations are posted in the Federal Register. They would not take 
effect until the conclusion of a period to study the incoming 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The action represents a fundamental change in how fuel tanks  
are designed, maintained and operated,'' said FAA Administrator 
Jane Garvey. ``This package results from literally thousands of 
staff hours in investigations and research and development. Indeed, 
that work is continuing with a broad range of research projects.''

<HEADLINE> Woods Hits Rock, Gets 'Stinger'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Tiger Woods hit through a baseball-sized rock and  
suffered a stinger Thursday in the Tour Championship, which a 
physical therapist said would cause stiffness through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods said it would not force him to withdraw.  
</P>
<P>
	``No worries,'' the world's No. 1 player said. ``I'll be all  
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may not have been the smartest play for Woods. Trailing by  
one stroke with five holes left in the 27-hole round, Woods' tee 
shot on No. 15 came to rest next to a tree, with a big rock right 
in front of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said moving the rock would have caused the ball to move, a  
one-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I took two club lengths (a one-stroke penalty), I would  
still be in the rough, the tree in my line. A bogey would be a good 
number,'' he said. ``If I could somehow get the ball back out in 
the fairway ... which is what I tried to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smashing through the rock with a wedge, the chain-reaction  
caused the ball to advance sideways about 25 yards, still in the 
rough. Woods hit his third shot to about 20 feet and two-putted for 
par. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Simpson, a physical therapist in the fitness trailer, said  
it was a brachial plexsus traction injury -- also known as a 
stinger, which is compounded by a neck strain. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Woods would be treated over the next two days with  
motion exercises and ice treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was at 6-under 100, one stroke back of Davis Love III.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injury, Woods was 1-under over the last three holes,  
wincing after every iron shot. He hit his last one to about four 
feet for birdie on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are times when you just have to accept the shot and know  
it is going to hurt,'' he said. ``Go ahead and hit, and at least 
make it count. It's like being a wide receiver going up the middle. 
You know the guy is going to lay you out, but at least catch the 
ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has won six times on the PGA Tour this year, the most  
since Tom Watson in 1980. He leads the money list with over $4.7 
million.

<HEADLINE> LA Times Publisher Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Times' publisher apologized  
for agreeing to give the Staples Center a share of the profit from 
a special Sunday magazine issue devoted to the new downtown sports 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn M. Downing said the deal -- and her failure to disclose  
it to readers and the newspaper's staff -- resulted from her own 
misunderstanding of editorial principles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible situation,'' Downing said in a Times story  
published Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault,'' Downing said. ``I thought because of the  
line between the business and editorial sides there was no reason 
to disclose it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has drawn criticism from other newspapers and members  
of the Times' staff. Nearly 300 reporters and editors signed a 
petition seeking an apology, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition said the agreement with Staples Center raised  
doubts about the newspaper's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	One outside expert, Loren Ghiglione, director of the University  
of Southern California school of journalism, said the arrangement 
created credibility problems with readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises the question of whether the newspaper will share  
profits on other projects, and will it go out to create these 
money-making projects,'' Ghiglione said. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy comes amid a campaign by Mark H. Willes,  
chairman and chief executive of Times parent Times Mirror Co., to 
encourage editorial staff and business managers to work more 
closely together to develop new revenue sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort, viewed skeptically by many in the news industry, has  
resulted in many new sections in the paper devoted to subjects such 
as automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors in the sports section and the magazine didn't know about  
the arrangement, and nobody from the business section or the arena 
was involved in the ``editorial product,'' the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Editor Michael Parks said he learned of the agreement  
after the special issue was printed but before it was distributed. 
His initial reaction, he said, was ``to ask for more details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My objection was that we had entered rather treacherous  
ground, reporting on an institution with which we were going to 
share revenues,'' he said. ``And it was not a proper 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming publisher, Downing was president and chief  
executive officer of Mosby-Matthew Bender, a legal publishing 
company formerly owned by Times Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
	She blamed her willingness to share profits from the Oct. 10  
issue of Los Angeles Times Magazine on ``my fundamental 
misunderstanding'' of the impact it would have on perceptions of 
the newspaper's editorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times also has an advertising deal with the $375 million  
arena, which is the new home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers 
of the National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of 
the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times is one of 10 founding partners that, for a payment of  
$2.75 million to $3 million a year each, get a luxury suite and 
exclusive rights to post advertising inside the arena and on the 
grounds outside. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal also included a provision that called on the newspaper  
and the arena to ``work together on joint opportunities for 
additional revenue.'' Times business managers viewed the special 
magazine issue as one of those opportunities, the newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The special edition generated $2 million in revenue. Profits  
were used by the Times to cover part of its partnership fee, 
Downing said.

<HEADLINE> Wild Horse Roundup Need Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Animal rights activists are objecting to a  
Bureau of Land Management plan to corral herds of wild horses from 
range land singed by summer wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials say the helicopter roundups of up to 1,500  
mustangs and wild burros are necessary to keep the animals from 
starving due to the decimation of more than 1 million acres of 
grass and brush in central Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists contend enough grass remains to feed the herds, and  
the bureau is acting to please ranchers, who see the animals as 
competition for livestock grazing forage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping the BLM will do the right thing and back down,''  
said Jeanne Stuart McVey, a spokeswoman for the Petaluma, 
Calif.-based Animal Rights Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Bureau officials said they would work with leaders of the  
defense fund but didn't plan to suspend the roundups. About 400 
horses have been rounded up so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerie Stanley, a lawyer for the defense fund, said the BLM  
appears to be violating the National Environmental Policy Act and 
the Wild Free Roaming Horse and Burros Act. She said the agency did 
not hold a required public hearing before using helicopters on the 
roundup or prepare an environmental assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the agency's director for Nevada, Bob Abbey, issued  
a statement taking ``exception to the questioning of BLM's motives. 
... Our goal is to have viable and healthy wild horse and burro 
herds on public lands in Nevada where resources can sustain them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said younger horses will be sent to the bureau's  
Palomino Valley adoption center near Reno, while older horses will 
end up at a sanctuary in Bartlesville, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 40,000 wild horses roam the West, about half of  
them in Nevada. Roundups occur regularly to help guard against 
overpopulation and some mustangs are sold at auctions.

<HEADLINE> Bush Skips Debate for Wife's Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday that he  
skipped a debate in New Hampshire because ``I love my wife'' and 
wanted to be at her side when she received an alumni award at 
Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family is important to me, and I think the people of New  
Hampshire will recognize that,'' Bush said in an interview on 
WMUR-TV, several hours before the debate it was co-sponsoring with 
CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Laura, was with him.  
</P>
<P>
	The governor stressed that he was not taking New Hampshire for  
granted and that he would be campaigning there next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``At every stop I answer questions and lay out my vision for  
America and it seems to me that the people of New Hampshire accept 
my vision and want me to be the nominee,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush was being honored by SMU, along with three others, as  
a distinguished alumna. 
</P>
<P>
	She is founder and honorary chairwoman of the Texas Book  
Festival, a gathering of Texas authors and book lovers that has 
raised nearly $600,000 for the state's public libraries. She also 
promotes women's health through the Governor's Spouse Program of 
the National Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people packed a Dallas hotel ballroom for the  
black-tie event, where a video was shown on giant screens of Mrs. 
Bush growing up in Midland, Texas, and attending SMU. She received 
a standing ovation when she walked onstage to receive the award, 
and later thanked her husband for being with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my four years at SMU, I never thought about the  
'distinguished' half of the equation. I was just worried about the 
'alumni,''' she said, smiling widely. ``I think I might have 
married into the 'distinguished' part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Bush made his first campaign swing through  
North Dakota, where he was endorsed by Gov. Ed Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the label `compassionate conservative,''' Bush told  
a crowd of more than 700 at a Greater North Dakota Association 
meeting in Fargo. ``I want compassionate minds to match our 
conservative ideals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The audience cheered at Bush's promise that his presidency would  
``rally the armies of compassion'' to fix shortcomings in education 
and welfare policies, and be an ``era of responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of us must understand that we are responsible for our  
decisions in life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference later, Bush touched on a variety of issues:  
</P>
<P>
	--He suggested that the 1996 farm law, which was intended to make  
growers less dependent on government assistance, could use some 
fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
	--He believes better trade agreements would open more markets to  
U.S. farm products, helping to raise crop prices. But Washington 
also must be willing to open its borders, he said. ``It is the 
fearful who build walls. It is the confident who tear them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He said the United States must build up its military to protect  
the country from ``madmen and terrorists'' and he supports 
construction of a proposed national missile defense system.

<HEADLINE> Consecutive Series Sweeps Rare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ruth and Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio. And now Bernie  
Williams, Derek Jeter and the '99 Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	For just the third time in baseball history, a team swept the  
World Series in consecutive years. By beating the Atlanta Braves 
4-1 Wednesday night, these Yankees, who swept San Diego last year, 
joined the Murderers' Row Yankees that swept Pittsburgh in 1927 and 
St. Louis in 1928, and DiMaggio's Yankees, which swept the Chicago 
Cubs in 1938 and Cincinnati in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when it sounded like a mixture of Verdun, St.  
Mihiel, Ypres and the Somme as the `slammerese twins' rolled their 
heavy artillery into position and once more opened up the big 
blast,'' Grantland Rice wrote in the New York Herald Tribune after 
Ruth homered three times and Gehrig once in a 7-3 victory that 
capped the '28 Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Babe and Lou stalked through this series like the Four  
Horsemen of the Sock Eclipse -- Dyanmite, Demolition, Destruction 
and Death. And that spins out only part of the story. In addition, 
they were a pounding pestilence, a mauling misery, a clouting 
contagion, a black plague of mighty wallops that continued to clear 
out the right-field wall and threaten the lives and homes of those 
benighted denizens who lived in gunfire range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the fourth game at St. Louis, the Yankees trailed 2-1 before  
a four-run seventh. After going 110-44 in 1927, New York had 
``slumped'' to 101-53 and was the underdog going in, hampered by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the cripples came through,'' Ruth wrote in a  
first-person account in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ``And whatever 
may be said about our playing or our pitching or our hitting, 
there's one thing I don't think anyone can deny. They can't say we 
didn't have courage. I never expected to win this series in four 
straight games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth was 10-for-16 (.625) in the four games with three doubles,  
three homers and four RBIs. Gehrig was 6-for-11 (.545) with four 
homers and nine RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 11 years later, the Yankees did it again, with Charlie  
Keller going 7-for-16 (.438) with a double, a triple, three homers 
and six RBIs. Bill Dickey drove in five runs and DiMaggio went 
5-for-16 (.313). 
</P>
<P>
	New York trailed 4-2 in the ninth but tied the score, then won  
it with a three-run 10th. DiMaggio hit a go-ahead single to right, 
with Frank Crosetti scoring, and Keller slid home for a 6-4 lead as 
the ball got away from catcher Ernie Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Lombardi fell as Keller crossed the plate and no one went after  
the ball, and DiMaggio wound up coming all the way around on what 
the Herald Tribune called a `home-run' single. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signor Schnozzola is sleeping beauty of a strange spectacle,''  
said a headline in the New York Journal-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Much was made how manager Joe McCarthy matched Miller Huggins'  
feat of leading teams to consecutive sweeps. After the win, 
McCarthy led the team in the clubhouse singing ``East Side, West 
Side,'' and ``Roll Out the Barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No other manager, no other team has equaled that record in  
baseball's first 100 years,'' Bill Corum wrote in the 
Journal-American. ``None will in its second 100. ... The way it 
looks now, the Yankees' complete dominance of the baseball world is 
not for a month and not for a year, but for always.''

<HEADLINE> Giant Casino Opens in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- More than seven years after the Legislature  
approved the idea, Harrah's on Thursday opened Louisiana's biggest 
casino, just across the street from the French Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the public had to wait, however, to spend money at the  
100,000-square-foot casino. Ribbon-cutting ceremonies didn't begin 
until dusk and the rest of the evening was devoted to 
invitation-only celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mississippi, watch out! Las Vegas, watch out! Atlantic City,  
watch out! Harrah's New Orleans is here to stay. ... Like a 
phoenix, this project has risen after being written off by so 
many,'' Mayor Marc Morial told about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino has 2,900 slot machines and 120 table games in five  
New Orleans-themed and decorated rooms. It is the only land-based 
casino in the New Orleans area, where three other riverboat casinos 
also operate. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrah's opened a casino in 1995, but is closed in about six  
months after attracting only a third of its projected revenue, 
followed by three years of bankruptcy reorganization.

<HEADLINE> Texas Executes Killer of 94-Yr-Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man convicted of raping and fatally  
beating a 94-year-old woman who was watering her flowers was 
executed by injection Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo Cantu, 31, was the 28th inmate executed in Texas this  
year and the 82nd nationwide, the most since 83 were put to death 
in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay an hour  
before Virginia planned to execute a 31-year-old man for robbing 
and killing a couple in 1993. The justices agreed to hear the 
appeal of Michael Wayne Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantu was convicted of murdering Suda Eller Jones in 1988  
outside the home where she had lived in Dallas for 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantu insisted he was innocent. In a letter published on the  
Internet, the half-Hispanic, half-Apache former painter called 
himself ``an American Indian warrior held hostage in my homeland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence showed Cantu dragged Ms. Jones across her patio into  
the back yard, hauled the 97-pound woman over a 4-foot-high 
chain-link fence, and then beat, raped and sodomized her. Her head 
was repeatedly slammed into concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just couldn't find a worse crime,'' former prosecutor Andy  
Beach said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Michael Wayne Williams was sentenced to die for the  
slayings of Morris Keller Jr., 45, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth 
Keller, 34, in Cumberland County. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and an accomplice locked the Kellers in a closet and  
raped Mrs. Keller after searching the house for valuables. They 
shot and killed the couple before setting fire to the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The accomplice testified against Williams and got a life  
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the South Carolina Supreme Court blocked Friday's  
scheduled execution of a convicted cop killer. The court said it 
needed time to review materials filed after a woman recanted her 
trial testimony and said she was the one who pulled the trigger.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Tax Break Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans agreed Thursday to back an  
$8.5 billion measure to extend expiring tax breaks and were making 
headway in removing Democratic objections that blocked immediate 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters that  
Republicans had agreed to support moving the ``extenders'' bill 
through the Senate unanimously without any amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would extend several business tax credits  
through Dec. 31, 2000, including the research and development 
credit that expired June 30. It also would ensure that millions of 
average taxpayers who claim numerous personal tax credits do not 
get tangled up in the alternative minimum tax in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got broad support,'' Lott, R-Miss., said after a  
closed-door meeting of GOP senators. ``We want to do the 
extenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although most Democrats also support the items in the measure,  
at least three were blocking it at midday. One lawmaker, Sen. Bob 
Graham of Florida, announced later Thursday in a Senate floor 
speech he would withdraw his ``hold'' because it is important to 
move the tax measure forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is appropriate to allow the Senate to take up this  
legislation without further delay,'' Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he had objected because of an unrelated Medicare  
provider reimbursement measure that would spend $15 billion of the 
non-Social Security surplus. That is unlike the tax bill, which is 
fully offset with a variety of revenue raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to make the point that we're doing it right with  
the extenders bill,'' Graham said. ``I support that bill in large 
part because it's paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were optimistic they could overcome the other  
roadblocks as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're pretty close to a consensus,'' said Sen. Don  
Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate's second-ranking Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure is quite different from a five-year, $23.3  
billion bill pending in the House that would extend the research 
and development tax credit for five years and make the alternative 
minimum tax fix permanent. The two measures eventually would have 
to be reconciled before a final version is sent to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the mix is a Lott bill that blends parts of those two  
bills and omits others, while making the research and development 
credit permanent. That bill would cost $17 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite these differences, House Ways and Means Committee  
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, was optimistic a deal would be 
worked out before Congress adjourns this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the most part, we're on the same page,'' Archer said.  
``There is a strong desire to see the extenders pass before this 
session ends so we don't have them hanging over the new year.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees No Longer Bronx Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Derek Jeter was in the middle of the champagne  
celebration just like he was in the middle of almost every Yankees 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	He sprayed an entire bottle of the bubbly on Joe Torre's head.  
Then he got really adventurous and let loose on owner George 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Boss was in a forgiving mood. And why not?  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees had just completed their second straight  
World Series sweep, beating the Atlanta Braves 4-1 Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeter is in deep trouble,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Tell him I'm  
kidding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Past Yankees dynasties have been led by sluggers like Babe Ruth,  
Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson. For this group of 
Yankees -- the first team in 25 years to win three titles in four 
years -- no player defines it more than Jeter, the happy-go-lucky 
shortstop who arrived at the start of this run in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to give Yogi a run for his money,'' general manager  
Brian Cashman said, referring to Berra's 10 World Series titles. 
``We're just fortunate to have him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because these Yankees aren't really the Bronx  
Bombers anymore; they didn't rely on the longball to win the World 
Series. Jeter, known for his defense and clutch hitting, was one of 
the players who helped make sure the Yankees didn't need many home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York scored three runs in the third inning without an  
extra-base hit and Jim Leyritz added a homer as the Yankees became 
the first team in 60 years to sweep back-to-back Series. New York 
was also the last team to accomplish the feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we play for,'' Jeter said in a slightly subdued  
celebration that was dampened by the death of Paul O'Neill's father 
earlier in the day. ``We want to be the last team on the field. 
People wrote us off earlier in the season but we did it when we had 
to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operating with machinelike efficiency, the Yankees of the 1990s  
joined DiMaggio's teams of the 1930s and Mantle's of the 1950s as 
the only Yankees teams to win three Series titles in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But outside of a four-homer performance in Game 3 that brought  
back memories of the Bronx Bombers, this group of Yankees prefers a 
much slower method of offensive torture. 
</P>
<P>
	A majestic blast from Ruth, Mantle or Jackson typified great  
Yankees teams of the past. But Torre's Yankees, who didn't have a 
30-homer hitter for the second straight year, would rather foul off 
tough pitches, string together singles and work out walks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What helps us is that we're just thinking, 'jab, jab, jab,' as  
opposed to knockout punch,'' Torre said. ``We're thinking of a line 
drive. That's basically our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The big third-inning rally in Game 4, like so many for the  
Yankees, was started by their pesky one-two duo at the top of the 
lineup. In their second year as teammates, Jeter and Chuck 
Knoblauch have become close friends and frequent dinner partners. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the work they do against opposing pitchers that is most  
important to the Yankees, scoring nine of New York's 21 runs in the 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just try to get on base and let the other guys get us in,''  
Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knoblauch started the rally with an infield single that bounced  
off the glove of shortstop Walt Weiss, who couldn't make the 
backhand play. Jeter then lined an inside-out single to right 
field, sending Knoblauch to third base. 
</P>
<P>
	The table had been set. Now it was up to the middle of the  
lineup to finish the job. Of course, they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter stole second as O'Neill struck out. After Bernie Williams  
was intentionally walked by John Smoltz, Tino Martinez hit a hard 
grounder off first baseman Ryan Klesko's right arm for a two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
	One out later, Jorge Posada -- catching Roger Clemens for the  
first time in two months -- lined an RBI single to right to make it 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is 25 men all contributing to a goal,'' Cashman said.  
``We give Joe a number of players and he utilizes them perfectly. 
It's a different player every time.''

<HEADLINE>  Carolina Hurricanes' New Arena Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Hockey's nomads finally have a home.  
</P>
<P>
	After two years of playing ``home'' games at the Greensboro  
Coliseum 80 miles down Interstate 40 and starting this season with 
an NHL record-tying nine-game road trip, the Carolina Hurricanes 
will open the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a strange feeling,'' defenseman Glen Wesley  
said about playing in the team's new 18,700-seat arena. ``You can 
probably go all the way back to Hartford to where we felt like we 
had a home -- until we found out we were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been tough sleeping at night because you are so excited  
about coming down to the new rink and seeing the new things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Hartford Whalers left Connecticut for North Carolina  
following the 1996-97 season, but construction delays in the new 
building forced the team to play two years in Greensboro, where it 
was last in the NHL in attendance both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of times during that I-40 drive you wondered if the  
end would ever come,'' center Jeff O'Neill said of the 160-mile 
round trip for each home game. ``But we saw the light at the end of 
the tunnel and we stuck together as a team. Since I came into the 
league they have been talking about the Whalers moving and for me 
this is the end result. I've finally got a home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's home opener against the New Jersey Devils is sold out,  
not a very common occurrence for the Hurricanes. The team sold out 
only four games last season in Greensboro, where the coliseum had a 
black curtain lowered in the upper deck to hide empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't explain what the guys have quietly put up with over  
the last two years,'' coach Paul Maurice said. ``We didn't get a 
lot of complaining out of our locker room about the circumstances 
and I'm happiest for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina's solid 4-2-3 start during the season-opening nine-game  
road trip and the opening of the new arena has created somewhat of 
a hockey buzz throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice and the players hope the sport can catch on and give the  
team a home-ice advantage, something that was missing the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost a quarter of the way into our road schedule, now  
we have to make hay at home,'' said Maurice, whose team has 11 home 
dates in November. ``That will be a big test for us Friday. Are we 
going to be able to keep our emotions in check enough to play our 
game and not open it up too much and try to put on too big a 
show?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having 11,000 seats in the arena's lower bowl could make the new  
place rather loud, Maurice said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect it to be loud just based on the fans that we had  
last year and how loud they were,'' Maurice said. ``They came to 
yell and scream. There are some places that are like libraries 
around the league ... and that works against the home team. This 
building doesn't have any of those characteristics. They've done a 
great job with the slant of the lower bowl.''

	Snow was falling steadily through the afternoon in the Cascades  
of Washington and Oregon, the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana and 
Idaho, and the Clearwater Mountains of Utah. The heaviest rain was 
along a cold front stretching from southern Idaho into northwest 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington state, at least 50,000 customers lost power for  
about 24 hours after the early winter storm hit Wednesday, and a 
hiker was killed when a tree fell on her in strong winds about 20 
miles east of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong winds continued Thursday across much of the Northwest.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Southwest and southern Rockies, skies were fair to partly

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of Stabbing Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A man who claimed he stabbed his wife  
as many as 25 times in the back to conceal her suicide from their 
son was convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Storey, a 27-year-old Navy veteran, faces up to 26 years  
to life in prison when he is sentenced next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Storey told police that Ginny Change Storey was already dead  
when he stabbed her last year in their Fountain Valley apartment. 
He said he wanted to spare their son the trauma of dealing with her 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is absolutely ridiculous,'' prosecutor Chris Kralick told  
jurors during closing arguments in Storey's murder trial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Storey, 22, had just filed for divorce from her husband,  
who was discharged from the military for mental health reasons 
after serving in the 1993 peacekeeping mission in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Storey was found stabbed once in the stomach and up to 25  
times in the bedroom of the apartment the couple shared with her 
parents. Storey testified that he found his wife with a knife in 
her abdomen and believed she committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Storey's lawyer, Phil Zalewski, called the defense unusual but  
valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowhere does it say that unusual means unreasonable,'' he  
said. ``He walks into the bedroom and finds his wife, with his 
child, is taking her life. That night his universe crashed and he 
suffered a psychotic episode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zalewski also said it's possible that Storey ``felt guilty for  
her death and wanted to be punished'' by implicating himself to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found a suicide note written by Mrs. Storey, but  
prosecutors said she was forced to write it.

<HEADLINE> MSN Unveils Internet Call Waiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft's MSN Web service and Nortel Networks  
are offering an Internet version of call waiting and caller ID that 
lets people with one phone line log on and still know when they're 
getting a call and who's calling. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service, costing an extra $5 or $6 a month, uses a  
pop-up window on a computer screen to show when there's an incoming 
phone call, displaying the name and phone number of the caller. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop-up window offers a few alternatives if the person  
getting the call doesn't want to pick up the phone and end their 
Internet connection. The call can be forwarded to another number 
such as a voice mail line or mobile phone. The user can also send a 
recorded or generic ``call back'' message to the caller. Or, for 
those with the necessary equipment in their personal computer, the 
call can be answered through that PC without terminating the 
Internet connection. 
</P>
<P>
	MSN launched the service Thursday for its subscribers in  
Atlanta, Seattle and San Diego, and plans to offer it 50 major U.S. 
markets over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
	While Nortel's technology is somewhat new in this country, it  
has been available in Canada for more than a year. A similar 
service using Nortel's system was recently introduced in Chicago by 
Ameritech, the Baby Bell phone company that's been acquired by SBC 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	To use the service, subscribers also need to order ``call  
forward busy'' from their local phone companies, which costs from 
50 cents to $2 per month in most parts of the country, but can go 
as high as $3.35 a month in California communities served by 
Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no activation fee from Nortel or MSN, which hopes to  
integrate the monthly charge for Internet call waiting into its 
monthly bill. Nortel will operate the service for MSN and bill 
customers directly at first. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the added expense, the service could prove very  
attractive to consumers and small businesses, who might otherwise 
miss calls or have to pay the $15 to $25 a month it costs to have a 
second phone line. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, although the new high-speed offering called DSL, or  
digital subscriber line, enables a simultaneous Internet and 
telephone connection over a single phone line, the service 
generally costs from $40 to $60 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee Group, an industry research firm, predicts that 10  
million households will subscribe to Internet call waiting services 
by 2001, growing to 26 million by 2003. International Data Corp., 
another research firm, expects these services to generate $400 
million a year in revenues by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel, which usually doesn't operate the high-tech  
communications equipment it develops and manufactures, hopes to 
sell the service through numerous Internet service providers and 
local telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in discussions with a number of channel partners and  
we'll be making announcements over the next several months,'' said 
Irving Ebert, a product manager for Nortel Internet telephony 
products. He declined to provide further details.
