<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia's leading rugby league
player Allan Langer is believed to be considering a switch to the
London Broncos, the team owned by Virgin recording empire boss
Richard Branson.
	   Scrum half Langer, who was man of the series when Queensland
beat New South Wales in the annual Origin series this year, is
considered part of Branson's bid to boost rugby league's flagging
image in London, according to a report in Brisbane's Sunday Mail.
	   ``I have always thought about playing in England for a year or
two,'' Langer said. ``I'd listen to anything they (the London
Broncos) have to say.''
	   The Brisbane Broncos captain was left out of Australia's test
team in a controversial omission earlier this season. Before his
dominating role as Queensland captain this season Langer suggested
he might retire from representative football. He would not
elaborate at the end of the series.

Mosley, Reid win by knockouts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Shane Mosley defended his IBF lightweight
title for the fourth time with a fifth-round knockout of Wilfredo
Ruiz on Saturday night.
	   In the co-feature at the Apollo of Temple, Olympic gold medalist
David Reid also remained unbeaten with a fourth-round knockout of
Simon Brown in a junior middleweight fight.
	   Mosley (28-0) battered Ruiz (25-4) for five rounds, but the late
replacement for the injured Ivan Robinson refused to go down.
	   ``He was in great shape, and he really wanted the title,'' said
Mosley of the United States. ``But I didn't get frustrated because
I knew I would catch him.''
	   It looked as if Ruiz, a native of Colombia, wouldn't last the
first round of the scheduled 12-rounder as he stumbled into the
ropes midway through it after several combinations.
	   Mosley was leading on all scorecards when his straight right
sent Ruiz to the canvas 2:32 into the fifth round, his 26th
knockout.
	   ``I set it up with two body shots, which took the wind out of
him, then I went upstairs with the knockout punch,'' Mosley said.
``I thought he would go in the first, but he was a tough guy.''
	   Reid (10-0) earned his seventh knockout with a hard right hand
that stunned Brown (47-8) two minutes into the fourth round of the
scheduled 10-round fight. Brown stayed down well beyond the 10
count.
	   ``The right hand was devastating,'' Reid said. ``I was a little
too fast and slick for Simon tonight.''
	   Reid, who won the gold medal in 1996, came out aggressively
against his more experienced opponent. A right hook sent Brown of
the United States down early in the second round.
	   Reid said he felt no jitters before the hometown crowd of 4,832.
	   ``I knew there would be a lot of pressure but I wasn't nervous.
I stayed calm and let my hands go,'' he said. ``This is a tough
town to please, but hopefully when I win a world title, I'll come
back to defend it.''

More than 100 nations to seek first global ban on toxic chemicals 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Taking aim at the so-called ``dirty dozen,''
delegates from more than 100 nations begin negotiations Monday on
the first global treaty banning or reducing use of some of the most
toxic chemical pollutants.
	   At week-long talks in Montreal, sponsored by the U.N.
Environmental Program, delegates will try to set a framework for
producing a legally binding treaty by the end of 2000 that would
curb emissions of 12 of the most dangerous man-made substances.
	   Known as the ``dirty dozen,'' these chemicals include pesticides
such as DDT, toxaphene and chlordane, as well as industrial
products such as PCBs.
	   The substances, called ``persistent organic pollutants,'' or
POPs, persist for long periods in the environment and accumulate in
body tissues through food consumption. They can be carried across
national borders by wind or water currents and end up in the food
chain and water supplies of countries far from where they were
used.
	   Though many nations have banned at least some of the chemicals,
others continue to be widely used. For example, DDT is still
employed in the tropics to combat malaria.
	   Numerous studies have linked POPs with an array of health
problems, ranging from cancer to disorders of the nervous system to
low sperm counts in men. The toxins can be passed from mother to
fetus or to an infant through breast milk.
	   Dozens of non-government organizations are sending
representatives to the talks, hoping to use the occasion to
intensify pressure on governments for genuinely tough action.
	   ``The challenge is to turn promises and high-sounding rhetoric
into concrete, binding measures that will eliminate POPs in a
rapid, orderly and just manner,'' said Clifton Curtis, director of
the World Wildlife Fund's global toxics program.
	   Curtis' group is part of a coalition of environmental and health
organizations that will be seeking ways to help developing
countries put the treaty into effect and establish criteria for
expanding the list of banned chemicals.
	   Greenpeace, another group actively campaigning for a global ban,
warned that chemical industry lobbyists would be on hand during the
talks to play down the risks posed by POPs.
	   The five-day meeting in Montreal is expected to be the first in
a series of five negotiating sessions to iron out a treaty.

Clinton preaches religious unity to Chinese congregation AP White House Correspondent

Eds: Graf 6-7 new with parishioner reaction.
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ From the simple sanctuary of China's largest
Protestant church, U.S. President Bill Clinton preached a message
of unity and freedom Sunday in a nation where Christian leaders
have been jailed or harassed by the government.
	   ``I believe that Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters
as children of God,'' the president told the congregation. ``We
come here in that spirit today.''
	   In a country where Clinton's very attendance at church
highlighted the quest for religious freedom, he said, ``I believe
our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world
of different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   Clinton quoted from the Bible, Acts 17:26, ``God has made from
one blood every nation to dwell on the surface of the earth,'' and
added, ``I believe that is true.''
	   He spoke in the large sanctuary of Chongwenmen Church with white
plaster walls and brown wooden floor and ceiling. The squat gray
building _ unmarked by any steeple _ is tucked at the rear of a
hotel parking lot, past a row of shanties. Its has a congregation
of about 2,500.
	   Parishioners were hopeful Clinton's appearance at the
government-sanctioned church would make a difference. ``Now that
he's prayed with us, the Chinese government will greatly relax its
policies toward us Christians and our churches,'' said Liu Suxing.
	   She complained that churches not sanctioned by the government,
where many Christians prefer to worship, often are shut down. She
said the government ``says there is freedom of religion but in
reality it's not free.''

New fighters, new philosophy mark evolution of Taiwan's military 
</HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HSINCHU AIR BASE, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's military once stocked
up on tanks and landing craft to invade and retake the huge Chinese
mainland. Propaganda focused on defeating the ``communist
bandits.''
	   Today, the quixotic dream that an island of 20 million could win
a war against a country of 1.2 billion has been abandoned, and
Taiwan's military is focusing on defense. Taiwan has laid out
billions of dollars and is now bristling with new warplanes,
frigates and other advanced weapons.
	   The United States is the main supplier. It has sold Taiwan 150
F-16 fighters, and U.S. President Bill Clinton is certain to hear
about Taiwan on his visit to China. Beijing officials say the
United States should not sell advanced weapons to Taiwan.
	   Nowhere is the military transformation as obvious as on Hsinchu
Air Base, where French-made Mirage 2000-5 fighters are located only
80 miles (130 kilometers) from the mainland.
	   ``If the communists dare launch an attack, they'd better come
prepared to lose their arms or legs _ if not get killed,'' said
Col. Chang Nien-hua, the base's top administrator.
	   Taiwan split from China in 1949. When Communists defeated Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists on the mainland, Chiang moved here. Both
sides regarded that as a temporary situation, and China still views
Taiwan as a renegade province subject to forcible reintegration.
	   Taiwan argues that buying modern weapons could help deter an
invasion, and possibly spare the West the pain of defending it. But
the island also realizes that it must not count on Western military
intervention in the post-Cold War era. A defense buildup therefore
is vital.
	   Taiwan has spent dlrs15 billion on Mirages, F-16s and six
French-built Lafayette frigates. It has leased six Knox-class
missile frigates, bought new tanks, developed its own advanced
cruise and ballistic missiles, and acquired a U.S.-made
anti-missile defense system.
	   The arrival of 40 Mirage 2000-5s since last year, with 20 more
to come, has allowed the base to retire its 1960s-era F-104
Starfighters.
	   Military officials are confident the new air force will have
superiority over China's People's Liberation Army _ at least for a
while. They plan to buy more anti-submarine warfare planes to
strengthen Taiwan's sea defense.
	   The evolution from a force that once bought landing craft for
use on China's beaches is obvious at this base. Cold War-era
slogans like ``Retake the Mainland, Eradicate the Communist
Bandits'' are gone.
	   Instead, Maj. Gen. Ko Kuang-yueh, commander of the fighter wing,
focuses on building professionalism among his 2,000 officers and
encouraging pilots to stay in the military.
	   Ko's 92-year-old father was a pilot in Chiang's air force _ part
of a colorful history including dogfights with Japanese invaders
and ties to the American volunteers known as the Flying Tigers.
	   Retaking the mainland from the Communists motivated Ko and five
older brothers to join the military. The oldest brother was shot
down and killed on a reconnaissance mission over eastern China in
1963.
	   The change in philosophy doesn't mean that ``you don't know what
you're fighting for without a bitter enemy or an imminent war,'' Ko
said.

Mike McCullough leads Jay Sigel by one in quest for first win. AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
	   CLIFTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mike McCullough, seeking his first
win in an official U.S. PGA Tour event, shot a 7-under-par 65 to
take a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the dlrs 1.1 million
Cadillac NFL Golf Classic on Saturday.
	   Jay Sigel was a shot behind after shooting a 64, the low round
in this week's senior tournament, while Jim Colbert, Larry Nelson
and Bruce Summerhays were two shots out heading into Sunday's final
round.
	   Despite windy conditions on the tight Upper Montclair Country
Club, the old, tree-lined course gave up some very good rounds as
the greens held shots after an hour-long rain on Friday. There were
44 players who shot par or better in the second round.
	   First-round leader Charles Coody was among those who struggled,
shooting a 1-over-par 73 to fall five shots off the pace. Defending
champion Bruce Crampton and Dave Stockton, who were one shot off
the lead Friday, shot 2-under-par 70s and were in a group three
shots back at 7-under-par.
	   McCullough was as surprised as anyone being in the lead, not so
much because of the way he was playing but the course. It favors
players who are either long hitters or draw the ball off the tee.
	   McCullough likes to hit a fade, but that didn't prevent him from
making eight birdies and a bogey in posting his second-best round
ever in a Senior PGA Tour event. He had a 64 last week in the final
round of the AT&AMP;T Canada Senior Open in finishing tied for sixth.
	   ``I consider myself an underdog even though I am leading the
tournament because it is very, very hard for me to play this golf
course,'' McCullough said. ``I sound like I am making an excuse,
and I don't apologize for saying what I said, but I can tell you
from the bottom of my heart this golf course is hard for me to
play.''
	   The 53-year-old McCullough cherished having the lead entering
the final round for only the third time in his senior career, but
he admitted he would not feel comfortable about winning unless he
had a big lead heading to the final hole.
	   McCullough played on the PGA Tour from 1973-96, and his best
finish was a second at the Tournament Players Championship in 1977.
He won the Magnolia Classic that year, but it was an unofficial
tournament then, held during the same week of the Masters.
	   This has been McCullough's best year on the Senior Tour with
four Top 10 finishes, including a second in the Southwestern Bell
Dominion in March. His dlrs 404,287 in earning are a personal
record on the senior tour, which he joined in 1995.
	   McCullough had birdies ranging in length from 2 feet (0.61
meters) to 30 feet (9.14 meters) in finishing with a 10-under-par
total of 134.
	   The long-hitting Sigel, who is looking for his second win of the
year, only used his driver a couple of times in making nine birdies
and a bogey.
	   ``I didn't expect a 64 with the wind, but I made my share of
putts,'' said Sigel, whose birdies were all under 20 feet (6.10
meters), including four under six feet (1.83 meters).
 &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  Arnold Palmer shot a 1-under-par 71 for his first sub-par
round in his last 40, dating to the Northville Classic in Long
Island in August. The King birdied the last two holes on Saturday
to break par. ... Buzz Thomas recorded the fourth hole-in-one on
the Senior PGA Tour this year, acing the 178-yard (162.71 meters)
No. 17 hole with an 8-iron. Don January, Brian Barnes and J.C.
Snead had the other holes-in-one this year.

Iranian-Americans urge better ties with homeland

RETRANSMITTING to fix slug line
AP Photo pursuing
By JOSEF FEDERMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For the umpteenth time, Iran was under fire in
Congress.
	   Sen. Dianne Feinstein was leading the calls on this occasion,
urging tighter background checks for students entering the United
States from Iran and other hostile countries. Her concern: American
universities could potentially help terrorist-supporting countries.
	   Feinstein's criticism of Iran was nothing new in Washington, but
the response she received was. Soon after her February testimony,
she was contacted by a group of Iranian-Americans objecting to her
comments.
	   ``We were severely insulted,'' said Dr. Kamyar Kalantar, a San
Francisco physician who says there has never been a terrorism case
in the United States involving an Iranian student or immigrant.
	   Large numbers of Iranians began coming to the United States
during the 1979 Islamic Revolution that drove the shah from power.
	   But with U.S.-Iranian animosities seething _ Iranians held
Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Washington accused
Iran of supporting terrorists, and Iranian leaders tarred the
United States as the decadent ``great Satan'' _ few Iranians got
involved in politics here.
	   Now, led by a savvy new generation and encouraged by the
election of a moderate president in Iran, Iranian-Americans are
increasingly urging the United States to make peace with their
former homeland.
	   ``To take political action is kind of a new frontier. I'm (just)
worried we're too late,'' said Shahriar Afshar, president of the
Iranian Trade Association, a group working to end U.S. sanctions on
Iran.
	   In addition to lobbying members of Congress, Iranian-Americans
are writing newspaper columns and cooperating with other interest
groups to pursue their cause. With about 1 million ethnic Iranians
living in America, they are also considering endorsing candidates.
	   Iranian-American activists interviewed for this story said they
have no ties to any political faction in Iran. But they clearly
support Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to improve
ties with the United States, despite hard-line opposition in his
country.
	   ``It's a new era in Iran. Sure Khatami's got a difficult time.
Now we want to help him,'' Afshar said.
	   More than half the Iranians living in the United States are in
California, with large communities in New York, Texas and
Washington, D.C., activists say.
	   Most have kept a low profile. Some were hindered by language or
cultural barriers. Others feared retribution over Iran's alleged
ties to terrorism and the hostage crisis.
	   ``Being an Iranian in the U.S. during the 1980s was not an easy
time,'' Afshar said. ``We were from a country that it was almost
publicly acceptable to hate.''
	   That appears to be changing with the generation of
Iranian-Americans who grew up in the United States.
	   ``These children are very interested in rediscovering their
roots. They also have a sense on how things are done in the U.S. in
a way their parents did not,'' said Gary Sick, a presidential
adviser during the Iranian revolution.
	   Amir Zamaninia, a spokesman for Iran's U.N. mission, said his
government has no ties with Iranian-American groups. He declined
comment on their growing range of activities.
	   Some U.S. corporations with interest in Iran are joining the
lobbying effort.
	   The San Diego-based Iranian Trade Association has attracted more
than 20 corporate sponsors to its campaign against sanctions, said
Afshar, a 30-year-old former worker in that city's trade office.
Among his sponsors is Conoco, which had a dlrs 1 billion oil-field
project in Iran blocked by the U.S. government in 1995.
	   Gary Marfin, Conoco's manager for government affairs, said the
company's alliance with Iranian-Americans is part of its general
opposition to economic sanctions.
	   ``About the only impact sanctions do have is lost business and
lost job opportunities in the U.S.,'' Marfin said.
	   Another group, Iranians for International Cooperation, seeks to
promote dialogue and cultural exchanges as well as economic ties
between Iran and America.
	   Trita Parsi, a graduate student who leads the group from Sweden,
said opening Iran to the West will reduce tensions and ultimately
help average people in impoverished Iran.
	   Noting that most exiles still have relatives in Iran, he said
ordinary Iranians want friendly ties with the West.
	   ``Khatami has promised more personal freedom, the rule of law
and better relations with Iran's neighbors and the West. We agree
with these goals and want to do what we can to make their
fulfillment possible,'' Parsi said.
	   On the individual level, hundreds of Iranian-Americans have
contacted members of Congress since Khatami's election, said Rep.
Robert Ney, R-Ohio, who is a leading supporter of improving
relations with Iran.
	   ``About 90 percent of these people ask us to please think about
communication'' with Iran, he said.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ From the simple sanctuary of China's largest
Protestant church, U.S. President Bill Clinton preached a message
of unity and freedom Sunday in a nation where Christian leaders
have been jailed or harassed by the government.
	   ``I believe that Chinese and Americans are brothers and sisters
as children of God,'' the president told the congregation. ``We
come here in that spirit today.''
	   In a country where Clinton's very attendance at church
highlighted the quest for religious freedom, he said, ``I believe
our faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world
of different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   After the services, Clinton and his family toured the ancient
palaces and courtyards of the Forbidden City, the spectacular
walled enclave that was the residence for 24 emperors of Ming and
Qing dynasties.
	   ``It's an amazing place,'' Clinton marveled. Then, the
presidential party set out to visit the Great Wall.
	   At the church, Clinton quoted from the Bible, Acts 17:26, ``God
has made from one blood every nation to dwell on the surface of the
earth,'' and added, ``I believe that is true.''
	   He spoke in the large sanctuary of Chongwenmen Church with white
plaster walls and brown wooden floor and ceiling. The squat gray
building _ unmarked by any steeple _ is tucked at the rear of a
hotel parking lot, past a row of shanties. Its has a congregation
of about 2,500.
	   Parishioners were hopeful Clinton's appearance at the
government-sanctioned church would make a difference. ``Now that
he's prayed with us, the Chinese government will greatly relax its
policies toward us Christians and our churches,'' said Liu Suxing.
	   She complained that churches not sanctioned by the government,
where many Christians prefer to worship, often are shut down. She
said the government ``says there is freedom of religion but in
reality it's not free.''
	   There was a brief disruption when a middle-aged woman walked up
the aisle toward the president's pew. Some members of the
congregation tried to grab her but she shook them off, saying she
wanted to see Clinton. ``Don't throw me out, I'll leave of my own
accord,'' she shouted.
	   She was escorted to the rear of the sanctuary and sat silently
through the service. Afterward, she was allowed to see Clinton and
told him she was a charismatic Christian, thanked him for coming to
China and expressed hope that China's leaders would become
Christians, a White House official said. Members of the
congregation would not allow reporters to talk to the woman, said
to be from another province.
	   Human rights groups say dozens of Protestant and Catholic
leaders are imprisoned or held in Chinese labor camps for refusing
to bow to government control. Clinton and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin agreed to exchange visits of religious leaders to further
understanding on spiritual matters.
	   Clinton's wife, Hillary, and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will carry the call for religious freedom Wednesday when
they visit the Ohel Rachel Synagogue in Shanghai. It was a haven
for persecuted Jews during World War II.
	   On Saturday, Clinton and Jiang treated China to an uncensored
airing of differences on human rights, freedom, trade and Tibet.
The leaders eagerly jumped in after each other to get the last
word. It was spirited but cordial, and neither leader was reluctant
to emphasize differences.
	   ``You can see that neither one of us are shy about being strong
about how we believe,'' Clinton said.
	   American officials applauded China's willingness to broadcast
Saturday's news conference across the land, from the temple-dotted
capital of Tibet in Chinese Central Asia to the flashy financial
center of Shanghai at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
	   The exchange also was telecast in America, but for China, it was
an unprecedented look at their leader standing side by side with
the American president, both men unflinching on areas of
controversy and disagreement.
	   Speaking afterwards, many Chinese expressed satisfaction with
the summit and the televised appearance.
	   ``For us Chinese, it really is new to see two presidents
speaking face-to-face, with reporters asking question, on live
television,'' said Andrea Yang, an insurance company employee in
Beijing. ``I hope we can see more of that in the future. This is
quite big progress.''
	   Clinton's critics back home weren't so happy with his
performance.
	   ``He reduced it to a disagreement. It's more than a
disagreement,'' said Republican Rep. Chris Smith, who chaired a
hearing on human rights in China on the eve of Clinton's welcome in
Beijing.
	   Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a longtime critic of Clinton on
China, said he treated the massacre around Tiananmen Square as a
``historical episode.''

U.S. Commerce Secretary opens fast food restaurant in China

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Given U.S. President Bill Clinton's known
fondness for fast food, it seemed fitting Sunday that America's top
trade official should highlight closer ties with China by opening
the world's 10,000th Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet.
	   Commerce Secretary William Daley said the restaurant chain's
newest outlet, its 260th in China, represented a ``success story.''
	   ``It's good to see a major U.S. business expand in the world.''
	   By Monday, Daley said he expected U.S. businesses to sign deals
worth as much as dlrs 1.5 billion in connection with President
Clinton's nine-day visit to China.
	   But Daley expressed disappointment over trade negotiators'
failure to reach a broad agreement on market access which could win
China entry into the World Trade Organization.
	   ``The bottom line is that we need China to come into the WTO,
but on commercially viable terms. It's a fact the market needs to
be opened more,'' he told reporters following the restaurant
opening.
	   Still, Daley said he viewed Clinton's summit meeting in Beijing
as a positive development for Sino-American relations.
	   ``We feel good about the summit,'' he said. ``This summit is
about many issues, not just commercial issues.''
	   Before leaving the ceremony at the restaurant, Daley sat down
with some children to nibble on a piece of fried chicken and some
French fries and to sip a cola.
	   Kentucky Fried Chicken was one of the first U.S. fast food
restaurants to enter the Chinese market. Its flagship outlet opened
in central Beijing in 1987.
	   Since then, a slew of other U.S. restaurant franchises have
opened hamburger, chicken, donut and pizza shops all over China.
	   U.S. fast food is so popular in China that many Chinese complain
about the negative impact on the health of the young people who
account for the bulk of fast food restaurant customers.

Thousands of demonstrators rally in East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) - Thousands of pro-independence protesters
marched Sunday in the streets of East Timor's capital, one day
after a man was shot and killed during a demonstration.
	   Watched by troops armed with rifles and tear gas canisters, the
chanting marchers in the city of Dili rallied peacefully against
Indonesian control in a bid to impress visiting European
ambassadors.
	   ``Hold a referendum in East Timor,'' read one banner raised by
the crowd. The column of protesters stretched for about one
kilometer (0.6 miles) through the streets of the seaside city.
	   Acting on behalf of the European Union, top envoys in Indonesia
from Britain, Austria and the Netherlands have been visiting on a
fact-finding mission in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province, triggering human
rights abuses and a long-running guerrilla war.
	   The United Nations and many governments refuse to recognize
Indonesia's claim of sovereignty over East Timor.
	   On Saturday, rival groups of protesters clashed in front of a
Catholic church in Manatutu, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of
Dili. Troops opened fire when groups of demonstrators who support
Indonesia's claim over the province clashed with opponents of it.
	   Witnesses said troops killed one man and seriously wounded two
others, but the military denied playing a role in the incident.
	   Clashes also broke out in Dili.
	   But in the peaceful protest in the capital on Sunday,
demonstrators marched from the University of East Timor to a hotel
where the European ambassadors are staying during their three-day
trip.
	   The protesters shouted slogans in support of imprisoned rebel
commander Xanana Gusmao, who was arrested in 1992 and is being held
in a maximum-security jail in Jakarta.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered to grant special
status to East Timor and to release Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition. However, separatist groups, as well as
Portugal and Gusmao, demand a referendum.

Two-headed girl born in Vietnam, doctors decide against surgery

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Doctors in Vietnam have decided not to
surgically separate the two heads of a baby girl who was born last
week.
	   The baby has been receiving supplemental oxygen in the
intensive-care ward of Children's Hospital No. 1 in Ho Chi Minh
City because of a heart complication, Dr. Cam Ngoc Phuong said
Saturday.
	   X-rays and examinations show the baby has two heads, two
backbones, two lungs and two hearts, but only one hipbone, one set
of reproductive organs, two arms and two legs, the doctor said.
	   The baby was born last Monday in the Mekong Delta province of
Tien Giang to a poor family of farmers. She is the first child of
Nguyen Bich Thuy, 26, and husband Le Thanh Toan, 25.
	   The baby was transferred to the hospital in Ho Chi Minh last
Wednesday.
	   Three years ago, another Vietnamese two-headed baby died after
surgery to remove one of its heads.

Last colonial governor says Hong Kong remains free 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Days before Hong Kong marks the first year of
its return to Chinese rule, the last colonial governor, Chris
Patten, said Sunday that the territory remains a free society.
	   ``Hong Kong is a free society under the rule of law. It was last
year, and it still is this year,'' Patten said.
	   He was speaking in a pre-recorded address broadcast on
state-owned Radio Hong Kong, his first public address in the
territory since his emotional departure last June 30 ended 150
years of colonial rule.
	   Patten said the territory's unyielding democratic spirit and
strong economic fundamentals will help Hong Kong rebound from
Asia's financial crisis.
	   Hong Kong has a clean civil service, a top rate police force,
``a rule of law that people recognize as their strongest shield,''
and ``an instinct, a taste for freedom,'' he said.
	   The territory also is free from some economic ills that plague
other Asian economies, such as slack regulation of banks and
financial services, corruption and nepotism, and crippling bad
loans, Patten said.
	   ``For all those reasons, Hong Kong is better placed than almost
any other society in Asia to withstand the raging storms,'' he
said.
	   A university poll last week found an overwhelming majority of
people believed Patten to have done a better job than post-handover
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Hong Kong's economy peaked shortly after the July handover, but
the region's financial crisis eventually dragged it into a
recession. Since then, property prices have dived 10 to 40 percent,
and the key stock index has lost almost half of its value.
	   Patten said he will return to Hong Kong in autumn as part of an
Asian promotional tour for his new book, East and West.
	   The Sunday Morning Post reported he will be here for three days
in late October, but will not visit mainland China.
	   Patten's book had been dropped by publisher HarperCollins, run
by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, allegedly for fear of upsetting
Beijing. The book is believed to criticize China's communist
government and its human rights record.
	   Patten later made a deal for his book with publishing house
Macmillan.
	   The former governor had a strained relationship with the Chinese
communist leadership for much of his five years as governor.
Beijing regularly criticized him.
	   To protest the democratic reforms Patten engineered without
China's consent, Beijing dismantled the elected pre-handover
legislature and replaced it with a mostly handpicked interim body
when it regained Hong Kong. A new legislature was elected last
month.

Newcastle on top of table 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY HARPER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Newcastle went back to the top of
Australia's National Rugby League table with a brilliant 36-12 win
over Parramatta at Marathon Stadium on Sunday.
	   The Knights have been under pressure with two players, including
test fullback Robbie O'Davis, testing positive to banned substances
and the whole club under the microscope.
	   O'Davis scored a try ahead of his pending tribunal appearance
and received strong support from a 25,000 home crowd.
	   ``I've brought it on myself but to have this sort of support is
great,'' said an emotional O'Davis. ``Every single person out there
is like your best friend.''
	   Newcastle brothers Andrew and Matthew Johns tormented the Eels
with their kicking game as the Knights took a one-point lead at the
top.
	   Parramatta was in third place with Melbourne in second.
	   Melbourne slipped from the top when Auckland sneaked a try after
the siren in their match at Olympic Park.
	   The Storm appeared to have the game in their keeping at 21-18
but Warriors scrum half Stacey Jones sent up a bomb and winger Tony
Tatupu pounced for the try. The video referee took five minutes to
award the try.
	   Storm coach Chris Anderson said the controversy over the drugs
case of prop Rodney Howe had unsettled the team.
	   Howe returned a positive test to an anabolic steroid, revealed
midweek, and admitted it was to help him overcome a knee injury.
	   ``It had made it difficult to concentrate on footy all week,''
Anderson said.
	   St. George was in equal fourth with Brisbane on 11-5 records
after their match Friday. Brisbane's Gorden Tallis returned to St.
George for the first time since his acrimonious split with the
Saints and scored the winning try.
	   Tallis was pelted with garbage and insults and was loudly booed
every time he touched the ball before his try secured a 30-18
victory.
	   ``It was a great feeling that try, I got a bit carried away but
you can only control your emotions for so long,'' Tallis said.
``They were chucking all sorts of stuff at me _ corn, tennis balls
and 20-cent pieces.''
	   Adelaide scored a 40-12 victory over Gold Coast at Carrara with
Graham Appo crossing three times in a club record win for the Rams.
	   Cronulla beat Canterbury 28-6 at home with David Peachey scoring
two tries.
	   Illawarra beat North Queensland 24-18 with both teams scoring
four tries each.
	   North Sydney downed Penrith 30-22 and Souths scored a rare win,
beating Balmain 16-12 at Leichhardt.

Six die from insulin shortage in Kazakstan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A severe shortage of insulin in the Central Asian
nation of Kazakstan has led to the deaths of six diabetics, the
president of the country's Diabetes Association said Sunday.
	   The president, Natalia Tukalevskaya, told the ITAR-Tass news
agency that federal authorities in the former Soviet republic
failed to place the proper orders for the drug last November.
	   She said that six insulin-dependent diabetics have already died
in the country's Karagandinsky and Mangistausky districts, and
warned that thousands more were at risk.
	   The report did not say when the deaths took place.

Strong quake kills 108 in southern Turkey pipeline still functional; CHANGES overline.

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake that rattled this southern
city and nearby towns has killed at least 108 people and injured
about 1,000, news reports and witnesses said.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 37 people who lived in the
slums of Adana, a city of 1 million about 250 miles (400
kilometers) south of the capital, Ankara, said Deputy Gov. Ardahan
Totuk.
	   Mustafa Karsli, a hospital official in nearby Ceyhan, said 41
bodies had been brought to the hospital morgue and at least 200
other people were injured.
	   ``It is not finished yet,'' Karsli said. ``There are scores of
people still under the collapsed buildings.'' Rescue workers were
using earthmoving machinery to uncover people buried in rubble in
Ceyhan, where the quake leveled at least four downtown buildings.
Ceyhan, site of an oil terminal, is about 30 miles (48 kilometers)
east of Adana.
	   ``They are dead, all of them are dead,'' said Huseyin Atasoz,
gazing at the remains of a five-story building in Ceyhan. Five of
Atasoz's relatives, including three teen-agers, were inside the
building when it collapsed.
	   Turkey's state radio said 107 people had been killed, and
rescuers later pulled at least one more body from a collapsed
building. The number of injured had reached about 1,000, Gov. Oguz
Koksal said.
	   But Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu said only 12 of the
injured were in critical condition.
	   The hardest hit areas were slum areas with poorly constructed
buildings. The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several
buildings, including mosques.
	   Etem Zerenturk, 47, said he lost three relatives in one of the
buildings that collapsed in Adana's low-income Tepebagi district.
	   ``I got shocked when I heard that they were inside. They were so
young,'' he said.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory. The
U.S. Geological Survey put the preliminary magnitude at 6.2 and
said the quake rattled the neighboring provinces of Mersin, Nigde
and Kayseri, as well as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off
Turkey's southern coast.
	   ``I thought I'd die,'' said Suna Cicel, 37, while watching
rescue workers pick through piles of rubble early Sunday in search
of more victims in Adana. ``I am very happy to be alive. I ran into
the street in panic when the walls of my house began to crack.''
	   According to an announcement from the headquarters of the U.S.
Air Forces in Europe, 25 people at Incirlik air base sustained
minor injuries. The announcement did not say how many were
Americans.
	   But a U.S. Embassy spokesperson, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that a dozen U.S. citizens
were lightly injured by falling objects.
	   The brief U.S. statement also said the earthquake caused
structural and electrical damage to buildings on base. Because the
phone lines were knocked out in the quake, it was impossible to
call the base directly for further details.
	   The oil pipeline linking Iraq to Turkey was functioning and did
not appear to suffer any damage, according to an oil terminal
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The temblor knocked
out power to most of Adana.

Clintons visits past, marvels at future With Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Walking through the Forbidden City, where
emperors who believed they had heavenly authority ruled for five
hundred years, U.S. President Bill Clinton marveled at the contrast
with China's modern-day transformation.
	   ``In the last 25 years, it's changed quite a lot,'' the
president said as he toured the spectacularly walled imperial
courtyards with Hillary Rodham Clinton and their daughter, Chelsea.
	   Asked if China had changed enough, Clinton said, ``After
yesterday, I feel quite good about it.''
	   On Saturday, Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin engaged
in a lively debate televised across China, with the leaders airing
their nations' deep differences over human rights. It was the first
such exchange involving a Chinese leader broadcast nationwide.
	   Playing tourist Sunday, Clinton strolled through a maze of
buildings and courtyards in the Forbidden City where emperors hid
and commoners weren't allowed until the 1911 revolution ended the
Qing Dynasty.
	   ``It's an amazing place,'' Clinton said, looking at 30-foot-high
red walls and steep golden roofs amid marble steps and statues.
	   Chelsea pointed out a series of gargoyles that lined some roofs.
	   ``Look, Dad. Every one is different. See all the little
animals?'' Chelsea said.
	   The imperial palace, which took 14 years to build, was dotted
with incense burners the size of barrels and sundials made of
stone, representing the belief that emperors even had power over
time.
	   Clinton walked through most of the complex and passed through
the ``Gate of Heavenly Purity'' in the emperor's inner court,
beyond which only women and eunuchs were allowed after dark.
	   The emperors, like Chinese authorities today, were extremely
security conscious, too. The courtyards were built with nine
stories of brickwork underground so assassins could not tunnel
underneath the city.

Burn 4, Revolution 3, SO 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ The Dallas Burn twice overcame
two-goal deficits then beat the New England Revolution in a
shootout to cap a 4-3 victory Saturday night.
	   Dallas (9-7) outscored New England 4-2 in the shootout and the
loss was the eighth straight for New England (4-11).
	   Dallas, which had lost six straight matches to New England, tied
it 3-3 in the 65th minute when midfielder Ted Eck scored.
	   In the shootout, Eck scored the decisive goal on the Burn's
fifth attempt. The Revolution had fallen behind 3-2 when Ivan
McKinley's shot was stopped by Dallas goalkeeper Mark Dodd on New
England's second attempt and Joe-Max Moore's shot on the fourth
attempt sailed wide to the right.
	   New England scored two goals in the first nine minutes and led
3-2 at halftime.
	   Revolution striker Raul Diaz Arce, the MLS' second-leading goal
scorer, netted his 11th of the season at the six-minute mark, and
New England added an own goal at the nine-minute mark when Eck
headed in a corner kick from the right wing taken by the
Revolution's Edwin Gorter.
	   Jason Kreis of Dallas scored at the 19-minute mark on a direct
kick, and Gorter put New England ahead 3-1 at the 28-minute mark on
a 20-yard (18.2-meter) shot.
	   Dallas striker Damian made it 3-2 in the 43rd minute.
 &UR; Fusion 2, Mutiny 1, SO &QC; 
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Paulinho, playing in his second MLS
game, beat Tampa Bay's Thomas Ravelli in the final shootout round
and the Miami Fusion snapped a six-game losing streak with a 2-1
victory over the Mutiny on Saturday night.
	   The win was Miami's first without midfielder Carlos Valderrama,
who has missed the past month to be with Colombia's national team
at the World Cup.
	   Paulinho dribbled around Ravelli as Miami won the shootout 3-2.
John Maessner and Diego Serna also converted for the Fusion (6-10).
	   Frank Yallop and Paul Young scored in the shootout, keeping
Tampa Bay (4-13) in contention after the Mutiny missed their first
two attempts.
	   Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead in the 54th minute on Alan Prampin's
third goal of the year.
	   Miami tied it in the 68th minute when Marcelo Herrera took a
pass from Serna and blasted a shot past Ravelli from 30 yards out.
 &UR; Galaxy 2, Clash 1 &QC; 
	   In San Jose, California, Paul Caligiuri and Harut Karapetyan
scored second-half goals to lead the Los Angeles Galaxy to a 2-1
victory over the San Jose Clash on Saturday night.
	   Karapetyan scored in the 85th minute, just moments after
entering the game as a substitute. Karapetyan controlled a rebound
off the post and sent the ball into an empty net to give the Galaxy
(14-2) the lead.
	   Caligiuri also scored on a rebound, sending in a loose ball
following a penalty kick in the 64th minute.
	   The Clash (5-11) scored in the 15th minute on Richard Gough's
header off a cross from U.S. national team player Eric Wynalda.

Recession fears loom as Singapore prepares to slash forecast 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Only two days before Singapore is expected to
slash its growth forecasts for the year, a government minister
hinted that a mild recession is a real possibility for the
city-state's increasingly troubled economy.
	   Minister without portfolio Lim Boon Heng would not rule out the
possibility Singapore's economy could shrink, but he was quoted by
The Sunday Times newspaper as saying on Saturday that the country
is probably ``not going into a bad recession.''
	   Many of Lim's colleagues have said they do not anticipate a
recession at all, though Singapore's prime minister has conceded
negative growth is plausible if the regional economic situation
deteriorates further.
	   As the Asian crisis begins to seriously pressure Singapore's
vulnerable economy, Finance Minister Richard Hu is scheduled to
revise the government's rosy economic forecast when Parliament
meets on Monday.
	   Hu also plans to announce a package of special measures to
soften the economy's landing in the event of a recession.
	   The government has resolutely maintained a forecast announced in
February for growth between 2.5 and 4.5 percent in 1998, despite an
steadily increasing drumbeat of warnings from private sector
economists of lower growth or outright recession.
	   Lim, who also heads a government-linked coalition of unions,
also cautioned workers not to rely on the pay bonuses they normally
enjoy, since they will almost certainly be cut this year.
	   He added that employers' contributions to Singapore's mandatory
pension system, called the Central Provident Fund (CPF), will not
be reduced.
	   Organizations representing employees have urged the government
not to cut the required 20 percent company contribution to workers'
pensions.
	   Singaporeans rely on the pension scheme, which is often drawn
upon to help finance property mortgages. Housing loans have become
an increased burden for average home owners because of recent
interest rate hikes.

Bridge collapses on mayor Moscow highway, 10 injured 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bridge under construction along the large
highway that encircles Moscow collapsed late Saturday, a news
agency reported. Ten people were reported injured.
	   The accident occurred at the highway's intersection with another
major artery, the Dmitrovskoye Shosse, around 11 p.m. when traffic
was relatively light, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Ten people received light injuries, the report said, citing
ambulance officials. Traffic was restricted in both directions.
	   The report did not say whether the bridge was part of the
central highway or one of many ramps connecting it to the
Dmitrovskoye Shosse.
	   Police and traffic officials were not available for comment
early Sunday.

For Beijingers, Clinton's visit means traffic jams, blocked roads 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Having a U.S. president in town can certainly
muck up your travel plans. For residents of Beijing, blocked roads,
traffic jams, and heavy police security have been among the many
inconveniences due to President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   On Sunday, dozens of police, plain clothed and uniformed, sealed
off roads around a church where the Clinton's attended service.
Some members of the congregation of the Chongwenmen Church said
they began lining up more than three hours before the service,
which started at 9:30 a.m. (0130 GMT).
	   Public buses were blocked from passing through the area, leaving
their passengers sweltering in the heat. The local subway station
was declared shut for four hours, with trains running by the
station without stopping.
	   About 30 minutes before Clinton's arrival, outside the nearby
Beijing Railway Station three police detained a man and dragged him
away by his feet, scrapping one of his arms raw and bloody on the
ground.
	   The man, apparently a migrant laborer, grimaced in pain but
didn't cry out. It wasn't clear why police arrested him.
	   Outside the church, police were generally polite in directing
people away from the area, but also didn't make many exceptions.
	   ``I can't make any trouble for you,'' an old man in a wheelchair
told an officer blocking his way. ``It's hot and I'm sweaty.''
	   But the policeman refused to let him pass, telling instead to
shelter under a shady tree and wait.
	   ``Go, go, go, go, go. You can't stay here,'' another officer
shouted at people who lingered on a sidewalk, curious to see what
was going on.
	   ``Can I use the toilet here?'' an anxious-sounding rickshaw
driver asked officers blocking a narrow street.
	   ``You'll have to wait, and find another,'' one of them replied,
to laughter from passersby.
	   Despite the security measures, only a few people grumbled out
loud, mostly in off-color terms. Many people were in good spirits
as they waited for a glimpse of Clinton's motorcade or for roads
around the church to reopen.
	   ``It's totally necessary. It's for Clinton's safety, we
understand that,'' said Deng Min, a 38-year-old environmental
scientist who had planned to go window-shopping.

Thousands greet Iranian soccer team on return to Tehran 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TERHAN, Iran (AP) _ Blowing trumpets and waving flags, thousands
of jubilant Iranians welcomed the World Cup team Sunday, a
homecoming that mixed disappointment at the team's disqualification
with joy over its win against the United States.
	   Some fans waited for hours outside Tehran's Mehrabad Airport,
where the team arrived before dawn. Fans waved the red, white and
green Iranian flag and wore the team's jersey or T-shirts with the
picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   Others blew plastic trumpets in a noisy reception.
	   ``Our boys played very well,'' coach Jalal Talebi said. ``We are
pleased to see our people receiving the team so warmly.''
	   Iran lost 2-0 Thursday to a powerful German team that knocked it
out of the World Cup in the first round. But the defeat came just
four days after Iran's 2-1 win over the United States, a game
charged with political significance born of the hostility between
Washington and Tehran since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The win, Iran's first in World Cup action, started an all-night
party in Tehran. Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran, Iran.'' Honking cars sped aimlessly across the
city of 10 million, and women distributed sweets and candies.
	   ``Our performance was good, especially beating the United
States. That was great. Thank God for that,'' Mehdi Pashazadeh, a
defender on the team, said at the airport.
	   Dozens of cars carrying flags followed the players' bus as it
made its way from the airport into the city. Some young boys danced
in the back of pickup trucks in scenes reminiscent of last week's
celebration.
	   ``I hope our people are satisfied with us,'' said Mehdi
Mahdavikia, a midfielder who scored the team's second goal against
the United States. ``We did our best.''

	   Ten people were injured, Interfax said, citing ambulance
officials. The ITAR-Tass news agency said three of the injured were
in serious condition.
	   Traffic was restricted Sunday in both directions as crews worked
to clear the debris.
	   The reports did not say whether the bridge was part of the
central highway or one of many ramps connecting it to the
Dmitrovskoye Shosse.
	   Police and traffic officials were not available for comment
early Sunday.

Marshall returns as All Blacks look ahead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Black scrum-half Justin
Marshall returned to action after an Achilles injury Sunday to put
himself in the frame for the tri-nations series against Australia
and South Africa.
	   Marshall's incident-free outing in New Zealand A's 60-7 win over
Tonga was good news for an All Blacks outfit which expressed
disappointment over a 40-10 victory against England on Saturday.
	   So bad had the English been before Saturday that they heralded
the 30-point loss with great pride while the All Blacks started
looking for excuses.
	   Marshall captained the All Blacks while Sean Fitzpatrick was
injured last season and is considered vital to a successful season.
Fitzpatrick has since retired, along with Zinzan Brooke, and Taine
Randell has taken over the captaincy.
	   Marshall snapped his Achilles tendon in March and was not
expected back until August.
	   ``I'm thrilled to get through the game,'' Marshall said after a
low-key game Sunday. ``It's been a long time out and to get through
80 minutes I was really stoked.''
	   New Zealand's selectors will name their squad Tuesday for the
July 11 tri-nations opener, against Australia in Melbourne, and
Marshall should win a recall.
	   ``That's in the hands of the gods,'' Marshall said. ``It's
really out of my control.''
	   Hart said Marshall has a ``pretty strong'' chance of getting
picked Tuesday.
	   ``It's just amazing what he's done in terms of getting back so
quick,'' Hart said.
	   New Zealand's main area of concern is the tight five, an
experienced group which was dominated by the English early in
Saturday's test. But Hart said he would resist change.
	   ``Realistically, you've got to look at the best options to play
Australia in Melbourne,'' said Hart. ``You cannot go and play
Australia without experience. I don't think we should underestimate
that requirement.''
	   England's loss followed a 64-22 defeat in the first test and a
world record 76-0 loss to Australia. The tourists now head to South
Africa for a one-off test in a strangely upbeat mood for a team
well beaten in all five games on tour.
	   ``We were very competitive for 60 minutes, we leave New Zealand
in a far better heart than we came,'' said captain Matt Dawson.
``The forwards were magnificent. I've never played behind such a
committed pack before and I'm desperately sorry for them.''

Two dead in rioting, appeal for calm before singer's funeral 
</HEADLINE>
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The government and the family of slain
singer-activist Lounes Matoub appealed for calm after rioting in
Algeria's Berber region left two people dead. Mourners and police
gathered near his burial site before dawn Sunday.
	   Leaders in the mountainous region east of Algiers called a
general strike Sunday, while the ethnic Berber singer was to be
laid to rest at a cemetery in his hometown three days after he was
killed by Muslim militants.
	   The Interior Ministry and Matoub's family called for an end to
the three days of unrest against the 6-year-old Muslim insurgency
as well as the military-backed government's law making Arabic the
only official language on July 5.
	   Youths stoned police, burned state buildings and tore down
Arab-language signs in the regional capital Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms (60
miles) east of Algiers, as well as in other Berber cities.
	   Two demonstrators were killed _ one in Tizi-Ouzou and the other
in the town of Sidi Aich, hospital sources said on condition of
anonymity. Injury figures were not available.
	   The Interior Ministry said an 18-year-old man was fatally shot,
but authorities said security forces were not to blame.
	   Several youths considered as leaders of the violence were
arrested, residents said, but no figures were available.
	   It was believed the largest unrest in the region since the
so-called Berber Spring uprising of 1980.
	   The 42-year-old singer, riddled by bullets at a fake roadblock
outside his native village, was to be buried Sunday near his
hometown of Beni Douala at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT).
	   Police lined Taourit Moussa cemetery and the road leading to it,
while dozens of admirers spent the night outside.
	   Matoub, a defender of Berber culture, was the latest Algerian
artist to be slain during an insurgency that has claimed more than
75,000 lives.
	   The Arabic-only law move was seen as an effort of the
military-backed government to appease supporters of Islamic
movements.
	   The Rally for Culture and Democracy, in a statement, accused the
government of President Liamine Zeroual of ``passive complicity
with the fundamentalists.''
	   While there was no claim of responsibility for Matoub's slaying,
officials blamed it on the Armed Islamic Group, the insurgency's
most violent movement, which kidnapped the singer in 1994 and held
him for two weeks.
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment. The Front has condemned Matoub's
assassination.

Widespread medical leave swindle emerging in Singapore 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A recently revealed swindle involving Malaysian
employees in Singapore using faked medical certificates to take
paid days off appears to have been a widespread practice, The
Sunday Times reported.
	   No less than 95 percent of 500 medical certificates from
Sultanah Aminah Hospital in neighboring Johor Bahru _ across the
border in Malaysia _ were discovered to be forgeries, hospital
director Dr. Samsiah Mohamad Yusoff said.
	   News of the swindle broke two weeks ago, when more than 100
Malaysian employees of Seagate Technology were arrested for using
faked certificates. Singapore imports much of its labor force from
neighboring countries, including Malaysia.
	   Since then, companies throughout Singapore have been sending
hundreds of medical leave forms back to the Johor Bahru hospital
for verification, the newspaper said.
	   Aside from the incident at Seagate, employees of CISCO and the
Singapore Bus Service have also been arrested or fired.
	   Malaysian police are investigating the case, and believe the
forged certificates were supplied by a syndicate that has been
operating for four years, the newspaper said.

Estrada urges Filipinos to unite after furor over Marcos burial 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo Planned
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada urged
Filipinos Sunday to unite after a stormy dispute provoked by his
endorsing the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a
heroes' cemetery.
	   Estrada said he was relieved the furor over the planned July 11
burial was over, adding that Filipinos couldn't afford to be
divided amid the economic challenges confronting their nation.
	   ``Our foes are big and strong, especially when it comes to the
economy. There is no reason for us to be divided,'' Estrada told a
crowd after a thanksgiving Mass in a church in suburban San Juan,
where he was mayor at the start of his political career.
	   Estrada angered groups led by former President Corazon Aquino by
endorsing a plan to bury Marcos' remains at the Heroes Cemetery in
an army camp in metropolitan Manila.
	   Groups that had fought Marcos' authoritarian rule immediately
launched protests, eroding in just a few days the immense
popularity that had helped Estrada triumph in the May 11
presidential polls. Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, dismissed
the opposition as mere nuisance.
	   Bowing to the widespread protests, Marcos' widow, Imelda, backed
off last Wednesday and said she would indefinitely postpone the
burial. On Thursday, Estrada said he would urge the family to bury
Marcos in his hometown instead.
	   Estrada said he approved of Marcos' burial at the heroes'
cemetery to put the issue of his long-delayed interment to rest and
was surprised by the extensive opposition.
	   ``I'm thankful that it did not push through,'' he said of the
burial.
	   The government accuses the late president and his associates of
illegally amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule.
Marcos' government also was accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.
	   Critics said they plan to seek a court injunction against the
burial. Some relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery said they
planned to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial went
ahead.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial at the cemetery is appropriate
because he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   Analysts said Estrada's backing off from support for the planned
burial enabled him to avoid public outrage that would have wiped
out the good will he needed for his political and economic agenda.
	   ``The confrontation is the first baptism of fire for Estrada,''
said political analyst Amando Doronila.
	   ``He has learned a painful lesson that bullying his opponents
with the powers of state is a worst way to govern effectively in
democratic systems.''
	   Estrada is to be inaugurated as the country's 13th president on
Tuesday.
	   Marcos' 20-year rule ended in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986.
After he died in Hawaii, his body was not allowed to return to the
Philippines until September 1993. Since then, it has been kept in a
glass coffin in an air-conditioned mausoleum in his northern
hometown.
	   Both Aquino, who succeeded Marcos, and incumbent President Fidel
Ramos refused to let Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing
conflicts between the former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   Ramos has ordered a halt to construction of Marcos' grave at the
cemetery for the few days remaining in his term.

Ten more Proton launches set for this year, Russian agency says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Space officials plan 10 more launches this year of
Russia's workhorse Proton booster rocket, including one to put the
first section of the international space station in orbit, a news
agency reported Sunday.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, citing officials at Russia's
Khrunichev Space Center, said the Proton launch schedule has been
unaffected by problems that have grounded the newer Zenit-2
booster.
	   Two planned Zenit-2 launches have run into trouble this month.
On June 16, a Zenit booster put six spy satellites into the wrong
orbit. A launch originally scheduled for June 23 has been delayed
twice over concerns about a similar malfunction.
	   Those troubles will not affect the Proton launch schedule,
officials at the Khrunichev center, which builds the Proton, told
ITAR-Tass.
	   Among the launches are several to place foreign satellites into
orbit. Such commercial launches have become a major source of
funding for Russia's cash-strapped space program.
	   The officials said the launch of the first section of the
international space station is still scheduled for Nov. 20.
	   The station's components are to be assembled in orbit and the
first American-led crew is scheduled to board the station in July
1999 _ a year later than previously planned.
	   The dlrs 21 billion space station is a joint project of Russia,
the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan. It
has experienced many delays, largely because of Russia's funding
problems.

	   INDIO, California (AP) _ Unbeaten Carlos Navarro of the United
States retained his WBU junior featherweight title by stopping
Ruben Diaz of Mexico after seven rounds of their scheduled
12-rounder Saturday night.
	   Although there were no knockdowns, Navarro had won every round
when referee Jose Cobian stopped the bout at the Santa Fe Springs
Casino on the advice of ringside physician Paul Wallace after he
examined Diaz in the corner.
	   Navarro, who weighed 121 1/2 (55.12 kilos), improved to 16-0
with 11 knockouts. Diaz, also 121 1/2 (55.12 kilos), fell to 14-4-1
with six knockouts.

Villagers see Malaysia's new airport as their fast track to growth 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SEPANG, Malaysia (AP) _ Zainuddin Harun peered out the window of
Flight MH5407, gulped at the capital skyline, awash in lights
below, and predicted his humble life was about to take off.
	   ``Malaysia, Boleh!'' Zainuddin, a 24-year-old part-time food
hawker, whispered proudly as the inaugural flight to Malaysia's new
dlrs 2.3 billion airport touched down and its passengers snapped
pictures, cheering the national slogan: ``Malaysia, Can Do It!''
	   For Malaysia, the opening of the state-of-the-art Kuala Lumpur
International Airport Saturday was a victory; a headstrong nod to
the world that the regional economic crisis had not shaken its goal
of developed country status by 2020.
	   For the 150 passengers on board Malaysian Airlines flight 5407 _
men, women and children from small farming villages near the new
airport _ that future was tangible.
	   ``This moment marks history. One of the world's biggest airports
just opened in my backyard,'' said Kiok Jiang Ning, a 34-year-old
government worker, who gave his address as 4 kilometers (2.5 miles)
from the runway. ``That means more jobs, more opportunity. My
backwoods town just got its place on the map.''
	   Critics of the multibillion-dollar airport have said it came at
the wrong time and caused further damage to Malaysia's battered
economy.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, at Saturday night's opening
celebration, rejected those claims and hailed the megaproject as a
stepping stone to economic health.
	   ``In terms of cost, it is not mega at all. It is easily the most
economic project in the world. Far from being the cause of our
economic downturn, it is likely to help our recovery,'' Mahathir
said.
	   Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, has depreciated sharply since
last July, losing nearly 40 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar. The bulk of airport, however, was paid for before the
crisis took hold, Mahathir said.
	   ``Certainly with our present economic situation we would not
build it at all. But we decided at the right time and at 9 billion
ringgit (dlrs 2.3 billion) this is the cheapest major airport,''
Mahathir said.
	   Mahathir estimated the 10,000-hectare (24,700-acre) KLIA, in the
midst of rubber and oil palm plantations, would eventually create
30,000 new jobs. It is to begin a full schedule of flights Tuesday.
	   Malaysian officials hope the airport in Sepang, 70 kilometers
(40 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur and touted as the largest airport
in Southeast Asia, will transform the capital into a regional air
transport hub.
	   Many Sepang farmers, however, said progress and national pride
came with a price.
	   ``You gain something, you lose something,'' said Tsen Yon Fatt,
a 56-year-old retired teacher and land owner who received 200,000
ringgit (dlrs 51,300) compensation from the government and an order
to evacuate 10 acres (4 hectares) of his oil palm plantation.
	   But now, his Sepang address has become prestigious. The value of
his remaining 10-acre farm has shot up 100 percent, Tsen said.
	   ``Malaysia is a small country and I'm a little man,'' said Tsen.
``This airport is big. Very big.''

Dunstall career in doubt, Saints hit the top 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Hawthorn great Jason Dunstall's
Australian Football league career may be finished after he suffered
a broken collarbone on the weekend.
	   Dunstall, the leading goal scorer still playing, has said this
season would be his last and the end may have come prematurely in a
13.14 (92) to 11.10 (76) loss against Carlton on Saturday.
	   Dunstall is just 48 goals short of breaking the long-standing
AFL record of Gordon Coventry's 1299 career goals.
	   ``It would certainly be a very sad way for his footy career to
end if that's what happens,'' Hawthorn coach Ken Judge said.
	   Dunstall's injury overshadowed unfashionable St. Kilda's rise to
the top of the ladder following a victory in the clash against
previous leader Western Bulldogs.
	   The Saints won 12.15 (87) to 10.12 (72) to claim their 11th win
from 14 matches this season.
	   Bulldogs coach Terry Wallace was frustrated by the umpiring and
said he would bring the matter up with AFL officials.
	   Wallace was livid when forward James Cook was denied a shot at
goal halfway through the last quarter after a free kick was paid to
the Saints following an off-the-ball incident. Cook had the chance
to put the Bulldogs within nine points at the 16-minute mark as he
lined up a shot from 35 meters out, when the free was reversed.
	   ``I thought it was very significant,'' Wallace said. ``I'm not
necessarily disputing the umpire's decision, but it was the first
turnaround free kick I've seen in a month of football.''
	   Sydney's inconsistent season continued as defending champion
continued its strng mid-season surge.
	   The Crows beat the Swans 18.16 (124) to 12.15 (87) at the SCG on
Sunday.
	   At the MCG, Richmond full-forward Matthew Richardson kicked
seven goals to lead his side to a 90-point mauling of Fremantle.
	   Richardson bagged six of his goals in the first half to set up
the 23.7 (145) to 8.7 (55) victory.
	   Two last-quarter goals from teenage Port Adelaide forward Warren
Tredrea helped his side to a fighting 13.13.(91) to 10.13.(73) win
over Geelong in torrential rain at Football Park.
	   Geelong hit the front minutes into the final term but Tredrea
kicked two crucial goals to spark a four-goal run by the Power
which sealed the match and kept the Cats winless in premiership
season matches in Adelaide.
	   In other matches, Brisbane beat Collingwood 19.21 (135) to 12.11
(83), North Melbourne defeated Essendon 19.13 (127) to 16.13 (109)
and Melbourne beat West Coast 14.12 (96) to 11.13 (79).

Rockets slam into capital, killing four 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rockets slammed into the Afghan
capital of Kabul on Sunday in one of the deadliest assaults in
several months, killing four people and wounding several others,
hospital officials and eyewitnesses said.
	   At least 10 rockets rattled the city before noon on Sunday,
eyewitnesses said.
	   Two of the rockets struck the airport, which serves both
civilians and the military. Others hit a densely populated
residential area on the southeastern edge of the city, forcing
people to run for cover.
	   A 15-year-old boy was killed when a rocket hit his house.
	   The rockets were fired by opposition soldiers based north of the
capital.
	   The opposition vowed to continue to target the capital,
particularly the airport, as long as fighter jets belonging to the
Taliban religious army took off from the airport. Mohammed Arif, a
spokesman for ousted military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, said
Taliban pilots were bombing civilian areas in opposition-held
northern areas.
	   Sunday's rocket assault was the worst since opposition soldiers
moved within 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the capital almost one
year ago.
	   The Taliban and its opponents have been waging fierce battles on
at least three different fronts. The anti-Taliban alliance, led by
Massood and ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani, controls about 15
percent of Afghanistan.
	   The remaining 85 percent is ruled by the Taliban religious army,
which has imposed strict Islamic law on residents. The army has
banned women from work and girls from school and forced men to grow
beards, say their prayers at the mosque and wear head coverings.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Taliban on the latest
attack.
	   Attempts by the United Nations to broker a peace agreement
between the warring factions have so far failed.

Indonesian government announces hot lines for rape victims from riots 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government has opened two
telephone hot lines for women victimized during deadly riots in
Jakarta last month, the official Antara news agency reported
Sunday.
	   Human rights groups say they have documented more than 100 cases
of rape and sexual assault during the rioting, which led to the
ouster of President Suharto.
	   Most rape victims are believed to be from the ethnic Chinese
minority, which dominates the nation's economy and is often made a
scapegoat because of its relative wealth.
	   The women's affairs minister, Tuty Alawiyah, said rape victims
could now lodge complaints on two government telephone lines that
would guarantee their confidentiality.
	   The government has also set up a fact-finding team to track down
rapists, Antara quoted Alawiyah as saying Saturday.
	   The minister said the riots may have been masterminded by
unidentified groups that directed attacks on certain areas and
engaged in looting and raping. She indicated the ethnic Chinese
minority may have been pinpointed as a target.
	   Women's groups say the government has been slow to investigate
the rape reports, which are largely based on testimony from
victims' families.
	   Rioting over several days in Jakarta, together with student-led
democracy protests, helped end Suharto's 32-year authoritarian
rule. Nearly 1,190 people were killed in the violence.
	   Mobs of looters and arsonists destroyed hundreds of
Chinese-owned stores in anger over the country's economic decline.
Indonesia is experiencing its worst economic crisis in 30 years,
and inflation and mass unemployment have soared.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A speeding utility vehicle plowed into oncoming
traffic in a busy Moscow intersection, causing a three-vehicle
accident that killed five, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   The accident in southwestern Moscow shortly before midnight
Saturday also left three people in critical condition, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

speed of the utility vehicle may be to blame for the accident, the

Japanese anti-nuclear group campaigns for peace 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's decision to conduct nuclear
tests disappointed many Japanese, who for decades had supported New
Delhi's campaign for nuclear disarmament, a visiting Japanese
anti-nuclear campaigner said.
	   ``There is no winner in a nuclear war,'' said Yoshioka Tatsuya,
an official of Peace Boat on Saturday. Peace Boat is a private
organization based in Japan that focuses on anti-nuclear,
environmental and human rights issues.
	   Representatives of the group began a three-day photo exhibition
in New Delhi Saturday, showing the effects of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombings in 1945. The exhibition, which also had a
three-day showing in Pakistan earlier this week, aims to make
Indians and Pakistanis aware of the consequences of a nuclear
conflict and hopes to encourage a people-to-people dialogue for
peace.
	   India and Pakistan conducted tit for tat nuclear tests last
month that heightened tensions in one of the world's most volatile
regions. The neighbors have fought three wars since gaining thair
independence from colonial Britain in 1947.
	   The international community has pressed the two South Asian
rivals to talk and resolve their disputes and to sign nuclear
nonproliferation treaties.

Hanson demands English language competency test for immigrants 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS reaction
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's One Nation party head
Pauline Hanson said Sunday that an English-language competency test
would form part of her new right-wing party's immigration policy.
	   Hanson, speaking on a television program, reiterated her
controversial views, saying she did not want Australia to become
Asianized, just as many Asians do not want Asia to become too
strongly influenced by Australia.
	   ``Here in Australia, we speak English. Everyone should speak
English,'' Hanson said. ``I don't want to go to any parts of
Australia and don't know whether I am walking into a butcher shop
or a hairdresser.''
	   Hanson, whose party made a strong debut as a political force by
claiming 11 seats and 23 percent of the vote in this month's
Queensland state poll, is gearing up for the next federal election.
The election is due by March but expected earlier.
	   She is expected to release her party's official immigration
policy later this week.
	   ``I think there should be a test on English,'' Hanson said.
``This is Australia and I believe these people must make an effort
to know the English language.''
	   One Nation would push for a referendum on the issue of
Aboriginal native title to land as a condition of support for the
Liberal and National coalition in the Australian Senate, Hanson
said.
	   ``Everyone has the right to enjoy this country and everything it
has to offer _ native title is destroying us and splitting us as a
people,'' Hanson said.
	   She also said the Racial Discrimination Act needed to be
repealed as it was discriminatory.
	   A spokeswoman for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Commission said Hanson was misguided and confused.
	   ``You cannot use the language of equality and say in one breath
that we are all equal, and then devise policies that single out
particular groups in a negative way,'' acting ATSIC Social Justice
Commissioner and Race Discrimination Commissioner Zita Antonios
said. ``The Racial Discrimination Act is for all Australians. It is
there to protect all Australians and to promote equality and
fairness.''
	   Federal opposition leader Kim Beazley said repealing native
title legislation would mean endless litigation.
	   ``If she repeals the native title bill, then all that will mean
is that the issues of native title rights will be settled case by
case in court,'' Beazley said. ``It will take years and years and
create havoc.''
	   Queensland's new Attorney General Matt Foley said Hanson was
``abandoning the concept of a fair go in favor of bigotry and
prejudice.''
	   ``The Racial Discrimination Act is all about giving every
Australian a fair go, whatever their racial background,'' Foley
said. ``This is something of which we should be proud, and ordinary

Longley says Olympics central to his plans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Chicago Bulls center Luc Longley said
Sunday he would make his availability for Australia's 2000 Olympic
team central to any new contract discussions.
	   Longley expects to command more than U.S. dlrs 6 million a
season when he signs a new contract this year, but is adamant about
his long-term goal of playing for Australia.
	   ``Sydney is a big focus for me,'' Longley said. ``When I come to
negotiate my contract with whoever it is at the end of the summer,
I'm going to make it a stipulation that I'm allowed to play in
Sydney. I'm not going to take any chances with Sydney.''
	   Longley missed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics to have a knee
operation so he would be fit for the start of the next NBA season.
He was criticized in his home country for putting his professional
career ahead of Australia's Olympic interests, but it was believed
he was pressured into missing the games by Chicago.
	   Longley said he was unsure if he would stay with the Bulls.
	   ``There's no doubt the team will be disbanded this year so that
raises a lot of questions as to where I'll be,'' Longley said. ``We
may have seen the last of Michael Jordan and if the team is not
here in Chicago it becomes an economic decision.
	   ``I've won three championships with the Bulls, but this season
was the best of the lot, a fun year and a spectacular finish. We
struggled all season, but Jordan lived up to his reputation and
ability with the dramatic ending and showed why he is one of
America's greatest basketball players.''

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A fisherman died after being attacked
by a shark off the South Australian coast Sunday, police said.
	   The attack occurred near South Neptune Island, about 200
nautical miles (370 kilometers) west of Adelaide in the Spencer
Gulf. Police said the man had been on the island with his fishing
partner, checking nets, when he decided to go for a swim and dive
for abalone without scuba equipment.
	   The man's partner saw the attack and dragged him to shore. He
took him to a house on the island for medical assistance, but the
man died soon after that.
	   No other information was immediately available.

Studies: Evidence mounts that HIV mothers can protect babies 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Conference opens 1530-1700 GMT.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Hopeful signs that HIV-infected mothers can
protect their babies greeted 12,000 of the world's top researchers
and others in the war on AIDS as they gathered for a biennial
global review.
	   Studies released Saturday in Chicago pointed to the virtual
elimination of the risk of AIDS transfer if the mother takes the
HIV-fighting drug AZT and gives birth by Caesarean section.
	   The studies are but a small sample of the more than 5,000
research projects on the whole gamut of work on AIDS that will come
before the delegates to the 12th World AIDS Conference that meets
until Friday.
	   The mother-child studies, which report on work done in Europe
and North America, point up one of the main problems in the
campaign against AIDS: that weapons needed may be too expensive or
unavailable for developing countries.
	   The conference is dedicated to finding ways to help Africa, Asia
and Latin America share more in the advances against the disease
that are made in wealthy countries.
	   It is developing countries that have seen the most rapid spread
of the disease. They now have more than 90 percent of the 30.6
million people in the world living with HIV or full-blown AIDS.
Africa alone has more that 21 million people who are infected.
	   The conference, the first since experts met in Vancouver two
years ago, has so much research to cover that it has been divided
into four parallel sessions for the week.
	   The sessions range from the basic laboratory research on cells
and the virus to care of infected people, prevention of the spread
of AIDS and behavioral science.
	   The mother-to-child studies found that an HIV-infected pregnant
woman taking AZT alone could reduce to 8 percent from 25 percent
the chance of passing the virus on to her baby.
	   Giving birth by C-section dropped transmission to 2 percent or
lower, according to a combination of studies of thousands of
mother-baby pairs in Europe and North America.
	   The studies were put together by the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development in Washington.
	   A Swiss study found that performing the Caesarean section before
contractions begin and before the waters break is the key to
eliminating the dangers of infection from natural childbirth.
	   Those dangers include infected blood being forced through the
placenta; the baby swallowing amniotic fluid after the waters
break; and its skin coming into prolonged contact with infected
fluids from the mother during birth, the study said.

Thai `ghosts' call for more rain amid economic crisis BY THAKSINA KHAIKAEW

<TEXT>
	   LOEI, Thailand (AP) _ Hundreds of friendly ``ghosts'' gathered
in northeastern Thailand over the weekend, asking the powers above
to provide adequate rainfall for the forthcoming rice planting.
	   Referred to by local people as Phee Tha Khon, the festival is
celebrated annually only in Dan Sai District of Loei Province, 430
kilometers (270 miles) northeast of Bangkok.
	   Throughout the district, children and adults dress up in
colorful, ghost-like outfits including masks fashioned from the
trunks of coconut trees.
	   The masks are meant to hide their identity as participants make
sexual gestures to each other and spectators with wooden phalluses,
a symbol of fertility.
	   The young and old, males and females, marched down the streets
poking phalluses at one another as they danced to local folk music
and modern rock, including Ricky Martin's ``Cup of Life.''
	   Although the atmosphere was one of fun and games, the rural
dwellers had a serious purpose. Particularly this year, they hope
that their calls to the heavens will be heard.
	   Farmers in the northeast have been suffering from drought and
Thailand's economic crisis has robbed many of better-paying jobs in
the cities. Nearly 2 million people have lost employment since the
crisis began a year ago.
	   Villagers said more ``ghosts'' participated in this year's
festival than in recent times since many have had to return home
from the cities. Others hoped to win the first prize for the best
costume and dancing: 10,000 baht (dlrs 250) in cash.
	   ``I will have enough water to plow my rice paddies if it rains
again tonight,'' said one farmer, 36-year-old Chalerm Mukdam.
	   It had rained heavily just two days earlier, an omen to Chalerm
and others that this year's Phee Tha Khon would bring fertility to
the land.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bridge under construction along the large
highway that encircles Moscow collapsed late Saturday, falling onto
the roadway below and injuring 10 workers.
	   The accident occurred shortly before 11 p.m. when the metal
frame supporting the bridge buckled after concrete was poured,
according to a spokesman for the state traffic police's local
district. He declined to provide his name.
	   The bridge was being constructed parallel to the existing bridge
on the Moscow Circular Roadway where it passes over another major
artery, the Dmitrovskoye Shosse, he said.
	   Traffic was light on both thoroughfares at the time of the
accident, but 10 construction workers were injured, news agencies
said. The ITAR-Tass news agency said three of the injured were in
serious condition.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov expressed concern about the accident,
but said ``it's not worthwhile to dramatize the situation,''
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Traffic was restricted Sunday in both directions on the
Dmitrovskoye Shosse as crews worked to clear the debris. Traffic on
the circular road was unaffected.
	   An investigation is underway, the spokesman said.

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake that rattled this southern
city and nearby towns has killed at least 108 people and injured
about 1,000, news reports and witnesses said.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 37 people who lived in the
slums of Adana, a city of 1 million about 250 miles (400
kilometers) south of the capital, Ankara, said Deputy Gov. Ardahan
Totuk.
	   Mustafa Karsli, a hospital official in nearby Ceyhan, said 41
bodies had been brought to the hospital morgue and at least 200
other people were injured.
	   ``It is not finished yet,'' Karsli said. ``There are scores of
people still under the collapsed buildings.'' Rescue workers were
using earthmoving machinery to uncover people buried in rubble in
Ceyhan, where the quake leveled at least four downtown buildings.
Ceyhan, site of an oil terminal, is about 30 miles (48 kilometers)
east of Adana.
	   ``They are dead, all of them are dead,'' said Huseyin Atasoz,
gazing at the remains of a five-story building in Ceyhan. Five of
Atasoz's relatives, including three teen-agers, were inside the
building when it collapsed.
	   Turkey's state radio said 107 people had been killed, and
rescuers later pulled at least one more body from a collapsed
building. The number of injured had reached about 1,000, Gov. Oguz
Koksal said.
	   But Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu said only 12 of the
injured were in critical condition.
	   The hardest hit areas were slum areas with poorly constructed
buildings. The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several
buildings, including mosques.
	   Etem Zerenturk, 47, said he lost three relatives in one of the
buildings that collapsed in Adana's low-income Tepebagi district.
	   ``I got shocked when I heard that they were inside. They were so
young,'' he said.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory. The
U.S. Geological Survey put the preliminary magnitude at 6.2 and
said the quake rattled the neighboring provinces of Mersin, Nigde
and Kayseri, as well as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off
Turkey's southern coast.
	   ``I thought I'd die,'' said Suna Cicel, 37, while watching
rescue workers pick through piles of rubble early Sunday in search
of more victims in Adana. ``I am very happy to be alive. I ran into
the street in panic when the walls of my house began to crack.''
	   According to an announcement from the headquarters of the U.S.
Air Forces in Europe, 25 people at Incirlik air base sustained
minor injuries. The announcement did not say how many were
Americans.
	   But a U.S. Embassy spokesperson, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that a dozen U.S. citizens
were lightly injured by falling objects.
	   The brief U.S. statement also said the earthquake caused
structural and electrical damage to buildings on base. Because the
phone lines were knocked out in the quake, it was impossible to
call the base directly for further details.
	   The oil pipeline linking Iraq to Turkey was functioning and did
not appear to suffer any damage, according to an oil terminal
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The temblor knocked
out power to most of Adana.

	   Valdes lost his bid for the 14th perfect game in modern history
when Kevin Young singled up the middle on the first pitch of the
eighth inning.
	   Valdes (6-7), who pitched his first career shutout three starts

earned runs in 30 1-3 innings.
	   Francisco Cordova (6-6) took the loss.

Thousands of demonstrators rally in East Timor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comments from British ambassador, grafs 5-7
<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of pro-independence protesters
marched Sunday in the streets of East Timor's capital, one day
after a man was shot and killed during a demonstration.
	   Watched by troops armed with rifles and tear gas canisters, the
chanting marchers in the city of Dili rallied peacefully against
Indonesian control in a bid to impress visiting European
ambassadors.
	   ``Hold a referendum in East Timor,'' read one banner raised by
the crowd. The column of protesters stretched for about one
kilometer (0.6 miles) through the streets of the seaside city.
	   Acting on behalf of the European Union, top envoys in Indonesia
from Britain, Austria and the Netherlands are on a fact-finding
mission in the former Portuguese colony.
	   British Ambassador Robin Christopher told the protesters that he
supported their right to express their views peacefully.
	   ``Your voice has been heard,'' he said. ``We all have taken your
messages away with us.''
	   ``We congratulate this good and disciplined demonstration,''
Christopher said. ``It is peaceful and frank and we want the future
of East Timor to be peaceful.''
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in 1975 and
annexed it a year later as its 27th province, triggering human
rights abuses and a long-running guerrilla war.
	   The United Nations and many governments refuse to recognize
Indonesia's claim of sovereignty over East Timor.
	   On Saturday, rival groups of protesters clashed in front of a
Catholic church in Manatutu, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of
Dili. Troops opened fire when groups of demonstrators who support
Indonesia's claim over the province clashed with opponents of the
claim.
	   Witnesses said troops killed one man and seriously wounded two
others, but the military denied playing a role in the incident.
	   Clashes also broke out in Dili.
	   In the peaceful protest in the capital Sunday, demonstrators
marched from the University of East Timor to the hotel where the
European ambassadors are staying during their three-day trip.
	   The protesters shouted slogans in support of imprisoned rebel
commander Xanana Gusmao, who was arrested in 1992 and is being held
in a maximum-security prison in Jakarta.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has offered to grant special
status to East Timor and to release Gusmao in exchange for
international recognition. However, separatist groups, as well as
Portugal and Gusmao, demand a referendum.

Netanyahu says agreement likely by end of July 
</HEADLINE>
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Sunday that he expected an agreement with the Palestinians on an
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank by the end of next
month.
	   Critics, however, accused Netanyahu of coming up with new
gimmicks to stall the peace process, and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said the Israeli prime minister's objective was ``to
torpedo the peace process.''
	   Pressed by Israel Radio as to whether agreement would be reached
by July 29, when Israel's Knesset recesses for the summer,
Netanyahu said Sunday, ``I estimate this issue will be concluded by
then.''
	   ``I can't say for sure,'' he added, ``because I can't tell the
Palestinians what to do.''
	   The United States is pushing Israel to accept a U.S. proposal
for turning over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer, but
months have gone by without a response from Israel.
	   Netanyahu insists that the Palestinians are the ones holding up
the process, by refusing to give specific commitments for
fulfilling their obligations such as cracking down on terrorism.
	   ``This is what is delaying the process, nothing else,'' he said
Sunday. He acknowledged there were ``gaps'' on other issues, such
as the West Bank withdrawal. ``But we are not dealing with that at
the moment,'' he said.
	   In recent weeks, Netanyahu had appeared to endorse the idea of
holding a national referendum on any agreement, but now seems to be
backing away from that possibility. He said Sunday that a decision
on whether to hold a referendum would be made only after an
agreement with the Palestinians was reached.
	   Netanyahu's latest idea is a European-sponsored conference
sponsored by Europe to discuss Mideast issues _ but not the
Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically. The conference would
address regional issues such as water, the environment and trade,
he said.
	   Mubarak, speaking to reporters at a news conference Saturday,
said Netanyahu's proposal was aimed at nullifying all the
agreements that have already been reached.
	   ``In short, his objective is to torpedo the peace process,'' he
said.
	   Netanyahu criticized Mubarak's response on Sunday, saying ``It
would be good if Egypt, with all its influence on the Palestinians
... were to act with a greater degree of caution.''
	   Opposition legislator Yossi Beilin accused Netanyahu of stalling
for time.
	   ``I think the prime minister is willing to do everything in
order not to do anything,'' he said. ``I don't think there is
anyone willing to take seriously another such stalling tactic. ...
He thinks that this is the way to sideline the political issue at
hand _ which is the carrying out of the next withdrawal.''
	   Even Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy, a member of
Netanyahu's governing coalition, questioned why a conference would
be helpful now.
	   ``At this moment our goal is to reach the final status agreement
(with the Palestinians) ... and this is what the government should
be working for,'' he told Israel Radio.

Wounds drove man-eating tiger to attack humans, autopsy indicates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ An autopsy of a man-eating tiger
indicated the animal was driven to attack humans after repeated
wounds from illegal hunters left it unable to hunt in the wild,
news reports said Sunday.
	   Mohamad Faud Sharif, of the Wildlife and National Parks
Department, said the tiger, which mauled two men to death earlier
this month, could no longer prey on wild animals due to a shattered
front leg and more than 16 gunshot wounds that covered its body.
	   ``This incident shows us that indiscriminate shooting of wild
animals by hunters can endanger the lives of villagers living on
the jungle fringes,'' Mohamad Faud was quoted as saying in Sunday's
New Straits Times.
	   The tiger, known as Father Stripes, was shot by game rangers
Friday after it had killed two men in villages near the town of
Sungei Siput, about 140 kilometers (90 miles) north of Kuala
Lumpur. The animal weighed 140 kilograms (310 pounds) and was about
25 years old.
	   Meanwhile, there were fears of more tiger attacks in Hulu Dungun
in the northeastern state of Terengganu.
	   The Terengganu Forestry Department said a pack of six tigers had
killed 15 farm cows in the past three weeks, and villagers were
living in fear.
	   Game workers were sent to trap the tigers, the government news
agency Bernama reported.
	   The Malayan tiger has been classified by the World Wildlife Fund
as an endangered species. Hunting of the animal has been banned
since 1972.
	   The Malaysian government estimates only 500 tigers are still
alive, down from 5,000 in 1952.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ An earthquake that struck southern Turkey
has killed at least 108 people and injured about 1,000, news
reports and witnesses said.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 41 people in the town of
Ceyhan, where at least 200 others were injured, said Mustafa
Karsli, a hospital official.
	   ``It is not finished yet. There are scores of people still under
the collapsed buildings,'' Karsli said. Rescue workers were using
earthmoving machinery to reach people buried beneath rubble in
Ceyhan, where the quake leveled at least four downtown buildings.
	   The town, site of an oil terminal, is about 250 miles (400
kilometers) south of the capital, Ankara.
	   ``They are dead, all of them are dead,'' said Huseyin Atasoz,
gazing at the remains of a five-story building where five of his
relatives, including three teen-agers, were still buried.
	   Some 10 to 15 children were said to be trapped in one of the
buildings that collapsed. They had been celebrating at a birthday
party, firefighter Mustafa Karakus said.
	   Rescue operations were interrupted for several minutes on Sunday
when President Suleyman Demirel and Deputy Premier and Defense
Minister Ismet Sezgin visited Ceyhan. Crowds grew angry at the
delay.
	   ``I have three people of my own blood there. They are just
making politics here,'' said Ibrahim Civelek, standing before a
demolished house.
	   Rescuers resumed their efforts after the presidential convoy
left the area.
	   Turkey's state radio said 107 people had been killed, and
rescuers later pulled at least one more body from a collapsed
building. The number of injured had reached about 1,000, Gov. Oguz
Koksal said.
	   But Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu said only 12 of the
injured were in critical condition.
	   At least 37 people died in Adana, a city of 1 million about 30
miles (48 kilometers) west of Ceyhan where the quake was centered,
said Deputy Gov. Ardahan Totuk.
	   The hardest hit areas were slums with poorly constructed
buildings. The quake shattered windows and caused cracks in several
buildings, including mosques.
	   ``Paper walls,'' said Karakus, the firefighter, accusing
builders of not using enough iron and cement to build houses there.
	   The quake struck at 16:56 p.m. (1356 GMT) and had a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory. The
U.S. Geological Survey put the preliminary magnitude at 6.2 and
said the quake rattled the neighboring provinces of Mersin, Nigde
and Kayseri, as well as the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, off
Turkey's southern coast.
	   At least 34 aftershocks were recorded, the strongest one
reaching 4.8 in magnitude at 6:59 a.m. (0359 GMT). More aftershocks
were expected, the Kandilli observatory said.
	   According to an announcement from the headquarters of the U.S.
Air Forces in Europe, 25 people at Incirlik air base, 10 miles (16
kilometers) from Adana, sustained minor injuries. The announcement
did not say how many were Americans.
	   But a U.S. Embassy spokesperson, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that a dozen U.S. citizens
were lightly injured by falling objects.
	   Incirlik serves as a staging ground for about 45 U.S. and
British jets that patrol a no-fly zone above the 36th parallel in
northern Iraq. Some 1,400 personnel are part of the mission.
	   The oil pipeline linking Iraq to Turkey was functioning normally
and the pumping of 6,600 barrels per hour of Iraqi oil to Ceyhan
continued without interruption, the Energy and Natural Resources
Ministry announced.
	   In Adana, hundreds of people spent the night on blankets in
public parks, some grieving for their losses.
	   ``I have no mom and no house any more,'' said Arzu Oludag, 13,
as she held her 2-year-old brother in her arms on a sidewalk. ``The
quake took away everything we owned in one night.''
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent in the country.

Netanyahu says agreement likely by end of July 
</HEADLINE>
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Sunday he expected to reach an agreement with the Palestinians on
an Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank by the end of next
month.
	   Critics, however, accused Netanyahu of coming up with new
gimmicks to stall the peace process, and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said the Israeli prime minister's objective was ``to
torpedo the peace process.''
	   Pressed by Israel Radio as to whether agreement would be reached
by July 29, when Israel's Knesset recesses for the summer,
Netanyahu said Sunday, ``I estimate this issue will be concluded by
then.''
	   ``I can't say for sure because I can't tell the Palestinians
what to do,'' he said.
	   The United States is pushing Israel to accept a U.S. proposal to
turn over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority.
The Palestinians already have accepted the offer, but months have
gone by without a response from Israel.
	   Netanyahu insists that the Palestinians are the ones holding up
the process by refusing to give specific commitments for fulfilling
their obligations, such as cracking down on terrorism.
	   ``This is what is delaying the process, nothing else,'' he said
Sunday. He acknowledged there were ``gaps'' on other issues, such
as the West Bank withdrawal. ``But we are not dealing with that at
the moment,'' he said.
	   Israel has occupied the West Bank since capturing it from Jordan
in 1967.
	   In recent weeks, Netanyahu had appeared to endorse the idea of
holding a national referendum on any withdrawal agreement, but he
now seems to be backing away from that possibility. He said Sunday
that a decision on whether to hold a referendum would be made only
after an agreement with the Palestinians was reached.
	   Netanyahu's latest idea is a European-sponsored conference to
discuss Mideast issues _ but not the Israel-Palestinian conflict
specifically. The conference would address regional issues such as
water, the environment and trade, he said.
	   Mubarak, speaking to reporters at a news conference Saturday,
said Netanyahu's proposal was aimed at nullifying all the
agreements that have already been reached.
	   ``In short, his objective is to torpedo the peace process,'' he
said.
	   Netanyahu criticized Mubarak's response on Sunday, saying ``It
would be good if Egypt, with all its influence on the Palestinians
... were to act with a greater degree of caution.''
	   Opposition legislator Yossi Beilin accused Netanyahu of stalling
for time.
	   ``I think the prime minister is willing to do everything in
order not to do anything,'' he said. ``I don't think there is
anyone willing to take seriously another such stalling tactic. ...
He thinks that this is the way to sideline the political issue at
hand, which is the carrying out of the next withdrawal.''
	   Even Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy, a member of
Netanyahu's governing coalition, questioned why a conference would
be helpful now.
	   ``At this moment our goal is to reach the final status agreement
(with the Palestinians) ... and this is what the government should
be working for,'' he told Israel Radio.

American Jobe wins Mizuno Open by four strokes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KASAOKA, Japan (AP) _ American Brandt Jobe shot a 3-under-par 69
Sunday and won the 100 million yen (dlrs 709,000) Mizuno Open golf
tournament by four strokes.
	   It was the 32-year-old Oklahoman's third victory this season and
sixth in Japan since he joined the tour in 1995 as the top money
winner of that year's Asian Tour.
	   Jobe received 18 million yen (dlrs 128,000) after a round with
six birdies, one bogey and one double bogey gave him a 13-under 275
total.
	   American Brian Watts, winner of last week's Yomiuri Open,
started the final round with a one-shot lead, but slipped to a 76
with one birdie and five bogeys and tied for fifth at 281.
	   Yoshinori Mizumaki and Toru Suzuki tied for second at 279 after
Mizumaki shot a 69 Sunday and Suzuki a 70 on the 7,091-yard, par-72
Setonaikai Golf Club course.
	   Toru Taniguchi shot a 70 and placed fourth at 280.
	   Tied with Watts at 281 were Frankie Minoza of the Philippines,
Anthony Gilligan of Australia and three Japanese _ Saburo Fujiki,
Nobumitsu Yuhara and Keiihiro Fukabori. Minoza and Gilligan each
shot 74, Fujiki and Yuhara each had 71 and Fukabori had 75 Sunday.
	   The tournament's top finisher qualifies for the British Open
July 16-19, but Jobe already was eligible because he is in the top
50 in the world rankings.
	   Suzuki then qualified by beating Mizumaki in a playoff. He
birdied the first extra hole, the par-5 18th, and Mizumaki parred
it.
	   Mizumaki qualified anyway as one of the four top players in the
Japan PGA Tour money rankings in the last seven tournaments. The
others are Taniguchi, Fukabori and Kazuhiko Hosokawa.
	   Others from the Japan tour who qualify by being in the world's
top 50 are Minoza, Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Shigeki Maruyama,
Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki and Carlos Franco of Paraguay.

Peru's tabloids sell sex, crime stories _ and fear BY DAVID KOOP 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos LIM101, 103
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ When investigative reporter Angel Paez saw the
tabloid headline calling him a traitor wedged between big photos of
a naked woman and a transvestite gang member, he wanted to laugh.
	   But when he read the article, he felt a chill. It accused him of
treason and terrorism _ scary charges in a country emerging from a
war with leftist guerrillas that has left 30,000 dead and thousands
missing.
	   Paez is just one of the mainstream journalists who have recently
been targeted by cheap, lurid sex-and-crime tabloids that feature
front-page photos of naked women and are the most read newspapers
among Peru's poor majority.
	   Lima's biggest newspapers contend the attack campaign is being
orchestrated by the feared National Intelligence Service to
discredit reporters who probe military corruption and human rights
abuses.
	   There are indications the critical articles are being
ghostwritten for the tabloids, and the government is providing
financial support for the papers by buying ads.
	   Journalists say mixed in with the soft porn and crime is a
deadly political message: Investigate those in power and you will
pay.
	   The campaign started two months ago when the tabloids _
principally El Tio, La Chuchi, El Chino and El Mananero _ began a
series of articles accusing seven reporters from major newspapers
and television stations of betraying military secrets or
collaborating with rebels.
	   Among the headlines: ``The rabid dogs of the anti-Peruvian
press,'' ``The Devil raised them; together they plot,'' ``Shorty
Hildebrandt is a traitor,'' ``Paez will go to prison.''
	   One article in El Chino ended with the ominous question: ``What
should be done with these traitors?''
	   El Tio has run more than 70 articles attacking just Paez, who as
chief investigative reporter for Peru's main opposition newspaper,
La Republica, has broken stories on military corruption and a death
squad within the intelligence service.
	   ``I'm worried. They are laying the base in public opinion for
physical or legal attacks against us,'' said Paez, who gets on
average of three telephoned death threats a day.
	   He noted the attack began after he reported on corruption in the
secrecy-shrouded purchase of air force jets.
	   In a communique published in their tabloids, the editors of El
Tio, El Mananero and La Chuchi denied having ties to the National
Intelligence Service, which controls military intelligence
operations and has played a key role in the heavy-handed government
of President Alberto Fujimori.
	   ``We are an independent newspaper that tries to deliver
information in an entertaining fashion, accessible to the lower
classes,'' Patricia Medina, editor in chief of El Mananero, said in
an interview.
	   A presidential spokesman declined to comment on the charges that
Fujimori's government backs the campaign.
	   It's clear the campaign has its origins outside the tabloids,
mainstream journalists say.
	   Identical stories attacking reporters appear in different
tabloids, including even the same grammatical errors, noted Jorge
Salazar, director of Peru's Press and Society Institute, a private
journalism study group.
	   ``It's obvious they come from a central source, and this source
is thought to be the intelligence service,'' Salazar said.
	   The Committee to Protect Journalists, an international press
freedom group based in New York, has urged Fujimori to conduct an
independent investigation into the anti-press campaign.
	   ``There is evidence that these articles are part of an
orchestrated government campaign,'' the group said in a letter June
8.
	   Gustavo Mohme, publisher of La Republica, said further evidence
of such a campaign is a fax allegedly sent to El Tio from a company
owned by a top army adviser.
	   The fax contained an article attacking Paez that later appeared
word-for-word in El Tio, he said. La Republica got a copy of the
fax from a disgusted worker at El Tio, he said.
	   The mainstream press also points out that more than 12 full-page
ads paid for by the government have appeared in El Tio since the
attack campaign began. That is a considerable boost for a
9-month-old tabloid that has almost no other advertisers.
	   ``The tabloids publish the stories and in exchange receive
government advertising,'' Mohme charged. ``This is one way the
government controls them.''

China releases dissidents, but still holds another 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ All four dissidents who were detained in Xi'an,
the first city on U.S. President Bill Clinton's China trip, have
been released, a human rights group said Sunday.
	   But another dissident, Li Xiaolong, was still being held in
southern China, while an activist in Shanghai was made to leave the
city ahead of Clinton's arrival there Monday, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   In Xi'an, dissident Li Zhiying was released Friday evening, 48
hours after being taken by police from his home and as Clinton was
preparing to leave for Beijing, the Hong Kong-based monitoring
group said.
	   Three other dissidents detained in and around Xi'an ahead of
Clinton's arrival Thursday also have been released.
	   Clinton said he found reports of the detentions ``disturbing''
and raised them with President Jiang Zemin in a summit Saturday. At
a post-summit news conference, Jiang said local officials had taken
steps to ensure security.
	   Meanwhile, in Shanghai, dissident Zhou Jianhe was compelled by
his company to leave the city Sunday, the eve of Clinton's arrival,
on a 10-day trip to Qingdao, another city in eastern China, the
Information Center said. Last week, Zhou and five other people
urged Clinton in a letter to meet with dissidents.
	   Also, police told the family of dissident Li Xiaolong, detained
last Wednesday in southern China, that he would not be freed until
Clinton has visited the city of Guilin on Thursday, the group said.
	   Li was being held in a guesthouse in Yulin, about 300 kilometers
(190 miles) south of Guilin, it said.
	   Another activist, Lin Xinshu in eastern Fujian province, wrote a
letter to Clinton on Sunday thanking him for mentioning human
rights in his nationally televised news conference with Jiang on
Saturday.
	   Lin said Jiang was wrong to say that the crackdown on protests
on Tiananmen Square in 1989 was needed to ensure stability. He
added that China would have fewer problems with corruption and mass
layoffs from state factories if it had chosen a more democratic
course nine years ago.

Search underway for helicopter missing on Kyrgyz-China border 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kyrgyz rescue workers flew their first
reconnaissance missions Sunday after bad weather forced them to
delay their search for a helicopter missing along the
Kyrgyz-Chinese border, a news agency reported.
	   The Russian border guards' helicopter with 16 people on board
disappeared Thursday as it ferried repairmen to a power line break
80 kilometers (50 miles) from the town of Karakol, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Attempts to contact the helicopter's crew have been
unsuccessful, and it is not known if they crashed or made an
emergency landing in the mountains that separate the former Soviet
republic from China.
	   Search and rescue operations have been hampered by continued
inclement weather, including thick fog, the report said. Teams are
also using horses and motor vehicles to search the region.
	   The 16 people on board included four crew members and 12
employees of the Kyrgyzenergo electric company.
	   Russian forces assist with border operations in several former
Soviet republics.

European Central Bank president says Greek economy on right track 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece is on the right track toward
European economic and monetary union and should qualify for the
continent's single currency by 2001, the president of the European
Central Bank said Sunday.
	   In an interview published in the Athens newspaper
Eleftherotypia, Wim Duisenberg said the government's broad economic
reforms were leading Greece's economy in the right direction.
	   ``You are on the right track,'' he said. ``EMU entry is entirely
feasible, as long as the correct economic measures are enacted. I
am optimistic about the course of the Greek economy.''
	   Greece is the only European Union country that wanted to take
part in the first round of EMU but did not qualify. The Socialist
government has vowed to join the 11-member single-currency club by
2001.
	   Premier Costas Simitis is pushing through a sweeping
privatization and public sector reform plan despite widespread
labor unrest.
	   Just this month, the sale of state-owned Ionian Bank, the
nation's fourth-largest, was approved despite violent labor
opposition and a six-week strike by the bank's workers.
	   Duisenberg said the Greek government's economic policies had so
far proved successful. The drachma devaluation in March ``was
necessary to give the drachma a stable relation to other European
currencies'' in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, he said.
	   Further devaluations won't be needed if the government sticks to
its course, Duisenberg added.
	   Economic reforms should focus on the banking and insurance
sectors, and on money-losing state enterprises, he said.
	   As long as the government continues to keep inflation under
control and trim the bloated public sector, Duisenberg said Greece
should have no problem meeting EMU requirements by 2001.
	   ``I expect the current measures to be continued successfully and
for them to lead to Greece's participation in the third round of
EMU,'' he said.

Senate to probe delay in Viagra's approval in Philippines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A senator said Sunday he would seek a
congressional investigation into the delay in approving the
anti-impotence drug Viagra for use in the Philippines, which has
led to black market sales.
	   Sen. Blas Ople said smuggled Viagra could endanger users, citing
the case of a teacher who was recently hospitalized in central Cebu
city after taking Viagra he bought on the black market.
	   Health officials have warned that taking fake Viagra or improper
usage could harm users. They said tests were being done to
determine the drug's possible side effects and local distribution
may not be possible until late this year.
	   Ople said he has asked the Senate committee on health to summon
health department and other government officials to explain the
delay. The Philippine Congress is to open July 27 but its
committees could start work earlier, he added.
	   ``We have millions of senior citizens obviously at risk. There
is no need to wait,'' Ople said in a statement.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, venturing from a
church once shuttered by communists to the Forbidden City and the
Great Wall, said Sunday he felt confident China was on a path of
progress.
	   ``In the last 25 years, it's changed quite a lot,'' the
president said as he toured with Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, the vermilion-walled imperial courtyards of
Beijing's Forbidden City, adjacent to Tiananmen Square.
	   Asked if China had changed enough, Clinton said, ``After
yesterday, I feel quite good about it.'' On Saturday, Clinton and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin had engaged in a lively debate
televised across China _ an unprecedented public dialogue.
	   For a first-hand look at more of China's imperial past, the
Clintons ventured out of the capital Sunday afternoon to tour the
Great Wall. To reach the mountaintop wall at Mutianyu they rode in
a gondola, joined by Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham.

Former Gen. Alexander Lebed founds peace group for northern Caucasus 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Lebed _ a presidential contender and
governor of a Siberian province _ has been elected head of a
peacekeeping organization he founded in southern Russia, a news
agency reported Sunday.
	   Lebed, a former paratroop general, is credited with brokering an
end to Russia's war with separatist Chechnya in 1996 when he served
briefly as head of Russia's security council.
	   This spring he won election as governor of Siberia's Krasnoyarsk
region, a post many have seen as a possible springboard for a
presidential campaign in 2000. Lebed came in third in Russia's last
election for president.
	   During his Kranoyarsk campaign, Lebed promised to organize a
peace group for Russia's restive north Caucasus region, which has a
volatile mixture of ethnicities and economic troubles, Interfax
said.
	   The group, named the Peacekeeping Mission in the North Caucasus,
held its founding meeting on Saturday in the southern city of
Pyatigorsk and elected Lebed as its leader. Members include social
and academic representatives of all the ethnic groups of the
region, Interfax said.
	   The group issued a statement pledging to work to settle ethnic
conflicts, repair damage from the Chechen war and restore political
and economic stability to the region.
	   Asked whether the organization could be continued part of his
expected run for president, Lebed replied, ``You may think whatever
you like, but for me it's a matter of duty, honor and conscience,''
Interfax said.
	   Lebed was raised in the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk,
close to Chechnya and other Muslim republics.

`Several' financially weak South Korean banks to be closed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will order ``several''
financially weak banks to close this week as part of efforts to
rebuild its battered economy, government officials said Sunday.
	   Restructuring its inefficient banking sector was one of the key
promises South Korea made in exchange for a dlrs 58 billion bailout
of its economy by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   Officials at the Financial Supervisory Commission, the
government's banking watchdog, said its announcement of the list of
banks to be closed could come as early as Monday.
	   Few details of the anticipated announcement were known, but the
national news agency Yonhap reported that one national and four
regional banks were on the list.
	   Yonhap identified them as Kyungki, Chung Chong, Daedong, Donghwa
and Dongnam banks. The total amount of bad loans incurred by those
banks is estimated at ``several billion dollars,'' it said.
	   Yonhap said five bigger commercial banks _ Korea Housing, KorAm,
Shinhan, Hana and Kookmin _ will take over the five insolvent banks
on the condition that the government write off their debts.
	   It will be the second government move to overhaul the country's
ailing financial and industrial sectors. It has already shut down
14 troubled merchant banks, or finance companies. In mid-May, it
named 55 heavily indebted companies subject to liquidation.
	   South Korea's restructuring moves have drawn mixed evaluations.
Many analysts agree that the moves have largely fallen short of the
expectations of foreign investors.
	   Maeil Kyongje Shinmun, a major economic daily, said the
restructuring measures should be followed by larger-scale reforms
to earn the trust of foreign investors, whose massive exodus
triggered a foreign currency crisis late last year.
	   Yonhap said the five banks to be closed have been selected from
among 12 banks ordered early this year to improve their financial
structure. Their capital-to-asset ratio falls short of the
internationally accepted 8 percent.
	   The 12 banks were given until the end of May to improve their
financial status or face closure or merger. The government finished
reviewing the progress of their restructuring programs Saturday.
	   Yonhap said the other seven banks will be allowed to stay open
temporarily, with an order to improve their finances within the
next month or face closure or merger.
	   Word on the government's list leaked last Friday, prompting
massive withdrawals of deposits.
	   Over the weekend, the government appealed for calm and
restraint, saying that it will guarantee payment of all deposits at
banks to be closed.

Serbs, KLA rebels locked in new Kosovo standoff at Kijevo officials in Western Europe, edits to conform. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with newspaper report that U.S. envoy met two top KLA
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A dangerous standoff at a crossroads
village in the center of the secessionist province of Kosovo has
become the focus of international negotiators, who fear it could
ignite all-out war in the region.
	   Ethnic Albanian guerrillas maintain an armed ring around Kijevo
and have rebuffed demands Saturday that they end their 10-day siege
of the strategic village, located southwest of the provincial
capital of Pristina on one of Kosovo's two main roads.
	   Serbian forces reportedly flew in food and supplies and
evacuated four women and a child. But Western diplomats and
Albanian sources reported an army buildup that could signal
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is poised for another
crackdown.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Saturday at a forum of political
and economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   ``If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an operation on Feb.
28 to try to extinguish growing resistance by secessionist
militants in predominantly Albanian Kosovo. Some 80 people, mostly
civilians, died in that crackdown, and dozens more in another
campaign launched in late May.
	   Kijevo has emerged as a possible site of what diplomats fear
will be a third deadly offensive in Kosovo.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army claims to control 30
percent to 40 percent of this province in Serbia, the dominant
republic in what is left of Yugoslavia. They enjoy increasing
support among the Albanians who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   On Sunday, Holbrooke said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard had met
Friday with people claiming to be representatives of the KLA.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which is fighting for
independence of the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   ``The contacts were with people who said they had this
authority, but at this point that authority remains to be
demonstrated,'' he said.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that the two unidentified KLA
leaders committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in Kosovo,
quoting senior American officials. The KLA leaders also reportedly
agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to
try to provide a common negotiating position, even though they
disagree with his pacifist approach to seeking independence for
Kosovo.
	   An influential ethnic Albanian politician, Adem Demaci, said he
was asked by Holbrooke to mediate with the Albanian militants to
break the Kijevo impasse, but his efforts produced no visible
results.
	   According to TV Tirana in neighboring Albania, the rebels said
they would let the Serbs go from Kijevo if the police and Yugoslav
army withdraw from three vital positions in the area west of
Pristina.
	   The latest evidence that Kosovo Albanians favor a more radical
solution than diplomacy to their quest for independence came
Saturday, when several top politicians founded a new movement
intended to serve as the KLA's political wing.
	   A third of the group was once loyal to Rugova, including his
former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep Qosja,
who helped found the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   Rugova favors a pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   Holbrooke renewed his plea for a diplomatic solution.
	   ``The search for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo problem is
indispensable to the West,'' he said in Crans Montana, Switzerland.
	   ``If we fail, and the situation spirals out of control into a
general war across international borders, affecting Albania,
Macedonia and other countries, perhaps Greece, the danger to
European stability will be even greater than it was in Bosnia.''

Estrada urges Filipinos to unite after furor over Marcos burial

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada urged
Filipinos Sunday to unite after a stormy dispute provoked by his
endorsing the burial of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a
heroes' cemetery.
	   Estrada said he was relieved the furor over the planned July 11
burial was over, adding that Filipinos couldn't afford to be
divided amid the economic challenges confronting their nation.
	   ``Our foes are big and strong, especially when it comes to the
economy. There is no reason for us to be divided,'' Estrada told a
crowd after a thanksgiving Mass in a church in suburban San Juan,
where he was mayor at the start of his political career.
	   Estrada angered groups led by former President Corazon Aquino by
endorsing a plan to bury Marcos' remains at the Heroes Cemetery in
an army camp in metropolitan Manila.
	   Groups that had fought Marcos' authoritarian rule immediately
launched protests, eroding in just a few days the immense
popularity that had helped Estrada triumph in the May 11
presidential polls. Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, dismissed
the opposition as mere nuisance.
	   Bowing to the widespread protests, Marcos' widow, Imelda, backed
off last Wednesday and said she would indefinitely postpone the
burial. On Thursday, Estrada said he would urge the family to bury
Marcos in his hometown instead.
	   Estrada said he approved of Marcos' burial at the heroes'
cemetery to put the issue of his long-delayed interment to rest and
was surprised by the extensive opposition.
	   ``I'm thankful that it did not push through,'' he said of the
burial.
	   The government accuses the late president and his associates of
illegally amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule.
Marcos' government also was accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.
	   Critics said they plan to seek a court injunction against the
burial. Some relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery said they
planned to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial went
ahead.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial at the cemetery is appropriate
because he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   Analysts said Estrada's backing off from support for the planned
burial enabled him to avoid public outrage that would have wiped
out the good will he needed for his political and economic agenda.
	   ``The confrontation is the first baptism of fire for Estrada,''
said political analyst Amando Doronila.
	   ``He has learned a painful lesson that bullying his opponents
with the powers of state is a worst way to govern effectively in
democratic systems.''
	   Estrada is to be inaugurated as the country's 13th president on
Tuesday.
	   Marcos' 20-year rule ended in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986.
After he died in Hawaii, his body was not allowed to return to the
Philippines until September 1993. Since then, it has been kept in a
glass coffin in an air-conditioned mausoleum in his northern
hometown.
	   Both Aquino, who succeeded Marcos, and incumbent President Fidel
Ramos refused to let Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing
conflicts between the former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   Ramos has ordered a halt to construction of Marcos' grave at the
cemetery for the few days remaining in his term.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A speeding utility vehicle plowed into oncoming
traffic in a busy Moscow intersection, causing a three-vehicle
accident that killed six people, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   The accident in southwestern Moscow shortly before midnight
Saturday also left three people in critical condition, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   An investigation is underway, but investigators suspect the
speed of the utility vehicle may be to blame for the accident, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Traffic police said the speedometer
of the utility vehicle had jammed at 150 kph (93 mph).
	   Five victims died at the scene and a sixth died later at a
hospital, Interfax said.

Report: Journalists not free to report on China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ China still routinely bars Hong Kong
journalists considered ``unfriendly'' from visiting the Communist
mainland, a year after the capitalist territory's return to Chinese
rule, a leading local journalists group said Sunday.
	   The Hong Kong Journalists Association said in its annual report
that even those reporters given permission to visit China ``face
surveillance from the authorities, (and) at times harassment.''
	   The Hong Kong government should ask Beijing to deal with
journalists who want to report on the mainland ``in a fair, open
manner,'' association chairwoman Carol Lai told a news conference.
	   Last week, China barred three reporters of the U.S.
government-funded Radio Free Asia, as well as journalists from Hong
Kong's Apple Daily and its sister publication, Next Magazine, from
going to the mainland to cover U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit.
	   China considers Apple Daily and Next Magazine, both highly
critical of the Communist leadership, ``unfriendly.''
	   The report also said the local branch of China's state-owned
Xinhua News Agency keeps a blacklist of active local journalists
and uses it ``to isolate and punish those in the media deemed
`enemies.'''
	   Beijing should stop screening and controlling journalists
wishing to report on the mainland, the report said. The screening
regulations were imposed after the 1989 bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy activists near Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
	   The association found that officials have not clamped down on
press freedom in Hong Kong as expected after the handover last
July, although self-censorship is more prevalent as the media try
to avoid clashes with Beijing authorities, said Cliff Bale, a radio
reporter and an official of the 800-member union.
	   China has promised to maintain Hong Kong's capitalistic and
legal systems for at least 50 years.
	   ``We're happy to report that things have gone better than we
predicted a year ago,'' but there has been ``a reticence to discuss
any areas concerning (China's) national security,'' such as the
independence of Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan, Bale said.

Israel uncovers Hamas cell blamed for attacks on soldiers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel said Sunday it had uncovered a cell of
the militant Islamic group Hamas responsible for exploding two
bombs close to Israeli military patrols last month.
	   Five suspects from the northern West Bank village of Marka, near
Jenin, admitted under interrogation that they had planted the bombs
and fired shots at Israeli vehicles along the Jenin-Nablus road,
the army said in a statement.
	   Hamas, which violently opposes peace with Israel, has carried
out more than a dozen suicide bombings in Israel since 1994. Hamas
members seek to regain land lost to Israel after the Jewish state's
creation 50 years ago.
	   One suspect, Imad Yasser Musa, 20, is accused of recruiting the
others and admitted planning to plant a bomb near the police
station in the city of Afula in central Israel, the army said.
	   The five suspects were brought before a military court last week
and their detention was extended until the end of proceedings
against them, the army said.

World Cup: Dutch concentrate, Yugoslavs recuperate for second round 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ For the Dutch, concentration is the key
to their second-round match. For the Yugoslavs, it's recuperation.
	   A clutch of Yugoslav players are nursing injuries ahead of
Monday's clash in Toulouse, among them, Real Madrid's Predrag
Mijatovic.
	   The Dutch are physically fit, but coach Guus Hiddink is more
concerned with preparing his players mentally for the knockout
stage of the World Cup.
	   ``For us, in this phase of the World Cup, we must be
super-concentrated and motivated,'' Hiddink said.
	   ``We must be careful, particularly in situations when there is
no apparent danger.''
	   In their last Group E match, the Dutch let slip a 2-0 lead
against Mexico, conceding a brace of late goals as their minds
apparently wandered to the next round.
	   ``In the back of our minds, we knew a draw was enough,''
midfielder Ronald de Boer said.
	   Considered serious title contenders, the Dutch qualified with
just one win and two draws from an easy group, made up of Mexico,
South Korea and Belgium.
	   Yugoslavia, placed in a tougher qualifying group, ended with
seven points, beating the United States and Iran and drawing with
group winner Germany.
	   The qualifying round has given the Yugoslavs confidence going
into Monday's tie.
	   Defender Zeljko Ptrovic said that ``the Dutch are among
three-to-four top teams in the world. But so are the Germans who
got outplayed by us.'' The Germans scored two late goals to draw
2-2.
	   Captain Dragan Stojkovic said the attacking style the Dutch will
suit the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We play badly against defensive teams. The Dutch will leave us
more space in our offense. That is our chance,'' said Stojkovic,
who will play despite a slight ankle injury.
	   Suffering from an aching left knee, Mijatovic was substituted in
the 31st minute of Yugoslavia's match against the United States.
The Yugoslavs won the game 1-0.
	   ``I didn't want to risk it so I asked for substitution,''
Mijatovic said. ``It's much more important that I get well before
the game against the Dutch.'' He will start Monday's match.
	   Also carrying injuries are defenders Zoran Mirkovic and Miroslav
Djukic. Midfielder Dejan Stankovic, 19, had to be substituted in
the second half with a sore left ankle and striker Darko Kovacevic
still has not recovered from a hamstring injury he suffered in the
2-2 tie with Germany. Both Djukic and Kovacevic will miss the
match.
	   Star midfielder Dejan Savicevic went into the game in the second
half against the Americans, his first match in two months after
suffering a knee ligament injury. But he clearly was reluctant to
enter duels and did not appear ready for big games.
	   ``We have to recuperate and get those injured players back on
the pitch against the Dutch,'' said defender Sinisa Mihajlovic, who
is nursing a sore knee. ``But I'm optimistic as we always play
better against stronger teams.''
	   Hiddink can pick AC Milan striker Patrick Kluivert again
following a two-match red card suspension, but he may stick with
Kluivert's replacement, Ronald de Boer, who scored in both matches
he played as a forward.
	   The Netherlands, twice a losing World Cup finalist, is bidding
to reach the quarterfinal for the second time in succession. In the
United States four years ago they were knocked out by eventual
champion Brazil in the round of eight.
	   Yugoslavia did not play in the last World Cup finals, but
reached the quarterfinals in 1990.
	   Hiddink is preparing for a tough encounter at Toulouse's
Municipal Stadium.
	   ``Balkan teams are technically very good and tactically clever.
This Yugoslav team also has a lot of individual class,'' he said.

Holbrooke confirms U.S. envoy met with ''KLA representatives'' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RETRANSMITTING to change slug
<TEXT>
	   CRANS MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
Sunday confirmed that U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard met with people
claiming to be representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army in an
unidentified Western European city on Friday.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which is fighting for
independence for the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   ''It is up to the people who had contacts with Ambassador
Gelbard to demonstrate they do have authority over the armed
personnel of the KLA,'' he said. ''The contacts were with people
who said they had this authority, but at this point that authority
remains to be demonstrated.''
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that two unidentified KLA
leaders, taking part in talks lasting more than an hour with
Gelbard, committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in
Kosovo.
	   They also reportedly agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova to try to provide a common negotiating
position, even though they disagree with his pacifist approach to
seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The meeting could be a first step toward including the KLA in
any peace negotiations. Holbrooke stressed the U.S. wasn't
distancing itself from Rugova.
	   ''I want to stress we continue to support Doctor Rugova, who is
the only major leader who is seeking a non-violent solution to the
problem,'' he said. ''We support a peaceful solution. We admire
Doctor Rugova's commitment to a peaceful and non-violent solution
to the problem. Anything other than a peaceful settlement will lead
to a general war.''
	   Holbrooke was speaking at a press conference during a meeting
here of European and African economic and political leaders. He
completed a four-day mission to Kosovo Friday without securing a
cease-fire.
	   News of the meeting comes as the KLA is locked in a dangerous
stand-off with Serb forces at Kijevo, a crossroads village in the
center of the secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke Saturday identified the village, which lies on one of
two main roads between the provincial capital of Pristina and
Serb-dominated Pec, as a potential flashpoint.
	   ''We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
Holbrooke said.
	   ''If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
intensified fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against militant resistance, led by the KLA. Serbian
forces are using force to try to secure their hold on the province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.

Former Beatle speaks for first time of battle against throat cancer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Beatle George Harrison disclosed Sunday
that he has been battling throad cancer since last summer _ and is
winning.
	   ``I'm not going to die on you folks just yet. I am very lucky,''
the 54-year-old singer was quoted as telling the News of the World.
	   Harrison told the Sunday tabloid that he first noticed a lump on
his neck last July while he was gardening at his 200-room mansion
in Henley, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of London, which he
shares with his wife, Olivia, 47, and their 19-year-old artist son
Dhani.
	   He had surgery in August to remove the lump, which was found to
be cancerous, followed by two courses of of radiation therapy at
the Royal Marsden Hospital, Britain's leading cancer treatment
center.
	   ``I got it purely from smoking. I gave up cigarettes many years
ago but had started again for a while and then stopped in 1997,''
Harrison was quoted as telling the paper.
	   ``Luckily for me they found that this nodule was more of a
warning than anything else. There are many different types of
cancerous cells and this was a very basic type,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   In January, the singer went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota for tests and was told that the cancer had not returned.
He returned to the clinic in May for further tests, the paper said.
	   ``I went back and was given the final all-clear _ a clean bill
of health,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``Sometimes, if you say the word `cancer' everybody
automatically thinks it will end in misery, but it's not always the
case,'' he said. ``I was very lucky because it didn't go anywhere -
all it was was a little red mark on my neck.''
	   But Harrison said the battle with cancer had made him think
about the fragility of life.
	   ``It reminds you that anything can happen ... that's the nature
of life,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Life _ there's an old saying
... Life is like a raindrop on a lotus leaf.''
	   Earlier this month the three surviving Beatles _ Harrison, Ringo
Starr, and Paul McCartney _ were reunited for the first time in
years at a memorial service in London for McCartney's wife, Linda,
who died of breast cancer. John Lennon, the fourth Beatle, was shot
to death in New York City in 1980.
	   In May, Harrison went to court and argued successfully that
sales of a recording of the group singing drunkenly in a Hamburg
club in 1962 should be halted.
	   After the Beatles broke up, Harrison had several solo hits
including ``My Sweet Lord'' and ``Got My Mind Set on You.'' In
January, he sang the Carl Perkins song ``Your True Love'' at the
funeral in Jackson, Tennessee of the writer of many pop hits
including ``Blue Suede Shoes.''
	   Asked by the News of the World if the events of the past year
might be reflected in some of his new songs, Harrison was quoted as
saying: ``Maybe I'll record a track called Radiation Therapy.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, venturing from a
church once shuttered by communists to the Forbidden City and the
Great Wall, said Sunday he felt confident China was on a path of
progress.
	   ``In the last 25 years, it's changed quite a lot,'' the
president said as he toured with Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, the vermilion-walled imperial courtyards of
Beijing's Forbidden City, adjacent to Tiananmen Square.
	   Asked if China had changed enough, Clinton said, ``After
yesterday, I feel quite good about it.'' On Saturday, Clinton and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin had engaged in a lively debate
televised across China _ an unprecedented public dialogue.
	   For a first-hand look at more of China's imperial past, the
Clintons ventured out of the capital Sunday afternoon to tour the
Great Wall. To reach the mountaintop wall at Mutianyi they rode in
a gondola, joined by Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham.
	   In steamy heat, the presidential party strolled atop the wall,
where they peered through hazy skies at far reaches of the stone
spine, built mostly in the second century B.C. to hold out Central
Asian horsemen _ first the Huns and later the Mongols.
	   ``It's quite unbelievable, isn't it,'' Clinton said. ``It's
amazing to imagine that it was done so long ago.''
	   Before trading his statesman's coat and tie for a tourist's
green polo shirt, Clinton worshipped Sunday with Beijing's largest
Protestant congregation and said he felt at home in the old,
gray-brick church in central Beijing.
	   Clinton's presence at the Chongwenmen Church, part of China's
nondenominational official church, highlighted his concerns for
religious freedom. Although China's constitution protects religious
rights, in practice some church leaders are harassed and jailed.
	   Speaking after a sermon about unity in the church, Clinton said:
``I would like to add only one point: I believe our faith calls
upon us to seek unity with people across the world, of different
races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   He said he felt ``very much at home with you here in this
church'' and was encouraged by the ``growth of the practice of our
faith in China.''
	   During the Cultural Revolution, from the mid-1960s to late
1970s, churches in China were closed; many were destroyed.
Chongwenmen did not reopen until Christmas 1982. Today about 2,500
worship there each Sunday.
	   Many parishioners emerged from the service to say praying with
Clinton had been a thrill.
	   ``He's the president of the United States but the moment he
stepped into our church, he was a brother. In the face of God, we
are all equal,'' said Liu Yufang.
	   After the service, Clinton and his family toured the ancient
palaces and courtyards of the Forbidden City, the spectacular
walled enclave that was the residence for 24 emperors of Ming and
Qing dynasties.
	   On Monday, Clinton will address students at China's elite Peking
University, a quiet, leafy campus whose students were some of the
leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
	   Mrs. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned
to meet Monday with lawyers running a legal services center on the
edge of the campus, the country's only national center helping
women seek their legal rights.
	   At the church, the president spoke briefly in the large round
sanctuary with white plaster walls and brown wooden floor and
ceiling. The church, built in 1904 in the waning years of China's
last dynasty, is tucked in narrow lanes in an old part of Beijing
where historic houses are rapidly giving way to modern buildings.
	   Parishioners were hopeful Clinton's appearance at the
government-sanctioned church would promote religious freedom. ``Now
that he's prayed with us, the Chinese government will greatly relax
its policies toward us Christians and our churches,'' said Liu
Suxing.
	   She complained that churches not sanctioned by the government,
where many Christians prefer to worship, often are shut down. The
government ``says there is freedom of religion but in reality it's
not free,'' she said.
	   Human rights groups say dozens of Protestant and Catholic
leaders are imprisoned or held in Chinese labor camps for refusing
to bow to government control. Clinton and Jiang agreed to exchange
visits of religious leaders to further understanding on spiritual
matters.
	   In addressing the congregation, Clinton quoted from the Bible,
Acts 17:26, ``God has made from one blood every nation to dwell on
the surface of the Earth,'' and he added, ``I believe that is
true.''
	   Christians are a very small minority of China's population of
1.2 billion people. Beijing, a city of 13 million people, has eight
churches serving 30,000 members.

Taiwan welcomes warming U.S.-China ties, but not at its expense 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan applauds warming China-U.S.
relations, but is disappointed at being left out of the picture,
Vice President Lien Chan said Sunday.
	   Lien said he was ``pleased to see'' signs of warmth in ties
between China and the United States resulting from U.S. President
Bill Clinton's current visit to China.
	   But he stressed that developments must not come at the expense
of Taiwan, which China claims as a renegade province.
	   And Lien obliquely criticized Washington for not paying similar
attention to Taiwan, pointing out the contrast between Taiwanese
democracy and China's authoritarian government.
	   ``On his visit, President Clinton saw the cultural, historical
and economic China. I regret he was not able to see the free,
democratic China,'' Lien said at a meeting of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
	   Nervous officials expressed relief that no new agreements over
Taiwan's status were reached during Clinton's meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing.
	   Foreign Minister Jason Hu told reporters Clinton had stuck to
pledges not to give in to Chinese demands for reducing support for
Taiwan.
	   ``The United States has thoroughly honored its initial promise
not to damage Taiwan's interests,'' Hu said. The United States will
send an official to brief Taiwan on the content of the talks after
Clinton's visit, Hu said.
	   In his opening statement at Saturday's news conference in
Beijing, Clinton said only that he ``reaffirmed our longstanding
one-China policy'' to Jiang, and encouraged Beijing to expand
dialogue with Taiwan.
	   That policy commits Washington to having diplomatic relations
with Beijing only, and not recognizing an independent Taiwan.
Washington, however, is required by law to ensure Taiwan can defend
itself, and maintains that the sides must resolve their dispute
peacefully.
	   But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton could make a
detailed public statement later strongly reiterating U.S.
commitments to China over Taiwan. Taipei has warned that such a
statement, if made publicly or put into a signed agreement, would
reduce its room to maneuver diplomatically.
	   McCurry told a Taiwanese television station that Clinton might
deliver the remarks during an appearance at Beijing University on
Monday.
	   ``I suspect that the president will reiterate policy ... and do
it in somewhat greater detail,'' McCurry said in an interview with
the TVBS cable news station.
	   But McCurry said the White House doesn't believe a reiteration
is significant enough to provoke a backlash.
	   Taiwanese officials say they will loudly protest any U.S. move
that damages Taiwan's interests.
	   The Nationalists were driven out of China in 1949 and long
claimed to be the only legitimate government of both the mainland
and Taiwan under its official name, the Republic of China. They
continue to back eventual reunification, but call for each side to
first recognize the other's sovereignty.

After a look at China's new and old, Clinton sounds optimistic note 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Grafs 8-9 UPDATE with dissidents released; Mutianyu in 4th
graf is cq.
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, venturing from a
church once shuttered by communists to the Forbidden City and the
Great Wall, said Sunday he felt confident China was on a path of
progress.
	   ``In the last 25 years, it's changed quite a lot,'' the
president said as he toured with Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, the vermilion-walled imperial courtyards of
Beijing's Forbidden City, adjacent to Tiananmen Square.
	   Asked if China had changed enough, Clinton said, ``After
yesterday, I feel quite good about it.'' On Saturday, Clinton and
Chinese President Jiang Zemin had engaged in a lively debate
televised across China _ an unprecedented public dialogue.
	   For a first-hand look at more of China's imperial past, the
Clintons ventured out of the capital Sunday afternoon to tour the
Great Wall. To reach the mountaintop wall at Mutianyu they rode in
a gondola, joined by Mrs. Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham.
	   In steamy heat, the presidential party strolled atop the wall,
where they peered through hazy skies at far reaches of the stone
spine, built mostly in the second century B.C. to hold out Central
Asian horsemen _ first the Huns and later the Mongols.
	   ``It's quite unbelievable, isn't it,'' Clinton said. ``It's
amazing to imagine that it was done so long ago.''
	   Before trading his statesman's coat and tie for a tourist's
green polo shirt, Clinton worshipped Sunday with Beijing's largest
Protestant congregation and said he felt at home in the old,
gray-brick church in central Beijing.
	   Meanwhile, a human rights group said Sunday that all four
dissidents who were detained in Xi'an, the first city on Clinton's
China trip, have been released.
	   But another dissident, Li Xiaolong, was still being held in
southern China, while an activist in Shanghai was made to leave the
city ahead of Clinton's arrival there Monday, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Clinton's presence at the Chongwenmen Church, part of China's
nondenominational official church, highlighted his concerns for
religious freedom. Although China's constitution protects religious
rights, in practice some church leaders are harassed and jailed.
	   Speaking after a sermon about unity in the church, Clinton said:
``I would like to add only one point: I believe our faith calls
upon us to seek unity with people across the world, of different
races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   He said he felt ``very much at home with you here in this
church'' and was encouraged by the ``growth of the practice of our
faith in China.''
	   During the Cultural Revolution, from the mid-1960s to late
1970s, churches in China were closed; many were destroyed.
Chongwenmen did not reopen until Christmas 1982. Today about 2,500
worship there each Sunday.
	   Many parishioners emerged from the service to say praying with
Clinton had been a thrill.
	   ``He's the president of the United States but the moment he
stepped into our church, he was a brother. In the face of God, we
are all equal,'' said Liu Yufang.
	   After the service, Clinton and his family toured the ancient
palaces and courtyards of the Forbidden City, the spectacular
walled enclave that was the residence for 24 emperors of Ming and
Qing dynasties.
	   On Monday, Clinton will address students at China's elite Peking
University, a quiet, leafy campus whose students were some of the
leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
	   Mrs. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned
to meet Monday with lawyers running a legal services center on the
edge of the campus, the country's only national center helping
women seek their legal rights.
	   At the church, the president spoke briefly in the large round
sanctuary with white plaster walls and brown wooden floor and
ceiling. The church, built in 1904 in the waning years of China's
last dynasty, is tucked in narrow lanes in an old part of Beijing
where historic houses are rapidly giving way to modern buildings.
	   Parishioners were hopeful Clinton's appearance at the
government-sanctioned church would promote religious freedom. ``Now
that he's prayed with us, the Chinese government will greatly relax
its policies toward us Christians and our churches,'' said Liu
Suxing.
	   She complained that churches not sanctioned by the government,
where many Christians prefer to worship, often are shut down. The
government ``says there is freedom of religion but in reality it's
not free,'' she said.
	   Human rights groups say dozens of Protestant and Catholic
leaders are imprisoned or held in Chinese labor camps for refusing
to bow to government control. Clinton and Jiang agreed to exchange
visits of religious leaders to further understanding on spiritual
matters.
	   In addressing the congregation, Clinton quoted from the Bible,
Acts 17:26, ``God has made from one blood every nation to dwell on
the surface of the Earth,'' and he added, ``I believe that is
true.''
	   Christians are a very small minority of China's population of
1.2 billion people. Beijing, a city of 13 million people, has eight
churches serving 30,000 members.

Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of planning war of attrition 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTIN STOLK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia is incapable of achieving its
goal of occupying parts of Eritrean territory and is, therefore,
planning a war of attrition, Eritrea said Sunday.
	   ``The clashes that have occurred so far have demonstrated it
(Ethiopia) does not have the capability to achieve its goals,''
said a government statement. ``It has thus chosen to prepare for a
prolonged and destructive war.''
	   The statement was a summary of discussions at the 11th session
of the National Assembly late Friday. It was the first time
parliament met since the border conflict with Ethiopia erupted six
weeks ago.
	   The statement made no mention of Friday's demand by the U.N.
Security Council that both sides halt fighting.
	   Also the Security Council endorsed efforts by African leaders to
end the border conflict peacefully.
	   The council unanimously approved a U.S.-drafted resolution which
urged Secretary-General Kofi Annan to ``use his good offices'' as a
possible mediator and offered services of the United Nations to
help define and mark the border if the two sides can reach an
agreement.
	   The resolution commended efforts by the Organization of African
Unity to mediate in the conflict and ``condemns the use of force
and demands that both parties immediately cease hostilities and
refrain from further use of force.''
	   On Saturday, Yemane Gebreab, President Isaias Afwerki's advisor,
told journalists the assembly considered the council's resolution a
positive move.
	   Selome Taddese, Ethiopia's spokeswoman, told journalists Sunday
the council resolution was a ``hope for peace.''
	   Selome had no comment on the Eritrea's charges Ethiopia is
planning a protracted war.
	   Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross said
Saturday it is monitoring the flow of displaced Eritreans.
	   Delegate Peter Iseli said 60,000 Eritreans displaced by the
fighting have been absorbed by local communities and ``there has
not yet been any need for Red Cross assistance.''
	   He said the Red Cross has not visited any prisoners of war in
Eritrea.
	   ``The authorities are very discrete,'' Iseli said. ``The ICRC
thinks this is okay because it shows restraint and no will to
expose the POWs to the press.''

New U.S. ambassador to Spain arrives in Madrid

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The new U.S. ambassador to Spain, Ed
Romero, arrived in Madrid Sunday to fill a position that has been
empty for almost a year.
	   The New Mexico businessman told reporters at the capital's
Barajas airport that his ancestor, Bartolome Romero, had left Spain
by boat four centuries ago to settle in the Americas.
	   ``I want to serve my president and my fatherland, the United
States, to the best of my ability and with honor, and I hope that
my historical motherland, Spain, receives me with the same pleasure
and pride as I feel,'' he said in a brief statement.
	   The new ambassador, who replaces Richard Gardner, is due to
present his credentials to King Juan Carlos in an elaborate
ceremony on Tuesday.
	   Romero, 64, described Spanish-U.S. relations as ``excellent.''
	   He mentioned Spain's important role within NATO, its
contribution to peace efforts in the Middle East and praised
Spanish ``support of the democratic process in Latin America and
strengthening of world trade.''
	   Romero, who was sworn in as ambassador to Spain and Andorra for
a three-year-term last week, described himself as ``a businessman
who has always been interested in other things.''
	   He still serves as chief executive officer of Commodore-ASI, an
Albuquerque environmental management company.

Holbrooke confirms U.S. envoy met with ''KLA representatives'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CRANS MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
confirmed on Sunday that U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard met with people
claiming to be representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army in an
unidentified Western European city on Friday.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which is fighting for
independence for the Yugoslav province.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
intensified fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against militant resistance, led by the KLA. Serbian
forces are using force to try to secure their hold on the province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. Serbia is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   ``It is up to the people who had contacts with Ambassador
Gelbard to demonstrate they do have authority over the armed
personnel of the KLA,'' he said. ``The contacts were with people
who said they had this authority, but at this point that authority
remains to be demonstrated.''
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that two unidentified KLA
leaders, taking part in talks lasting more than an hour with
Gelbard, committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in
Kosovo.
	   They also reportedly agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova to try to provide a common negotiating
position, even though they disagree with his pacifist approach to
seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The meeting could be a first step toward including the KLA in
any peace negotiations. Holbrooke stressed the U.S. wasn't
distancing itself from Rugova.
	   ``I want to stress we continue to support Doctor Rugova, who is
the only major leader who is seeking a non-violent solution to the
problem,'' he said. ``We support a peaceful solution. We admire
Doctor Rugova's commitment to a peaceful and non-violent solution
to the problem. Anything other than a peaceful settlement will lead
to a general war.''
	   Holbrooke spoke during a meeting here of European and African
economic and political leaders. He completed a four-day mission to
Kosovo on Friday without securing a cease-fire.
	   News of the meeting came as the KLA is locked in a dangerous
stand-off with Serb forces at Kijevo, a crossroads village in the
center of the secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
Holbrooke said.
	   ``If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.

World Cup: Romania displays `good balance' of experienced, young players 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ The aging limbs of Gheorghe Hagi and Co.
gave Romania one last shot and the medicine produced the miracle
that many didn't expect: a spot among the World Cup's last 16 and
realistic hopes of advancing to the quarterfinals.
	   After edging England 2-1 and Colombia 1-0 and tieing Tunisia
1-1, Romania clinched Group G and earned a place in the knockout
second stage.
	   The Romanians will play debutant Croatia on Tuesday in an
all-Balkan clash, with the winner getting a quarterfinal match
probably against Germany.
	   ``Few expected Romania's veterans and newcomers meld so smoothly
at the right moment,'' said Adalbert Kassai, general secretary of
the Romanian Football Federation. ``Many said the team is too old
or that the young players lack international experience.''
	   Hagi concurred, saying, ``Our team is well balanced in all
aspects of the game.''
	   Romania achieved its all-time best showing in a World Cup in
1994, beating Colombia and the United States in the first round,
then Argentina in a wild second-round match before falling to
Sweden on penalties in the quarterfinals.
	   Some of the top players then are still the top players now, but
there is significant new blood and more variety in the style.
	   The 33-year-old Hagi, who plays in Turkey with Galatasary, is
again the fulcrum of the squad that includes other established
players like Chelsea's Dan Petrescu, former Barcelona star Gheorghe
Popescu and veteran striker Marius Lacatus, 34, who played for
Fiorentina and Real Oviedo.
	   Hagi is still one of the game's best, but he has slowed
noticeably and no longer can be the go-through man. He failed to
score any goals in the three first-round games, and announced he
would retire from the Romanian national team after France.
	   ``Hagi still is the leader of our team but he is too nervous. He
needs to be calmer. He needs more concentration,'' coach Anghel
Iordanescu said.
	   He and other old stars want to end their long international
careers with a big bang.
	   ``They know this is their last major appearance before the
curtain falls over their career,'' said Kassai.
	   The older generation, which also includes striker Florin
Raducioiu, star of the 1994 tournament and now with Stuttgart, has
been replaced by young and ambitious players who have been lured
away from cash-strapped Romanian clubs by respected soccer clubs in
the West.
	   For Iordanscu, who was criticized for sticking with the old
hands, that was big relief.
	   ``We have a valuable, experienced team of great talent,''` he
told reporters. ``There are several young players we can rely on.''
	   Iordanescu has hung a lot of his hopes on Valencia's Adrian
Ilie, a 24-year-old striker who has sprung from nowhere in the past
year to become a central figure in the Romanian setup.
	   His most obvious asset is his speed, but he packs an accurate
shot as well.
	   Ilie, whose four-year contract with Valencia contains a special
clause allowing him to leave if another club offers dlrs 33 million
for his services, tallied a superb goal in the game against
Colombia.
	   ``Our team has a good balance of experienced and young players
who bring boldness and life,'' said Ilie, who is reportedly courted
by Real Madrid. ``I hope to score more goals during the World Cup
to become internationally better known.''
	   Another pleasant surprise for Romanian fans is forward Viorel
Moldovan, 25, who has spent most of his time on the bench at
Coventry City. In France, however, he was part of a useful
combination up front with Ilie _ and scored two goals so far.
	   Other newcomers who impressed are defender Iulian Filipescu, 24,
of Galatasaray, who proved to be a utility player who can be
equally effective in defense and midfield, and Salamanca's Gabriel
Popescu, 24, an excellent playmaker who is being groomed to take
over Hagi's tactical attributions.
	   Popescu is set to move across Spain from Salamanca to Valencia
on a four-year contract, thus joining Ilie, his teammate in the
national squad.

Noro wins Japan's Women Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NISHIKAMOGUN, Japan (AP) _ Natsuko Noro, with her husband
carrying her bag and providing advice, won the Japan Women's Open
Golf Championship by two strokes Sunday _ and then couldn't find
him.
	   ``I could win because my husband gave me advice as a caddy. I
wanted to embrace him (on the green) for the victory, but I
couldn't find him after holing out,'' said Noro, who finished at
2-under-par 286 after an ever-par 72 final round.
	   Her husband, a 32-year-old salaried worker, is not her regular
caddy, but served in that role throughout this four-day event, one
of the three major tournaments on the Japanese women's tour.
	   Noro received 14 million yen (dlrs 99,000) from a purse of 70
million yen (dlrs 496,000) for her first victory this season and
second in her eight-year career.
	   She started the final round with a one-stroke lead over Taiwan's
Huang Yu-chen and Marnie McGuire of New Zealand, and shot four
birdies and four bogeys on the 6,320-yard, par-72 Miyoshi Country
Club course.
	   Huang, winner of last week's Dunlop Open, double bogeyed the
last hole for a 73 and placed second at 288, winning 7.7 million
yen (dlrs 55,000).
	   Ku Ok-hee shot a 73 and shared third place at 291 with Korean
compatriot Shin Sora and Japan's Akiko Fukushima. Shin shot 73 and
Fukushima 75 Sunday.
	   McGuire had 77 and shared sixth place at 292 with two Japanese _
Yuri Fudo and Akemi Yamaoka.

Rockets slam into capital, killing four conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with five more rockets hit Kabul. EDITS throughout to
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rockets slammed into the beleaguered
Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday in one of the deadliest assaults
in the past year, killing four people and wounding several others,
said hospital officials and eyewitnesses.
	   Throughout the day the rockets rattled the city. By the end of
the day 15 rockets had hit several areas, eyewitnesses said.
	   Four rockets landed at the combined military and civilian
airport. The others all hit a densely populated residential area on
the southeastern edge of the city.
	   The rockets were fired by opposition soldiers based north of the
capital.
	   On the southeastern edge of the city where several rockets
landed, people ran for cover, some hid in and under trees. One man
was killed when a rocket landed beside the tree in which he was
hiding.
	   A 15-year-old boy was killed when a rocket slammed into his
house. His relatives quickly gathered at the victim's home wailing
and crying, said eyewitnesses in the area.
	   The opposition vowed to keep up its assault on the capital, and
particularly the airport to prevent Taliban jet fighters from using
the airstrip.
	   But within minutes of one rocket attack two aircraft landed on
the undamaged runway.
	   ``We will keep targeting Kabul ... unless the Taliban stop using
the airport,'' said Mohammed Arif, a spokesman for ousted military
chief Ahmed Shah Massood. ``The Taliban jets are bombing
civilians.''
	   The blistering rocket assault Sunday was the worst since
opposition soldiers moved within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the
capital almost one year ago.
	   The Taliban and its opponents have been waging fierce battles on
at least three different fronts. The anti-Taliban alliance, led by
Massood and ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani, controls about 15
percent of Afghanistan.
	   The remaining 85 percent is ruled by the Taliban religious army
which has imposed its harsh version of Islamic law on the residents
of the area.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is trying to stop the Taliban from
gaining full control of the country, something they have been
unable to do in four years of fighting.
	   The Taliban's biggest victory was to gain control of Kabul in
1996, when they drove out Massood and Rabbani, who had ruled for
four years.
	   During Rabbani's rein, a bitter power struggle ensued for the
capital and between 1992 until his ouster in 1996 an estimated
30,000 people -- most of them civilians -- died in rocket attacks
on the city. Most of the rockets were fired by Rabbani's rival at
the time, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
	   Rabbani and Hekmatyar have since become allies to oust the
Taliban.
	   Attempts by the United Nations to broker a peace agreement
between the warring factions have so far failed.

President reportedly slaps editor who criticized him 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese President Elias Hrawi slapped
the editor of a leading weekly magazine that published repeated
attacks on his administration, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   No one was immediately available to comment at Hrawi's office.
Government offices are closed Sunday in Lebanon.
	   The incident occurred Saturday at the house of Interior Minister
Michel Murr in Beirut as Murr received condolences on the death of
his mother, Ad-Diyar newspaper said Sunday.
	   Hassan Sabra, publisher and editor-in-chief of the weekly
magazine Ash Shiraa, came in to offer his condolences.
	   Afterward, Sabra turned to shake hands with Hrawi, who was
quoted as telling him, ``Get out of here. Get out of my face.''
	   When Sabra insisted on shaking hands, Hrawi stood up and
shouted, ``I told you to get out of my face.'' He then slapped him
before the interior minister intervened, the paper said.
	   Hrawi was reportedly angered by articles that criticized the
president's proposal in March to permit civil marriages in Lebanon.
	   Lebanon only permits religious weddings, and couples of mixed
religious backgrounds must travel abroad to get married.
	   Sabra, a Shiite Muslim from southern Lebanon, is known for his
harsh criticism of government officials for failing to stamp out
rampant corruption in the administration.
	   Sabra was not available Sunday for comment. But Ad-Diyar quoted
him as saying he was considering a lawsuit.
	   His magazine gained fame in the 1980s for breaking news of the
Iran-contra scandal, in which the Reagan administration diverted
proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels from arms sales to Iran.

Chirac presents Tutu with award

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   STELLENBOSCH, South Africa (AP) _ French President Jacques
Chirac awarded retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu one of
France's highest awards Sunday for his anti-apartheid activities.
	   ``I salute in you a man who brought the message of the gospels
to the heart of action, a man who was and is the conscience and
inspiration of South Africa,'' Chirac told Tutu.
	   Chirac pinned a silver star with a red ribbon on Tutu's lapel,
making him a grand officer of the Legion of Honor, France's highest
award to non-heads of state.
	   Tutu, who had led protests against apartheid which ended with
South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, said the struggle
had been inspired by the French revolution.
	   The ceremony was held in a winery northeast of Cape Town. The
two then sat down to lunch with other guests at the winery, set
amid rolling hills near the town of Stellenbosch.
	   Later Sunday, Chirac was to head to Mozambique.
	   South Africa is the key stop on Chirac's six-day tour of
southern African countries that is meant to encourage new
relationships and bring closer political and economic ties. He
earlier visited Namibia and ends his trip with a stopover in
Angola.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, meanwhile, went to
Franschoek, a town near Stellenbosch settled in the 17th century by
French protestants fleeing Catholic persecution. Vedrine signed a
125 million rand (dlrs 21 million) loan to the Development Bank of
Southern Africa with objective of funding infrastructure projects
for disadvangtaged communities.

Taiwanese claim biggest jigsaw puzzle record 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Invited guests laid in place the last
seven pieces of what organizers claimed is the world's largest
jigsaw puzzle at a Taipei hotel Sunday.
	   The puzzle, containing 209,250 pieces put together in sections
by families across Taiwan, measured 47 square meters (505 square
feet) in area after being assembled in the hotel's atrium.
	   The project was sponsored by Hotai Motor Co., local agents for
Japanese car maker Toyota, and the Walt Disney company.
	   It portrays characters from the new Disney animated film
``Mulan,'' a Hollywood take on an ancient Chinese legend still
taught to Taiwanese school children. A version of the film dubbed
into Mandarin is to be shown in Taiwan theaters beginning July 11.
	   Organizers claim the puzzle has 4,766 pieces more than the
former champion, which was assembled by a Dutch school in 1991.
They have asked the Guinness Book of World Records to verify that
it is a record.

Bertelsmann acquires majority interest in Berlin Verlag 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German media conglomerate Bertelsmann,
fresh from its deal to take over U.S. publisher Random House, has
added another German publisher to its stable, the company said
Sunday.
	   Bertelsmann said it acquired a majority interest in the
privately owned Berlin Verlag, publisher since 1994 of literature
and technical works. Bertelsmann declined to disclose the value of
the transaction, or the percentage of its ownership.
	   Bertelsmann, the world's third-largest media and entertainment
company after Time Warner Inc. and Walt Disney Co., is a major
publisher of both German- and English-language books.
	   The German company announced in March that it would take over
Random House, the largest U.S. publisher, and already owns Bantam
Books, Doubleday, Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books.
	   Bertelsmann spokeswoman Friederike Harmgarth said that Arnulf
Conradi will continue to head Berlin Verlag and also will take over
the helm of Siedler Verlag. But the two companies will retain their
distinct brands in the marketplace, Harmgarth said.

Eritrea accuses Ethiopia of planning war of attrition 
</HEADLINE>
By MARTIN STOLK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Ethiopia is incapable of achieving its
goal of occupying parts of Eritrean territory and as a result is
planning a war of attrition, Eritrea said Sunday.
	   ``The clashes that have occurred so far have demonstrated it
(Ethiopia) does not have the capability to achieve its goals,''
said a government statement. ``It has thus chosen to prepare for a
prolonged and destructive war.''
	   The statement was a summary of discussions at the 11th session
of the National Assembly late Friday. It was the first time
parliament has met since the border conflict with Ethiopia erupted
six weeks ago.
	   The statement made no mention of Friday's demand by the U.N.
Security Council that both sides halt fighting. The Security
Council also endorsed efforts by African leaders to end the border
conflict peacefully.
	   On Saturday, Yemane Gebreab, President Isaias Afwerki's advisor,
told journalists the assembly considered the council's resolution a
positive move.
	   Selome Taddese, Ethiopia's spokeswoman, told journalists Sunday
the council resolution was a ``hope for peace.''
	   Selome had no comment on Eritrea's charges Ethiopia is planning
a protracted war.
	   Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross said
Saturday it is monitoring the flow of displaced Eritreans.
	   Delegate Peter Iseli said 60,000 Eritreans displaced by the
fighting have been absorbed by local communities and ``there has
not yet been any need for Red Cross assistance.''

Holbrooke confirms U.S. envoy met with ''KLA representatives'' 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Albright comments
<TEXT>
	   CRANS MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
Sunday confirmed that U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard met with people
claiming to be representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army in an
unidentified Western European city on Friday.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, a group fighting for independence
for the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   ''It is up to the people who had contacts with Ambassador
Gelbard to demonstrate they do have authority over the armed
personnel of the KLA,'' he said. ''The contacts were with people
who said they had this authority, but at this point that authority
remains to be demonstrated.''
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Beijing with
President Bill Clinton, told reporters Gelbard and Holbrooke were
``trying to get a diplomatic solution'' but NATO planning for other
options was accelerating.
	   ``All options are on the table,'' she said, giving no more hint
than she has in recent weeks of what action might be taken.
	   Albright said the diplomatic solution entails ``getting (Serbia
President Slobodan) Milosevic to realize he's going totally in the
wrong direction.''
	   She also said ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova needs a
broader base and needs to ``bring fighters into the camp of those
who seek a diplomatic solution.''
	   ``It's very difficult,'' Albright said.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that two unidentified KLA
leaders, taking part in talks lasting more than an hour with
Gelbard, committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in
Kosovo.
	   They also reportedly agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova to try to provide a common negotiating
position, even though they disagree with his pacifist approach to
seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The meeting could be a first step toward including the KLA in
any peace negotiations. Holbrooke stressed the U.S. wasn't
distancing itself from Rugova.
	   ''I want to stress we continue to support Doctor Rugova, who is
the only major leader who is seeking a non-violent solution to the
problem,'' he said. ''We support a peaceful solution. We admire
Doctor Rugova's commitment to a peaceful and non-violent solution
to the problem. Anything other than a peaceful settlement will lead
to a general war.''
	   Holbrooke was speaking at a press conference during a meeting
here of European and African economic and political leaders. He
completed a four-day mission to Kosovo Friday without securing a
cease-fire.
	   News of the meeting comes as the KLA is locked in a dangerous
stand-off with Serb forces at Kijevo, a crossroads village in the
center of the secessionist province of Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke Saturday identified the village, which lies on one of
two main roads between the provincial capital of Pristina and
Serb-dominated Pec, as a potential flashpoint.
	   ''We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
Holbrooke said.
	   ''If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
intensified fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against militant resistance, led by the KLA. Serbian
forces are using force to try to secure their hold on the province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1.

World Cup: Italian chief upset by `hooligan' tag on neo-Nazi fans AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Already faced with problems with tickets, referees
and street violence, the World Cup confronted another troublespot
Sunday: Just who is a hooligan?
	   A public-address announcement at Saturday's Italy-Norway game in
Marseille directed at a small group of neo-Nazi Italian fans _
``Don't behave like hooligans'' _ angered the head of the national
soccer federation.
	   Luciano Nezzola said he was upset that fans from Italy, even
though they might be fascist sympathizers, were grouped in the same
category with the street thugs from England and Germany, where
soccer hooliganism has its roots.
	   Marseille was the scene two weeks ago of three days of violence
by English hooligans.
	   ``I am very angry,'' Nezzola told Italian journalists after the
match. ``It's not true that Italian fans are hooligans.''
	   World Cup organizers said the stadium announcement in Italian
was proper and they dismissed Nezzola's criticism.
	   ``I understand that it might be an insult to be called a
hooligan, but you have to call a spade a spade,'' said Bruno
Travade, a spokesman for the French organizing committee.
	   According to Travade, a small group of fans from Verona, an area
of Italy with a sizable neo-fascist community, were stopped as they
tried take a flag with the swastika of Nazi Germany into the
stadium.
	   When they got to their seats, the spokesman said, the fans began
``acting in an aggressive manner toward the people near them.''
	   ``It was very insulting,'' Travade said. ``They were making
politically insulting statements. These were neo-fascist, making
Nazi salutes.''
	   After ushers were unable to subdue the ruckus, Travade said,
eight French police were called to the area, along with an Italian
police representative who identified the fans as fascist
sympathizers from Verona.
	   At the same time, the PA system announced in Italian,
``Attention Italian fans. Don't behave like hooligans. If you do,
you will be treated like hooligans.''
	   Nezzola said Italian fans don't behave like the notorious
English thugs who smashed shops and bars and fought with police in
Marseille. German hooligans were blamed for violence in Lens that
left a police officer in a coma, and French authorities in recent
days have mounted a show of force against any hints of street
violence.
	   That crackdown should not have extended to Italian fans in
Marseille, Nezzola said.
	   The French organizers took a ``one-sided decision'' to make the
announcement ``because 10 Italians carried a flag with the Nazi
symbol,'' the federation president said.
	   Travade said the decision was correct.
	   ``The English fans are those most identified with hooligans, and
I can understand that some people would take umbrage,'' Travade
said. ``But the situation calmed down (after the announcement).
That is what was intended. That is what counts.''

Court fires two police officers for negligence in Luxor massacre 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian police court fired two senior
officers for negligence Sunday in the massacre last year of 62
people in the southern city of Luxor, officials said.
	   The Police High Disciplinary Commission also canceled the
retirement bonuses and cut by one-fourth the pensions of the two
officers, Maj. Gen. Medhat el-Shanawani, former police chief of
Luxor, and his deputy, Maj. Gen. Youssef Abu el-Atta, the officials
said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Fifty-eight tourists and four Egyptians were killed in the Nov.
17 attack by Muslim radicals at the Temple of Hatshepsut near
Luxor, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. The
attack devastated the tourism industry in Egypt.
	   After the attack, President Hosni Mubarak publicly blamed the
interior minister, who resigned soon after, and ordered an internal
police investigation. The new interior minister, Maj. Gen. Habib
el-Adli, ordered that the two generals be put on trial, along with
four other officers, on charges of negligence.
	   The seven-month trial was conducted behind closed doors, and
newspapers were barred from publishing details of the case.
	   In the verdict Sunday, Judge Imad Ismael said the two officers
failed to work out a proper plan to protect the site and neglected
tips by security agents that terrorist attacks were possible.
Ismael said they were given the stiffest penalty under the police
code.
	   The officers cannot appeal. Their bonuses were worth 300,000
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 88,000). Police pensions are usually between
1,500 pounds (dlrs 440) and 2,000 pounds (dlrs 588) a month.
	   The verdicts have yet to be issued for the other four officers.

Squatters remain on white farms but intentions unclear 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ There were conflicting reports Sunday
whether rural residents who are squatting on four white commercial
farms southeast of Harare would abandon the properties.
	   The government-controlled Sunday Mail reported the squatters
told Vice President Simon Muzenda they would return to their homes.
Muzenda reportedly visited the squatters on Saturday and asked them
to return to their homes while the government works out a strategy
on resettling them.
	   However, the official news agency Ziana said the squatters'
intentions remained unclear, despite their declarations of loyalty
to President Robert Mugabe and his ruling party.
	   Estimates of the numbers of squatters in the Marondera area, 100
miles from the capital, range from 400 to 4,000.

Bridge collapses on major Moscow highway, injuring 10 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bridge under construction as part of Moscow's
massive circular highway collapsed late Saturday, falling onto the
roadway below and injuring 10 workers.
	   The accident occurred shortly before 11 p.m. when the metal
frame supporting the bridge buckled after about 700 tons of
concrete was poured, according to police officials and news
reports.
	   Television footage showed a massive tangle of metal rods and
scaffolding tumbling from the pilings onto the roadway. Dogs
climbed over the rods, searching for possible victims.
	   ``We were walking along the bridge when it suddenly started to
go down,'' worker Nikolai Kovalyov said on ORT television. ``We had
a little plastic walkway, and it kept going down and down.''
	   The bridge was being constructed alongside an existing bridge on
a northern section of the Moscow Circular Roadway where it passes
over another major artery, the Dmitrovskoye Shosse.
	   Traffic was light on both thoroughfares at the time of the
accident, but 10 construction workers were injured, news agencies
said. The ITAR-Tass news agency said three of the injured were in
serious condition.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov expressed concern about the accident,
but said ``it's not worthwhile to dramatize the situation,''
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Traffic was restricted Sunday in both directions on the
Dmitrovskoye Shosse as crews worked to clear the debris. Traffic on
the circular road was unaffected.
	   The cause of the accident was not known, and an investigation
was underway.
	   Construction of the wide highway encircling Moscow has been
perhaps the most visible and widely-praised public works project of
the post-Soviet period. The final stage of the project _ widening
the northern section of the roadway from two lanes to five lanes _
is scheduled to be completed in September.

Holbrooke confirms U.S. envoy met with ''KLA representatives'' comment 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INSERTS five new grafs after 4th graf pvs with Albright
<TEXT>
	   CRANS MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
confirmed on Sunday that U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard met with people
claiming to be representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army in an
unidentified Western European city on Friday.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which is fighting for
independence for the Yugoslav province.
	   More than 300 people have died in Kosovo since early March in
intensified fighting that began after Serbian police launched a
crackdown against militant resistance, led by the KLA. Serbian
forces are using force to try to secure their hold on the province,
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by 9-to-1. Serbia is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   ``It is up to the people who had contacts with Ambassador
Gelbard to demonstrate they do have authority over the armed
personnel of the KLA,'' he said. ``The contacts were with people
who said they had this authority, but at this point that authority
remains to be demonstrated.''
	   	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Beijing with
President Bill Clinton, told reporters Gelbard and Holbrooke were
``trying to get a diplomatic solution'' but NATO planning for other
options was accelerating.
	   ``All options are on the table,'' she said, giving no more hint
than she has in recent weeks of what action might be taken.
	   Albright said the diplomatic solution entails ``getting (Serbia
President Slobodan) Milosevic to realize he's going totally in the
wrong direction.''
	   She also said ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova needs a
broader base and needs to ``bring fighters into the camp of those
who seek a diplomatic solution.''

Report: Deutsche Telekom competitors snag 10 percent of long-distance market 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Nearly six months into Germany's open
home-phone market, competitors have snatched over 10 percent of the
country's long-distance business from the former monopoly, a
newsmagazine reported Sunday.
	   Deutsche Telekom lost its monopoly Jan. 1 under a European
Union-mandated deregulation. Several competitors have entered the
market with cheaper rates, especially for long-distance calls.
	   Customers now log about 39 million minutes in conversations
daily over the networks of competitors, according to a survey by
the Munich-based Focus.
	   Competitors, which have entered the local phone market only a
few cities, have secured 3 percent of the market share for local
calls, Focus said in an advance copy of its Monday edition.
	   Mobilcom is leading the start-ups, claiming nearly 20 percent of
business from customers who have turned away from the former
monopoly, Focus said.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A dangerous standoff at a crossroads
village in the center of the secessionist province of Kosovo has
become the focus of international negotiators, who fear it could
ignite all-out war in the region.
	   Ethnic Albanian guerrillas maintain an armed ring around Kijevo
and have rebuffed demands Saturday that they end their 10-day siege
of the strategic village, located southwest of the provincial
capital of Pristina on one of Kosovo's two main roads.
	   Serbian forces reportedly flew in food and supplies and
evacuated four women and a child. But Western diplomats and
Albanian sources reported an army buildup that could signal
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is poised for another
crackdown.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Saturday at a forum of political
and economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   ``If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an operation on Feb.
28 to try to extinguish growing resistance by secessionist
militants in predominantly Albanian Kosovo. Some 80 people, mostly
civilians, died in that crackdown, and dozens more in another
campaign launched in late May.
	   Kijevo has emerged as a possible site of what diplomats fear
will be a third deadly offensive in Kosovo. A KLA fighter said
Sunday that Yugoslav forces had conducted an aerial bombardment of
the town late Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The new U.S. ambassador to Spain, Ed
Romero, arrived in Madrid Sunday to fill a position that has been
empty for almost a year.
	   The New Mexico businessman told reporters at the capital's
Barajas airport that his ancestor, Bartolome Romero, had left Spain
by boat four centuries ago to settle in the Americas.
	   ``I want to serve my president and my fatherland, the United
States, to the best of my ability and with honor, and I hope that
my historical motherland, Spain, receives me with the same pleasure
and pride as I feel,'' he said in a brief statement.
	   The new ambassador, who replaces Richard Gardner, is due to
present his credentials to King Juan Carlos in an elaborate
ceremony on Tuesday.
	   Romero, 64, described Spanish-U.S. relations as ``excellent.''
	   He mentioned Spain's important role within NATO, its
contribution to peace efforts in the Middle East and praised
Spanish ``support of the democratic process in Latin America and
strengthening of world trade.''
	   Romero, who was sworn in as ambassador to Spain and Andorra for
a three-year-term last week, described himself as ``a businessman
who has always been interested in other things.''
	   He still serves as chief executive officer of Commodore-ASI, an
Albuquerque environmental management company.

Report: Iraq allows PKK to open offices in Baghdad 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has allowed a Turkish Kurdish rebel
group regarded by U.S. officials as a terrorist organization to
open offices in Baghdad, an Arabic newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat, quoting Kurdish sources in northern
Iraq, also said that Iraq has started providing the Kurdistan
Workers Party with weapons and logistical support.
	   It said two other offices for the PKK, which is fighting for
autonomy from Turkey, were opened in the northern cities of Mosul
and Kirkuk, which are under Baghdad's control.
	   Iraq also urged the two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling the
north, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, to allow the PKK to operate in their areas
bordering Turkey.
	   Al-Hayat's report was confirmed by Kurdish officials in northern
Iraq. If true, the move could bolster the group's campaign against
the Turkish army, which started in 1984.
	   Both Syria and Iran, which border Turkey, are believed to
provide the PKK with similar facilities.
	   The PKK has in the past taken refuge in northern Iraq, and
Turkish troops have crossed over into northern Iraq several times
in the last few years to fight the Kurds.
	   Last month, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported
that Iraq agreed to grant asylum to 6,800 Turkish Kurdish refugees
stranded on the line dividing government-held areas from regions
controlled by Iraqi Kurds in the north.
	   The United States and many European countries consider the PKK a
terrorist organization.

Portuguese vote on whether to permit abortion on demand 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Results expected by 2300 GMT
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Voters went to the polls Sunday in a
national referendum on whether to permit abortion on demand, a
deeply divisive issue in this mostly Roman Catholic country.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, termination of pregnancy is
permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or in cases of
rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   People will decide whether abortion on demand through the 10th
week of pregnancy should be ``decriminalized,'' which in effect
will eliminate current prohibitions.
	   The polls opened at 8a.m. (0700 GMT) and national media reported
a slow early turnout. The weather was fine across the country, with
temperatures reaching 30 degrees Celcius (86 Fahrenheit).
	   Teresa Cardoso, a 45-year-old Lisbon newspaper seller, said she
had voted yes because abortion was the lesser of two evils.
	   ``I think it's more criminal to allow a child into the world
knowing that it won't have decent living conditions,'' she said.
	   Others remained split on the issue.
	   ``I'm very torn. There are good arguments on both sides,'' said
Luisa Teixeira, a Lisbon schoolteacher in her 50s, who said she
still hadn't decided which way she would vote.
	   The result of Portugal's first-ever referendum was due around
midnight (2300 GMT).
	   The National Assembly, Portugal's parliament, has been debating
the abortion issue for the past 14 years _ since leftist parties
first won enough seats to press for a discussion.
	   Lawmakers in February approved a bill relaxing abortion
restrictions, but opponents successfully pushed for the national
ballot which will either overturn or ratify that legislation.
	   An intense two-week campaign leading up to the ballot featured
marches in major cities and a nationwide media blitz.
	   Abortion rights activists _ mostly the younger generation backed
by leftist politicians _ say they want to end the estimated 16,000
illegal abortions each year in Portugal, a nation of 9.5 million
people.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions.
	   Women can be imprisoned for up to three years for having an
illegal abortion.
	   Opposition to the easing of the current law has come from older
Portuguese, backed by the influential Catholic church and
conservative parties.
	   While the `yes' camp is favored to win, voter-intention polls
have shown its support drop over the course of the campaign to
about 50 percent from 60 percent.
	   The referendum's result will be binding only if more than half
of registered voters participate.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German media conglomerate Bertelsmann,
fresh from its deal to take over U.S. publisher Random House, is
adding another German publisher to its stable, the company said
Sunday.
	   Bertelsmann said it is to acquire a qualified majority interest
in the privately owned Berlin Verlag, publisher since 1994 of
literature and technical works. Bertelsmann declined to disclose
the value of the transaction, or the percentage of its ownership.
	   Bertelsmann, the world's third-largest media and entertainment
company after Time Warner Inc. and Walt Disney Co., is a major
publisher of both German- and English-language books.
	   The German company announced in March that it would take over
Random House, the largest U.S. publisher, and already owns Bantam
Books, Doubleday, Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books.
	   Bertelsmann spokeswoman Friederike Harmgarth said that Arnulf
Conradi will continue to head Berlin Verlag and also will take over
the helm of Siedler Verlag. But the two companies will retain their
distinct brands in the marketplace, Harmgarth said.

Precede: ALGIERS Two dead in rioting; tension around singer's funeral 
</HEADLINE>
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIZI-OUZOU, Algeria (AP) _ Tens of thousands of mourners in
Algeria's eastern Berber region gathered in a mountain village
Sunday for the funeral of a singer and native son whose
assassination sparked rioting that ravaged this provincial capital.
	   At least two people died and about 100 were reported injured in
the rioting that began after ethnic Berber singer Lounes Matoub was
slain Thursday by Muslim militants at a fake roadblock.
	   Security forces stood guard around the cemetery in nearby Beni
Douala, Matoub's hometown, where the 42-year-old singer was to be
laid to rest in a ceremony at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) before tens of
thousands of Berbers.
	   The government and Matoub's family appealed for calm, though
streets in Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, remained
tense with prowling youths in a city of shattered windows and
burned-out state businesses.
	   Matoub, a defender of Berber culture, was the latest Algerian
artist to be slain during an insurgency that has claimed more than
75,000 lives.
	   The killing also inflamed Berber anger at the military-backed
government's plans to impose Arabic as the only official language
beginning next Sunday, effectively banning the Berber language,
also known as Tamazight.
	   ``Tamazight in school,'' read one banner among protesters, who
chanted ``We are not Arabs!''
	   ``People are angry, but you must understand their frustration
because Tamazight is marginalized,'' Nourredine Ait-Hamouda, an
organizer of the funeral and a member of the Movement for Berber
Culture, told reporters.
	   Leaders in the mountainous region east of Algiers called a
general strike Sunday.
	   Youths burned tires and tore down Arab-language street signs on
Thursday, then stoned police and burned state buildings in several
Berber cities Friday and Saturday.
	   Two demonstrators were killed _ one in Tizi-Ouzou and the other
in the town of Sidi Aich, authorities confirmed. Official injury
figures were not available, but the opposition Rally for Culture
and Democracy said about 100 people were hurt.
	   Several youths considered as leaders of the violence were
arrested, residents said, but no figures were available.
	   In Tizi-Ouzou Sunday, only the city hall, police station and
courthouse appeared intact, protected by security forces.
	   Algerian authorities blamed the violence on rowdy youths and not
on political grounds. It was believed the largest unrest in the
region since the so-called Berber Spring uprising of 1980.
	   The Arabic-only law move was seen as a government effort to
appease supporters of Islamic movements. The Rally for Culture and
Democracy, in a statement, accused the government of President
Liamine Zeroual of ``passive complicity with the fundamentalists.''
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment. The Front has condemned Matoub's
assassination.

category codes:
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister on Sunday
urged the United Nations to move quickly to mediate the Kashmir
dispute or risk a fourth war between Pakistan and India, the
world's newest nuclear powers. In an interview with The Associated
Press, Gohar Ayub, who was to meet later in the day with the U.N.
secretary general's special envoy, said relentless cross-border
attacks in the disputed Kashmir region could quickly spin out of
control. ``The danger is there of cross-border raids or hot pursuit
. . . this is a strong possibility,'' said Ayub. ``That would be
responded to by us sharply and aggressively.'' (PAKISTAN-INDIA-UN)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A dangerous standoff at a crossroads
village in the center of the secessionist province of Kosovo has
become the focus of international negotiators, who fear it could
ignite all-out war in the region. Ethnic Albanian guerrillas
maintain an armed ring around Kijevo and have rebuffed demands
Saturday that they end their 10-day siege of the strategic village,
located southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina on one of
Kosovo's two main roads. Serbian forces reportedly flew in food and
supplies and evacuated four women and a child. But Western
diplomats and Albanian sources reported an army buildup that could
signal Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is poised for another
crackdown. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Rockets slammed into the beleaguered
Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday in one of the deadliest assaults
in the past year, killing four people and wounding several others,
said hospital officials and eyewitnesses. Throughout the day the
rockets rattled the city. By the end of the day 15 rockets had hit
several areas, eyewitnesses said. Four rockets landed at the
combined military and civilian airport. The others all hit a
densely populated residential area on the southeastern edge of the
city. (AFGHANISTAN ROCKETS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton, venturing from a
church once shuttered by communists to the Forbidden City and the
Great Wall, said Sunday he felt confident China was on a path of
progress. ``In the last 25 years, it's changed quite a lot,'' the
president said as he toured with Hillary Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, the vermilion-walled imperial courtyards of
Beijing's Forbidden City, adjacent to Tiananmen Square. Asked if
China had changed enough, Clinton said, ``After yesterday, I feel
quite good about it.'' On Saturday, Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin had engaged in a lively debate televised across China _
an unprecedented public dialogue. (CLINTON CHINA)
	   CEYHAN, Turkey _ An earthquake that struck southern Turkey has
killed at least 108 people and injured about 1,000, news reports
and witnesses said. Among those killed Saturday were 41 people in
the town of Ceyhan, where at least 200 others were injured, said
Mustafa Karsli, a hospital official. ``It is not finished yet.
There are scores of people still under the collapsed buildings,''
Karsli said. Rescue workers were using earthmoving machinery to
reach people buried beneath rubble in Ceyhan, where the quake
leveled at least four downtown buildings. (TURKEY QUAKE)

Court fires two police officers for negligence in Luxor massacre 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian police court fired two senior
officers for negligence Sunday in the massacre last year of 62
people in the southern city of Luxor, officials said.
	   The Police High Disciplinary Commission also canceled the
retirement bonuses and cut by one-fourth the pensions of the two
officers, Maj. Gen. Medhat el-Shanawani, former police chief of
Luxor, and his deputy, Maj. Gen. Youssef Abu el-Atta, the officials
said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Fifty-eight tourists and four Egyptians were killed in the Nov.
17 attack by Muslim radicals at the Temple of Hatshepsut near
Luxor, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. The
attack devastated the tourism industry in Egypt.
	   After the attack, President Hosni Mubarak publicly blamed the
interior minister, who resigned soon after, and ordered an internal
police investigation. The new interior minister, Maj. Gen. Habib
el-Adli, ordered that the two generals be put on trial, along with
four other officers, on charges of negligence.
	   The seven-month trial was conducted behind closed doors, and
newspapers were barred from publishing details of the case.
	   In the verdict Sunday, Judge Imad Ismael said the two officers
failed to work out a proper plan to protect the site and neglected
tips by security agents that terrorist attacks were possible.
Ismael said they were given the stiffest penalty under the police
code.
	   The officers cannot appeal. Their bonuses were worth 300,000
Egyptian pounds (dlrs 88,000). Police pensions are usually between
1,500 pounds (dlrs 440) and 2,000 pounds (dlrs 588) a month.
	   The verdicts have yet to be issued for the other four officers.

Singapore to slash growth forecast as recession and record layoffs loom RECASTS throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with minister comments on layoffs reaching 30,000;
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ On the eve of anticipated government measures
to help Singapore's economy, media reports Sunday quoted ministers
as hinting that recession is a real possibility and warning that
layoffs could exceed earlier estimates.
	   Minister without portfolio Lim Boon Heng was quoted by The
Sunday Times newspaper as saying Saturday that the country is
probably ``not going into a bad recession'' this year, an admission
that at least a mild contraction seems more likely.
	   Minister of Manpower Lee Boon Yang added Sunday that total
layoffs could reach 30,000 this year ``depending on how soon the
regional situation picks up (and) on how soon demand for
electronics products picks up in our traditional market,'' national
television reported.
	   Earlier government estimates ranged from 20,000 to 25,000
layoffs this year, above the record high during Singapore's last
recession in 1985, while most ministers have said publicly that
they do not anticipate a recession at all.
	   Nevertheless, Singapore's prime minister has conceded
contraction is plausible if the regional economic situation
deteriorates further.
	   When Parliament convenes Monday, Finance Minister Richard Hu is
scheduled to announce a package of special measures to soften the
blow to the economy from the Asian financial crisis.
	   He also is to issue new growth predictions for 1998, after
months of contention over previous government estimates.
	   The government has resolutely maintained a forecast announced in
February for growth between 2.5 and 4.5 percent in 1998, despite a
steadily increasing number of warnings from private sector
economists of lower growth or outright recession.
	   Lim, who also heads a government-linked coalition of unions,
cautioned workers Saturday not to rely on the pay bonuses they
normally enjoy, since they will almost certainly be cut this year.
	   He added that employers' contributions to Singapore's mandatory
pension system, called the Central Provident Fund, will not be
reduced.
	   Organizations representing employees have urged the government
not to cut the required 20 percent company contribution to workers'
pensions.
	   Singaporeans rely on the pension scheme, which is often drawn
upon to help finance property mortgages. Housing loans have become
a heavier burden for average home owners because of recent interest
rate increases.

Italian chief upset by `hooligan' tag on neo-Nazi fans AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS name of Italian soccer federation chief throughout
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Already facing problems with tickets, referees and
street violence, the World Cup confronted another troublespot
Sunday: Just who is a hooligan?
	   A public-address announcement at Saturday's Italy-Norway game in
Marseille directed at a small group of neo-Nazi Italian fans _
``Don't behave like hooligans'' _ angered the head of the national
soccer federation.
	   Luciano Nizzola said he was upset that fans from Italy, even
though they might be fascist sympathizers, were grouped in the same
category with the street thugs from England and Germany, where
soccer hooliganism has its roots.
	   Marseille was the scene two weeks ago of three days of violence
by English hooligans.
	   ``I am very angry,'' Nizzola said. ``It's not true that Italian
fans are hooligans.''
	   World Cup organizers said the announcement, made in Italian and
directed at a small group of fans, was proper and dismissed
Nizzola's criticism.
	   ``I understand that it might be an insult to be called a
hooligan, but you have to call a spade a spade,'' said Bruno
Travade, a spokesman for the French organizing committee.
	   According to Travade, a small group of fans from Verona, an area
of Italy with a sizable neo-fascist community, were stopped as they
tried take a flag with the swastika of Nazi Germany into the
stadium.
	   When they got to their seats, the spokesman said, the fans began
``acting in an aggressive manner toward the people near them.''
	   ``It was very insulting,'' Travade said. ``They were making
politically insulting statements. These were neo-fascists, making
Nazi salutes.''
	   After ushers were unable to subdue the ruckus, Travade said,
eight French police were called to the area, along with an Italian
police representative who identified the fans as fascist
sympathizers from Verona.
	   At the same time, the PA system announced in Italian,
``Attention Italian fans. Don't behave like hooligans. If you do,
you will be treated like hooligans.''
	   Nizzola said Italian fans don't behave like the notorious
English thugs who smashed shops and bars and fought with police in
Marseille. German hooligans were blamed for violence in Lens that
left a police officer in a coma, and French authorities in recent
days have mounted a show of force against any hints of street
violence.
	   That crackdown should not have extended to Italian fans in
Marseille, Nizzola said.
	   The French organizers took a ``one-sided decision'' to make the
announcement ``because 10 Italians carried a flag with the Nazi
symbol,'' the federation president said.
	   Travade said the decision was correct.
	   ``The English fans are those most identified with hooligans, and
I can understand that some people would take umbrage,'' Travade
said. ``But the situation calmed down (after the announcement).
That is what was intended. That is what counts.''

Disappearance of U.N. envoy prompts renewed calls on UNITA to fulfill peace pact 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``Cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye disappeared Saturday when his plane
crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   The accident happened just days before the U.N.'s July 1st
deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA officials were not available for comment at their
headquarters in Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of
the capital.
	   The U.N. and the ``troika'' also expressed ``great shock and
deep sadness'' at the disappearance of Beye, who was on a mission
in search of support from other African states to push Angola's
troubled peace process to conclusion.
	   In a separate statement Portuguese President, Jorge Sampaio,
said ``I pray that peace in Angola will be definitively concluded
in a short term. This is undoubtedly the best way to pay homage to
the figure of that distinguished African (Beye).''
	   Beye threatened to resign last month, saying that neither UNITA
nor the Angolan government had the ``political will'' to fully
comply with the 1994 peace accord.
	   The accord has passed numerous deadlines without fulfillment.
The reluctance of the former rebels to give up their strongholds
has become one of the major sticking points.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

Indian soldiers shell Pakistani villages killing 11 people

<TEXT>
	   MUZZAFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Indian soldiers pounded several
Pakistani villages along the disputed Kashmir border on Sunday,
killing 11 people, including seven women, said police officials and
eyewitnesses.
	   Mohammed Lateef, his wife and their five children were killed
when a shell smashed into their home near Chakoti, some 60
kilometers (36 miles) east of Muzzafarabad, the capital of
Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, said police officials. One man was
killed in nearby Khalana village, they said.
	   In Balasatho, a few kilometers away, three women were killed and
two seriously injured when shells rained down on their village.
	   Tens of thousands of Indian and Pakistani soldiers face each
other along the border that divides Kashmir between Pakistan and
India, two uneasy neighbors who have gone to war three times.
	   Two of those wars were over Kashmir. Both countries lay claim to
a united Kashmir, which was divided between India and Pakistan
after the British left the Asian subcontinent in 1947.
	   There was no immediate comment from India on the reports of
shelling.
	   The Pakistan government claims as many as 15 people have been
killed and several more wounded in attacks by Indian soldiers in
the last week.
	   Cross-border exchanges by both Pakistani and Indian soldiers is
a common occurrence along the border.

with joy over its win against the United States.
	   Some fans waited for hours outside Tehran's Mehrabad Airport,
where the team arrived before dawn. Fans waved the red, white and
green Iranian flag and wore the team's jersey or T-shirts with the
picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   Others blew plastic trumpets in a noisy reception.
	   ``Our boys played very well,'' coach Jalal Talebi said. ``We are
pleased to see our people receiving the team so warmly.''
	   Iran lost 2-0 Thursday to a powerful German team that knocked it
out of the World Cup in the first round. But the defeat came just
four days after Iran's 2-1 win over the United States, a game
charged with political significance born of the hostility between
Washington and Tehran since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   The win, Iran's first in World Cup action, started an all-night
party in Tehran. Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran, Iran.'' Honking cars sped aimlessly across the
city of 10 million, and women distributed sweets and candies.
	   ``Our performance was good, especially beating the United
States. That was great. Thank God for that,'' Mehdi Pashazadeh, a
defender on the team, said at the airport.
	   Dozens of cars carrying flags followed the players' bus as it
made its way from the airport into the city. Some young boys danced
in the back of pickup trucks in scenes reminiscent of last week's
celebration.
	   ``I hope our people are satisfied with us,'' said Mehdi
Mahdavikia, a midfielder who scored the team's second goal against
the United States. ``We did our best.''

Taiwanese claim biggest jigsaw puzzle record

Eds: CORRECTS name of book in last graf
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Invited guests laid in place the last
seven pieces of what organizers claimed is the world's largest
jigsaw puzzle at a Taipei hotel Sunday.
	   The puzzle, containing 209,250 pieces put together in sections
by families across Taiwan, measured 47 square meters (505 square
feet) in area after being assembled in the hotel's atrium.
	   The project was sponsored by Hotai Motor Co., local agents for
Japanese car maker Toyota, and the Walt Disney company.
	   It portrays characters from the new Disney animated film
``Mulan,'' a Hollywood take on an ancient Chinese legend still
taught to Taiwanese school children. A version of the film dubbed
into Mandarin is to be shown in Taiwan theaters beginning July 11.
	   Organizers claim the puzzle has 4,766 pieces more than the
former champion, which was assembled by a Dutch school in 1991.
They have asked the Guinness Book of Records to verify that it is a
record.

Taiwan's party-owned studio to film series with Chinese company 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Almost 50 years after the Nationalists
fled the Communist takeover of China, Taiwan's governing party will
film a television series in cooperation with a Chinese studio, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Nationalist-owned Central Motion Picture Corp. will shoot
the historical drama series with China's state-owned film studio,
the United Evening News reported. Filming is to start in China's
southern Guangdong province in August, it said.
	   The production is the first ever between the party-owned studio
and a Chinese company, although Taiwanese money frequently funds
productions made in China. The series, about Hsi Shih, a famous
Tang dynasty imperial concubine, will cost 60 million Taiwan
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.7 million), the paper said.
	   The partners plan to cooperate on big screen features after
filming the series, which will be shown on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the paper said.
	   It said the deal was made possible by the current warming trend
in relations between the sides, which have been mostly frosty since
China cut off negotiations between them in 1995. Chiu Shun-ching,
president of the Taiwanese studio, visited his Chinese counterpart
last July, but the strained political climate prevented them from
signing a deal, the paper said.
	   China, which claims Taiwan as a breakaway province, recently
invited Taiwan's top negotiator to visit this fall as a step toward
formally restoring dialogue. The Nationalists fled to Taiwan in
1949.

Wimbledon grass like quicksand for French Open winners AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Maybe grass really is for cows.
	   For French Open men's champions, at least, the switch from the
dusty, red clay of Roland Garros to the slick, manicured lawns of
Wimbledon appears to be a futile task.
	   Take Carlos Moya.
	   The flamboyant Spaniard won the French Open three weeks ago, but
failed to get past the second round at Wimbledon, losing Thursday
to Hicham Arazi _ another grass-court neophyte.
	   The player Moya beat in the final in Paris, fellow Spaniard Alex
Corretja, lost in the first round at Wimbledon.
	   Moya was seeded No. 5 and Corretja No. 10, yet their early
departures came as no great surprise. Winning on grass requires a
completely different game than winning on clay.
	   The French Open requires patience, endurance and the ability to
construct points. All that counts for little at Wimbledon, where
the men's game is dominated by big serves and points rarely go
beyond three shots.
	   The last player to win both tournaments in his career was Bjorn
Borg, who captured the French Open six times and Wimbledon five
times. He won both in the same year three straight times from
1978-80.
	   Since then, only Ivan Lendl has come close, winning the French
in 1986 and 1987 and losing in the Wimbledon final both years.
	   In the last 10 years, Mats Wilander (1988) and Jim Courier
(1991) are the only French Open champs to get past the fourth round
at Wimbledon. Both lost in the quaters.
	   Conversely, Wimbledon champions have enjoyed little success at
the French.
	   Pete Sampras, winner of four Wimbledon titles and a total of 10
Grand Slams, has never advanced past the semifinals in Paris and
went out in the second round this year.
	   Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg, John McEnroe and
Jimmy Connors are among those who never won the French.
	   Geoff Pollard, president of Tennis Australia, believes players
take the wrong approach.
	   ``Anything is possible, but very few players follow what Bjorn
Borg did,'' he said. ``He stayed back in Paris and came to
Wimbledon and served and volleyed. I can't believe other players
don't do the same. There's no logical reason for it.''
	   The clay-grass conflict is less acute in women's tennis, where
the serve is less dominant. Steffi Graf has won the French and
Wimbledon in the same year four times (1988, 1993, 1995, 1996).
	   Moya is just the latest king of Paris to flop in London.
	   Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Gustavo Kuerten followed their triumphs
in Paris in 1996 and 1997 with first-round defeats at Wimbledon.
Both also failed to make the second round this year.
	   Thomas Muster didn't even show up at Wimbledon after winning the
1995 French Open. No wonder _ he'd lost in the first round in each
of his four tries.
	   Sergi Bruguera skipped Wimbledon after his triumph at the French
in 1993. He made the fourth round here in 1994 after winning his
second French title, but hasn't been back since.
	   These days, the men's game is so split between fast-court and
clay-court players that it's hard to imagine anyone winning both
tournaments _ let alone completing a sweep of all four Grand Slams.
Rod Laver was the last to accomplish the Slam in 1969.
	   Another factor is scheduling: Wimbledon begins just two weeks
after the French. Many players complain that's not enough time to
prepare for the grass, especially since there are no grass-court
tournaments the rest of the year.
	   Moya, who reached the finals of the Australian Open on hard
courts in 1997, has more of an all-court game than most Spaniards.
He has a good serve and is not afraid to come to the net, yet he
resorted to his baseline instincts during his loss to Arazi.
	   ``I started going to the net,'' he said. ``At the beginning I
was very confident, but then I was losing confidence. I was not
confident to go there, so I just stay at the baseline.''
	   That's exactly the problem with today's clay-court experts, says
Pollard.
	   ``They fall back on their natural game,'' he said. ``Agassi can
do it. Moya can do it. He can serve and volley. But after players
come forward and hit one bad shot, then they stay back.''

Albright: `Long way to go' on human rights in China 
</HEADLINE>
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton brought a strong
message on human rights to China, but the summit yielded little
other progress in pushing for better rights protection, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said Sunday.
	   ``We have a long way to go'' toward seeing any progress on human
rights protection in China, Albright said.
	   ``Clearly there are disagreements in human rights and how
freedom of expression is used in the society,'' Albright told
reporters.
	   ``But I think President Clinton made very clear the importance
of the ability of people anywhere to be able to express their
views,'' she said. ``He carried American values to the Chinese
people.''
	   Clinton's comments on human rights at a news conference
Saturday, televised live in China, were ``a large step in terms of
progress,'' she said. ``I think it will have a positive effect.''
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
was meeting with government officials in charge of religion to
discuss religious persecution, Albright said.
	   Albright has made support for religious freedom a priority at
the State Department.
	   All churches in China must register with the government to
operate legally. Independent religious leaders have been harassed
and jailed, and some unregistered churches have been closed. The
government does not allow Chinese Catholics to obey all orders of
the pope, particularly on approval of new bishops.
	   Police in Xi'an, the first stop on the president's trip,
detained four dissidents last week, but all have been released, the
Hong Kong-based Information Center for Democratic Movement and
Human Rights said in a statement Sunday.
	   ``I think it is very disappointing to say the least when
dissidents are rounded up,'' Albright said. ``We make the point
that that is not acceptable.''
	   The U.S. government's programs to promote the rule of law are a
bright spot, she said. As an example, she mentioned U.S. support
for training for Chinese judges to help create an independent
judiciary with fair legal procedures.
	   Clinton's message in China, Albright said, is that ``stability
actually comes when people are free and able to use their ideas to
move their societies into the next stage.''

Portuguese vote on whether to permit abortion on demand 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Results expected by 2300 GMT
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Voters went to the polls Sunday in a
national referendum on whether to permit abortion on demand, a
deeply divisive issue in this mostly Roman Catholic country.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, termination of pregnancy is
permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or in cases of
rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   People will decide whether abortion on demand through the 10th
week of pregnancy should be ``decriminalized,'' which in effect
will eliminate current prohibitions.
	   The polls opened at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and national media
reported a slow early turnout. The weather across the country was
mostly clear .
	   Teresa Cardoso, a 45-year-old Lisbon newspaper seller, said she
had voted yes because abortion was the lesser of two evils.
	   ``I think it's more criminal to allow a child into the world
knowing that it won't have decent living conditions,'' she said.
	   Others remained split on the issue.
	   ``I'm very torn. There are good arguments on both sides,'' said
Luisa Teixeira, a Lisbon schoolteacher in her 50s, who said she
still hadn't decided which way she would vote.
	   The result of Portugal's first-ever referendum was due around
midnight (2300 GMT).
	   The National Assembly, Portugal's parliament, has been debating
the abortion issue for the past 14 years _ since leftist parties
first won enough seats to press for a discussion.
	   Lawmakers in February approved a bill relaxing abortion
restrictions, but opponents successfully pushed for the national
ballot which will either overturn or ratify that legislation.
	   An intense two-week campaign leading up to the ballot featured
marches in major cities and a nationwide media blitz.
	   Abortion rights activists _ backed by leftist politicians _ say
they want to end the estimated 16,000 illegal abortions each year
in Portugal, a nation of 9.5 million people.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions.
	   Women can be imprisoned for up to three years for having an
illegal abortion.
	   Opposition to the easing of the current law has come from older
Portuguese, backed by the influential Catholic church and
conservative parties.
	   While the `yes' camp is favored to win, voter-intention polls
have shown its support drop over the course of the campaign to
about 50 percent from 60 percent.
	   The referendum's result will be binding only if more than half
of registered voters participate.

Prince discharged from hospital following prostate surgery 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prince Claus, the husband of Dutch
Queen Beatrix, was discharged Sunday from a German hospital nearly
three weeks after undergoing emergency prostate surgery.
	   The Government Information Services said doctors have confirmed
that the tumor was completely removed and that the wound has healed
successfully without complications.
	   The German-born prince underwent emergency surgery on June 9 at
the Allgemeines Krankenhaus Barmbek in Hamburg, Germany, to remove
his prostate after doctors discovered what the Royal House
described as ``a malignant condition.''
	   The problem was found during a checkup in Hamburg, and surgeons
recommended surgery as soon as possible.
	   Following the operation, the 71-year-old prince was often
visited by his son, Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, and Queen
Beatrix.
	   The royal family has been hit by a string of illnesses.
	   Just last month, Beatrix's father, Prince Bernhard, also
underwent operation to treat an enlargement of the prostate, a
common complaint among older men.
	   Bernhard's wife, former Queen Juliana, also had surgery recently
after she suffered a fracture in a fall at a friend's home.

Italian, Greek leaders fear wave of Kosovo refugees 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CORFU, Greece (AP) _ An escalating conflict in Kosovo could
drive a wave of refugees into Greece and Italy and create
widespread regional instability, the two countries' premiers said
Sunday.
	   ``A war in Kosovo would have wider implications for the region,
especially for Italy and Greece, which would bear the brunt of a
wave of refugees,'' said Greek Premier Costas Simitis.
	   Italian Premier Romano Prodi met with Simitis for more than an
hour on the Ionian island of Corfu during a private visit to
Greece.
	   Speaking to reporters after their meeting, both leaders said
that the West must act to prevent a full-fledged war in Kosovo, the
southern province of Yugoslavia where Serbian police are battling
ethnic Albanians rebels. The Albanians are seeking independence.
	   NATO should not act on its own to solve the crisis, Prodi said.
``Any intervention must be discussed and approved by the U.N.
Security Council,'' he said.
	   About 15,000 refugees are estimated to already have crossed the
border from Kosovo into Albania. If war breaks out, many more are
expected.
	   Italy and Greece have served as joint guarantors of peace in
Albania since an armed uprising led that country into chaos last
spring.
	   Prodi said the two European Union members must join forces to
fight Albanian-based smuggling and crime networks. ``The Adriatic
must not become a sea of crime and lawlessness,'' he said.
	   Simitis and Prodi said their governments would continue working
together closely to foster regional stability.

Two dead in rioting; tension around singer's funeral 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with funeral
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TIZI-OUZOU, Algeria (AP) _ Tens of thousands of mourners in
Algeria's eastern Berber region filled a mountain village Sunday
for the funeral of a singer and native son whose assassination
sparked rioting that ravaged this provincial capital.
	   At least two people died and about 100 were reported injured in
the rioting after ethnic Berber singer Lounes Matoub was slain
Thursday by Muslim militants. While the militants were invisible,
the rage was aimed at government plans to make Arabic the only
official language.
	   Security forces stood watch over the tens of thousands of
mourners around the cemetery in nearby Beni Douala, Matoub's
hometown, where the 42-year-old singer was laid to rest in a
ceremony Sunday afternoon, France Info radio reported in Paris.
	   Mourners carried portraits of the singer and signs reading ``No
peace without the Berber language.''
	   The government and Matoub's family appealed for calm, though
streets in Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers, remained
tense with prowling youths in a city of shattered windows and
burned-out state businesses.
	   Matoub, a defender of Berber culture, was the latest Algerian
artist to be slain during an insurgency that has claimed more than
75,000 lives.
	   The killing inflamed Berber anger at the military-backed
government's plans to impose Arabic as the only official language
beginning next Sunday, effectively banning the Berber language,
also known as Tamazight, as well as French, which is widely used in
this former French colony.
	   ``Tamazight in school,'' read one banner among protesters, who
chanted ``We are not Arabs!''
	   ``People are angry, but you must understand their frustration
because Tamazight is marginalized,'' Nourredine Ait-Hamouda, an
organizer of the funeral and a member of the Movement for Berber
Culture, told reporters.
	   Leaders in the mountainous region east of Algiers called a
general strike Sunday.
	   Youths burned tires and tore down Arab-language street signs on
Thursday, then stoned police and burned state buildings in several
Berber cities Friday and Saturday.
	   Two demonstrators were killed _ one in Tizi-Ouzou and the other
in the town of Sidi Aich, authorities confirmed. Official injury
figures were not available, but the opposition Rally for Culture
and Democracy said about 100 people were hurt.
	   Several youths considered as leaders of the violence were
arrested, residents said, but no figures were available.
	   In Tizi-Ouzou Sunday, only the city hall, police station and
courthouse appeared intact, protected by security forces.
	   Algerian authorities blamed the violence on rowdy youths and not
on political grounds. It was believed the largest unrest in the
region since the so-called Berber Spring uprising of 1980.
	   The Arabic-only law move was seen as a government effort to
appease supporters of Islamic movements. The Rally for Culture and
Democracy, in a statement, accused the government of President
Liamine Zeroual of ``passive complicity with the fundamentalists.''
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment. The Front has condemned Matoub's
assassination.

Disappearance of U.N. envoy prompts renewed calls to fulfill peace pact 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye disappeared Saturday when his plane
crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   The accident happened just days before the U.N.'s July 1st
deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA officials were not available for comment at their
headquarters in Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of
the capital.
	   The U.N. and the ``troika'' also expressed ``great shock and
deep sadness'' at the disappearance of Beye, who was on a mission
in search of support from other African states to push Angola's
troubled peace process to conclusion.
	   In a separate statement, Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
said: ``I pray that peace in Angola will be definitively concluded
in a short term. This is undoubtedly the best way to pay homage to
the figure of that distinguished African.''
	   Beye threatened to resign last month, saying that neither UNITA
nor the Angolan government had the ``political will'' to fully
comply with the 1994 peace accord.
	   The accord has passed numerous deadlines without fulfillment.
The reluctance of the former rebels to give up their strongholds
has become one of the major sticking points.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

	   ASSEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A helicopter crashed while circling
over the Dutch motorcycle Grand Prix, lightly injuring two of the
three people aboard, authorities said Sunday.
	   Investigators were trying to determine what caused the aircraft
to go down in a field near the track where Saturday's competition
was held. Dutch television reported that the pilot had experienced
some engine trouble just before the chopper crashed.
	   Police did not identify the wounded but said their injuries were
not life-threatening. It was unclear whether the pilot was among
the injured.
	   The Grand Prix, held annually in this northeastern Dutch city,
was the seventh event of the 1998 World Motorcycle Racing
Championship.
	   Four-time world champion Michael ``Mick'' Doohan of Australia,
riding a Honda, won easily Saturday in the 500-cc class and
improved his overall season standings from fourth to second place.

Jet with 180 passengers returns after freak wind gust 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ A jet bound for Greece with 180
passengers returned to Bristol International Airport after it was
hit by a ``freak gust'' of wind just at its nose left the runway on
takeoff, an airport spokeswoman said Sunday.
	   The downdraft caused the underside of the Airbus 320, operated
by Air 2000, to touch the runway for a moment, said airport
spokeswoman Tiffany Aitkens.
	   ``It was just a freak gust of wind,'' she said. ``The pilot was
aware and immediately after takeoff circled the airport and landed
again. All the passengers were disembarked and taken to the
terminal while engineers were called in to examine the aircraft.''
	   The incident happened early Saturday morning and passengers left
for Heraklion, Crete on a replacement aircraft eight hours later,
Aitkens said.
	   No details were available about damage to the aircraft.

<TEXT>
	   MUZZAFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Indian soldiers pounded several
Pakistani villages along the disputed Kashmir border on Sunday,
killing 11 people, including seven women, said police officials and
eyewitnesses.
	   Mohammed Lateef, his wife and their five children were killed
when a shell smashed into their home near Chakoti, some 60
kilometers (36 miles) east of Muzzafarabad, the capital of
Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, said police officials. One man was
killed in nearby Khalana village, they said.
	   In Balasatho, a few kilometers away, three women were killed and
two seriously injured when shells rained down on their village.
	   Reports from the area said Pakistani soldiers retaliated. There
were no reports of casualties on the Indian side of the border.
	   In India, the military said its soldiers did not target
villages.
	   ``There was some firing but we have never targeted any villages
and there were certainly no civilian deaths,'' Brigadier Arun
Chopra told The Associated Press by telephone from Srinagar,
capital of the troubled Jammu-Kashmir state.
	   ``In fact, they have targeted our villages and two people were
killed on the Indian side and two more injured on Saturday,''
Chopra said. ``We have given a restrained response which has been
targeted at their gun positions and posts.''
	   Tens of thousands of Indian and Pakistani soldiers face each
other along the border that divides Kashmir between Pakistan and
India, two uneasy neighbors who have gone to war three times.
	   Two of those wars were over Kashmir. Both countries lay claim to
a united Kashmir, which was divided between India and Pakistan
after the British left the Asian subcontinent in 1947.
	   The Pakistan government claims as many as 15 people have been
killed and several more wounded in attacks by Indian soldiers in
the last one week.
	   Cross-border shelling by both Pakistani and Indian soldiers is a
common occurrence along the border.

Former Beatle speaks for first time of battle against throat cancer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RETRANSMITTING to add cycle designator
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Beatle George Harrison disclosed Sunday
that he has been battling throad cancer since last summer _ and is
winning.
	   ``I'm not going to die on you folks just yet. I am very lucky,''
the 54-year-old singer was quoted as telling the News of the World.
	   Harrison told the Sunday tabloid that he first noticed a lump on
his neck last July while he was gardening at his 200-room mansion
in Henley, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of London, which he
shares with his wife, Olivia, 47, and their 19-year-old artist son
Dhani.
	   He had surgery in August to remove the lump, which was found to
be cancerous, followed by two courses of of radiation therapy at
the Royal Marsden Hospital, Britain's leading cancer treatment
center.
	   ``I got it purely from smoking. I gave up cigarettes many years
ago but had started again for a while and then stopped in 1997,''
Harrison was quoted as telling the paper.
	   ``Luckily for me they found that this nodule was more of a
warning than anything else. There are many different types of
cancerous cells and this was a very basic type,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   In January, the singer went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota for tests and was told that the cancer had not returned.
He returned to the clinic in May for further tests, the paper said.
	   ``I went back and was given the final all-clear _ a clean bill
of health,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ``Sometimes, if you say the word `cancer' everybody
automatically thinks it will end in misery, but it's not always the
case,'' he said. ``I was very lucky because it didn't go anywhere -
all it was was a little red mark on my neck.''
	   But Harrison said the battle with cancer had made him think
about the fragility of life.
	   ``It reminds you that anything can happen ... that's the nature
of life,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Life _ there's an old saying
... Life is like a raindrop on a lotus leaf.''
	   Earlier this month the three surviving Beatles _ Harrison, Ringo
Starr, and Paul McCartney _ were reunited for the first time in
years at a memorial service in London for McCartney's wife, Linda,
who died of breast cancer. John Lennon, the fourth Beatle, was shot
to death in New York City in 1980.
	   In May, Harrison went to court and argued successfully that
sales of a recording of the group singing drunkenly in a Hamburg
club in 1962 should be halted.
	   After the Beatles broke up, Harrison had several solo hits
including ``My Sweet Lord'' and ``Got My Mind Set on You.'' In
January, he sang the Carl Perkins song ``Your True Love'' at the
funeral in Jackson, Tennessee of the writer of many pop hits
including ``Blue Suede Shoes.''
	   Asked by the News of the World if the events of the past year
might be reflected in some of his new songs, Harrison was quoted as
saying: ``Maybe I'll record a track called Radiation Therapy.''

World Cup: FIFA defends ticket allocation system 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Soccer's world governing body has refused to
increase England's ticketshare for the World Cup match between
England and Argentina despite mounting political pressure.
	   British Sports Minister Tony Banks Saturday lent government
support to the English Football Association's bid to get FIFA to
increase England's ticket allocation for Tuesday's match.
	   England received 2,049 tickets for the St Etienne match _ its
smallest allocation to date _ but Banks said England and Argentina
should each have received 10,000 tickets.
	   FIFA communications director Keith Cooper Sunday refused to
yield to pressure from the FA or the British Government, saying the
ticket policy was set in 1995 and exceptions would not be made.
	   ``Anyone who had taken the trouble would have been able to read
how this system worked...three years ago,'' he said.
	   Cooper said it was impossible to pre-determine which teams would
be playing where in the second round of the World Cup or calculate
demand for tickets at each of the venues.
	   ``While there may be a huge demand from England, had it been
Romania playing in that particular match there would not have been
a huge demand,'' he said.
	   ``The only way to do this is the way it has been done.''
	   The Football Supporters' Association has slammed both FIFA and
the FA in the wake of the ticket allocation fiasco.
	   FSA spokesman Steve Powell said the FA should have questioned
the ticketing system when it was released.
	   ``Were they paying attention? I don't think so. Did they care? I
don't think so. The interests of the fans, who are fundamental to
the World Cup, are being forgotten,'' he said.

Thousands greet Iranian soccer team on return to Tehran

	   TERHAN, Iran (AP) _ Blowing trumpets and waving flags, thousands
of jubilant Iranians welcomed their World Cup team home Sunday with
disappointment at the team's departure from the tournament and joy
over its win against the United States.
	   Some fans waited for hours outside Tehran's Mehrabad Airport,
where the team arrived a little before dawn. Fans waved the red,
white and green Iranian flag and wore the team's jersey or T-shirts
with the picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   Others blew plastic trumpets in a noisy reception.
	   ``Our boys played very well,'' coach Jalal Talebi said. ``We are
pleased to see our people receiving the team so warmly.''
	   Iran lost 2-0 Thursday to a powerful German team, knocking it
out of the World Cup in the first round. But the defeat came just
four days after Iran's 2-1 win over the United States, a game
charged with political significance.
	   The win, Iran's first in World Cup action, started an all-night
party in Tehran. Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran, Iran.''
	   ``Our performance was good, especially beating the United
States. That was great. Thank God for that,'' Mehdi Pashazadeh, a
defender on the team, said at the airport.
	   The players greeted fans from a platform set up in the parking
lot. They then boarded a bus, which moved slowly through a crowd of
hundreds of people waving and shouting.
	   Dozens of cars carrying flags followed the bus as it made its
way into the city. Some young boys danced in the back of pickup
trucks in scenes reminiscent of last week's celebration.
	   Iranian television and radio broadcast the arrival live.
	   ``I hope our people are satisfied with us,'' said Mehdi
Mahdavikia, a midfielder who scored the team's second goal against
the United States. ``We did our best.''

Reminded of killings, new Swiss Guards sworn in at Vatican 
</HEADLINE>
With AP Photos
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Urged to put aside all egoism and discord
following the double-murder and suicide by one of their
predecessors, new Swiss Guards on Sunday swore their loyalty to
Pope John Paul II.
	   The ceremony for the 37 recruits to the corps, which protects
the pope and whose Michelangelo-designed uniforms and plumed
helmets add brilliant color to ceremonies and tourists'
photographs, was supposed to be May 6.
	   But instead on that day there was a funeral for the slain, newly
named commander, Alois Estermann, and his wife, Gladys Meza Romero.
	   The couple, along with guard member Cedric Tornay, were found
dead of gunshot wounds in the Estermann's apartment not far from
the Vatican courtyard where Sunday's ceremony was held.
	   The Vatican said Tornay was upset he wasn't getting a medal,
and, in a frenzy of madness, killed the couple, then himself.
	   Raising the thumb, index and middle fingers of the right hand at
the swearing-in, each recruit shouted a pledge to serve John Paul
and his successors ``with all my strength and to give my life if
necessary.''
	   The ``beauty'' of the oath-taking, to affirm ``the same ideal,
the same courage, the common trust,'' can serve to ``cancel out all
divisions, all egoism, all discord, which are always and everywhere
possible among humans,'' the corps' interim commander, Roland Buchs
told the new guards.
	   Monsignor Giovan Battista Re, a Vatican official, told the
guards that the private ceremony was more simple this year because
of the ``sad events and the upsetting tragedy which continue to
weigh on all of us.''
	   John Paul did not attend Sunday's swearing-in nor did he make
any reference to it a couple of hours later during his weekly
appearance to tourists in St. Peter's Square.
	   But on Saturday, greeting the recruits and their families, the
pope said the shootings remain ``a source of suffering.''
	   The corps of 100 will be commanded by a Swiss army colonel, Pius
Segmueller, who arrives in August.
	   Tornay had reportedly felt that Estermann, then the corps' No.
2, was too harsh on him for discipline infractions such as staying
out late. News of Estermann's appointment as well as learning he
would get no medal on May 6 apparently fueled the murderous fit of
madness.
	   Despite the sad memories, a lighter atmosphere was noted. After
the ceremony, the new guards posed for photos with girlfriends and
families, had coffee and cake and toasted with beer.
	   Pope Julius II founded the corps, out of a group of fearless
Swiss mercenaries, in 1506. In 1527, 147 Swiss Guards died
protecting Pope Clement VII during Emperor Charles V's sacking of
Rome.

102 would-be immigrants arrested by Spanish coast guards over weekend 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ Coast guards arrested over 100 would-be
immigrants from north Africa as they neared the Spanish shore this
weekend, a spokesman said Sunday.
	   The arrest of 64 men and four women in two operations early
Sunday came 24 hours after 31 men and three women were detained in
similar circumstances, the spokesman for the coast guard service in
this southern Spanish town said.
	   All the would-be immigrants had traveled over night from Morocco
in makeshift boats and would almost certainly be deported back, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Every year poverty and unemployment prompts thousands of north
Africans make the potentially dangerous crossing into Europe.
	   Spain serves as a major entry point because the Strait of
Gibraltar that separates it from Morocco is as narrow as 12 miles
(20 kilometers) in some places.
	   ``There has been a recent increase encouraged by the better
summer weather, but in general there are more attempted crossings
this year compared to last year'' the spokesman said.
	   ``People must be getting desperate'' he added.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The state-run Jordan Telecommunications Co.
will cut an additional 30 percent from fees on long-distance calls
to compete with other firms worldwide.
	   A company statement issued Sunday said local calls would
increase by less than 0.5 percent to cover part of the reduced
revenue generated from international calls.
	   ``International phone calls generate 70 percent of the company's
revenues and the discounted rate will cause a 21 percent reduction
in the income generated annually,'' the statement said.
	   It said the new fees will go into effect on Wednesday.
	   Last year, the government reduced by 30 percent the charges on
all overseas calls following widespread criticism of the highly
priced phone charges.
	   In view of last year's reduction, a call to the United States
cost 1.485 Jordanian dinars (dlrs 2.09) per minute _ double the
price of the call from the United States to Jordan.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The United States has granted Jordanian
handicraft textile products duty-free access to the American
market, a boon for the Arab country's flourishing weaving industry.
	   Ali Dajani, a spokesman at the Jordanian Chamber of Industry,
said Sunday the decision is in line with an agreement concluded
with the U.S. Department of Commerce last week in Washington.
	   All hand-loomed products, including weaved rugs and embroidered
cushions and dresses, will be exempt from the U.S. tax, Dajani
said.
	   Jordan exports dlrs 20 million worth of textiles, Dead Sea salt
products and jewelry to the United States under another duty free
agreement reached last year. It imports dlrs 360 million worth of
American goods, such as machinery, capital goods, foodstuffs,
grains, motor vehicles and medicine.

World Cup: For Ronaldo, good isn't good enough 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Just outside the winners' locker room, Brazilian
coach Mario Zagallo ran down his personal honor roll for the team's
best performance yet in the World Cup.
	   Cesar Sampaio? Perfect. Rivaldo? Sensational. Ronaldo?
	   Pause.
	   ``Ronaldo was ... better,'' Zagallo said. ``He's still not the
Ronaldo we all want to see. He has a lot more to give, and I'm sure
we'll see it in the games we have left.''
	   For any other player, the assessment seem harsh. After all,
Ronaldo had just scored two goals and barely missed two others to
lead his team past Chile 4-1 and into the Cup quarterfinals.
	   But Ronaldo isn't just any player. He's ``the phenomenon,'' the
most talented striker of a generation, twice voted FIFA Player of
the Year. For him, the bar is higher.
	   Of course, opponents also expect great things from the
21-year-old striker. Against Chile, Ronaldo had a hard time keeping
his feet against a defense that barely let him breathe.
	   But he turned it to his advantage when he collided with goalie
Nelson Tapia and French referee Marc Batta whistled a penalty.
Ronaldo took the shot himself for the score.
	   In the second period, he ranged all over the field, scoring his
second goal on a pass from Cafu and bouncing two shots off the post
and the crossbar.
	   ``Ronaldo has the fame. He's the best player in the world, and
the marking is always individual and tough,'' said Rivaldo. ``He
had a great game, and with two goals I'm sure he will be happier.''
	   He clearly wasn't happy before, with just one goal in his first
three games. Brazilians wondered what was wrong, and when there was
no clear answer, they made some up.
	   Ronaldo was hiding a serious knee injury, ran one rumor. Another
said he was depressed because his romance with Brazilian model
Suzana Werner was on the rocks.
	   Denials didn't help, and Ronaldo seemed tense. After Brazil lost
2-1 to Norway last week, he complained that teammates weren't
getting him the ball enough.
	   Zagallo had a more prosaic explanation.
	   ``A high-profile player like him has to shake his defender,'' he
said. ``He has to move on to the wings, vary the play. He can't
just play up front all the time because he won't produce.''
	   After the game, Ronaldo admitted the coach was right.
	   ``I followed his instructions, and you see the result,'' he
said. ``I knew this drought had to end soon, that at any moment I'd
find my rhythm, and thank God it happened at the best time.''
	   While many may envy a youngster who has won fame, riches and
glory at the peak of his profession, Ronaldo's teammates see the
simple kid from Rio's poor north side, whose talent has thrust him
into a global limelight he can never escape.
	   ``The expectations, the demands on him are something crazy,''
said Leonardo. ``It's amazing how he deals with it. We always try
to help him, but he doesn't need it.''
	   For Leonardo, all the superlatives are justified.
	   ``Ronaldo is special,'' he said. ``In the games we have left, I
am sure he will show us all his magic.''

Serbs, KLA rebels locked in new Kosovo standoff at Kijevo aerial bombing, comments from Albright in grafs 19-20.

Eds: UPDATES with KLA holding still holding village, detials on
By ADAM BROWN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A dangerous standoff at a crossroads
village in the center of the secessionist province of Kosovo has
become the focus of international negotiators, who fear it could
ignite all-out war in the region.
	   Ethnic Albanian guerrillas have maintained an armed ring around
the predominately Serb village of Kijevo for 11 days, and still
refused Sunday to give up their positions.
	   Yugoslav security forces reportedly attacked Albanian positions
around the strategic village late Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said Sunday four Yugoslav helicopters bombed Albanian
positions around Kijevo, while a fifth flew food supplies into the
village and evacuated four Serb women and a child.
	   Western diplomats fear Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
preparing for another crackdown centered on the village, located
southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina on one of Kosovo's
two main roads.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Saturday at a forum of political
and economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   ``If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an operation on Feb.
28 to try to extinguish growing resistance by secessionist
militants in predominantly Albanian Kosovo. Some 80 people, mostly
civilians, died in that crackdown, and dozens more in another
campaign launched in late May.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army claims to control 30
percent to 40 percent of this province in Serbia, the dominant
republic in what is left of Yugoslavia. They are increasingly
supported by the Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   On Sunday Holbrooke said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard had met
Friday with people claiming to be representatives of the KLA.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which is fighting for
independence of the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   ``The contacts were with people who said they had this
authority, but at this point that authority remains to be
demonstrated,'' he said.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that the two unidentified KLA
leaders committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in Kosovo,
quoting senior American officials. The KLA leaders also reportedly
agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to
try to provide a common negotiating position, even though they
disagree with his pacifist approach to seeking independence for
Kosovo.
	   An influential ethnic Albanian politician, Adem Demaci, said he
was asked by Holbrooke to mediate with the Albanian militants to
break the Kijevo impasse, but his efforts produced no visible
results.
	   According to TV Tirana in neighboring Albania, the rebels said
they would let the Serbs go from Kijevo if the police and Yugoslav
army withdraw from three vital positions in the area west of
Pristina.
	   The latest evidence that Kosovo Albanians favor a more radical
solution than diplomacy to their quest for independence came
Saturday, when several top politicians founded a new movement
intended to serve as the KLA's political wing.
	   A third of the group was once loyal to Rugova, including his
former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep Qosja,
who helped found the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   Rugova favors a pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   Speaking in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
told reporters both Gelbard and Holbrooke were ``trying to get a
diplomatic solution'' but NATO planning for other options was
accelerating.
	   ``All options are on the table,'' she said.

Duisenberg tells newspaper he never promised to step down early 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In a declaration that could
rekindle a bitter continental squabble, the new head of the
European Central Bank told a Dutch newspaper he never promised to
step down midway through his term.
	   Wim Duisenberg, president of the bank that will set European
monetary policy and oversee the historic switch to a common
currency, told the respected daily NRC Handelsblad he didn't agree
to split the eight-year term with a Frenchman as France insisted.
	   ``There is no agreement that I will retire early,'' Duisenberg
was quoted as saying in the newspaper's weekend edition.
	   In an interview with the BBC earlier this month, French
President Jacques Chirac said Duisenberg had promised he would quit
after four years to make way for the current Bank of France
Governor, Jean-Claude Trichet.
	   However, Duisenberg _ a Dutchman who headed the Frankfurt-based
European Monetary Institute until his appointment in May _ denied
there is an agreement about a split term.
	   Asked whether he had made that promise to Chirac, he simply
answered ``no.''
	   Bitter bickering between France and the Netherlands spilled over
to other European Union countries in the runup to Duisenberg's
appointment.
	   Critics contend that France's insistence on sharing the new
central bank's first presidency violates the Maastricht treaty, the
accord considered a blueprint for the Jan. 1, 1999, debut of the
single currency, the euro.
	   Duisenberg was able to defuse tensions by reading a statement
saying he would stay on at least until mid-2002, when monetary
union is fully in place with the circulation of euro coins and
notes.

Ruble devaluation unnecessary, IMF says 
</HEADLINE>
By MAURA REYNOLDS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders are right to make every effort to
prevent a devaluation of the ruble, which would only deepen the
country's economic crisis, a top International Monetary Fund
official said Sunday.
	   Martin Gilman, head of the fund's Moscow office, praised Russian
leaders for their efforts to dig their country out of its economic
troubles, and said the fund would make a decision on a bailout loan
as soon as possible.
	   He said Russia must first take control of its budget before
considering a ruble devaluation.
	   Devaluation ``will not resolve the budget problem but only make
it worse,'' he said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Investors have been fleeing Russia's markets for weeks, worried
that the Central Bank would be unable to keep spending reserves to
keep the currency stable.
	   The shaky ruble is one of several problems that have combined to
cause Russia's economic crisis, which has led to a steep drop in
the stock market and forced interest rates up to 80 percent.
	   Until now, Russia's relatively low inflation and the ruble's
stability has been seen as one of President Boris Yeltsin's most
important successes, and the economic crisis has been confined to
the financial markets.
	   Devaluation would increase consumer prices, and the Kremlin
fears that could lead to social unrest. A wave of miners strikes
last month intensified that anxiety.
	   Some analysts have said devaluation is inevitable, and the
government is trying too hard to prevent it.
	   But Gilman told Interfax that experience in other countries
suggest that devaluation causes more problems than it cures. ``Any
talk of the devaluation of the ruble is out of place in this
context,'' he said.
	   Russia wants at least dlrs 10 billion from the IMF to build up
its Central Bank reserves _ in part to back up government bonds and
in part to have adequate reserves to forestall a run on the ruble.
	   The IMF has insisted on a strict austerity regime if Russia is
to qualify for the loan. In particular, the fund has insisted that
Russia improve tax collections, which currently take in only a
fraction of what is owed.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko unveiled a new austerity plan
last week that officials said appeared to meet many of the fund's
criteria. But the hard-line lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, has delayed action on legislation needed to implement the
plan.
	   Russia's stock market has lost about half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been using hard
currency reserves to keep the value of the ruble steady.
	   The economic crisis comes after Russia made what appeared to be
significant progress last year _ the stock market was the world's
best performer, and the economy posted its first growth since the
Soviet collapse.
	   But the Asian financial crisis has made many investors leery of
developing markets, and labor unrest earlier this summer and a drop
in oil prices also sapped confidence in Russia's economy.

Netanyahu accused of trying to stall peace process CORRECTS that Levy is education minister 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new quotes, details.
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal
for an international peace conference was blasted Sunday by critics
who accused him of putting up new roadblocks to peace.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Netanyahu was
trying to ``escape'' from his commitments, and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said the prime minister was trying ``to torpedo the
peace process.''
	   Netanyahu, however, said agreement with the Palestinians on an
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank could be reached by
next month if the Palestinians met their obligations.
	   ``I estimate this issue will be concluded by then,'' he said on
Israel Radio when asked if agreement would be reached before the
Knesset recesses on July 29.
	   ``I can't say for sure,'' he added, ``because I can't tell the
Palestinians what to do.''
	   The United States is pushing Israel to accept a U.S. proposal
for turning over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer, but
deadline after unofficial deadline has passed without a response
from Israel.
	   Netanyahu, who faces serious opposition to any withdrawal from
hard-liners in his own Cabinet, in recent weeks flirted with the
possibility of holding a national referendum on any agreement to
shore up support for a withdrawal, but has appeared to back away
from that idea in recent days.
	   His latest suggestion was a European-sponsored conference
sponsored by Europe to discuss Mideast issues _ but not the
Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically. The conference would
address regional issues such as water, the environment, and trade,
he said Sunday.
	   Critics charged that both suggestions were stalling tactics to
avoid moving the peace process forward.
	   ``It is futile for the Palestinians to respond to every new idea
he comes up with, because he does not mean it and does not take it
seriously,'' Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Sunday.
	   ``The only thing he takes seriously is killing the peace
process.''
	   ``I think the prime minister is willing to do everything in
order not to do anything,'' opposition legislator Yossi Beilin said
on Israel Radio. ``He thinks that this is the way to sideline the
political issue at hand _ which is the carrying out of the next
withdrawal.''
	   Even Education Minister Yitzhak Levy, a member of Netanyahu's
governing coalition, questioned the usefulness of holding a
conference now.
	   ``At this moment our goal is to reach the final status agreement
(with the Palestinians) ... and this is what the government should
be working for,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu, however, said the Palestinians were the ones holding
up the process by refusing to make specific commitments for
fulfilling their obligations.
	   ``This is what is delaying the process, nothing else,'' he said.
He acknowledged ``gaps'' on other issues, such as the West Bank
withdrawal. ``But we are not dealing with that at the moment,'' he
said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, said those gaps _
on the size and details of the redeployment _ could be resolved
``in very little time.''
	   Israel had made ``sufficient'' compromises, Bar-Illan said,
while the Palestinians had refused to commit to carrying out
obligations such as collecting weapons, outlawing militant groups,
arresting suspects, or completing the repeal of articles in the
Palestinian National Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.

Police reinforcements in Saint-Etienne for England-Argentina match 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Fearing a burst of politically
tinged hooliganism in the World Cup, authorities on Sunday doubled
the number of police for the England-Argentina match and warned of
a ``heavy hand'' to prevent violence.
	   After several outbreaks of violence by English and German
hooligans since the Cup began June 10, officials promised ``speed
and severity'' in their security measures for Tuesday's match,
unveiled at a news conference.
	   The sporting rivalry is magnified by politics. Great Britain and
Argentina fought a war in 1982 in the South Atlantic for possession
of the Falkland Islands.
	   ``We will not hesitate. Those engaged in violence will be
arrested and punished immediately,'' Saint-Etienne Chief of Police
Jean-Ives Audin said.
	   Prosecutor Brice Robin said 1,500 additional police began
patrolling the streets of this southeastern city of 200,000. That's
almost twice the number of police used to guard against violence
during previous Cup matches in Saint-Etienne.
	   With the first English fans arriving, the first of those police
were deployed Sunday, said regional Police Prefect Jean-Yves
Audoin.
	   As in other high-risk World Cup matches, bars are to close at 11
p.m. Monday and Tuesday, officials said. But instead of a street
ban on alcohol possession, authorities planned to arrest for public
drunkenness.
	   A large screen set up downtown to view World Cup matches would
remain dark during Tuesday's match to avoid clashes between
ticketless fans, which occurred in Marseille during the
England-Tunisia match two weeks earlier.
	   French police, backed by English and Argentine officers that
include hooligan spotters are to work at both the city's main train
station and airport.
	   Mayor Michel Thiolliere sought to calm fears of clashes.
	   ``The arrival of English fans doesn't change life in
Saint-Etienne,'' he said. ``Soccer fans will continue to celebrate
as before. You shouldn't see a hooligan in every fan.''
	   English hooligans and their Argentine counterparts, known as
``barrasbravas,'' have a long history of causing havoc in their
countries, and fought a bloody battle during the 1986 World Cup in
Mexico.
	   Buenos Aires police have stopped some known hooligans from
leaving the country.
	   Barrabravas struck Friday night in Bordeaux, where two were
arrested for attacking two Croats who refused to hand over their
match tickets. One Croat was hospitalized after he was slashed in
the face.

Thousands greet Iranian soccer team on return to Tehran

	   TERHAN, Iran (AP) _ Blowing trumpets and waving flags, thousands
of jubilant Iranians welcomed their World Cup team home Sunday with
disappointment at the team's departure from the tournament and joy
over its win against the United States.
	   Some fans waited for hours outside Tehran's Mehrabad Airport,
where the team arrived a little before dawn. Fans waved the red,
white and green Iranian flag and wore the team's jersey or T-shirts
with the picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   Others blew plastic trumpets in a noisy reception.
	   ``Our boys played very well,'' coach Jalal Talebi said. ``We are
pleased to see our people receiving the team so warmly.''
	   Iran lost 2-0 Thursday to a powerful German team, knocking it
out of the World Cup in the first round. But the defeat came just
four days after Iran's 2-1 win over the United States, a game
charged with political significance.
	   The win, Iran's first in World Cup action, started an all-night
party in Tehran. Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran, Iran.''
	   ``Our performance was good, especially beating the United
States. That was great. Thank God for that,'' Mehdi Pashazadeh, a
defender on the team, said at the airport.
	   The players greeted fans from a platform set up in the parking
lot. They then boarded a bus, which moved slowly through a crowd of
hundreds of people waving and shouting.
	   Dozens of cars carrying flags followed the bus as it made its
way into the city. Some young boys danced in the back of pickup
trucks in scenes reminiscent of last week's celebration.
	   Iranian television and radio broadcast the arrival live.
	   ``I hope our people are satisfied with us,'' said Mehdi
Mahdavikia, a midfielder who scored the team's second goal against
the United States. ``We did our best.''

Anything possible this week at Wimbledon, even sunshine AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ It's not so much a tennis tournament
as a showcase for forces of nature: fire, rain and Venus Williams'
serve.
	   All were part of the first week at Wimbledon.
	   Sunday's traditional day off gave players a chance to dry off
and hope for better weather. Hey, if Natasha Zvereva can beat
Steffi Graf, anything is possible.
	   The tournament has been tough on comebacks, tabloid
photographers and U.S. males, but good for umbrella salesmen, the
Williams sisters and Sam Smith, a female.
	   The first week claimed Graf, heartthrob Anna Kournikova and 14
of the 16 American men entered, including Andre Agassi. Still
around are two Britons, heartthrob Patrick Rafter and defending
champions Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis.
	   Four days of play were delayed by rain last week, and a total of
only 28 singles matches were completed Friday and Saturday. That
left the tournament 13 matches behind schedule, a modest number
compared with last year, when record rain forced play on middle
Sunday for only the second time in Wimbledon history.
	   But there were no fires last year. Between showers Saturday, a
match involving Todd Martin and Todd Woodbridge was suspended
because of smoke from a blaze in an apartment building. Then the
rain resumed.
	   ``We've seen everything,'' said Monica Seles, who was playing on
a nearby court. ``I was wondering if it's OK to breathe this air.''
	   Photographers suffered the first loss of the event when
Kournikova withdrew due to a thumb injury. Her departure meant
diminished media attention for a tournament already overshadowed by
the World Cup.
	   Another teen-ager, Wimbledon newcomer Serena Williams, dodged
the puddles and made a big splash by easily winning her first two
matches. The 16-year-old American is on course for a fourth-round
collision with her equally impressive sister, Venus, who set a
women's record with a 125-mph (201 kph) serve.
	   The Williams-Williams winner would face a path that could
include Jana Novotna in the quarterfinals, Hingis in the semifinals
and Seles or Lindsay Davenport in the final.
	   On the men's side, Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic are a
likely matchup in one semifinal. The other is expected to pit
Sampras against Rafter, Tim Henman or Petr Korda.
	   Henman, trying to become the first Englishman to win Wimbledon
since 1936, is glad to share the nation's favor with fellow Briton
Samantha Smith, who goes by Sam. She earned her first Wimbledon
victory last week at age 26, then promptly won twice more, beating
1994 champion Conchita Martinez to reach the round of 16.
	   Two other former champs, Graf and Agassi, suffered setbacks in
their comebacks. Graf, a seven-time titlist plagued lately by
injuries, lost 6-4, 7-5 to Zvereva, a player she had beaten in
their 17 previous meetings.
	   Steffi was iffy about returning next year.
	   ``It would be nice to play again and, hopefully, be in different
shape and enjoy myself,'' said Graf, 29. ``But I've learned enough
to take what's coming up next (as it comes). So I don't know.''
	   Agassi still hasn't reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam
since 1996. He lost to unseeded Tommy Haas, who promptly lost to
unseeded John Van Lottum.
	   ``Right now,'' Agassi said, ``I feel I have a lot more to do
with some of these defeats than my opponents.''
	   Also bidding adios was second-seeded Marcelo Rios, who lost to
Francisco Clavet and then ripped Wimbledon as ``just another
tournament.''
	   Only 17 of 32 seeds survived the first week. Because of the
weather and playing surface, more surprises are likely during the
second half of the fortnight.
	   ``On grass especially, it makes no difference if you're a
star,'' Hingis said. ``Everybody can beat you if you aren't 100
percent.''
	   ``With the rain delays, anything can happen,'' Seles said.
``You've got to stay strong mentally. So I wouldn't dismiss really
anybody.''
	   Yes, anything's possible _ weather permitting.

Outgoing president urges world leaders to continue Philippine support 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Outgoing President Fidel Ramos has
written farewell letters to 93 world leaders, including the pope
and U.N. secretary-general, urging them to continue support for the
Philippines, the government said Sunday.
	   Ramos' single six-year term ends Tuesday. His successor is
Joseph Estrada, a former movie star, who has vowed to continue the
wide-ranging political and economic reforms of his predecessor.
	   Ramos thanked his counterparts in Asia, Europe, Africa and the
Americas for cooperation, singling out leaders like Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   Ramos praised China's statesmanship and restraint concerning the
disputed Spratlys, a potentially oil-rich island chain claimed by
China, the Philippines and four other countries in the South China
Sea, a government statement said.
	   The Philippine leader thanked Jiang for not devaluing the
Chinese yuan, which could drastically aggravate a year-old currency
crisis in Asia.
	   In his letter to Clinton, Ramos said active U.S. engagement in
Asia and the Pacific has helped keep stability in the region.
	   Ramos said he would urge Estrada to build on U.S.-Philippine
economic and security ties. The Philippines was once an American
colony and host to the largest military bases outside the U.S.
mainland.
	   As a senator, Estrada had fought for the closure of a huge U.S.
naval base in Subic town, north of Manila, by voting against an
extension of the U.S. lease on the base. It closed in the early
1990s. Estrada has said he was not personally opposed to Americans
but only wanted to end Filipino dependence on the U.S. bases.
	   Ramos assured U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Estrada
would continue the Philippines' strong support for the world body,
particularly its peace and security-keeping efforts in Asia. The
president asked Pope John Paul II to pray for the country and
Estrada, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday.
	   Ramos, a former military general, has been credited for economic
and political reforms that allowed Filipinos to enjoy a measure of
prosperity after more than a decade of stagnancy.
	   Since becoming president in 1992, Ramos has journeyed to more
than 40 countries on 35 foreign trips in an aggressive quest for
investment. Officials said his trips have generated about dlrs 20
billion worth of business for the Philippines.

	   BRISTOL, England (AP) _ A jet bound for Greece with 180
passengers returned to Bristol International Airport after it was
hit by a ``freak gust'' of wind just at its nose left the runway on
takeoff, an airport spokeswoman said Sunday.

by Air 2000, to touch the runway for a moment, said airport
spokeswoman Tiffany Aitkens.ircraft.''

Report: Weizman to boycott air show after wings clipped by air force 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's 74-year-old president will boycott an
air force celebration after the country's top military brass
clipped his wings, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Former air force commander Ezer Weizman wanted to co-pilot a
Fuga-Magister jet trainer in a fly-over on Thursday in honor of
Israel's 50th anniversary celebrations.
	   But the present air force commander, Maj. Gen Eitan Ben-Eliahu,
said Weizman was no longer physically fit to fly jets, the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper said.
	   Other former commanders _ including 78-year-old Dan Tolkowsky _
are flying as co-pilots in the jet trainers, although the planes
will really be flown by instructors from the air force flying
school, the paper said.
	   As a compromise, Ben-Eliahu suggested that Weizman co-pilot a
C-140 Hercules transport aircraft or a tanker plane for in-flight
refuelling, but Weizman dismissed the offer as an insult, the paper
said.
	   The army spokesman's office refused comment on the report,
referring queries to Weizman's office, which did not immediately
return telephone calls from The Associated Press.

Serbs, KLA rebels locked in new Kosovo standoff at Kijevo No pick up

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A dangerous standoff at a crossroads
village in the center of the secessionist province of Kosovo has
become the focus of international negotiators, who fear it could
ignite all-out war in the region.
	   Ethnic Albanian guerrillas have maintained an armed ring around
the predominately Serb village of Kijevo for 11 days, and still
refused Sunday to give up their positions.
	   Yugoslav security forces reportedly attacked Albanian positions
around the strategic village late Saturday.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership, said Sunday four Yugoslav helicopters bombed guerilla
positions around Kijevo, while a fifth flew food supplies into the
village and evacuated four Serb women and a child.
	   Western diplomats fear Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
preparing for another crackdown centered on the village, located
southwest of the provincial capital of Pristina on one of Kosovo's
two main roads.
	   ``We are only a few steps away from a general war'' in Kosovo,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said Saturday at a forum of political
and economic leaders in Switzerland.
	   ``If he (Milosevic) opened the checkpoint at Kijevo by force,
there would be tremendous bloodshed and you would know about Kijevo
as a place that could have triggered a wider war,'' he said.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an operation on Feb.
28 to try to extinguish growing resistance by secessionist
militants in predominantly Albanian Kosovo. Some 80 people, mostly
civilians, died in that crackdown, and dozens more in another
campaign launched in late May.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army claims to control 30
percent to 40 percent of this province in Serbia, the dominant
republic in what is left of Yugoslavia. They are increasingly
supported by the Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
	   On Sunday Holbrooke said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard had met
Friday with people claiming to be representatives of the KLA.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which is fighting for
independence of the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   ``The contacts were with people who said they had this
authority, but at this point that authority remains to be
demonstrated,'' he said.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that the two unidentified KLA
leaders committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in Kosovo,
quoting senior American officials. The KLA leaders also reportedly
agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to
try to provide a common negotiating position, even though they
disagree with his pacifist approach to seeking independence for
Kosovo.
	   An influential ethnic Albanian politician, Adem Demaci, said he
was asked by Holbrooke to mediate with the Albanian militants to
break the Kijevo impasse, but his efforts produced no visible
results.
	   According to TV Tirana in neighboring Albania, the rebels said
they would let the Serbs go from Kijevo if the police and Yugoslav
army withdraw from three vital positions in the area west of
Pristina.
	   The latest evidence that Kosovo Albanians favor a more radical
solution than diplomacy to their quest for independence came
Saturday, when several top politicians founded a new movement
intended to serve as the KLA's political wing.
	   A third of the group was once loyal to Rugova, including his
former top aide Hidajet Hiseni and prominent activist Rexhep Qosja,
who helped found the Albanian Democratic Movement with the aim of
uniting radicals.
	   Rugova favors a pacifist approach to gain independence.
	   Speaking in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
told reporters both Gelbard and Holbrooke were ``trying to get a
diplomatic solution'' but NATO planning for other options was
accelerating.
	   ``All options are on the table,'' she said.

Twelve people die in car accident in southern Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Twelve people were killed Sunday when the
bus they were traveling in ran into a truck in southern Egypt,
police officials said.
	   The accident occurred near the southern city of Sohag, some 390
kilometers (240 miles) to the south, said the officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The bus, coming from Cairo, was carrying 11 passengers.
	   The bus driver and the driver of the truck, which was traveling
on the opposite direction, were among those killed, the officials
said.
	   Only one passenger, a policeman sitting in the back of the bus,
survived the crash and was taken to hospital for treatment.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.

Pope praises recent Catholic-Lutheran agreement 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday warmly praised a
recent Catholic-Lutheran agreement on some doctrine and said he
hoped the progress will encourage efforts aimed at unity.
	   Last week, the Vatican said that much agreement had been reached
with the Lutherans about a joint declaration which would remove
most of the condemnations that the two churches leveled at each
other when Western Christianity split in the 16th century.
	   However, the Vatican acknowledged some differences on
fundamental doctrine remain that require further study.
	   Speaking to tourists in St. Peter's Square, John Paul called the
step an ``important ecumenical'' achievement and said he hoped it
could ``encourage and reinforce the declared aim that Lutherans and
Catholics pursue -- the achievement of visible full unity.''
	   John Paul said the Vatican and the World Lutheran Foundation had
reached a ``high degree of agreement.''
	   The two sides crafted compromise language on one of the key
unresolved points regarding what theologians call
``justification,'' or how humankind achieves salvation.
	   For the Lutherans, it depends on the grace of God, while
Catholics maintain that good works are also involved.
	   With the declaration, Catholics and Lutherans have agreed that
divine forgiveness and salvation come ``solely by God's grace'' and
that good works flow from that.
	   ``Although the declaration doesn't resolve all the questions
relating to the teaching of the doctrine of justification, it
expresses a consensus on fundamental truths of that doctrine,'' the
pope said.
	   The Vatican has said formal signing of the declaration will take
place this fall.

Netanyahu accused of trying to stall peace process Levy is education minister. No pick up 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with new quotes, details. CORRECTS that
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal
for an international peace conference was blasted Sunday by critics
who accused him of putting up new roadblocks to peace.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Netanyahu was
trying to ``escape'' from his commitments, and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said the prime minister was trying ``to torpedo the
peace process.''
	   Netanyahu, however, said agreement with the Palestinians on an
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank could be reached by
next month if the Palestinians met their obligations.
	   ``I estimate this issue will be concluded by then,'' he said on
Israel Radio when asked if agreement would be reached before the
Knesset recesses on July 29. ``I can't say for sure,'' he added,
``because I can't tell the Palestinians what to do.''
	   The United States is pushing Israel to accept a U.S. proposal
for turning over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer, but
deadline after unofficial deadline has passed without a response
from Israel.
	   Netanyahu, who faces serious opposition to any withdrawal from
hard-liners in his own Cabinet, recently suggested a
European-sponsored conference to discuss Mideast issues _ but not
the Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically. The conference would
address regional issues such as water, the environment, and trade,
he said Sunday.
	   Critics charged that both suggestions were stalling tactics to
avoid moving the peace process forward.
	   ``It is futile for the Palestinians to respond to every new idea
he comes up with, because he does not mean it and does not take it
seriously,'' Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Sunday.
``The only thing he takes seriously is killing the peace process.''
	   Even Education Minister Yitzhak Levy, a member of Netanyahu's
governing coalition, questioned the usefulness of holding a
conference now.
	   ``At this moment our goal is to reach the final status agreement
(with the Palestinians) ... and this is what the government should
be working for,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu, however, said the Palestinians were the ones holding
up the process by refusing to make specific commitments for
fulfilling their obligations, such as collecting weapons, outlawing
militant groups, arresting suspects, or completing the repeal of
articles in the Palestinian National Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.

Fighters blank BlueWave 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Jerry Brooks and Katsuhiro Nishiura each hit a
two-run home run in the sixth inning as the Pacific League's
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters blanked the Orix BlueWave 4-0 at
Kobe Sunday.
	   Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins, has 17 homers and
Nishiura has 11.
	   The Fighters are two games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, who
beat the Chiba Lotte Marines 6-2 at Chiba.
	   The Marines suffered their 12th straight defeat.
	   The Buffaloes' Phil Clark, formerly with the Boston Red Sox, hit
a two-run double against starter Joe Crawford in the four-run
fourth inning.
	   Crawford, formerly with the New York Mets, gave up eight hits
over five innings and took the loss. He is 4-5.
	   At Seibu Dome, Hiroshi Shintani pitched a two-hitter over 8 2/3
innings for his third victory against three defeats as the Seibu
Lions blanked the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 6-0 and extended their
winning streak to five.
	   In the Central League, Kazuhiro Kiyohara belted a three-run home
run in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Yomiuri Giants an
8-5 victory over the front-running Yokohama BayStars at Tokyo Dome.
	   Kiyohara has 11 homers this season.
	   The BayStars, who ended their winning streak at eight, are still
one game ahead of the Giants, who moved into second place as the
Chunichi Dragons lost 8-0 to the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Nagoya Dome
and fell to third.
	   The Dragons were .003 percentage points ahead of the Giants
Saturday.
	   The Carp's Akira Etoh hit a two-run home run in the seventh
inning and teammate Makoto Kitoh pitched a six-hitter against the
Dragons.
	   Etoh has 12 homers and Kitoh is 2-4.
	   At Koshien Stadium, Yoshiya Takeuchi pitched a three-hitter over
seven innings and Ben Rivera yielded just one hit over the
remaining two as the Hanshin Tigers blanked the Yakult Swallows
3-0.
	   Takeuchi (2-3) was the winner. Rivera formerly played for the
Philadelphia Phillies.

They shoot, they score! Officials say World Cup is wide-open on offense AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fast breaks. Strikes from the corner. Points in
close and in the air. Action, action and more action.
	   A late-night rerun of the NBA Finals? No way. This is the World
Cup, soccer in the French style.
	   Officials said Sunday that a combination of cool weather, gifted
athletes and changes in coaches' strategies and players' roles had
opened up the tournament's offense like never before.
	   Although scoring was just about the same as for the last Cup in
1994, the head of FIFA's panel that studies the nuts and bolts of
soccer said the first round was played at a quicker pace with an
emphasis on going for goals.
	   ``We are seeing more counterattacks and faster scoring,'' Gerard
Houllier said. ``The one-on-one and other shows of athletic ability
certainly are much higher than in 1994. The players are playing
harder and running faster.''
	   Houllier, a former coach of the French national team, said more
teams had gone to formations that encourage offense, with the 3-5-2
featuring an athletic, play-calling sweeper the favorite. Four
years ago, when the Cup was held in the United States, most coaches
favored a lineup with four deep defenders.
	   There's very little pressing on defense, he said, and the block
formations now used force attackers to dribble more, opening the
field and the chance of fast breaks.
	   ``In the United States, there were a lot of goals off short
passes,'' Houllier said. ``Here, a lot of goals have been scored on
breakaways.''
	   Strikers such as top scorer Christian Vieri of Italy, Gabriel
Batistuta of Argentina and Ronaldo of Brazil have made their mark
on the tournament. But Houllier and Jurg Nepfer, FIFA's technical
coordinator, said midfielders has suddenly become scoring machines.
	   In the first round, midfielders scored 47 times, or 37.3 percent
of all goals, compared with 25.8 percent in 1994, when there were
fewer games. Strikers, who supplied 65.6 percent of the goals four
years ago, were down to 52.4 percent (66 goals) this year, Nepfer
said.
	   The average game has seen 2.63 goals, compared with 2.47 in '94
and well up from the 2.28 goals-per-game average of the
defense-dominated 1990 tournament in Italy.
	   While the average score hasn't changed much from '94, the
average scoring play has. Goals from outside the penalty area
dropped to 13 or 10.3 percent, compared with 20.5 percent last
time. Scores inside the goal area, conversely, were way up, 33-15,
or a jump from 16.1 percent to 26.2 percent.
	   And corner kicks have produced 17 goals, compared with just four
at the same stage four years ago.
	   ``The teams are very good at playing the ball in the air,''
Houllier said.
	   All this means that teams are going to the hole, rather than
flopping around at midfield in hopes something will develop. And
Houllier said a drastic change in the weather probably accounted
for some of that.
	   ``It was hot in the United States in '94,'' Houllier said.
``Teams were very focused on controlling the ball.''
	   While that summer in the U.S. cities was boiling, France has
been unseasonably cool, making it easier for players to go all-out.
	   And they've had to, Houllier said, to beat a sterling bunch of
goalies.
	   ``The goalkeepers are playing better than in 1994,'' he said.
``We've seen some great saves and great, great plays by the
goalkeepers. Teams from Asia and Africa have made great advances in
training their goalkeepers.''
	   Houllier said the technical committee would try to pick the 11
best players after the later rounds. For the time being, he said,
there were a few players who had caught his eye.
	   In goal on the all-Houllier team was Jose Luis Chilavert of
Paraguay. Among defenders, he picked Marcel Desailly of France, who
``makes no mistakes and wins all the loose balls.'' The top
midfielder so far, Houllier said, was Argentina's Ariel Ortega,
``creative, an excellent passer.'' And the striker, he said, would
come from among a gilded trio _ Vieri, who leads the tournament
with five goals; Batistuta, who has the tournament's only hat
trick; and Ronaldo, who had two goals against Chile while banging
two other shots off the goalpost and the crossbar.

Report: Weizman to boycott air show after wings clipped by air force 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's 74-year-old president will boycott an
air force celebration after the country's top military brass
clipped his wings, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Former air force commander Ezer Weizman wanted to co-pilot a
Fuga-Magister jet trainer in a fly-over on Thursday in honor of
Israel's 50th anniversary celebrations.
	   But the present air force commander, Maj. Gen Eitan Ben-Eliahu,
said Weizman was no longer physically fit to fly jets, the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper said.
	   Other former commanders _ including 78-year-old Dan Tolkowsky _
are flying as co-pilots in the jet trainers, although the planes
will really be flown by instructors from the air force flying
school, the paper said.
	   As a compromise, Ben-Eliahu suggested that Weizman co-pilot a
C-140 Hercules transport aircraft or a tanker plane used for
in-flight refuelling, but Weizman dismissed the offer as an insult,
the paper said.
	   The army spokesman's office refused comment on the report,
referring queries to Weizman's office, which did not immediately
return telephone calls from The Associated Press.

	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - Michael Schumacher took advantage of
a race re-start to win the French Grand Prix Sunday to close within
six points of Mika Hakkinen with half the season to go.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine, acting a a buffer
between Schumacher and Hakkinen for most of the race, came in
second, 19.5 seconds behind.
	   A frustrated Hakkinen in a McLaren-Mercedes was third, barely
behind Irvine after trying to pass him for the last 15 laps of the
race.
	   Jacques Villeneuve, last year's Formula One champion, was fourth
in Williams-Mecachrome. Villeneuve beat Schumacher for the title in
the last race of the 1997 season after a dramatic collision forced
Schumacher out of the race.
	   Alexander Wurz of Austria was in fifth with a Benetton-Playlife
followed by David Coulthard, plagued by problems fueling in the
pits, in sixth with a McLaren-Mercedes.
	   Hakkinen still leads the drivers standings with 50 points but .
Schumacher moved up to 44.
	   It was Schumacher's 30th career victory and third this season.
He also has won the French Grand Prix four of the last five times.
He missed out in 1996 when he car's engine failed on the warm-up
lap after leading qualifying.
	   The race had to begin twice. The first time Jos Verstappen, who
had replaced Jan Magnussen at Stewart-Ford this week, stalled out
just before the start as the rest of the field roared away.
Hakkinen had the lead but the race was stopped.
	   On the re-start Schumacher and Irvine pulled ahead of Hakkinen
on the first turn, a perfect start for the Ferraris.
	   Schumacher pulled away from his teammate Irvine who forced the
McLarens to lap about a second slower than Schumacher in the early
stages.
	   Schumacher's lead was up to 11 seconds by the end of 10 laps and
leveled to about 13 seconds after 15.
	   Meanwhile Hakkinen continued to pressure Irvine and took his
chance with an inside move on a curve on the 20th lap. He had
passed Irvine but couldn't hold the line and spun out. He got back
on track quickly but lost more than four seconds.
	   He made a pit stop soon after to change tires and get fuel but
Schumacher followed, now with a comfortable margin over Hakkinen.
	   After the first pit stops were sorted out by the 26th lap,
Schumacher now had an 18-second bulge over Irvine and, more
important, a 22-second advantage over Hakkinen, who had regained
third from his teammate Coulthard.
	   By his second pit stop on the 45th lap, Schumacher led by 24
seconds over Irvine and 33 over Hakkinen.
	   Hakkinen held off pitting until 54 laps and wound up behind
Irvine again. Hakkinen was desparate to pass Irvine this time.
	   He kept looking for an op ening but Irvine kept closing the
door.
	   On the final curve, it became a drag race down the straightaway
with Irvine holding off Hakkinen.
	   The French Grand Prix was the eighth race of the Formula One
series and began a hectic period with three more races over the
next five weeks.
	   The next race is the British Grand Prix July 12.

Twelve people die in car accident in southern Egypt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Twelve people were killed Sunday when the
bus they were traveling in ran into a truck in southern Egypt,
police officials said.
	   The accident occurred near the southern city of Sohag, some 390
kilometers (240 miles) to the south, said the officials, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The bus, coming from Cairo, was carrying 11 passengers.
	   The bus driver and the driver of the truck, which was traveling
in the opposite direction, were among those killed, the officials
said.
	   Only one passenger, a policeman sitting in the back of the bus,
survived the crash and was taken to a hospital.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.

Searchers arrive in swamps where U.N. envoy's plane crashed 
</HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANGROVE SWAMPS NEAR AKOURE, Ivory Coast (AP) _ A team of
searchers airdropped Sunday into the marshlands crash site where a
small chartered plane carrying the U.N. envoy to Angola descended
more than 36 hours earlier.
	   A small group of Ivorian and French soldiers and local villagers
were flown by helicopter to the accident in nearly-impenetrable
mangrove swamps about 35 miles (50 kilometers) outside Abidjan, the
commercial capital of Ivory Coast, French military officials said
on condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear whether those who were aboard the plane had been
found although rescuers had said Saturday after flying over the
crash that there were no sign of survivors.
	   Searchers have been hampered by a lack of telephone
communications as well as the inhospitable terrain. U.N. aviation
experts were expected to join the search, but had not yet arrived,
Ivorian civil aviation officials said Sunday morning.
	   Dozens of Ivorian military rescuers were struggling for a second
day to carve a path through miles (kilometers) of mud, water and
thick forest to reach the plane.
	   Ivorian soldiers, journalists and villagers trekking by land
were often mired in waste-high water as local guides used machetes
and chain saws to cut a path to the plane.
	   The U.S.-built Beechcraft 200 was believed to be carrying either
seven or eight people, including the United Nations special envoy
to Angola, 59-year-old Alioune Blondin Beye.
	   Beye, a well-respected diplomat from Mali, is credited with
leading U.N. peace efforts in Angola, which has suffered an
on-again off-again fighting since civil war began after
independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The others aboard were identified as Togolese foreign ministry
employee Koffi Adjovi, Senegalese journalist Moktar Gueye and
Baendegar Dessandre, who is from Chad and an unnamed Portugese
national. Two South African pilots were flying the plane, civil
aviation director John Kouassi Abounan said.
	   There was a discrepancy over the number of people aboard.
Ivorian officials said in a statement Saturday that eight people
were on the plane although later referred to seven people without
explaining.
	   The plane left Togo's capital of Lome on Friday evening after
Beye met with Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema in a bid to win
support for the Angolan peace process.
	   The aircraft disappeared east of Abidjan's international airport
around 7:00 p.m. on Saturday night and search-and-rescue operations
were launched.
	   Local villagers saw a flash in the sky followed by a roar that
some initially thought was a bomb.
	   Beye, 59, threatened to resign last month, saying the government
and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the ``political will'' to
see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace pact signed in Lusaka. An earlier
peace accord, signed in Lisbon in 1991, collapsed a year later when
UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, rejected its defeat in the country's
first-ever elections and returned to the bush.
	   Lingering hostility between the government and UNITA has stymied
implementation of the pact, which is running more than a year
behind schedule, and the U.N.'s patience is growing thin.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to give UNITA five
more days to comply with terms of the plan.
	   After June 30, the U.N. Security Council will freeze UNITA's
foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond exports unless the
movement relinquishes its central highland strongholds and takes
major steps to demobilize.
	   UNITA criticized the threatened sanctions Friday, calling them
illegal and saying they would jeopardize the peace agreement.
	   The ``troika'' said the international community learned ``with
great shock and deep sadness of the crash'' and praised Beye for
his ``indefatigable efforts'' to obtain lasting peace in Angola.

Cruise ship disinfected after discovery of Legionnaires' disease bacteria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GREENOCK, Scotland (AP) _ Health experts began disinfecting the
water supply system on a cruise ship which docked at this Scottish
port near Glasgow Sunday after tests showed a high concentration of
the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease.
	   The 800 passengers and 400 crew who disembarked from the SS
Edinburgh Castle were told to seek urgent medical attention if they
developed any signs of the flu-like illness in the next 10 days,
including a fever, cough, diarrhea, headache, confusion or
shortness of breath.
	   The ship was suspected of carrying the legionella organism after
two passengers who had been on different cruises _ one in April,
the other in June _ contracted Legionnaires' disease.
	   Direct Cruises, which operates the cruise ship, said tests for
the legionnella organism in the Edinburgh Castle's water supply
were done in Liverpool on June 15 after the second Legionaires'
case was discovered.
	   But there were technical difficulties so the tests were repeated
on June 21 when the ship reached Greenock, its next port of call,
said Rick Green, operations manager of Direct Cruises.
	   The results, which were sent to the local council in Greenock on
Wednesday, showed a high concentration of legionella in some parts
of the water system, he said.
	   At the time, the Edinburgh Castle was cruising in Norway and
while most passengers were on day trips Thursday the ship's captain
ordered the water on board to be heated to the point where 95
percent of the legionnella present would have been killed, Green
said.
	   Bottled water was made available to all passengers, he said.
	   Inverclyde Council's incident control group drew up plans to
disinfect the entire water system when the ship returned to
Greenock on Sunday. These include flushing tanks and pipes with a
solution of chlorine dioxide, which must remain in contact with all
parts of the system for at least four hours. The system is then
flushed and the entire treatment repeated.
	   The owners of the ship, Castle Cruising, said the 900 passengers
booked to sail Sunday on board the Edinburgh Castle were informed
that their cruise will be delayed, and offered compensation if they
decide to cancel.
	   An Inverclyde Council spokesman said the vessel will set sail
once the treatment process is completed successfully.

	   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Several hundred Kosovo Serbs packed
the nave of a 14th century Serbian Orthodox monastery Sunday to
mark a defining moment in their history that still echoes in their
present battle against independence-minded ethnic Albanians.
	   In a service held at the Gracanica monastery 5 kilometers (3.1
miles) south of the provincial capital of Pristina, Orthodox bishop
Artemije , compared what happened six centuries ago to the present
battle between Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   ``Our people here have been abandoned by those who should lead
them ... there is no aim, no clear vision as to why today, our
children should give their lives every day,'' the bishop said.
	   In 1389, the Serbian kingdom suffered a major defeat from the
invaders of the Turkish Ottoman Empire at a nearby battlefield.
Five hundred years later, Serbs liberated their country from the
Turks, including the Kosovo province.
	   More than 300 people have been killed and thousands have fled
their homes in Kosovo since March, when fighting between ethnic
Albanian militants and Serb police and army escalated. Albanians
outnumber Serbs in the province 9-to-1.
	   Only some 50 kilometers (31 miles) to the west, a tense standoff
continued Sunday between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas besieging Serb villagers in Kijevo, a crossroads village
in the heart of the province,
	   Top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, on his diplomatic mission to
stop bloodshed in Kosovo called the Kijevo stadoff ``only a few
steps away from a general war.''
	   Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, widely blamed for the
deteriorating situation in Kosovo, was invited to the gathering in
Gracanica, but neither he nor any other Serb official turned up.
	   ``If the political leadership and our presidents betrayed us,
let us hope, brothers and sisters, God will not abandon us,'' the
Radosavljevic concluded.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Steve James' exit from the England cricket team
was just as sudden as his call-up for the second test against South
Africa.
	   The Glamorgan opener, a top run scorer in the domestic
competition, was cut from England's 13-man squad announced Sunday
for the third test at Old Trafford.
	   He was a last-minute inclusion in the Lord's test when Mark
Butcher was ruled out with a thumb injury but squandered the
chance, scoring 10 and 0 in two innings as England was routed.
	   James is replaced by Warwickshire opener Nick Knight _ his first
test selection in 16 months _ because Butcher failed a fitness test
and was not considered.
	   England was humiliated in the 10-wicket second test loss to
South Africa.
	   Forced to follow-on when bowled out for 110 in reply to South
Africa's 360, England just passed the Proteas score when it was
bowled out a second time.
	   Mark Ealham was also cut from the England squad for the third
test after disappointing performances and was replaced by Ben
Hollioake.
	   The 20-year-old all-rounder is selected for his first test since
his debut against Australia at Trent Bridge last summer.
	   England chairman of selectors David Graveney said Hollioake had
been identified as a player of the future, which was a contributing
factor in his selection.
	   One-day squad spinner Ashley Giles was also added to the test
squad but is only likely to play if England decide the Olf Trafford
pitch is suitable for two spinners.
	   Yorkshire fast bowler Darren Gough, who missed the Lord's test
with a broken finger, has also been included in the squad.
	   His return should add the bowling strikepower England sorely
missed in the second test when Dominic Cork and Angus Fraser had
South Africa in early trouble.

Parade performers on strike, but show goes on 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Several dozen parade performers at Disneyland Paris
maintained a four-day-old strike Sunday, though the show has gone
on without them, a park spokeswoman said.
	   About 70 people who participate in the daily Main Street parade
_ nearly half the performers _ walked off the job Wednesday,
demanding wider responsibilities with higher salaries, said Euro
Disney spokeswoman Isabelle Clap.
	   ``They've arrived at a point where they can't evolve in their
jobs, so there's discussion on how to advance,'' she said in a
telephone interview.
	   Union representatives were demanding a 7 percent hike in the
employees' salaries of 8,000 francs (dlrs 1,300) per month, France
Info radio reported.
	   Clap said salaries were an issue in the walkout, but she did not
elaborate.
	   In the meantime, the musical parade with Disney characters was
still staged every afternoon with a cast of 150, Clap said. Other
employees took the places of the ones on strike at the park 30 kms
(18 miles) east of Paris.
	   Euro Disney, the holding company that is 39 percent owned by the
Walt Disney Co. based in Burbank, California, opened the park's
doors in April 1992. It reported annual profit since 1995, in part
by imposing tougher cost controls that have triggered occasional
strikes.

Free Democrats endorse Kohl, but forge own path on social policy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ The junior party in Helmut Kohl's
government ended a three-day party congress Sunday with ambiguity:
It endorsed the chancellor's coalition but forged a separate path
in social policy.
	   Free Democratic Party delegates supported the continuation of
Kohl's three-party, center-right coalition should it win the Sept.
27 national elections, despite talk of joining the opposition.
	   But the free-market, anti-tax party said it would push its own
goals in coalition talks, including some endorsed Sunday that are
at odds with positions of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
	   The Free Democrats support the controlled distribution of
narcotics to addicts to wean them away from the drugs and deter
crime, and want to make it easier for children of foreigners in
Germany to acquire German citizenship. Both measures are opposed by
Kohl's party.
	   The Free Democrats also expressed strong support for big
income-tax reductions to spur economic growth, and reductions in
agrarian subsidies.
	   The Free Democrats have relished the role of king-maker in
German politics. They scrapped an alliance with the left-leaning
Social Democrats in 1982 to help bring Kohl to power.
	   With the opposition Social Democrats leading Kohl's party in the
polls, some leaders of the Free Democrats had raised the
possibility of joining the opposition during the election campaign.
	   Party chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt rejected that idea and secured
party delegates' votes Friday at the Leipzig convention for the
resolution endorsing Kohl's coalition. But that position could
change if the Social Democrats win on Sept. 27.
	   Polls released this weekend showed the Social Democrats would
garner the most votes if the election were held immediately.
	   A survey by Munich-based Polis Institute said the Social
Democrats would get 43 percent, and that Kohl's CDU and its
Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union would get 36 percent.
The environmentalist Greens party, a likely coalition partner for
the Social Democrats, scored 6 percent and the Free Democrats 6
percent.
	   A poll by the Bonn-based Dimap Institute showed the Social
Democrats with 44 percent, CDU/CSU 36 percent, Greens 7 percent and
Free Democrats 5 percent.
	   Both polls had a margin of error of about two percentage points.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Rescuers on Sunday found a boy out alive
from mountains of rubble triggered by a quake a day earlier in
southern Turkey that killed at least 109 people and leveled much of
this city.
	   More than 1,000 people were injured, and tens of thousands fled
this city rattled by scores of aftershocks.
	   The 11-year-old survivor was found in the debris of a flattened
five-story building 24 hours after the earthquake struck.
	   ``He is conscious and talking to us. We need to clear the stones
around his body,'' said Atilla Uras, a volunteer searcher as a
crowd applauded.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 46 people in Ceyhan, terminus
of site of an Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline, which the energy ministry
said suffered no damage.
	   At least 40 people died in Adana, which is some 48 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Ceyhan.
	   At the outskirts of Adana is the Incirlik air base, used by U.S.
and British jets to patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
	   A U.S. military announcement said 25 people suffered minor
injuries at the base.
	   The quake was slightly felt along the Mediterranean coast of
Turkey, as well as on the island of Cyprus, but hotel officials
said foreign tourists at resort areas showed no panic.
	   In Ceyhan, where at least five downtown buildings were leveled,
rescuers used backhoes, shovels and hands to clear away rubble.
	   ``It is not over yet. There are scores of people still under
collapsed buildings,'' said a local hospital official, Mustafa
Karsli.
	   Firefighters dug out the bodies of three children who were
killed at a birthday party in one of the collapsed buildings.
	   Gulbin Cankaya was on the top floor of a seven-story building
that collapsed.
	   ``I cleared some stones around me and started to knock stones
together to make noise and cried for help,'' she said lying on a
stretcher in the garden of Ceyhan's hospital with her
three-year-old daughter.
	   The doctors did not tell her that her husband and sister were
found dead.
	   Close to half of Ceyhan's population of 80,000 ran from the city
after the quake jolted southern Turkey Saturday with a preliminary
magnitude of 6.3, according to Istanbul's Kandilli observatory.
	   With the first 24 hours after the quake, 65 aftershocks were
recorded, including one which had a 4.8 magnitude at 6:59 a.m.
(0359 GMT), the department of natural disasters announced.
	   Crowds were angry when rescue operations were interrupted
briefly Sunday when President Suleyman Demirel visited Ceyhan.
	   ``I have three people of my own blood there. They are just
making politics here,'' said Ibrahim Civelek, standing before a
destroyed house.
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz also visited the area.
	   Gov. Oguz Koksal of Adana, a city of 1 million people where the
quake was centered, said the number of injured reached at least
1,041, with 15 of those in serious condition.
	   The hardest hit areas were slums with poorly constructed
buildings. Cracks opened in many buildings, including mosques.
	   ``This is all the result of ill-construction,'' Environment
Minister Imren Aykut told APTV.
	   ``Paper walls,'' said firefighter Mustafa Karakus, accusing
builders of not using enough iron and cement for construction.
	   Several government buildings collapsed, despite a public works
ministry decree ordering safety measures in the construction of
buildings in earthquake-prone regions, the daily Sabah noted.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

Pope praises recent Catholic-Lutheran agreement delegation as part of Christian unity efforts 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES by ADDING two grafs pope later met with Orthodox
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday warmly praised a
recent Catholic-Lutheran agreement on some points of doctrine and
said he hoped the progress will encourage efforts aimed at unity.
	   Last week, the Vatican said that much agreement had been reached
with the Lutherans about a joint declaration which would remove
most of the condemnations that the two churches leveled at each
other when Western Christianity split in the 16th century.
	   However, the Vatican acknowledged some differences on
fundamental doctrine need further study.
	   Speaking to tourists in St. Peter's Square, John Paul called the
step an ``important ecumenical'' achievement and said he hoped it
could ``encourage and reinforce the declared aim that Lutherans and
Catholics pursue -- the achievement of visible full unity.''
	   John Paul said the Vatican and the World Lutheran Foundation had
reached a ``high degree of agreement.''
	   The two sides crafted compromise language on one of the key
unresolved points regarding what theologians call
``justification,'' or how humankind achieves salvation.
	   For the Lutherans, it depends on the grace of God, while
Catholics maintain that good works are also involved.
	   With the declaration, Catholics and Lutherans have agreed that
divine forgiveness and salvation come ``solely by God's grace'' and
that good works flow from that.
	   ``Although the declaration doesn't resolve all the questions
relating to the teaching of the doctrine of justification, it
expresses a consensus on fundamental truths of that doctrine,'' the
pope said.
	   The Vatican has said formal signing of the declaration will take
place this fall.
	   Later, as part of other efforts aimed at moving down the path
toward Christian unity, the pope received an Orthodox delegation.
	   He called their presence, to help him celebrate the feast day
Monday of St. Peter and St. Paul, a ``clear sign of our common will
to undertake this journey in fraternal charity and in love for the
truth.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Steve James' exit from the England cricket team
was just as sudden as his call-up for the second test against South
Africa.
	   The Glamorgan opener, a top run scorer in the domestic
competition, was cut from England's 13-man squad announced Sunday
for the third test at Old Trafford.
	   He was a last-minute inclusion in the Lord's test when Mark
Butcher was ruled out with a thumb injury but squandered the
chance, scoring 10 and 0 in two innings as England was routed.
	   James is replaced by Warwickshire opener Nick Knight _ his first
test selection in 16 months _ because Butcher failed a fitness test
and was not considered.
	   England was humiliated in the 10-wicket second test loss to
South Africa.
	   Forced to follow-on when bowled out for 110 in reply to South
Africa's 360, England just passed the Proteas score when it was
bowled out a second time.
	   Mark Ealham was also cut from the England squad for the third
test after disappointing performances and was replaced by Ben
Hollioake.
	   The 20-year-old all-rounder is selected for his first test since
his debut against Australia at Trent Bridge last summer.
	   England chairman of selectors David Graveney said Hollioake had
been identified as a player of the future, which was a contributing
factor in his selection.
	   One-day squad spinner Ashley Giles was also added to the test
squad but is only likely to play if England decide the Olf Trafford
pitch is suitable for two spinners.
	   Yorkshire fast bowler Darren Gough, who missed the Lord's test
with a broken finger, has also been included in the squad.
	   His return should add the bowling strikepower England sorely
missed in the second test when Dominic Cork and Angus Fraser had
South Africa in early trouble.
	   The England squad for the third Test against South Africa at Old
Trafford, starting on Thursday, July 2:
	   Alec Stewart (captain) age 35, Tests 77; Michael Atherton 30,
81; Nasser Hussain 30, 31; Graham Thorpe 28, 51; Mark Ramprakash
28, 25; Ben Hollioake 20, 1; Dominic Cork 26, 21; Robert Croft 28,
13; Darren Gough 27, 22; Angus Fraser 32, 40; Dean Headley 28, 10;
Ashley Giles 25, 0; Nick Knight 28, 11.

Kuwaiti authorities confiscate Egyptian magazine 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Kuwaiti authorities confiscated this week's
issue of an Egyptian weekly for publishing a report that predicted
political change in Kuwait, officials at the magazine said Sunday.
	   They said the al-Ahram al-Arabi magazine reported in its
Saturday issue that the recent political crisis in Kuwait could
lead to political reforms and limit the powers of the ruling
al-Sabah family. The change would entail that the crown prince
would no longer simultaneously hold the post of the premier, said
the magazine quoting Kuwaiti sources.
	   Opposition members of the Kuwaiti Parliament have been demanding
that the post of the premier should not be held by a member of the
ruling al-Sabah family. Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah has held the post of premier for the past 20
years.
	   Under the heading, ``Kuwait awaits wide-ranging political
changes,'' the al-Ahram al-Arabi said: ``there is no going back on
the democratic experience. The move is toward expansion of
democracy because of international pressures for change in the
Third World, especially in Kuwait.''
	   Kuwaiti officials were not available for comment.
	   Recent political crisis led to the resignation of the Kuwaiti
Cabinet in March to avoid a no-confidence vote against the
information minister.
	   The move was requested by Muslim fundamentalist legislators
seeking to oust the minister, Sheik Saud al-Sabah, for allowing
books they deemed as blasphemous to be sold at an Arab Book fair
late last year.
	   Earlier this month, a Shiite Muslim fundamentalist legislator
asked to question Interior Minister Sheik Mohammed al-Khaled
al-Sabah _ also a member of the royal family _ for failing to fight
corruption, drugs and crime.
	   Kuwait's parliament speaker turned down the request.
	   Kuwait's parliament is the only elected legislature in the Gulf,
and criticism of the government is somewhat tolerated. Still, the
government dissolved parliaments in 1976 and 1986 after legislators
severely criticized it.
	   The prime minister has complained that his Cabinet can no longer
cooperate with the 50-member legislature, which he has accused of
blocking his economic reforms and showing disrespect for ministers.
	   Last week a Kuwaiti court sentenced the editor of the opposition
newspaper, al-Qabas, and a freelance Egyptian journalist to six
months in jail for publishing a cartoon deemed to have insulted
Islam.

Schumacher wins French Grand Prix, 1st Ld Writethru

<TEXT>
	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - Michael Schumacher took advantage of
a race re-start to win the French Grand Prix Sunday to lead the
first Ferrari 1-2 finish in nearly eight years.
	   He closed within six points of Mika Hakkinen with half the
season to go.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate, Eddie Irvine, acting a a buffer
between Schumacher and Hakkinen for most of the race, came in
second, 19.5 seconds behind.
	   A frustrated Hakkinen in a McLaren-Mercedes was third, barely
behind Irvine after trying to pass him for the last 15 laps of the
race.
	   It was the first 1-2 finish for Ferrari since the Spanish Grand
Prix in 1990 when Alan Prost and Nigel Mansell took the top two
slots for the red cars.
	   Jacques Villeneuve, last year's Formula One champion, was fourth
in Williams-Mecachrome. Villeneuve beat Schumacher for the title in
the last race of the 1997 season after a dramatic collision forced
Schumacher out of the race.
	   Alexander Wurz of Austria was in fifth with a Benetton-Playlife
followed by David Coulthard, plagued by problems fueling in the
pits, in sixth with a McLaren-Mercedes.
	   Schumacher did 1 hour, 34 minutes, 45.026 seconds for the 71
laps of the 4.25-kilometer (2.641-mile) Magny Cours circuit. He
averaged 190.963 kph (118.864 mph) for the 301.75 kilometers (187.5
miles).
	   Hakkinen still leads the drivers standings with 50 points but .
Schumacher moved up to 44.
	   It was Schumacher's 30th career victory and third this season.
He also has won the French Grand Prix four of the last five times.
He missed out in 1996 when he car's engine failed on the warm-up
lap after leading qualifying.
	   The race had to begin twice. The first time Jos Verstappen, who
had replaced Jan Magnussen at Stewart-Ford this week, stalled out
just before the start as the rest of the field roared away.
Hakkinen had the lead but the race was stopped.
	   On the re-start Schumacher and Irvine pulled ahead of Hakkinen
on the first turn, a perfect start for the Ferraris.
	   ``I thought I had a good start and then when I saw Eddie in
second I thought that's the scenario I'd like to have,'' Schumacher
said.
	   Schumacher pulled away from his teammate Irvine who forced the
McLarens to lap about a second slower than Schumacher in the early
stages.
	   ``I didn't want to push too hard,'' Irvine said.
	   Schumacher's lead was up to 11 seconds by the end of 10 laps and
leveled to about 13 seconds after 15.
	   Meanwhile Hakkinen continued to pressure Irvine and took his
chance with an inside move on a curve on the 20th lap. He had
passed Irvine but couldn't hold the line and spun out. He got back
on track quickly but lost more than four seconds.
	   ``He was slow on entering the corners and gave me opportunity to
overtake him,'' said Hakkinen. ``I tried once, the corner was too
tight to take it at that speed.''
	   He made a pit stop soon after to change tires and get fuel but
Schumacher followed, now with a comfortable margin over Hakkinen.
	   After the first pit stops were sorted out by the 26th lap,
Schumacher now had an 18-second bulge over Irvine and, more
important, a 22-second advantage over Hakkinen, who had regained
third from his teammate Coulthard.
	   By his second pit stop on the 45th lap, Schumacher led by 24
seconds over Irvine and 33 over Hakkinen.
	   Hakkinen held off pitting until 54 laps and wound up behind
Irvine again. Hakkinen was desparate to pass Irvine this time.
	   He kept looking for an op ening but Irvine kept closing the
door.
	   On the final curve, it became a drag race down the straightaway
with Irvine holding off Hakkinen.
	   ``I had the the worst downchange of gears and it happened on the
last corner of the last race,'' Irvine said. ``I just locked the
rear wheel.''
	   Still he held off Hakkinen for the Ferrari 1-2.
	   The French Grand Prix was the eighth race of the Formula One
series and began a hectic period with three more races over the
next five weeks.
	   The next race is the British Grand Prix July 12.

Poland plans to lease several dozen military planes from U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland is considering leasing dozens of
U.S. fighter planes and helicopters to bring its military up to
NATO standards, the deputy defense minister said Sunday.
	   Leasing the F-16 or F-18 planes and Cobra helicopters would be a
temporary measure to boost Poland's combat-readiness as required
for its integration into the NATO alliance, Romuald Szeremietiew
said.
	   The government recently decided to delay plans to buy more than
dlrs 1 billion in aircraft, citing tight funds.
	   Szeremietiew, quoted by the PAP news agency after a week-long
visit to the United States, said he will ask the prime minister to
officially request the leases.
	   The deputy defense minister said the Polish military was
interested in dozens of the aircraft but gave no firm details about
the number or cost.
	   He said that U.S. officials had shown him 28 F-16 planes that
were available immediately for leasing, or for purchase at between
dlrs 5 million and dlrs 8 million each. Seven F-18 planes were
available immediately, he said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's 74-year-old president will boycott an
air force celebration after the country's top military brass
clipped his wings, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   Former air force commander Ezer Weizman wanted to co-pilot a
Fuga-Magister jet trainer in a fly-over on Thursday in honor of
Israel's 50th anniversary celebrations.
	   But the present air force commander, Maj. Gen Eitan Ben-Eliahu,
said Weizman was no longer physically fit to fly jets, the Yediot
Ahronot newspaper said.
	   Other former commanders _ including 78-year-old Dan Tolkowsky _
are flying as co-pilots in the jet trainers, although the planes
will actually be flown by instructors from the air force flying
school, the paper said.
	   As a compromise, Ben-Eliahu suggested that Weizman co-pilot a
C-140 Hercules transport aircraft or a tanker plane for in-flight
refuelling, but Weizman dismissed the offer as an insult, the paper
said.
	   The army spokesman's office issued a statement saying there were
``no differences of opinion between the president and the air
force.''
	   After discussion with air force leaders, Weizman himself decided
that ``It would not be right for him to be included,''the statement
said.
	   Weizman's office did not immediately return telephone calls from
The Associated Press.

Precede: TIZI-OUZOU Singer laid to rest amid anti-govt tension, two dead in rioting

<TEXT>
	   BENI DOUALA, Algeria (AP) _ In a human wave of emotion against
Muslim militants who murdered their singer and a government trying
to silence their language, tens of thousands of Berbers attended
the village burial of native son Lounes Matoub.
	   ``No peace without the Berber language,'' read one sign, after
three days of rioting sparked by Matoub's slaying Thursday ravaged
state buildings and left at least two dead and 100 reported injured
in the mountainous Berber region of eastern Algeria.
	   ``Zeroual, murderer,'' read another placard, focusing anger as
much against militants as against the military-backed government of
President Liamine Zeroual that will impose Arabic as the only
official language next Sunday.
	   ``We are not Arabs!'' chanted some mourners under a stifling
summer heat as women ululated and security forces stood watch in
this village 15 kms (10 miles) south of the Berber capital
Tizi-Ouzou, 100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers.
	   Berber leaders called a general strike Sunday, following what
was believed the largest unrest in the region since the so-called
Berber Spring uprising of 1980.
	   No incidents were reported around the funeral at Taourirt Moussa
cemetery next to the village. Both Matoub's family and Prime
Minister Ahmed Ouayhia had appealed for calm.
	   But protest spread to the capital Algiers on Sunday, when
several dozen university students at the Institute for Foreign
Languages and other schools chanted slogans against the government
and for the institutionalization of the Berber language.
	   In Paris, Algerians and French intellectuals gathered near the
Eiffel Tower and at Place de la Republique to honor Matoub and
protest his murder.
	   An impassioned defender of Berber culture, the 42-year-old
singer was the latest Algerian artist to be slain during an
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The killing inflamed Berber anger at the military-backed
government's plans to impose Arabic as the only official language
beginning next Sunday, effectively banning the Berber language,
also known as Tamazight, as well as French, which is widely used in
this former French colony.
	   ``Tamazight in school,'' read one banner among mourners.
	   ``People are angry, but you must understand their frustration
because Tamazight is marginalized,'' Nourredine Ait-Hamouda, an
organizer of the funeral and a member of the Movement for Berber
Culture, told reporters.
	   The Arabic-only law move was seen as a government effort to
appease supporters of Islamic movements. The Rally for Culture and
Democracy, in a statement, accused the government of President
Liamine Zeroual of ``passive complicity with the fundamentalists.''
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment. The Front has condemned Matoub's
assassination.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Rescuers on Sunday found a boy alive in
the rubble of a quake that struck southern Turkey a day earlier,
killing at least 109 people and leveling much of this city and
other towns.
	   More than 1,000 people were injured, and tens of thousands fled
this city rattled by scores of aftershocks. Scores of people were
feared buried under wreckage.
	   The 11-year-old survivor was found in the debris of a flattened
five-story building 24 hours after the earthquake.
	   ``He is conscious and talking to us. We need to clear the stones
around his body,'' said Atilla Uras, a volunteer searcher as a
crowd applauded.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 46 people in Ceyhan, terminus
city for an Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline, which the energy ministry
said suffered no damage.
	   At least 40 people died in Adana, which is some 48 kilometers
(30 miles) west of Ceyhan.
	   In villages in the countryside, at least 23 bodies were found.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Arsonists burned a car belonging to a
right-wing television station Sunday, causing extensive damage but
no injuries.
	   Police are investigating an extremist right-wing group in the
near-fatal beating of a student two weeks ago.
	   In addition to the Tele-Tora television station car, the office
of a right-wing newspaper was firebombed last week. Police believe
the incidents might have occurred in retaliation for the beating.

Eds: RECASTS to ADDS discovery of wreckage, unidentified body
By TIM SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANGROVE SWAMPS NEAR AKOURE, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Mangled body
parts, luggage and personal identity documents were strewn in
wreckage of a small chartered plane carrying the U.N. envoy to
Angola that crashed Friday evening.
	   More than 36 hours after the plane crashed on Friday evening in
a piece of dry land surrounded by expansive mangrove swamps some 35
miles (50 kilometers) east of Ivory Coast's commercial capital of
Abidjan, pieces of the aircraft continued to smolder in grass and
bushes.
	   A party of soldiers and journalists who hacked through miles
(kilometers) of mud, water and thick forest reached the crash site
Sunday afternoon to find bodies mutilated beyond recognition
littered across a 100-meter (yard) area along with the smouldering,
battered remains of the aircraft.
	   Six personal identity documents were discovered, including one
belonging to United Nations special envoy to Angola, 59-year-old
Alioune Blondin Beye.
	   The other five documents bore the names of Senegalese journalist
Moktar Gueye, Chad national Beadegar Dessandde, Togolese foreign
ministry official Koffi Adoyi and two people of unidentified
nationality _ Jason McNeill and Ibikunle Williams.
	   There was no sign of survivors.
	   There was a discrepancy over the number of people on board _
Ivorian officials said either seven or eight, while Togolese
officials said seven. One Portugese national and two South African
pilots were reported to be among those on board.
	   The plane itself was broken into two large crushed and mangled
pieces _ one apparently the tail _ and many smaller broken parts.
Small fires still smouldered Sunday, long after the crash occured
on Friday evening.
	   Searchers had been prevented from reaching the aircraft on the
first day of the search by poor telephone communications and
difficulties in finding their way the dense forests and marshlands.
	   An initial party of French and Ivory Coast soldiers were
airdropped by a helicopter on Sunday morning and several ground
search parties _ including a number of journalists _ slogged
through the swamps with the help of villagers with machetes and
chainsaws, at times wading through waist-high water.
	   U.N. aviation experts had been expected to join the search, but
had not yet arrived, Ivorian civil aviation officials said Sunday
morning.
	   Beye, a well-respected diplomat from Mali, is credited with
leading U.N. peace efforts in Angola, which has suffered an
on-again off-again fighting since civil war began after
independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The plane left Togo's capital of Lome on Friday evening after
Beye met with Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema in a bid to win
support for the Angolan peace process.
	   The aircraft disappeared east of Abidjan's international airport
around 7:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) Friday and search-and-rescue operations
were launched.
	   Local villagers saw a flash in the sky followed by a roar that
some initially thought was a bomb.
	   Beye, 59, threatened to resign last month, saying the government
and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the ``political will'' to
see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   Beye mediated the 1994 peace pact signed in Lusaka. An earlier
peace accord collapsed when UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, rejected its
defeat in the country's first-ever elections and returned to the
bush.
	   Lingering hostility between the government and UNITA has stymied
peace in the southwest African country, and the U.N.'s patience is
growing thin.
	   The U.N. Security Council agreed Wednesday to give UNITA five
more days to comply with terms of the plan.
	   After June 30, the U.N. Security Council will freeze UNITA's
foreign bank accounts and ban its diamond exports unless the
movement relinquishes its central highland strongholds and takes
major steps to demobilize.
	   UNITA criticized the threatened sanctions Friday, calling them
illegal and saying they would jeopardize the peace agreement.
	   The ``troika'' said the international community learned ``with
great shock and deep sadness of the crash'' and praised Beye for
his ``indefatigable efforts'' to obtain lasting peace in Angola.

Netanyahu accused of trying to stall peace process on conference in grafs 3-5, edits to conform throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: MOVES UP specific allegations against Palestinians, Netanyahu
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders and other critics on Sunday
blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for an
international peace conference, accusing him of putting up new
roadblocks to peace.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Netanyahu was
trying to ``escape'' from his commitments, and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said the prime minister was trying ``to torpedo the
peace process.''
	   Netanyahu, however, said the proposal for a European-sponsored
conference to discuss Mideast regional issues _ but not the
Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically _ was intended to
complement the bilateral negotiations, not replace them.
	   He argued that the Palestinians were the ones holding up the
negotiations, claiming they have failed to keep their commitments
to collect weapons, outlaw militant groups, arrest suspects and
complete the repeal of articles in the Palestinian National
Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``This is what is delaying the process, nothing else,'' he said.
	   Asked if an agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank would be reached before the Knesset recesses on July 29,
Netanyahu told Israel Radio, ``I estimate this issue will be
concluded by then.''
	   ``I can't say for sure,'' he added, ``because I can't tell the
Palestinians what to do.''
	   The United States is pushing Israel to accept a U.S. proposal
for turning over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer, but
deadline after unofficial deadline has passed without a response
from Israel.
	   Netanyahu, who faces serious opposition to any withdrawal from
hard-liners in his own Cabinet, in recent weeks flirted with the
possibility of holding a national referendum on any agreement to
shore up support for a withdrawal, but has appeared to back away
from that idea in recent days.
	   His latest suggestion was the international conference to
address regional issues such as water, the environment, and trade.
	   Critics charged that both suggestions were stalling tactics to
avoid moving the peace process forward.
	   ``It is futile for the Palestinians to respond to every new idea
he comes up with, because he does not mean it and does not take it
seriously,'' Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Sunday.
	   ``The only thing he takes seriously is killing the peace
process.''
	   ``I think the prime minister is willing to do everything in
order not to do anything,'' opposition legislator Yossi Beilin said
on Israel Radio. ``He thinks that this is the way to sideline the
political issue at hand _ which is the carrying out of the next
withdrawal.''
	   Even Education Minister Yitzhak Levy, a member of Netanyahu's
governing coalition, questioned the usefulness of holding a
conference now.
	   ``At this moment our goal is to reach the final status agreement
(with the Palestinians) ... and this is what the government should
be working for,'' he said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel had
already made ``sufficient'' compromises to reach agreement on the
West Bank redeployment, and that the few remaining differences on
the size and details of the redeployment could be resolved ``in
very little time.''

Opposition demands government end killing of Maoists rebels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Opposition lawmakers in the Himalayan
kingdom of Nepal slammed the minority government Sunday for the
killings of dozens of anti-monarchy Maoists rebels in a huge police
operation.
	   The minority government of the Nepali Congress has admitted at
least 54 Maoists rebels were killed in the past month in an
operation to flush the rebels out of their jungle hide-outs in the
western part of the country.
	   But the opposition claimed that the figure could be much higher
and demanded that the government make public details of the
operation and casualty figures.
	   Members of the opposition Communist Party of Nepal called the
operation ``government-sponsored terrorism.''
	   ``Dozens of innocent people are being rounded up by police and
shot to death, before they can be tried,'' communist lawmaker Devi
Ojha said. ``We condemn the killings and demand an immediate end to
the operation.''
	   Nearly 1,500 policemen are combing 10 insurgency-hit districts,
located 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Katmandu, the Nepalese
capital, a government minister said earlier this month.
	   The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional monarchy and demand
that the Himalayan state be turned into a republic. More than 200
people have been killed since the insurgency began two years ago.

South African Central Bank chief optimistic depite rand's plunge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The head of South Africa's central
bank expressed optimism Sunday that the rand would recover after
recording its biggest single-day drop two days earlier.
	   South African Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals told Dow Jones
Newswires that he believed currency speculators pushed up the
dollar exchange rate on Friday, when the rand plunged 6.3 percent
against the dollar. In late trading, it was quoted at 5.87 rands
per dollar.
	   Coming amid Asia's financial crisis, there South Africa's
financial sector is nervous. The Sunday Independent, a Johannesburg
weekly, carried the headline ``How Japan could sink South Africa.''
The article said that if Japan fails to strenghten the yen,
emerging markets like South Africa's will suffer, with the local
economy possibly falling into recession.
	   Stals predicted the dollar-rand exchange rate ``will settle down
again on Monday.''
	   Stals and Finance Minister Trevor Manuel were to discuss the
rand crisis by telephone later Sunday and were expected to meet
early in the week to coordinate monetary and fiscal policy
measures.
	   Analysts say the monetary crisis should lead President Nelson
Mandela's government to tighten fiscal policies, accelerate
privatization and liberalize labor markets.

World Cup: France-Paraguay 0-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Thierry Henry hit the post and Jose Luis
Chilavert made a finger-tip save from Bernard Diomede as host
France was held to 0-0 at halftime of their World Cup second round
game with Paraguay Sunday.
	   The French forwards, who have scored nine goals in three Group C
games to reach the last 16, missed the target twice more as they
went in search of a quarterfinal place.
	   But Paraguay survived until the interval and broke out to create
one chance saved by French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez from Jose
Cardozo.
	   Monaco striker David Trezeguet went close to firing the French
ahead in the 14th minute with a curling right footer from the edge
of the area which hit the side netting.
	   Two minutes later, Diomede took a pass from Thierry Henry and
fired a left-foot shot which the diving Chilavert finger-tipped
round the post.
	   The French continued to set up shooting chances around the edge
of Paraguay's area and Youri Djorkaeff shaved Chilavert's left hand
post with a 20-meter drive with the 'keeper scrambling across goal.
	   Diomede had a chance to shoot the host ahead in the 37th minute
after a slick break by Emmanuel Petit down the left opened up the
Paraguayan defense. Petit pulled the ball sideways to the forward
who completely mistimed his shot and the ball rolled harmlessly
wide.
	   Cardozo reminded the French there was another attack in the game
when he took a well-timed pass from Miguel Benitez to get through
the home defense but fired straight at 'keeper Barthez.
	   At the other end, Henry got clear of Paraguay's defense and had
only Chilavert to beat. The experienced 'keeper raced off his line
and, although he was beaten by Henry's chip past him, the ball hit
the post.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff,
Emmanuel Petit; Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede.
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce, Carlos Gamarra,
Celso Ayala, Pedro Sarabia; Roberto Acuna, Carlos Parades, Julio
Cesar Enciso, Miguel Benitez; Jorge Campos, Jose Cardozo.
	   Referee: Mohamed Ali Bujsaim, United Arab Emirates.

World Cup: Hoddle seeks to make up for 12-year-old error against Argentina 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ England has the opportunity to right a
12-year wrong by overcoming Argentina in their World Cup second
round clash in Saint-Etienne, coach Glenn Hoddle said Sunday.
	   The winner will go into the quarterfinals, but for England
manager Glenn Hoddle there is an extra incentive _ justice.
	   Hoddle was a member of the team on the receiving end of
Maradona's infamous ``Hand of God goal'' in the quarterfinals of
the 1986 Mexico World Cup. Maradona palmed the ball into the net as
Argentina edged England 2-1 and went on to capture the trophy.
	   The 1986 incident was still on Hoddle's mind Sunday as his
22-strong squad all reported fit for training and ready to face the
South Americans.
	   Hoddle vividly recalled how Maradona turned the game with his
sleight of hand before adding a spectacular second goal almost
immediately after.
	   ``It was a tight game until that handball which turned the
situation completely,'' Hoddle said. He claimed England was still
unsettled by the incident when Maradona struck again.
	   ``That second goal, which was a fantastic goal, would never have
been scored if it was 0-0, but that was the sickening blow we had
to take on the day. This game now has given us a chance to address
the balance,'' he noted.
	   Defeating Argentina would also exorcise a personal ghost for the
English coach. It was Hoddle who lost the ball to Maradona leading
to the second goal.
	   Now, 12 years later, he has the chance to win back possession of
the ball.
	   But Hoddle stresses he is looking for justice, not revenge.
	   ``I am the only one here in our party who was involved on the
pitch and that feeling of injustice has stayed with us a long time
... we have got a chance of readdresing that balance and turning
that result around and getting it out of our system,'' he said.
	   ``There is nothing more important than getting through to the
next round, but life comes round in a circle some times,'' he said.
	   Hoddle said no member of the 1986 team felt bitter towards
Maradona, who went on to play in two more World Cup finals.
	   ``The officials were the problem on that day. No one blamed
Maradona from inside the camp. At the end of the day, he did what
he did.''
	   Hoddle even hailed Maradona as the greatest player ever, even
better than Brazil's Pele.
	   ``Pele was probably a better team player, but I think Maradona
was a better individual talent than anyone who has played football
on this planet,'' he said.
	   Looking ahead to Tuesday's match, Hoddle said he was glad
England were the underdogs. Although Argentina won all three Group
H games without conceding a goal, he preferred the South Americans
as England's opponents rather than Croatia, who finished second in
the Group.
	   England would have met Croatia if it had headed Group G instead
of losing to Romania who finished top.
	   ``In many ways, we are stronger when we have got our backs to
the wall a little bit, psychologically that suits us rather than
the other way around,'' he said.

Meeting between pope and patriarch unlikely 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A meeting between Patriarch Alexy II, the head of
the Russian Orthodox Church, and Pope John Paul II is unlikely to
take place soon, a Vatican official said Sunday.
	   Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the Vatican's foreign minister,
said after meeting with Alexy that there had been some progress on
dialogue between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox churches,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``I find it very timely because the progress will benefit both
sides,'' Tauran said.
	   He told a news conference said that a meeting between the two
church leaders was possible in principle, but ``they are unlikely
to meet in the near future.''
	   The Russian Orthodox Church considers the activities of the
Roman Catholic clergy in Russia as proselytism and differences
between the two churches caused the cancellation of planned meeting
in Austria last year.
	   It would have been the first meeting between the pope and a
Russian patriarch since the Great Schism of 1054 divided Christians
into the Catholic and Orthodox churches.
	   Tauran is on a three-day visit to Moscow and was scheduled to
hold talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and various
Catholic bishops. He will also attend the opening of a new Vatican
building in the city.

British rugby nightmare not over yet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British rugby union teams have suffered their
worst test defeats on record this summer but the nightmare is not
over yet.
	   England, which started its southern hemisphere campaign with a
record 76-0 test drubbing by Australia, left New Zealand Sunday
enroute to South Africa after two further test losses.
	   The England team is more depleted now than it was when it left a
dozen test players at home but faces a Springboks team fresh from a
96-13 win over Wales.
	   England's first loss to Australia was ominous for Scotland,
Wales and Ireland _ all touring the Southern Hemisphere with
depleted squads _ but Wales' loss was a national disgrace.
	   The 96-13 loss was the worst defeat ever suffered by one of the
eight major rugby playing nations of the world.
	   The 15 tries Wales conceded was another record worst, as was the
83 point losing margin _ both surpassing the 12 try 63_6 demolition
of Wales by Australia in 1991.
	   Wales coach Dennis John says he wants to keep his job as Welsh
officials comb the southern hemisphere in search of a replacement,
while England boss Clive Woodward says this tour is no more than a
build-up to the 1999 World Cup.
	   Recapping some of the ``lowlights'' gives a good example of the
ground England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland have to make up before
the World Cup.
	   Despite more promising recent performances by England, in a
40-10 loss to the All Blacks, and Scotland, a 33-11 loss to
Australia, the combined tours performance record is ten tests
played for one win.
	   Wales beat Zimbabwe 49-11 in Harare on June 6, while Scotland's
51-26 loss to Fiji in Suva was a test the Scots would have banked
on winning.
	   The match statistics revealed the teams have suffered an average
test loss of 49-15, having conceded 486 points while scoring just
147.
	   So what now for rugby in the ``home countries'' _ at least the
summer tours will soon come to an end. Then Australia, New Zealand
and South Africa will attempt to take each other apart in the
Tri-Nations series.

World Cup: France's heart of soccer can't help bleeding a bit 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ The heart of French soccer beat to a
delirious pulse Sunday, here in this former mining town with a
downtown stadium that seats more people than its entire population.
	   France vs. Paraguay was on at the Felix Bollaert Stadium and
after one long, dangerous week of living among English hooligan and
German neo-Nazis, finally the locals could show their true spirit _
the most passionate and knowledgeable fans of France.
	   Yet even on a sunny day like this with Les Bleus in town, the
city's heart bled just a bit. Even though Racing Lens became French
club champion against all the odds, none of its players was deemed
worthy of a place on the French squad of 22.
	   That didn't stop the town from partying after the hooligans
overshadowed its beloved game for days. After a jubiliant spring
when every shop and home was draped in their team's
``Blood-and-Gold'' colors, the town dressed up in the French
tricolor.
	   ``Today we can truly be here for France,'' said Lens fan Xavier
Geneau. ``We've had an awful lot of damage, now we can be happy.
	   The ``Jour de Gloire'' had truly arrived, as La Marseillaise was
sung at full blast by 41,000 voices, counting a smattering of
Paraguayans. Lens' population is no more than 35,000.
	   Frenchmen spilled into Lens' compact city center from every
corner of the country. Some dressed up as French roosters and
others as cartoon characters Asterix and Obelix, those famed Gallic
warriors who kept the Romans at bay.
	   Locals peeled back the tops of little humpbacked Renault 2CVs.
Youngsters waving the flag led impromptu parades down streets where
beer, blood and thugs' abuse had mingled just a few days earlier.
	   Nicolas Brancourt, a weekend referee, dressed up as the beefy
Obelix. He kept shouting, ``Chilavert, I'll eat him alive,''
referring to the hulking goalie who embodies the Paraguay team.
	   Brancourt served up generous portions of prune liquor,
``France's magic potion,'' to anyone who would have some. Brothers
in arms held liter mugs of beer, yet somehow the stew of male
hormones and alcohol only yielded good cheer.
	   At her Cafe de Paris, bathed in friendly afternoon sun, Estelle
Carlu offered up her thanks. ``This is deliverance for us,'' she
said. ``A few days ago, the gendarmerie had to come in to
physically pull away English hooligans who were clutching my beer
tabs.''
	   The only shadow over the game was that no Lens local was dressed
in blue on the pitch.
	   After an incredible run to win the championship, fans had hoped
to see at least two included in Aime Jacquet's squad. No luck, and
a sense of us-against-them briefly raised its head.
	   ``We're just a region of miners,'' said Geneau, reflecting a
popular feeling here that Lens players could not match up against
the high-priced teams of Paris, Marseille and Monaco.
	   Brancourt said the costly tickets and fancy events of the World
Cup were out of reach for a lot of true lovers of the game here.
``Most workers here just don't the money for that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Tribal drummers and dancers greeted
French President Jacques Chirac as he arrived Sunday in this former
Portuguese colony _ the first French president to ever do so.
	   The four-nation, six-day tour marks a departure in Paris' policy
toward Africa. After focusing for decades on French-speaking
Africa, Chirac himself announced last year France would curtail its
military interventions _ and expenditures _ in that region and
reach out to other parts of the continent.
	   Earlier Sunday, Chirac was in South Africa, the key stop on a
trip aimed at bringing closer political and economic ties. A
delegation of about 50 top French business executives are with
Chirac.
	   Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano greeted them on the
airport tarmac as drummers beat a lively tattoo and children danced
and sang. Artillery pieces fired off a 21-gun salute.
	   Chirac was to meet with Chissano at his residence and attend a
state banquet. He will also meet with political opposition figures
before departing for Angola on Monday, the final stop on the trip
that also took him to Namibia.
	   Earlier Sunday, in South Africa's wine region, Chirac awarded
retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu one of France's highest
awards for his anti-apartheid activities.
	   ``I salute in you a man who brought the message of the gospels
to the heart of action, a man who was and is the conscience and
inspiration of South
	   Africa,'' Chirac told Tutu.
	   Chirac pinned a silver star with a red ribbon on Tutu's lapel,
making him a grand officer of the Legion of Honor, France's highest
award to non-heads of state.
	   Tutu, who had led protests against apartheid which ended with
South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, said the struggle
had been inspired by the French revolution.
	   The ceremony was held in a winery northeast of Cape Town. The
two then sat down to lunch with other guests at the winery, set
amid rolling hills near the town of Stellenbosch.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, meanwhile, went to
Franschoek, a town near Stellenbosch settled in the 17th century by
French protestants fleeing Catholic persecution. Vedrine signed a
125 million rand (dlrs 21 million) loan to the Development Bank of
Southern Africa with objective of funding infrastructure projects
for disadvangtaged communities.

World Cup: Germans oozing confidence before Mexico 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: REPEATING to RESTORE ``BC'' to slug.
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Juergen Klinsmann was so confident, he
sounded even cocky. The message, basically, was: Mexico, start
packing your bags.
	   ``If we move up a gear and if we win one-on-ones, then I'd like
to see that team that's going to beat us,'' Klinsmann said Sunday,
before the Germans flew from Nice to Montpellier to face Mexico in
the second round Monday.
	   But the Mexicans did not seem overly impressed by their
opponents' performance so far.
	   ``I'm glad we're playing the so-called greats. We're not afraid
of them. On the contrary, we look forward to the game,'' midfielder
Jesus Arellano said. ``Germany is one of the big ones, but we know
we can beat them.''
	   ``When it comes to all or nothing, we can always show our
qualities,'' Klinsmann said.
	   Strong words from the captain of the German team that has
plodded into the second round, playing some of the dullest soccer
of all 16 qualifiers for the second round. But the European
champion did win its group and the Germans grow as the tournament
gets longer.
	   ``One or two things are not working so well,'' coach Berti Vogts
said. ``We have to come better over the flanks and our midfield is
not working well.''
	   The German team's game depends on high crosses for Klinsmann and
Oliver Bierhoff to head into the net. And although the Germans have
not shined, both strikers have two goals apiece already.
	   ``Our defense is playing very well and the strikers are scoring
their goals,'' Vogts said. ``But the midfielders have to provide
more support.''
	   Vogts was a bit more cautious about Mexico than his captain.
	   ``We have been warned. They came back in every game, and they
showed very good morale. I am not surprised. I was sure that
Belgium would not make it,'' Vogts said.
	   Mexico rallied from two-goal deficits against both Belgium and
the Netherlands to earn 2-2 draws. It also beat South Korea 3-1
after falling a goal behind.
	   Klinsmann said his team had respect for Mexico.
	   ``They showed character and will and they have a pair of
decisive players. But ... in difficult situations, we are able to
show our strengths,'' he said. ``In these KO games, there is
nothing to fix any more, if you lose, you go home. Such pressure
situations give us an extra push.''
	   If the Germans haven't been entirely convincing so far, history
speaks for them: three World Cup titles, three more finals.
	   The Germans have played Mexico twice in the World Cup, winning
6-0 in 1978 in Argentina and 4-1 on penalties after a goalless
quarterfinal clash on Mexican soil in 1986.
	   Mexico may be an underdog, but it can only draw inspiration from
its courageous performances.
	   ``We're not thinking about revenge. We want to advance, to see
how far we can go,'' Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente said.
	   ``We respect Germany as a soccer made of strength and power. But
respect does have its limits. We are ready and we'll try everything
to win,'' Lapuente said.
	   Mexico relies on Luis Hernandez, who has been one of the stars
of the tournament with his late-goal heroics _ 3 goals so far _ and
his partner Cuauhtemoc Blanco.
	   Vogts is not expected to make any major change in the lineup
that finished the match against Iran.

World Cup: Chile proud of its first World Cup performance in 16 years 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGIO CARRASCO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Chile ended its first World Cup appearance in 16
years with a lopsided loss to powerhouse Brazil, but returns home
proud of having reached the second round for the first time in more
than three decades.
	   ``We're not happy because we lost,'' head coach Nelson Acosta
said after Saturday's 4-1 loss to the world champions in the group
of 16. ``But if we analyze the job we did in the last month, we
should be happy. We had a great first round.''
	   Indeed. Chile, which hadn't seen World Cup action since the
tournament in Spain in 1982, advanced after drawing 2-2 with Group
B winner Italy. It also recorded 1-1 draws against Austria and
Cameroon.
	   The team could have easily won two of those matches, but gave up
late tallies to the Italians __ who already made it to the
quarter-finals __ and the Austrians. Both ties came during lapses
by the defense, the team's soft spot throughout the 32-team
tournament.
	   The Chilean offense, however, lived up to its billing.
	   Led by the dangerous duo of Ivan Zamorano and Marcelo Salas,
Chile showed it could score with the best and left having tallied
five times in four matches.
	   Salas, constantly fed by a tireless Zamorano, scored twice in
the opener against Italy and ended with four goals, tied with
Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta. Italy's Christian Vieri leads all
scorers with five.
	   But against a Brazilian team not yet playing at full steam,
Chile paid dearly for its wobbly defense and found itself falling
behind 1-0 after 10 minutes and 3-0 by halftime.
	   Cesar Sampaio opened the scoring in Brazil's first real attack
of the game, heading in a Dunga free kick after gliding untouched
through the maze of defenders. Sampaio pounced on a loose ball in
front of the goal and made it 2-0 in the 27th.
	   ``Sampaio's second goal was pure luck, a rebound in the middle
of the area,'' Acosta said.
	   ``But we should keep in mind we played the leading candidate to
win it all and we played them as equals, without resorting to dirty
tricks,'' he said.
	   Salas scored the Chilean goal in the second half, heading in a
rebound of a header by Zamorano.
	   ``I'm happy to have scored against Brazil, but also sad because
it wasn't enough to advance,'' Salas said.

Annual Jewish culture festival opens in Poland 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Organizers opened an exhibit of postage
stamps marking the history of Israel on Sunday to launch Poland's
eighth annual Festival of Jewish Culture in Krakow.
	   The traditional inaugural concert took place at the Jagiellonian
University instead of the usual synagogue venue in Krakow's Jewish
quarter of Kazimierz, which is under renovation as part of a
revival of Jewish culture in the city.
	   The festival lasts through July 5 and features concerts, films,
lectures and courses in Jewish dance, music and cuisine. The stamp
exhibit includes hundreds of stamps and postmarks from private
collections in Israel and Poland.
	   U.S. Jewish singers Benzion Miller and Albert Mizrachi will join
the Israel-based Ben Baruch choir for a closing concert July 4 in
the Kazimierz central square.
	   Kazimierz was a center of European Jewry since the end of the
15th century. But only 2,000 of the 70,000 Jews that lived there
survived the Holocaust.
	   Some 20,000 Jews live in Poland now, a fraction of the pre-war
community of 3.5 million.

Another hardliner chosen to replace Bosnian Serb party leader 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The largest Bosnian Serb
political party has elected a new hardline leader following the
party president's resignation, the Bosnian Serb news agency said
Sunday.
	   Dragan Kalinic, a former parliament speaker in the Serb substate
within Bosnia, will take the helm for the hardline Serb Democratic
Party following the resignation Saturday of Aleksa Buha.
	   The party originally was led by Radovan Karadzic, who led the
1992 Serb rebellion against Bosnia's independence from Yugoslavia.
He was ousted from the position after being indicted for war
crimes.
	   There have been growing signs of disunity among party leaders
since the group lost to a coalition of moderate Bosnian Serbs in
internationally supervised elections last year. The moderates
organized Kalinic's ouster from the speaker's post earlier this
month.

Report: Iraq allows PKK to open offices in Baghdad 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 5th graf to DELETE extraneous phrase.
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has allowed a Turkish Kurdish rebel
group regarded by U.S. officials as a terrorist organization to
open offices in Baghdad, an Arabic newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The London-based Al-Hayat, quoting Kurdish sources in northern
Iraq, also said that Iraq has started providing the Kurdistan
Workers Party with weapons and logistical support.
	   It said two other offices for the PKK, which is fighting for
autonomy from Turkey, were opened in the northern cities of Mosul
and Kirkuk, which are under Baghdad's control.
	   Iraq also urged the two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling the
north, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, to allow the PKK to operate in their areas
bordering Turkey.
	   Al-Hayat's report was confirmed by Kurdish officials in northern
Iraq. The move could bolster the group's campaign against the
Turkish army, which started in 1984.
	   Both Syria and Iran, which border Turkey, are believed to
provide the PKK with similar facilities.
	   The PKK has in the past taken refuge in northern Iraq, and
Turkish troops have crossed over into northern Iraq several times
in the last few years to fight the Kurds.
	   Last month, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported
that Iraq agreed to grant asylum to 6,800 Turkish Kurdish refugees
stranded on the line dividing government-held areas from regions
controlled by Iraqi Kurds in the north.
	   The United States and many European countries consider the PKK a
terrorist organization.

Fighting spreads in Guinea-Bissau amid new diplomacy efforts 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Fighting spread over the weekend
from Guinea-Bissau's capital to the central town of Mansoa as the
foreign ministers of Portugal and Angola joined efforts to
negotiate peace in the tiny West African country.
	   Portuguese foreign minister Jaime Gama and his Angolan
counterpart, Carlos Correia, met Sunday morning in a joint
mediating effort with Guinea-Bissau's Prime Minister Carlos Correia
among other government officials, a foreign diplomat said on
condition of anonymity.
	   The talks occurred less than a day after the two ministers met
Guinea-Bissau rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane, an unidentified
official told the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   ``The two ministers are analyzing the situation in
Guinea-Bissau,'' the official was quoted as saying. ``They will
pursue their contacts to try to obtain a platform of understanding
between the opposed parties.''
	   Earlier mediation efforts involving church leaders and a Gambian
envoy had failed to bring the side together in talks.
	   The latest peace efforts came as fighting, which has until now
raged mainly around the capital, erupted in Mansoa where Senegalese
troops fighting on behalf of Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo
Vieira were holding a primary road junction linking a key rebel
base with the country's eastern interior.
	   Bursts of machine gun fire crackled through the air Sunday as
soldiers loyal to the country's breakaway military fought to retake
the position.
	   On Friday, two truck loads of Senegalese troops were seen
rumbling down a main highway toward Mansoa. They were coming from
the direction of the northern border.
	   Mansoa, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the capital, is
overflowing with refugees who fled Bissau shortly after Mane
mounted a coup attempt against Vieira earlier this month.
	   The rebels insist Vieira's government was rife with corruption.
	   ``What we're doing here is looking for democracy, real democracy
not the kind of democracy that is of one man,'' said rebel Col.
Viricino Ceabra.
	   Vieria, the elected president, has called Mane an outlaw.
	   As many as 300,000 people fled Bissau in the first few days
after the coup attempt was launched, with the vast majority heading
to Mansoa, Bafata and Canchungo. Virtually the entire expatriate
community, including diplomats, left Bissau by evacuation boats.
	   Unable to wrest control of the government from Vieira, the
rebellion has degenerated into near civil war with loyalist troops
and their Senegalese allies trading daily artillery rounds with the
breakaway rebels in and around Bissau.
	   Aid workers on Sunday warned that the main roads north of Bissau
_ previously safe for refugee traffic _ were becoming risky for
travel.
	   A representative from Doctors Without Borders said there was a
growing danger of being caught in fighting.
	   On Saturday, breakaway soldiers executed an army base commander
in Bafata, as the rebels maneuvered to ensure loyalty to their
cause.
	   The commander was shot to death when he failed to pledge support
to Mane's rebellion.
	   Guinea-Bissau's army is split between troops aligned with Vieira
and those following Mane.
	   About half of the 200 soldiers at the Bafata base sided with
Mane, while the other half were apparently neutral, the rebel
officer said. The commander was reportedly trying to convince the
neutral troops to side with Vieira.
	   Bafata is about 140 kilometers (85 miles) northeast of Bissau,
the embattled capital of the West African country.
	   Loyalist forces control the city center, while the rebels are
dug in around the airport and a key military garrison on the city's
northern limits.
	   Vieira, encamped in Bissau, is relying on the support of troops
from neighboring Senegal and the Republic of Guinea.

	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Croatia may throw a fresh forward into its
second-round game against Romania, coach Miroslav Blazevic said
Sunday.
	   He said he had not ruled out starting with Valencia's Goran
Vlaovic, a substitute who had Croatia's closest shot _ a long drive
that hit the post _ in Friday's 1-0 loss to Argentina.
	   Croatia has to fill the hole left by the suspension of sweeper
Zvonimir Soldo, who received his second yellow card of the
tournament against Argentina.
	   Blazevic gave Soldo's spot to Igor Stimac of Derby County,
another veteran defender, but left the final lineup open Sunday.
	   ``Missing Soldo will be a handicap, but it's not such a problem.
Stimac will replace him well,'' defender Slaven Bilic said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain is in the grip of World Cup fever, which
seems to extend to the Royal Family.
	   Prince Charles and his son Prince Harry, 13, attended England's
2-0 win over Colombia in Lens on Friday.
	   Prince Charles, heir to the throne, sent a message of
congratulations to the England squad Saturday, saying how much he
and Prince Harry had enjoyed the game.
	   A senior member of the Royal Family will attend England's
knock-out match against Argentina at Saint-Etienne on Tuesday, and
Queen Elizabeth II will attend the final if England qualifies.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ British bookmakers Ladbrokes have slashed Brazil
to 5-2 favorites to win the World Cup after the 1994 champions
qualified for the quarterfinals.
	   The Brazilians routed Chile 4-1 on Saturday to advance into the
final eight and the odds on the South American's winning the
tournament was instantly cut from 3-1 to 5-2.
	   Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said Sunday that 5-2 was the
shortest price on Brazil since they won the trophy in 1994 and were
without doubt the team to beat.
	   France is rated a 9-2 chance, while Argentina, Italy and the
Netherlands are all 6-1.
	   Germany has odds of 7-1, England 10-1 and then Croatia, Romania
and Nigeria at 25-1.

Israeli court orders release of Lebanese detainee 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a tightly guarded hearing, the Tel Aviv
District Court on Sunday ordered the release of a Lebanese civilian
detained in Israel without trial for more than 10 years.
	   Ghassan Dirani's release was delayed for 30 days, however, to
give the state time to appeal.
	   Dirani is the nephew of Mustafa Dirani, a leader of Hezbollah,
an Iranian-backed group waging a guerrilla war against Israeli
soldiers and their Lebanese allies in south Lebanon.
	   Mustafa Dirani has also been held in Israel without trial since
he was kidnapped by Israeli commandos in 1994, reportedly in order
to question him about the fate of Ron Arad, the Israeli airman
captured by guerrillas when his plane was shot down over Lebanon.
	   Mustafa Dirani was present at Sunday's hearing, which was held
behind closed doors. Also present was Hezbollah commander Sheik
Abdel-Karim Obeid, who was kidnapped by Israeli commandos in 1989.
	   Sunday's ruling marked the second time the court had ordered
Ghassan Dirani's release. The previous decision, handed down a year
ago, was overturned on appeal, Israel Radio said.
	   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said
in a report last year that Ghassan Dirani is in poor physical and
mental health.
	   The court's latest ruling came four days after Israel and its
south Lebanese allies released 60 Lebanese detainees in exchange
for the remains of an Israeli commando killed nine months ago in
Lebanon.

Another hardliner chosen to replace Bosnian Serb party leader 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The largest Bosnian Serb
political party has elected a new hardline leader following the
party president's resignation, the Bosnian Serb news agency said
Sunday.
	   Dragan Kalinic, a former parliament speaker in the Serb state
within Bosnia, will take the helm for the hardline Serb Democratic
Party following the resignation Saturday of Aleksa Buha.
	   The party originally was led by Radovan Karadzic, who led the
1992 Serb rebellion against Bosnia's independence from Yugoslavia.
He was ousted from the position after being indicted for war
crimes.
	   There have been growing signs of disunity among party leaders
since the group lost to a coalition of moderate Bosnian Serbs in
internationally supervised elections last year. The moderates
organized Kalinic's ouster from the speaker's post earlier this
month.

World Cup: Young Croatia seizes chance to push patriotism 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ A young nation in its first World Cup,
Croatia is showcasing not only its soccer but also the nationalist
pride that fueled its war of independence from Yugoslavia a few
years ago.
	   With a coach who lauds his team as the best and team jerseys
sporting a red-and-white checkerboard design used by a pro-Nazi
regime during World War II, the Croatians are advertising their new
identity as well as their government's ambiguous relationship with
the past.
	   ``Sure, the World Cup is publicity for our country,'' said
defender Zvonimir Soldo.
	   That national mission has produced some unusual antics. After a
game against Japan, the team filed a protest with FIFA, soccer's
governing body, because the translator at the post-match news
conference was a Serb.
	   To top it off, Croatia complained that the band played its
national anthem too slowly before the match.
	   And the official team guide proudly lists matches played by the
national team from 1941 to 1945, while Croatia's the Nazi-backed
regime was killing tens of thousands of Jews, Serbs, Gypsies and
others it considered enemies.
	   The same guide touts the small southeastern European country of
4 million people as ``a gift from heaven'' because of the natural
beauty of its Adriatic coast.
	   Beyond the official line, the players and coach Miroslav
Blazevic try to focus on soccer. Croatia plays Romania on Tuesday
for a spot in the quarterfinals.
	   Even Blazevic, a soft-spoken chain smoker who wants his team to
win ``the fight'' on the soccer field and is considered close to
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, was embarrassed when Croatian
diplomats tried to stop the Serb translator.
	   ``It was clumsy,'' said Blazevic.
	   Croats and Serbs speak the same language _ known as
Serbo-Croatian in the old Yugoslav federation that broke up in war
in 1991 _ although with slightly differing regional accents. Now,
Croats view the Serb accent as an offensive reminder of past
domination from Belgrade.
	   But defender Slaven Bilic, who like most Croatian players earns
his money with a foreign club, says the Croatian team is tired of
being identified with Balkan extreme nationalism.
	   ``The pride is still there, but now we are proud like, say,
English players are proud to be English,'' said Bilic, who plays
for Everton. ``Maybe the motivation is actually better, because we
can concentrate on football.''
	   Team captain Zvonimir Boban says patriotism peaked with the 1996
European soccer championship, Croatia's first major international
tournament since independence.
	   Boban became a national hero during the breakup of Yugoslavia
when he attacked a policeman when Croatian fans rioted at a May
1990 game between his former club Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star
Belgrade.
	   Nowadays, he's busy trying to keep a lid on hype.
	   ``We are a good national team,'' he says. ``But we are not the
best. If you think you are the best, you win against nobody.''

Torrance triumphs in French Open golf AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN PAGE
<TEXT>
	   GUYANCOURT, France (AP) _ European veteran Sam Torrance scooped
up his 21st tour title in a 28-year career when he birdied the last
two holes to break a logjam at the head of the leader-board and win
the dlrs 800,000 French Open on Sunday.
	   The 44-year-old Scot, who made a last-minute decision to line up
here, fired a final-round, two-under-par 70 to finish 12-under
overall at 276.
	   His dlrs 133,000 victory check, the first he has pocketed since
his British Masters win three years ago, boosts him to 14th in the
European money list and gives an almost certain exemption into this
year's British Open.
	   Torrance shed a tear as he hefted the trophy. ``It was the
emotion of winning again after three years,'' Torrance said.
	   ``But I always knew I'd win again. I'm strong and fit and young
at heart and I may just go on to win a few more. ''
	   Five men were bracketed in the lead at -10 Sunday before
Torrance broke the deadlock with a perfect 7-wood to 30cms (1 foot)
to birdie the 17th.
	   At the par-5 18th, almost a full island-hole, Torrance, needing
a par, hit a clean 8-iron from light rough which bit and held.
	   The Scot two-putted comfortably for victory.
	   Italy's Massimo Florioli and Frenchman Olivier Edmond both fired
final-round 67s to tie second at 278.
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer whose putting let him down in the
stretch carded a 69 and Australian Mathew Goggin had a 70 to join
Florioli and Edmond at 278.
	   All four men won dlrs 53,000.
	   Spain's Pedro Linhart faltered with bogeys at the last two holes
and dropped back to a share of sixth place a further shot back at
279.
	   France's Marc Farry had a 69 to share sixth with Linhart. Both
players dlrs 27,000.
	   Michael Campbell's comeback stalled Sunday when the Maori shot
75 over the 6,510-meter (7,112-yard) National Golf track to drop
back to share of 11th place at 281, five shots off the pace.
	   Campbell picked up dlrs 11,000.
	   Scotland's star Colin Montgomerie, who sank a curving, 65-foot
(20-meter) eagle putt at the 18th, his second of the day, had a 68
to finish 5-under at 283 in 23rd place.
	   The Scot who suffered from jeering galleries at the previous
week's U.S. Open was happier about support he has gained than his
result.
	   ``It's obviously been a disappointing week but I've been
encouraged by the dozens of supportive E-mail messages I've
received, particularly from the States,'' Montgomerie said.
	   ``It shows some people out there really care about golf. ''

World Cup: Depite reaching goal of second round, Norway leaves disappointed AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Norway's big goal was to make the
second round of the World Cup. ``Flonaldo'' and company did, ``but
when you are there you want to go further,'' coach Egil ``Drillo''
Olsen said.
	   Italy was the wall Norway failed to breach for the third time at
a World Cup.
	   A 1-0 loss Saturday in Marseille continued the frustration
against the Azzurri that started in the same town 60 years ago when
Norway was beaten 2-1 and repeated itself in the United States four
years ago 1-0.
	   ``I'm disappointed for several reasons,'' Olsen said. ``We
didn't play up to our limit and I felt if we had done that, we
would have beaten Italy.''
	   Norway's consolation was a 2-1 upset of defending champion
Brazil that not only clinched second place in Group A and a
first-ever second-round berth for the Scandinavian nation, but it
also became the first team in 32 years to defeat Brazil in the
tournament's preliminary round.
	   Frustration started early for the Norwegians, who came into the
tournament ranked fourth in FIFA's monthly rankings and unbeaten in
14 consecutive matches.
	   First, they had to rally from one-goal deficits twice to get a
2-2 draw against Morocco in Montpellier. Then, leading 1-0, Craig
Burley snatched a late equalizer for Scotland in the second game in
Bordeaux.
	   That left the Norwegians in a must-win situation against Brazil,
which already had qualified for the second round before the last
match in Marseille.
	   Tore Andre Flo, nicknamed ``Flonaldo'' after scoring twice in a
4-2 exhibition win over Brazil a year ago in Oslo, again was the
man behind the stunning victory.
	   The tall Chelsea striker, who had not scored in the first two
games, got the Norwegians back into the game by scoring the
equalizer with seven minutes to go.
	   With a minute left, Junior Baiano collided with Flo in the
penalty area, and American referee Esse Baharmast whistled the
foul. Kjetil Rekdal, who scored Norway's only goal in the '94 Cup,
fired it into the left side for the clincher.
	   ``I've never been happier,'' Flo said. ``I won the (European)
Cup Winners' Cup and other prizes, but you just can't compare it
with this.''
	   Olsen agreed.
	   ``It's incredible. I'm amazed at what happened,'' the coach
said.
	   Olsen, a Swede, will retire after the tournament and many of the
Norwegians praised the coach after his final game against Italy.
	   ``Thanks to Drillo's success with the national team a lot of
players got rich contracts with foreign sides and I was one of
them,'' said Flo's older brother Jostein Flo, who played for
Sheffield United before returning home to Norway.
	   Jostein Flo, 33, saw little action in the tournament, but played
a vital role as a late second-half substitute with Norway trailing
the Brazilians 1-0.
	   ``I never complained sitting on the bench,'' he said. ``Drillo
is the man who has helped me during one of the best years in my
career. I have only praise for him. He's such a good coach.''
	   So good that Olsen has been linked to the vacant manager's job
at Glasgow Celtic. But he has made no firm commitments yet.

Ethiopian immigrants protest state-provided education 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ethiopian immigrants held a protest Sunday
accusing the government of forcing its children to attend schools
which provide sub-standard education, and warned that their ancient
community is in danger of unravelling unless the government
intervenes.
	   At a demonstration outside the office of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, elder Ethiopians cloaked in traditional white robes and
youth in jeans and dread locks, warned that if the community's
youth continue to receive educations inferior to their Israeli
peers, crime and social problems would ensue.
	   ``I could be a doctor, a lawyer ... or a criminal,'' read a sign
held by one teen-age demonstrator.
	   Crime and drug use is already on the rise among Ethiopian youth,
community leaders said. To combat the problem, leaders will ask
Netanyahu in a meeting next week to provide after-school and summer
time programming to keep children competitive and off the streets.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel, mostly in isolated
trailer parks with little infrastructure. Many arrived in two
dramatic airlifts in 1985 and 1991.
	   Demonstrators chanting in Hebrew and their native language of
Amharit also called for an end to state-run boarding schools.
	   According Adisso Massala, a legislator of Ethiopian origin, 80
percent of Ethiopian youth over age 13 are separated from their
families and sent to religious boarding schools. The schools were
originally designed to help integrate the newcomers by putting them
together with native Israelis but Massala said Ethiopian children
are the only students at the schools.
	   Tamrat Berhanu, a 25-year-old computer student, said the
boarding schools destroy family life and the rich Ethiopian
culture.
	   ``It's tragic _ kids don't know who they are. They are separated
from both their families and their culture and they fall between
the cracks,'' Berhanu said.

Schumacher wins French Grand Prix, 2nd Ld Writethru 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional; Updates with more details, quotes

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) - It's been a long time since the
prancing stallions ran so well.
	   Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine went 1-2 for Ferrari at the
French Grand Prix Sunday, the first time since 1990 for the proud
Italian team with the red cars with the famed black horse as its
symbol.
	   Ferrari now has won 116 Grand Prix races, most in the history of
Formula One although it has been stumbling over the past few years
as Mclaren moved up with 112 victories.
	   Since the Canadian Grand Prix victory three weeks ago,
Schumacher has been making statements that the Ferraris have closed
the gap on the McLaren-Mercedes of Mika Hakkinen and David
Coulthard, which dominated the early season in Formula One.
	   Now he has the 1-2 finish to back up his words.
	   ``It's hard work, many nights and night shifts that the team
provided what we had here this week,'' Schumacher said. ``They
really pushed hard to make it for us and we are here.''
	   Irvine acting as a buffer between Schumacher and Hakkinen, came
in second, 19.5 seconds behind.
	   ``We've had a couple 1-3s but to come in 1-2 is pretty
awesome,'' Irvine said.
	   A frustrated Hakkinen was third, barely behind Irvine after
trying to pass him for the last 15 laps of the race.
	   It was the first 1-2 finish for Ferrari since the Spanish Grand
Prix in 1990 when Alan Prost and Nigel Mansell took the top two
slots for the red cars.
	   Sunday, Schumacher took advantage of a race re-start to win and
close withing six points of Hakkinen entering the second half of
the season. Hakkinen still leads the drivers standings with 50
points but Schumacher moved up to 44.
	   It was Schumacher's 30th career victory and third this season.
He also has won the French Grand Prix four of the last five times.
He missed out in 1996 when he car's engine failed on the warm-up
lap after leading qualifying.
	   The race had to begin twice. The first time Jos Verstappen, who
had replaced Jan Magnussen at Stewart-Ford this week, stalled out
just before the start as the rest of the field roared away.
Hakkinen had the lead but the race was stopped barely into the
first lap.
	   On the re-start Schumacher and Irvine pulled ahead of Hakkinen
on the first turn, a perfect start for the Ferraris.
	   ``I thought I had a good start and then when I saw Eddie in
second I thought that's the scenario I'd like to have,'' Schumacher
said.
	   Schumacher pulled away from his teammate Irvine who forced the
McLarens to lap about a second slower than Schumacher in the early
stages.
	   ``I didn't want to push too hard,'' Irvine said.
	   Schumacher's lead was up to 11 seconds by the end of 10 laps and
leveled to about 13 seconds after 15.
	   Meanwhile Hakkinen continued to pressure Irvine and took his
chance with an inside move on a curve on the 20th lap. He had
passed Irvine but couldn't hold the line and spun out. He got back
on track quickly but lost more than four seconds.
	   ``He was slow on entering the corners and gave me opportunity to
overtake him,'' said Hakkinen. ``I tried once, the corner was too
tight to take it at that speed.''
	   He made a pit stop soon after to change tires and get fuel but
Schumacher followed, now with a comfortable margin over Hakkinen.
	   It stayed that way through the second pits stops with Schumacher
never really challenged the rest of the way.
	   Hakkinen held off pitting again until 54 laps and wound up
behind Irvine again. Hakkinen kept looking for an opening but
Irvine kept closing the door.
	   Hakkinen said he didn't want to risk anything.
	   ``I think you have to be fair out there and cannot bang someone
into the grass. It would be easy to do and one of us would go off,
either Eddie or me,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Hakkinen took one final chance when Irvine missed a gearchange
on the final turn of the last lap.
	   It became a drag race down the final straightaway with Irvine
holding off Hakkinen.
	   Still Irvine held off Hakkinen for the Ferrari 1-2.
	   Schumacher did 1 hour, 34 minutes, 45.026 seconds for the 71
laps of the 4.25-kilometer (2.641-mile) Magny Cours circuit. He
averaged 190.963 kph (118.864 mph) for the 301.75 kilometers (187.5
miles).
	   Jacques Villeneuve, last year's Formula One champion, was fourth
in Williams-Mecachrome. Villeneuve beat Schumacher for the title in
the last race of the 1997 season after a dramatic collision forced
Schumacher out of the race.
	   Alexander Wurz of Austria was in fifth with a Benetton-Playlife
followed by Coulthard, plagued by problems fueling in the pits, in
sixth.
	   The French Grand Prix was the eighth race of the Formula One
series and began a hectic period with three more races over the
next five weeks.
	   The next race is the British Grand Prix July 12.

Annan says NATO action in Kosovo needs U.N. backing 
</HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ NATO would set ``a dangerous precedent'' if it
took military action in Kosovo without U.N. Security Council
approval, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said in an interview
broadcast Sunday.
	   ``If NATO were to go in without Council approval ... who else
are they going to discipline tomorrow?,'' he asked. ``How could
they tell other regions or other governments not to do the same
thing without Council approval?''
	   Asked by London Weekend Television interviewer Jonathan Dimbleby
whether he was saying it would be ``a license for military anarchy
in effect,'' Annan replied: ``Absolutely.''
	   The Clinton administration takes the position that a new
Security Council resolution is not required to take military action
in Kosovo, where fighting has escalated between ethnic Albanian
militants and Serb security forces. More than 300 people have been
killed and thousands have fled their homes in the Serbian province
since March.
	   Britain, a close U.S. ally in the Balkans, shares Annan's view
about the need for a resolution. But Washington fears it would be
vetoed by Russia, which has historic and cultural ties to the Serbs
in Yugoslavia.
	   The Clinton Administration also fears that acknowledging the
need for a resolution could lead to criticism from congressional
conservatives that the White House would be conceding that Moscow
has a veto over NATO action.
	   While stressing that all use of military power by regional
groups should be sanctioned by the United Nations, Annan said, ``I
hope that no country would withhold its consent unreasonably if the
situation is going to explode without our intervention.''
	   The secretary general said he is very worried that the situation
in Kosovo could explode and spill over into a wider Balkans
conflict.
	   He said he has been in touch with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
the newly designated U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who
completed a four-day mission to Kosovo Friday without securing a
cease-fire.
	   ``We are at a very critical stage and he indicated that there
are two or three flashpoints (which) if not handled properly ...
and not defused could get out of hand _ and he's worried that the
situation could explode. But he's doing his best to try to contain
it,'' Annan said.
	   The Contact Group of six key nations, including the United
States and Russia, is trying to get all parties to the negotiating
table, ``and I hope that will succeed with the military pressure
from NATO,'' he said.
	   While militant Albanian fighters in the Kosovo Liberation Army
and their supporters are demanding independence for Kosovo, Annan
said ``no one is supporting them for that.''

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Rescuers on Sunday pulled a boy alive from
the rubble of a quake that struck southern Turkey a day earlier,
killing at least 112 people and leveling much of this city and
other towns.
	   More than 1,000 people were injured, and tens of thousands fled
this city rattled by scores of aftershocks.
	   Rescuers pulled the 11-year-old survivor from the debris of a
flattened five-story building 24 hours after the earthquake.
	   Health teams checked his pulse as he was put into an ambulance
after rescuers cleared away stones which had pinned him down.
	   The boy appeared tired as he watched an applauding crowd.
Rescuers were still searching for his mother, grandparents and two
teenage brothers.

World Cup: Young Croatia seizes chance to push patriotism 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: REPHRASES 15th graf to clarify 1990 incident
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ A young nation in its first World Cup,
Croatia is showcasing not only its soccer but also the nationalist
pride that fueled its war of independence from Yugoslavia a few
years ago.
	   With a coach who lauds his team as the best and team jerseys
sporting a red-and-white checkerboard design used by a pro-Nazi
regime during World War II, the Croatians are advertising their new
identity as well as their government's ambiguous relationship with
the past.
	   ``Sure, the World Cup is publicity for our country,'' said
defender Zvonimir Soldo.
	   That national mission has produced some unusual antics. After a
game against Japan, the team filed a protest with FIFA, soccer's
governing body, because the translator at the post-match news
conference was a Serb.
	   To top it off, Croatia complained that the band played its
national anthem too slowly before the match.
	   And the official team guide proudly lists matches played by the
national team from 1941 to 1945, while Croatia's the Nazi-backed
regime was killing tens of thousands of Jews, Serbs, Gypsies and
others it considered enemies.
	   The same guide touts the small southeastern European country of
4 million people as ``a gift from heaven'' because of the natural
beauty of its Adriatic coast.
	   Beyond the official line, the players and coach Miroslav
Blazevic try to focus on soccer. Croatia plays Romania on Tuesday
for a spot in the quarterfinals.
	   Even Blazevic, a soft-spoken chain smoker who wants his team to
win ``the fight'' on the soccer field and is considered close to
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, was embarrassed when Croatian
diplomats tried to stop the Serb translator.
	   ``It was clumsy,'' said Blazevic.
	   Croats and Serbs speak the same language _ known as
Serbo-Croatian in the old Yugoslav federation that broke up in war
in 1991 _ although with slightly differing regional accents. Now,
Croats view the Serb accent as an offensive reminder of past
domination from Belgrade.
	   But defender Slaven Bilic, who like most Croatian players earns
his money with a foreign club, says the Croatian team is tired of
being identified with Balkan extreme nationalism.
	   ``The pride is still there, but now we are proud like, say,
English players are proud to be English,'' said Bilic, who plays
for Everton. ``Maybe the motivation is actually better, because we
can concentrate on football.''
	   Team captain Zvonimir Boban says patriotism peaked with the 1996
European soccer championship, Croatia's first major international
tournament since independence.
	   Boban became a national hero during the breakup of Yugoslavia
when he attacked a policeman beating Croatian fans who rioted at a
May 1990 game in Zagreb between his former club Dinamo Zagreb and
Red Star Belgrade.
	   Nowadays, he's busy trying to keep a lid on hype.
	   ``We are a good national team,'' he says. ``But we are not the
best. If you think you are the best, you win against nobody.''

Eds: UPDATES with Joint Commission appointing temporary president
African Foreign Minister; picks up 8th graf pvs
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye disappeared Saturday when his plane
crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   The accident happened just days before the U.N.'s July 1st
deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA officials were not available for comment at their
headquarters in Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of
the capital.
	   The U.N. and the ``troika'' also expressed ``great shock and
deep sadness'' at the disappearance of Beye, who was on a mission
in search of support from other African states to push Angola's
troubled peace process to conclusion.
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the Joint Commission overseeing the peace process, officials said
in Luanda. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N. peace keeping
forces in Angola since April.
	   The commission _ which includes representatives of the Angolan
government, UNITA, the U.N., the United States, Russia and Portugal
_ also asked the U.N. to appoint a new special envoy to Angola ``as
soon as possible''.
	   Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said in Lisbon: ``I pray that
peace in Angola will be definitively concluded in a short term.
This is undoubtedly the best way to pay homage to the figure of
that distinguished African.''
	   South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in a statement
that Beye had ``always displayed a passionate desire to promote the
best interests of the Angolan people.''
	   It is still unclear whether the seven or eight people aboard the
plane have been found, although rescuers said Saturday that there
were no signs of survivors.
	   8th graf pvs ``Beye threatened to resign...''

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Berlin's annual gay and lesbian Christopher Street
Day parade drew a record 220,000 people this weekend, with
colorfully clad participants dancing to loud music and demanding
more rights for gay couples.
	   The event combines political demonstrations with partying and
commemorates the 1969 Christopher Street gay demonstrations against
police discrimination in New York's Greenwich Village.
	   In recent years, the Berlin parade has grown in popularity
partly because it has come to be seen as a precursor to the even
bigger Love Parade, the techno music party typically held two weeks
later.
	   Participants marched Saturday from Berlin's premier shopping
boulevard, the Kurfuerstendamm, to the Bebelplatz square in the
former east Berlin for a rally afterward.
	   Volker Beck, spokesman for the Gay Union and a parliament member
for the environmentalist Greens party, urged Germany's major
parties to do more for gay rights. ``Clear the way for gay
marriages!'' Beck said.

<TEXT>
	   LA BAULE, France (AP) _ It's been a nagging wound in England's
pride for 12 years, one that coach Glenn Hoddle says England will
have a chance to salve on Tuesday when it faces Argentina in the
second round of the World Cup.
	   The winner advances to the quarterfinals, but for Hoddle there
is an extra incentive _ justice.
	   Hoddle was a member of the England team that was beaten by the
help of Diego Maradona's legendary ``Hand of God'' goal in the
quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Maradona scored
twice in that game, once on one of the most memorable goals in
World Cup history, the other on a ball punched into the net as
Argentina edged England 2-1 and went on to lift the trophy.
	   The punched goal, which Maradona said was aided by the ``Hand of
God'', was still on Hoddle's mind Sunday as his 22-strong squad all
reported fit for training and ready to face the South Americans.
	   Hoddle vividly recalled how Maradona turned the game with his
sleight of hand before clinching the victory with his spectacular
second goal.
	   ``It was a tight game until that handball which turned the
situation completely,'' Hoddle said.
	   He claimed England never settled from the handball before
Maradona struck again.
	   ``That second goal, which was a fantastic goal, would never have
been scored if it was 0-0, but that was the sickening blow we had
to take on the day. This game now has given us a chance to address
the balance,'' he noted.
	   Defeating Argentina would also exorcise a personal ghost for the
English coach. It was Hoddle who lost the ball to Maradona leading
to the second goal.
	   Now, 12 years later, he has the chance to win back possession.
	   But Hoddle stresses he is looking for justice, not revenge.
	   ``I am the only one here in our party who was involved on the
pitch and that feeling of injustice has stayed with us a long time
... we have got a chance of readdresing that balance and turning
that result around and getting it out of our system,'' he said.
	   ``There is nothing more important than getting through to the
next round, but life comes round in a circle some times,'' he said.
	   Hoddle said no member of the 1986 team felt bitter toward
Maradona, who went on to play in two more World Cup finals.
	   ``The officials were the problem on that day. No one blamed
Maradona from inside the camp. At the end of the day, he did what
he did.''
	   Hoddle even hailed Maradona as the greatest player ever, even
better than Brazil's Pele.
	   ``Pele was probably a better team player, but I think Maradona
was a better individual talent than anyone who has played football
on this planet,'' he said.
	   Looking ahead to Tuesday's match, Hoddle said he was glad
England was the underdog. Although Argentina won all three Group H
games without conceding a goal, he preferred the South Americans as
England's opponents rather than Croatia, who finished second in
their group.
	   England would have met Croatia if it had won Group G instead of
losing to Romania, who finished first.
	   ``In many ways, we are stronger when we have got our backs to
the wall a little bit. Psychologically that suits us rather than
the other way around,'' he said.

Two injured in crash of copter at Dutch motorcycle Grand Prix 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ASSEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A helicopter crashed while circling
over the Dutch motorcycle Grand Prix, slightly injuring two of the
three people aboard, authorities said Sunday.
	   Investigators were trying to determine what caused the aircraft
to go down in a field near the track where Saturday's competition
was held. Dutch television reported that the pilot had experienced
engine trouble just before the chopper crashed.
	   Police did not identify the victims but said their injuries were
not life threatening. It was unclear whether the pilot was among
the injured.
	   The Grand Prix, held annually in the northeastern Dutch city of
Assen, was the seventh event of the 1998 World Motorcycle Racing
Championship.
	   Four-time world champion Michael ``Mick'' Doohan of Australia,
riding a Honda, won easily Saturday in the 500-cc class and
improved his overall season standings from fourth to second place.

Eds: UPDATES with Joint Commission appointing temporary president
African Foreign Minister; picks up 8th graf pvs
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye disappeared Saturday when his plane
crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   The accident happened just days before the U.N.'s July 1st
deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA officials were not available for comment at their
headquarters in Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of
the capital.
	   The U.N. and the ``troika'' also expressed ``great shock and
deep sadness'' at the disappearance of Beye, who was on a mission
in search of support from other African states to push Angola's
troubled peace process to conclusion.
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the Joint Commission overseeing the peace process, officials said
in Luanda. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N. peace keeping
forces in Angola since April.

Two police, nine soldiers killed in Mexican helicopter crash 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A police helicopter on a joint mission with
the army to eradicate drug crops crashed in the southern state of
Guerrero killing the craft's two-man police crew and nine soldiers.
	   The Attorney general's Office, which operated the helicopter,
did not specify what mechanical problems may have caused the Bell
212 helicopter to go down Saturday near the state capital of
Chilpancingo, 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
	   Guerrero state has been wracked in recent weeks by shoot outs
between the army and leftist rebels, and the state is also believed
to be one of the largest drug-growing areas in Mexico.
	   In the past, the army and police have engaged rebels in combat
while on what were purportedly routine anti-drug missions.
	   Army and police investigators are probing the cause of the
crash.
	   The newspaper La Jornada cited unnamed sources as saying the
helicopter may have been carrying troops to the scene of a 1995
police massacre of 17 farmworkers, to lay a trap for leftist rebels
expected to commemorate the third anniversary of the killings
Sunday.

Ethiopian immigrants protest state-provided education 
</HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ethiopian immigrants held a protest Sunday
accusing the government of forcing its children to attend schools
which provide sub-standard education, and warned that their ancient
community is in danger of unraveling unless the government
intervenes.
	   At a demonstration outside the office of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, elder Ethiopians cloaked in traditional white robes and
youth in jeans and dread locks, warned that if the community's
youth continue to receive an education inferior to their Israeli
peers, crime and social problems would ensue.
	   ``I could be a doctor, a lawyer ... or a criminal,'' read a sign
held by one teen-age demonstrator.
	   Crime and drug use is already on the rise among Ethiopian youth,
community leaders said. To combat the problem, leaders will ask
Netanyahu in a meeting next week to provide after-school and summer
time programming to keep children academically competitive and off
the streets.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel, mostly in isolated
trailer parks with little infrastructure. Many arrived in two
dramatic airlifts in 1985 and 1991.

Two Jewish settler youths charged in death of Palestinian 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Jewish settler youths were charged with
manslaughter Sunday in the clubbing death of a Palestinian farmer
killed two weeks ago near his West Bank home.
	   In charges filed to a Jerusalem district court, the state
prosecutor called the killing a direct result of the boys' ``hatred
towards Arabs.''
	   Calling the minors a ``danger to society,'' the state also asked
the court to order the accused incarcerated until the end of their
trial.
	   Abdel Abu Turki was walking home from his fields June 15th, with
a cousin when one of the accused leaned out of a van carrying six
other friends and wacked Abu Turki on the back of the head with a
wooden board. Abu Turki died moments later from the attack.
	   The youth and another 16-year-old in the car with him, were
arrested the next day from a home for troubled youths at a Jewish
settlement near Abu Turki's Palestinian village.
	   The state wrote that the van had been speeding when one of the
accused reached out a window to hit Abu Turki, walking along side
the road.
	   The state said the attack was pre-meditated and that the youths
took the board from a carpentry business where one of them was
employed. Abu Turki was unknown to the boys, ``an anonymous
victim,'' the state wrote.
	   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh said the 16-year-olds
had been spared a murder charge because of claims their intention
had been to harm and not to kill their victim.
	   The state said both boys had long histories of criminal activity
and were on parole at the time of the killing.

Disappearance of U.N. envoy prompts renewed calls to fulfill peace pact 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with rescuers reaching the wreckage of envoy's crashed
plane in 11th graf
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, from Mali, disappeared Saturday
when his plane crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   The accident happened just days before the U.N.'s July 1st
deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA officials were not available for comment at their
headquarters in Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of
the capital.
	   The U.N. and the ``troika'' also expressed ``great shock and
deep sadness'' at the disappearance of Beye, who was on a mission
in search of support from other African states to push Angola's
troubled peace process to conclusion.
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the Joint Commission overseeing the peace process, officials said
in Luanda. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N. peace keeping
forces in Angola since April.
	   The commission _ which includes representatives of the Angolan
government, UNITA, the U.N., the United States, Russia and Portugal
_ also asked the U.N. to appoint a new special envoy to Angola ``as
soon as possible''.
	   Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said in Lisbon: ``I pray that
peace in Angola will be definitively concluded in the short term.
This is undoubtedly the best way to pay homage to the figure of
that distinguished African.''
	   South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in a statement
that Beye had ``always displayed a passionate desire to promote the
best interests of the Angolan people.''
	   Rescuers Sunday found the wreckage of the plan surrounded by the
mangled body parts and six personal identity documents, including
one belonging to 59-year-old Beye. There were no signs of
survivors.
	   Beye threatened to resign last month, saying that neither UNITA
nor the Angolan government had the ``political will'' to fully
comply with the 1994 peace accord.
	   The accord has passed numerous deadlines without fulfillment.
The reluctance of the former rebels to give up their strongholds
has become one of the major sticking points.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

Singer laid to rest amid anti-govt tension, two dead in rioting

<TEXT>
	   BENI DOUALA, Algeria (AP) _ Demonstrating against Muslim
militants who murdered their singer and a government trying to
silence their language, tens of thousands of Berbers attended the
village burial Sunday of native son Lounes Matoub.
	   ``No peace without the Berber language,'' read one sign, after
three days of rioting sparked by Matoub's slaying Thursday ravaged
state buildings and left at least two dead and 100 reported injured
in the mountainous Berber region of eastern Algeria.
	   ``Zeroual, murderer,'' read another placard, focusing anger as
much against militants as against the military-backed government of
President Liamine Zeroual that will impose Arabic as the only
official language next Sunday.
	   ``We are not Arabs!'' chanted some mourners under a stifling
summer heat as women wailed and security forces stood watch in this
village 15 kms (10 miles) south of the Berber capital Tizi-Ouzou,
100 kms (60 miles) east of Algiers.
	   Berbers staged a general strike Sunday, following what was
believed the largest unrest in the region since the so-called
Berber Spring uprising of 1980.
	   Tizi-Ouzou was in a shambles Sunday, with most of its traffic
lights, street lamps and bus stops damaged. Rioters had burned a
cinema, state department stores, state banks and Air Algerie, among
other offices. Private businesses were unscathed.
	   No incidents were reported around the funeral at Taourirt Moussa
cemetery next to the village. Both Matoub's family and Prime
Minister Ahmed Ouayhia had appealed for calm.
	   In Paris, Algerians and French intellectuals gathered near the
Eiffel Tower and at Place de la Republique to honor Matoub and
protest his murder.
	   An impassioned defender of Berber culture, the 42-year-old
singer was the latest Algerian artist to be slain during an
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The killing inflamed Berber anger at the military-backed
government's plans to impose Arabic as the only official language
beginning next Sunday, effectively banning the Berber language,
also known as Tamazight, as well as French, which is widely used in
this former French colony.
	   ``Tamazight in school,'' read one banner among mourners.
	   ``People are angry, but you must understand their frustration
because Tamazight is marginalized,'' Nourredine Ait-Hamouda, an
organizer of the funeral and a member of the Movement for Berber
Culture, told reporters.
	   The Arabic-only law move was seen as a government effort to
appease supporters of Islamic movements. The Rally for Culture and
Democracy, in a statement, accused the government of President
Liamine Zeroual of ``passive complicity with the fundamentalists.''
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment. The Front has condemned Matoub's
assassination.

World Cup: Blanc Golden Goal puts France into last eight 
</HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Defender Laurent Blanc scored the first ever
World Cup ``Golden Goal'' six minutes from the end of extra time
Sunday to put France into the quarterfinal after a 1-0 victory over
Paraguay.
	   After the two teams went to extra time scoreless, Blanc gave
France victory and the host will face Italy at the Stade de France
Friday for a place in the semifinal.
	   The French forwards, who have scored nine goals in three Group C
games to reach the last 16, ran into a stubbornly-effective
Paraguay defense but still missed the target five times during the
first 90 minutes as the host went in search of a quarterfinal
place.
	   Even without the still-suspended Zinedine Zidane, the French
created two early chances.
	   Monaco striker David Trezeguet went close to firing the French
ahead in the 14th minute with a curling right footer from the edge
of the area which hit the side netting.
	   Two minutes later, Diomede took a pass from Thierry Henry and
fired a left-foot shot which the diving Jose Luis Chilavert
finger-tipped round the post.
	   The French continued to set up shooting chances around the edge
of Paraguay's area and Youri Djorkaeff shaved Chilavert's left hand
post with a 20-meter (yard) drive with the 'keeper scrambling
across goal.
	   French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, on his 27th birthday, almost
handed Paraguayan striker Jorge Campos a present when he lost
possession of a backpass. Fortunately for the French, he recovered
to gather it second time.
	   Bernard Diomede had a chance to shoot the host ahead in the 37th
minute after a slick break by Emmanuel Petit down the left opened
up the Paraguayan defense. Petit pulled the ball sideways to the
forward who completely mistimed his shot and the ball rolled
harmlessly wide.
	   Cardozo reminded the French there was another attack in the game
when he took a well-timed pass from Miguel Benitez to get through
the home defense but fired straight at 'keeper Barthez.
	   At the other end, Henry used his pace to prod the ball ahead
from the halfway line and charge clear of Paraguay's defense. The
experienced Chilavert raced off his line and, although he was
beaten by Henry's chip past him, the ball hit the post.
	   French defender Marcel Desailly rescued his team with an
expertly-timed tackle to foil Benitez as the Paraguayan midfielder
raced for goal and then went close to putting France ahead in the
55th minute.
	   The AC Milan star climbed well to meet a left-wing corner and
powered in a long-range header only to see Chilavert dive to his
right to hold the ball just short of the line.
	   Paraguay had a free kick at the other end, Arce found Carlos
Gammara with a well-aimed ball from the right but the defender's
diving header flew wide of the near post.
	   Djorkaeff had a 25-meter shot deflected over the top by
Paraguay's Julio Cesar Enciso and then a great chance fell to
Trezeguet with 11 minutes to go,
	   The ball fell to the Monaco striker in a crowded area and he
only had 'keeper Chilavert to beat. But his carefully-aimed
left-foot shot slid wide of the post.
	   In another scramble in front of Chilavert's goal with eight
minutes to go, Djorkaeff had the ball at his feet barely six meters
from goal but he delayed a fraction too long and Paraguayan
cleared.
	   Extra time was 10 minutes old when a 25-meter free kick from
Djorkaeff deflected off Enciso's head and Chilavert tipped the ball
round the post.
	   The Paraguayan 'keeper then kept out tame shots from Trezeguet
and substitute Alain Boghossian and, five minutes into the second
period of extra time, flung himself to his left to hold a swerving
drive from Robert Pires.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff,
Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 70th); Thierry Henry (Robert
Pires, 65th), David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede (Stephane
Guivarc'h), 77th).
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce Carlos Gamarra,
Celso Ayala, Pedro Sarabia; Roberto Acuna, Carlos Parades (Denis
Caniza, 75th), Julio Cesar Enciso, Miguel Benitez; Jorge Campos
(Juan Carlos Yegros, 56th), Jose Cardozo (Aristides Rojas, 91st).
	   Referee: Mohamed Ali Bujsaim, United Arab Emirates.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Tribal drummers and dancers greeted
French President Jacques Chirac as he arrived Sunday in this former
Portuguese colony _ the first French president to ever do so.
	   Chirac's main purpose here was to call for France to invest and
trade with Mozambique, where general political stability has led to
record economic growth after years of bitter civil war, French
officials said.
	   His four-nation, six-day tour marks a departure in Paris' policy
toward Africa. After focusing for decades on French-speaking
Africa, Chirac himself announced last year France would curtail its
military interventions _ and expenditures _ in that region and
reach out to other parts of the continent.
	   Earlier Sunday, Chirac was in South Africa, the key stop on a
trip aimed at bringing closer political and economic ties. A
delegation of about 50 top French business executives are with
Chirac.
	   Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano greeted them on the
airport tarmac as drummers beat a lively tattoo and children danced
and sang. Artillery pieces fired off a 21-gun salute.
	   Chirac was to meet with Chissano at his residence for private
talks and attend a state banquet.
	   French officials said he will also meet later Sunday with former
rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama, now head of the political opposition.
	   Dhlakama signed a peace accord with the government in 1992,
ending 16 years of civil war waged by his Mozambique National
Resistance _ known by its Portuguese acronym RENAMO _ that placed
Mozambique among the world's poorest nations.
	   The first democratic elections were held in 1996, and economic
reforms spurred a 12-percent increase in gross domestic product
last year, the highest economic growth in southern Africa.
	   Annual inflation fell to 2.4 percent, the lowest in the region,
and compared favorably with European and North American rates.
	   Earlier Sunday, in South Africa's wine region, Chirac awarded
retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu one of France's highest
awards for his anti-apartheid activities.
	   ``I salute in you a man who brought the message of the gospels
to the heart of action, a man who was and is the conscience and
inspiration of South Africa,'' Chirac told Tutu.
	   Chirac pinned a silver star with a red ribbon on Tutu's lapel,
making him a grand officer of the Legion of Honor, France's highest
award to non-heads of state.
	   Tutu, who had led protests against apartheid which ended with
South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, said the struggle
had been inspired by the French revolution.
	   Chirac leaves Monday for the former Portuguese colony of Angola,
the final stop on the trip that also took him to Namibia.
	   Angola is still battling to implement a peace accord singed in
1994 that ended its civil war. Officials said Chirac's talks there
were expected to review the ailing peace process.

	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to

Orange march a battleground for Northern Ireland's new era 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout for AMs
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's hoped-for
future of political compromise faces a fundamental test Monday when
the Parades Commission rules whether Orangemen can march through
the Catholic section of a fiercely Protestant town.
	   The annual confrontation between Catholic protesters and
Protestant Orangemen in Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of
Belfast, has caused bloodshed and bitterness the past two years.
The commission's long-awaited verdict has much of Northern Ireland
living in dread.
	   If the commission lets Sunday's parade go ahead, Catholic
protesters directed by a former Irish Republican Army prisoner have
vowed to confront the police and British army. Last year such a
decision triggered three nights of Catholic rioting and IRA
shootings.
	   If the Orange Order is barred from Portadown's Garvaghy Road,
Northern Ireland's 80,000-strong Protestant fraternal group is
threatening to cause chaos across the province until it gets its
way. Two years ago police caved in during a week of such violence.
	   ``It's a no-win situation, a conflict of rights,'' said Mo
Mowlam, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, who last year
infuriated protesters and Orangemen with her failed bid to broker
compromise. She said the coming week could prove ``difficult and
terrible.''
	   ``There's no answer ... unless the groups themselves sit down,
talk, and find a way through.''
	   This year the new Parades Commission, three Catholics and three
Protestants led by an English former labor-union negotiator, has
tried to strike an elusive balance.
	   It ordered police to prevent two small Orange marches from
passing through predominantly Catholic areas Sunday, decisions that
produced no violence.
	   On Saturday, it let Orangemen march to their lodge nearest
Catholic west Belfast. Catholic protesters fought police after
trying to block the roadway. No serious injuries were reported.
	   But the confrontation in Portadown, the bitter heartland of
Orangeism, has assumed symbolic significance above all others,
making retreat for either side hard to contemplate.
	   Portadown Orangemen refuse to meet the Garvaghy Road Residents
Coalition, the protest group formed following the IRA's 1994
cease-fire and led by Breandan MacCionnaith, a former prisoner who
has become an Orange hate figure.
	   MacCionnaith has substantial Catholic support. He was elected to
the local Protestant-majority council, where he presses the case
for direct negotiations with unwilling Orangemen.
	   This deadlock reflects Northern Ireland's long war of nerves
between Ulster Unionism, founders of this Protestant-majority state
77 years ago, and the Sinn Fein-IRA movement, which launched its
campaign to abolish Northern Ireland 28 years ago.
	   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble has refused to meet
Sinn Fein party leaders throughout four years of a peace process
that produced a compromise agreement in April.
	   Following last week's elections for the central plank of that
agreement _ a Belfast Assembly of Catholic and Protestant
politicians _ Trimble stands poised to be appointed Wednesday as
leader of a multi-party government that would include Sinn Fein.
	   But he still vows not to talk to Sinn Fein politicians, unless
the IRA starts disarming as a demonstration that it's really
abandoned violence.
	   Trimble's position underscores Protestant unwillingness to be
seen conceding anything to IRA threats.
	   Trimble, Portadown's representative in British Parliament,
warned the Parades Commission to make ``no foolish decisions''
Monday. He said Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness
were threatening violence and could call off the protest through
``their man'' MacCionnaith.
	   Sinn Fein leaders link a solution of this with the way the new
government should work.
	   ``This is happening in his own constituency, yet David Trimble
won't speak to his own constituents _ to resolve an issue that
could be very destabilizing for the rest of us,'' said McGuinness.
``And he has to talk to Gerry Adams. That's the way forward.''

World Cup: Vieri, Pagliuca get attention before half-day off 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GOUVIEUX, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri, the striker, and
Gianluca Pagliuca, the saver, got most of the media attention
Sunday, the day after Italy's qualification for the World Cup
quarterfinals on a 1-0 victory against Norway.
	   Vieri, who tallied Italy's game winner in Marseille for his
fifth goal in the competition, said he did his job against the
Norwegians ``taking advantage of the best chance I had in the
match.''
	   He said he was not obsessed by the idea of scoring other goals
in the next matches, or clinching the title of top World Cup
striker.
	   ``The less you think of scoring the more you put the ball into
the net. In any case what really counts is to keep on winning. I
think Italy can go a long way into the tournament,'' Vieri said.
	   Pagliuca, the Inter Milan keeper who preserved Italy's lead with
a sensational save on a short-range header by Tore Andre Flo, said
he was lucky to stop the ball just on the net line.
	   ``I stopped it by instinct. On a wet field the ball could have
slipped into the goal,'' Pagliuca said.
	   Italian players unusually met reporters in the castle-hotel
where they live _ usually banned to the media _ before taking a
half-day off.
	   Preparation for Friday's quarterfinal match begins at Italy's
training camp of Senlis Monday.

World Cup: Blanc Golden Goal puts France into last eight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS detail of goal
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Defender Laurent Blanc scored the first ever
World Cup ``Golden Goal'' six minutes from the end of extra time
Sunday to put France into the quarterfinal after a 1-0 victory over
Paraguay.
	   The centerback drove the ball past star 'keeper Jose Luis
Chilavert from six meters (yards) after David Trezeguet had headed
down a cross from Robert Pires.
	   After the two teams went to extra time scoreless and appeared to
be headed for a penalty shootout, Blanc's goal calmed the nerves of
the 40,000 French fans at the Felix Bollaert stadium and ensured
that the host will face Italy at the Stade de France Friday for a
place in the semifinal.
	   The French forwards, who have scored nine goals in three Group C
games to reach the last 16, ran into a stubbornly-effective
Paraguay defense but still missed the target five times during the
first 90 minutes as the host went in search of a quarterfinal
place.
	   Chilavert, the flamboyant 'keeper who scores from free kicks and
penalties for his team, made four more saves in extra time before
Blanc finally beat him.
	   Even without the still-suspended Zinedine Zidane, the French
created two early chances.
	   Monaco striker Trezeguet went close to firing the French ahead
in the 14th minute with a curling right footer from the edge of the
area which hit the side netting.
	   Two minutes later, Bernard Diomede took a pass from Thierry
Henry and fired a left-foot shot which the diving Chilavert
finger-tipped round the post.
	   The French continued to set up shooting chances around the edge
of Paraguay's area and Youri Djorkaeff shaved Chilavert's left hand
post with a 20-meter drive with the 'keeper scrambling across goal.
	   French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, on his 27th birthday, almost
handed Paraguayan striker Jorge Campos a present when he lost
possession of a backpass. Fortunately for the French, he recovered
to gather it second time.
	   Diomede had a chance to shoot the host ahead in the 37th minute
after a slick break by Emmanuel Petit down the left opened up the
Paraguayan defense. Petit pulled the ball sideways to the forward
who completely mistimed his shot and the ball rolled harmlessly
wide.
	   Cardozo reminded the French there was another attack in the game
when he took a well-timed pass from Miguel Benitez to get through
the home defense but fired straight at 'keeper Barthez.
	   At the other end, Henry used his pace to prod the ball ahead
from the halfway line and charge clear of Paraguay's defense. The
experienced Chilavert raced off his line and, although he was
beaten by Henry's chip past him, the ball hit the post.
	   French defender Marcel Desailly rescued his team with an
expertly-timed tackle to foil Benitez as the Paraguayan midfielder
raced for goal and then went close to putting France ahead in the
55th minute.
	   The AC Milan star climbed well to meet a left-wing corner and
powered in a long-range header only to see Chilavert dive to his
right to hold the ball just short of the line.
	   Paraguay had a free kick at the other end, Arce found Carlos
Gammara with a well-aimed ball from the right but the defender's
diving header flew wide of the near post.
	   Djorkaeff had a 25-meter shot deflected over the top by
Paraguay's Julio Cesar Enciso and then a great chance fell to
Trezeguet with 11 minutes to go,
	   The ball fell to the Monaco striker in a crowded area and he
only had 'keeper Chilavert to beat. But his carefully-aimed
left-foot shot slid wide of the post.
	   In another scramble in front of Chilavert's goal with eight
minutes to go, Djorkaeff had the ball at his feet barely six meters
from goal but he delayed a fraction too long and Paraguayan
cleared.
	   Extra time was 10 minutes old when a 25-meter free kick from
Djorkaeff deflected off Enciso's head and Chilavert tipped the ball
round the post.
	   The Paraguayan 'keeper then kept out tame shots from Trezeguet
and substitute Alain Boghossian and, five minutes into the second
period of extra time, flung himself to his left to hold a swerving
drive from Pires.
	   Lineups:
	   France _ Fabien Barthez; Lilian Thuram, Marcel Desailly, Laurent
Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu; Didier Deschamps, Youri Djorkaeff,
Emmanuel Petit (Alain Boghossian, 70th); Thierry Henry (Robert
Pires, 65th), David Trezeguet, Bernard Diomede (Stephane
Guivarc'h), 77th).
	   Paraguay _ Jose Luis Chilavert; Francisco Arce Carlos Gamarra,
Celso Ayala, Pedro Sarabia; Roberto Acuna, Carlos Parades (Denis
Caniza, 75th), Julio Cesar Enciso, Miguel Benitez; Jorge Campos
(Juan Carlos Yegros, 56th), Jose Cardozo (Aristides Rojas, 91st).

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Shortly after arriving to Israel Sunday,
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar stopped to pray at one of
Christianity's holiest sites, where Jesus is believed to have been
crucified, buried and resurrected.
	   Beginning a three-day visit to Israel as part of a Middle East
tour, Aznar and his wife, Ana Botella, participated in a private
service inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem's
walled Old city.
	   Afterward, Aznar toured the alley ways of the ancient city,
stopping at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site and the Temple
Mount which houses shrines holy to Islam.
	   During the tour, Azner chose not to answer questions from
reporters and did not make a statement.
	   Azner met later with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
one of two meetings scheduled between the leaders during the visit.
	   In 1991, Spain hosted an historic Middle East conference which
opened the door to dialogue between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
	   Israel and the Palestinians signed several peace accords
following the conference but 16 months ago negotiations broke down
over Israeli construction of a housing project for Jews on a
disputed Jerusalem hilltop. Netanyahu has suggested another
international gathering modeled after the Madrid Conference to help
restart the process, but the Palestinians have rejected the idea as
a waste of time.
	   Aznar and his wife will be the guests at a state dinner hosted
in the Netanyahu home Sunday.
	   Azner will also meet with Israel's President Ezer Weizmann
before traveling to the Palestinian autonomy for meetings Tuesday
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

Disappearance of U.N. envoy prompts renewed calls to fulfill peace pact grafs. No pick up

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye disappeared Saturday when his plane
crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   Rescuers Sunday found the wreckage of the plan surrounded by the
mangled body parts and six personal identity documents, including
one belonging to 59-year-old Beye. There were no signs of
survivors.
	   The accident happened just days before the U.N.'s July 1st
deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA officials were not available for comment at their
headquarters in Bailundo, about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of
the capital.
	   The U.N. and the ``troika'' also expressed ``great shock and
deep sadness'' at the disappearance of Beye, who was on a mission
in search of support from other African states to push Angola's
troubled peace process to conclusion.
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the Joint Commission overseeing the peace process, officials said
in Luanda. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N. peace keeping
forces in Angola since April.
	   The commission _ which includes representatives of the Angolan
government, UNITA, the U.N., the United States, Russia and Portugal
_ also asked the U.N. to appoint a new special envoy to Angola ``as
soon as possible''.
	   Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said in Lisbon: ``I pray that
peace in Angola will be definitively concluded in a short term.
This is undoubtedly the best way to pay homage to the figure of
that distinguished African.''
	   South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in a statement
that Beye had ``always displayed a passionate desire to promote the
best interests of the Angolan people.''
	   It is still unclear whether the seven or eight people aboard the
plane have been found, although rescuers said Saturday that there
were no signs of survivors.
	   Beye threatened to resign last month, saying that neither UNITA
nor the Angolan government had the ``political will'' to fully
comply with the 1994 peace accord.
	   The accord has passed numerous deadlines without fulfillment.
The reluctance of the former rebels to give up their strongholds
has become one of the major sticking points.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.

More still trapped after strong quake kills 112 in Turkey Incirlik base

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ A boy was pulled out alive Sunday from the
rubble of a quake which struck southern Turkey a day earlier,
killing at least 112 people, including children at a birthday party
in one of the buildings flattened in this town.
	   Across the region, more than 1,000 people were injured. Ceyhan
and, 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the west, Adana, a city of 1
million and epicenter of the 6.3 magnitude quake, were the hardest
hit cities.
	   Tens of thousands of residents, alarmed by scores of
aftershocks, fled, leaving laundry on balconies and taking bedding
and TV sets with them to gardens and other makeshift living areas.
	   ``About 25 people may still be trapped under the rubble in
Ceyhan,'' said fireman Ekrem Dogdu early Sunday evening.
	   Earlier, firefighters dug out the bodies of three children who
were killed at a birthday party in a building that collapsed.
	   Rescuers pulled the 11-year-old survivor from the debris of a
flattened five-story building 24 hours after the earthquake.
	   Doctors checked his pulse as he was put into an ambulance after
rescuers cleared away stones which had pinned him down.
	   The boy appeared tired as he watched an applauding crowd.
Rescuers were still searching for his mother, grandparents and two
older brothers.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 46 people in Ceyhan, terminus
town for an Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline, which the energy ministry
said suffered no damage.
	   Forty-four people died in Adana, among them a small boy whom two
American tourists tried in vain to remain, private Channel D TV
reported.
	   Many of the victims in Adana were living in slums districts
where houses were poorly built. The slums are crowded with Kurds
who have fled the war in their southeastern villages between the
army and the guerrillas.
	   The other victims were found in nearby towns and villages.
	   At the outskirts of Adana is Incirlik air base, used by U.S. and
British jets to patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
	   Staff Sgt. Joel Langton of the U.S. Air Force at Incirlik said
35 people affiliated with the base suffered mild bruises and cuts.
He did not give their nationalities.
	   The quake was slightly felt along the Mediterranean coast of
Turkey, but hotel officials said foreigners at resorts remained
calm.
	   In Ceyhan, where at least five downtown buildings were leveled,
rescuers used backhoes, shovels and their hands to clear away
rubble.
	   Gulbin Cankaya was on the top floor of a seven-story building
that collapsed.
	   ``I cleared some stones around me and started to knock stones
together to make noise and cried for help,'' she said lying on a
stretcher in the garden of Ceyhan's hospital with her
three-year-old daughter.
	   The doctors did not tell her that her husband and sister were
found dead.
	   Crowds were angry when rescue operations were interrupted
briefly Sunday for President Suleyman Demirel's inspection of
Ceyhan.
	   ``I have three people of my own blood there. They are just
making politics here,'' said Ibrahim Civelek, standing before a
destroyed house.
	   Adana Gov. Oguz Koksal said there were at least 1,041 injured,
15 of those in serious condition, in the region.
	   Several government buildings collapsed, despite a public works
ministry decree ordering safety measures in the construction of
buildings in earthquake-prone regions, the daily Sabah noted.
	   ``Paper walls,'' said firefighter Mustafa Karakus, accusing
builders of not using enough iron and cement for construction.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

Searchers hack through jungle swamp to reach envoy's plane wreck other details. No pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: REWRITES throughout with additional details from crash sites,
By TIM SULLIVAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANGROVE SWAMPS NEAR AKOURE, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Search teams
wielding machetes and chainsaws hacked their way through dense
mangrove swamps Sunday to reach the wreckage of the small chartered
plane that crashed while carrying the U.N. envoy to Angola.
	   They found no survivors.
	   What they discovered was the shattered, mangled remnants of the
plane, its passengers and their personal belongings.
	   Nearly everything _ from plane parts to bodies _ were destroyed
beyond recognition. Chunks of metal lay strewn across an area of
about 100 square yards (meters) along with body parts, personal
papers and bits of luggage.
	   A black carry-on bag sat incongruously to the side of the
wreckage, intact save for a burst zipper spilling out a calculator,
eye drops and a short-wave radio.
	   More than 36 hours after the plane crashed Friday evening _
slamming into an island of dry land surrounded by expansive
mangrove swamps and jungle some 35 miles (50 kilometers) east of
Ivory Coast's commercial capital of Abidjan _ pieces of aircraft
continued to smolder.
	   The plane's most well-known passenger was 59-year-old Alioune
Blondin Beye, a highly respected diplomat, politician, educator and
scholar from the West African nation Mali. Since 1993 he has been
the United Nations' envoy to Angola, and was on a swing through
Africa seeking support for a peace plan for that southern African
country.
	   Angola has suffered on-again off-again fighting since civil war
began after independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   Beye's apparent death jolted his native Mali, where he has long
been well-known, and the diplomatic community.
	   ``I was shocked to learn of the tragic news,'' said South
Africa's Foreign Affairs Minister, Alfred Nzo. ``Mr Beye's tragic
death will be felt by all who assisted him in his tireless and
determined efforts,'' for peace in Angola.
	   Beye's plane left Togo's capital of Lome on Friday evening after
the envoy met Togolese President Gnassigbe Eyadema in a bid to win
support for the Angolan peace process.
	   The aircraft disappeared east of Abidjan's international airport
around 7:00 p.m. (1900 GMT) Friday and search-and-rescue operations
were launched.
	   Searchers were prevented from reaching the aircraft Saturday by
poor telephone communications and difficulties in finding their way
the forests and marshlands.
	   A small party of French and Ivory Coast soldiers were airdropped
Sunday morning from a helicopter to the crash site, about 10
kilometers (6 miles) from Akoure, relaying their coordinates back
to several ground search parties that slogged through the swamps
with the help of local villagers.
	   The jungles and swamps were so dense that even one of the search
parties, slogging through waist-high water, became lost for a
couple hours.
	   At the scene, six passports were found, including Beye's.
	   The other five bore the names of Senegalese journalist Moktar
Gueye, Chad national Beadegar Dessandde, Togolese foreign ministry
official Koffi Adoyi and two people of unidentified nationality _
Jason McNeill and Ibikunle Williams.
	   There was a discrepancy over the number of people on board;
Ivorian officials said either seven or eight, while Togolese
officials said seven.
	   The plane itself, which appeared to have slammed into a tree
before crashing to the ground, was broken into two large mangled
pieces _ one apparently the tail _ and many smaller broken parts.
	   U.N. aviation experts had been expected to join the search, but
had not yet arrived, Ivorian civil aviation officials said Sunday
morning.
	   Beye, who is credited with leading U.N. peace efforts in Angola,
threatened to resign from his U.N. post last month, saying the
government and former rebel movement UNITA lacked the ``political
will'' to see the peace process to its conclusion.
	   Lingering hostility between the government and UNITA has stymied
peace, and the U.N.'s patience is growing thin.

World Cup: St Etienne alcohol restrictions a ``joke'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former British Sports Minister Sir Ted Taylor said
allowing soccer fans to drink alcohol all day Tuesday before
England's World Cup match against Argentina was asking for trouble.
	   Taylor said the restrictions imposed by authorities in St
Etienne to curb possible hooliganism by reducing alcohol
consumption were a ``joke''.
	   Tom Pendry, Football Trust chairman and former opposition sports
minister, said the decision not to restrict the supply of alcohol
at St Etienne was a ``cocktail for disaster''.
	   ``The ridiculous allocation of tickets has already caused a lot
of aggravation,'' he said. ``We are going to have 30,000 fans
trying to get into about 2,000 places.
	   ``There will be a high level of frustration which will mean
people looking for drink to find some other outlet for their
energies.''
	   Prefect of the Loire, Jean-Yves Audouin, sparked the outrage
Sunday when he said St Etienne would not be a ``dead town'' _ a
reference to the alcohol bans imposed in Lens for England's match
against Colombia Friday.
	   ``The main idea is to discourage troublemakers, who will be
dealt with. But we want to keep the festivities going,'' Audouin
said.
	   British parliamentarians voiced their concern after French
officials revealed the only measures being taken to curb drinking
would be closing bars at 2200GMT Monday.
	   The bars will reopen at 0730GMT Tuesday and serve alcohol until
2200GMT.

Shark attacks make for dangerous surfing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EAST LONDON, South Africa (AP) _ A series of shark attacks has
made for hazardous surfing off South Africa's coast.
	   The most recent fatality occurred Tuesday when a 20-year-old
student died of a blood disorder directly related to the massive
amount of blood lost when he was attacked by a shark, believed to
be a great white, the previous day. Anton De Vos was attacked while
body surfing on the Indian Ocean coast.
	   ``The shark lifted him out of the water and we could see its
upper body as Anton tried to punch it,'' witness Foden Saunders
recounted.
	   The attack brought to six the number of people mauled by sharks
in the Eastern Cape region over the past five weeks.
	   In late May, two other surfers were attacked by sharks 50
kilometers (30 miles) apart on a single day. One surfer reportedly
escaped by ramming his board into the shark's mouth and swimming to
shore.
	   Earlier in the month, a shark bit national bodyboard champion
Neal Stephenson win the right leg, which later was amputated.
	   The attacks, which resulted in temporary closures of some
beaches, are not rare in South Africa.
	   Sharks apparently mistake some wetsuit-clad surfers for seals or
turtles. Others come near South Africa's coast to feed on schools
of sardines which make migratory runs past the shores. Dive
operators also lure sharks into coastal waters by throwing bait
into the ocean so paying customers in underwater cages can view the
predators.

Netanyahu accused of trying to stall peace process prime minister, quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fresh Netanyahu comments, meeting with Spanish
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders and other critics on Sunday
blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for an
international peace conference, accusing him of putting up new
roadblocks to peace.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Netanyahu was
trying to ``escape'' from his commitments, and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said the prime minister was trying ``to torpedo the
peace process.''
	   Netanyahu, however, said the proposal for a European-sponsored
conference to discuss Mideast regional issues _ but not the
Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically _ was intended to
complement the bilateral negotiations, not replace them.
	   In a meeting with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, Netanyahu said he would be happy if such a conference were
held in Madrid, as was the case in 1991. ``I am very fond of that
city,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``If at a certain moment there is a need for Madrid to serve as
the venue for a peace conference, rest assured that we will be
willing to do this,'' Aznar responded when the two men addressed
reporters.
	   He argued that the Palestinians were the ones holding up the
negotiations, claiming they have failed to keep their commitments
to collect weapons, outlaw militant groups, arrest suspects and
complete the repeal of articles in the Palestinian National
Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``This is what is delaying the process, nothing else,'' he said.
	   Asked if an agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank would be reached before the Knesset recesses on July 29,
Netanyahu told Israel Radio, ``I estimate this issue will be
concluded by then.''
	   ``I can't say for sure,'' he added, ``because I can't tell the
Palestinians what to do.'' Later however, Netanyahu said progress
between the two sides had been made in recent weeks and that ``the
gap which remains is not wide and can be bridged.''

Israeli singer cancels German TV appearance because of threats 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Israel's transsexual pop star Dana
International backed out of a German TV appearance Sunday, saying
she had been the target of death threats.
	   The singer _ known as Yaron Cohen until a sex change operation
five years ago _ became a celebrity throughout Europe after winning
last month's 25-nation Eurovision song contest, broadcast live
throughout the continent.
	   Her selection as Israel's representative caused a furor among
Orthodox leaders at home, who called her a disgrace to the Jewish
state, and raised eyebrows among some European viewers.
	   Suedwestfunk network spokesman Arthur Landwehr said the singer
canceled her appearance on the ``Always on Sunday'' program because
of death threats, but Landwehr had no details on the nature of the
threats or how they were delivered.
	   A record company manager quoted in Germany's mass-circulation
Bild newspaper said the singer continually has problems with
threats. ``We take these death threats seriously,'' Joachim Uhrig
was quoted as saying.

Turkish Cypriots vote to elect new mayors 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriots went to the polls on
Sunday to elect mayors in their self-declared republic in the
northern third of the island in what was seen as a test for general
elections in November.
	   Early returns indicated that center-right National United Party,
currently in power, would lead the local elections.
	   Final results were expected Monday.
	   November's elections could help decide the political mood about
efforts to peacefully settle the division of Cyprus.
	   UN-sponsored talks to reunify island remain deadlocked.
	   Cyprus has been divided between Turkish and Greek Cypriot
communities since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the island
after an aborted coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Seven political parties presented some 3,000 candidates in their
bid to win 28 mayoral posts and more than 1,000 other city offices.
	   There are only four cities in the northern part of Cyprus:
Nicosia, Kyrenia, Famagusta and Morphou.

Ruble devaluation unnecessary, IMF says Nemtsov, Berezovsky in last 2 grafs.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian leaders are right to make every effort to
prevent a devaluation of the ruble, which would only deepen the
country's economic crisis, a top International Monetary Fund
official said Sunday.
	   Martin Gilman, head of the fund's Moscow office, praised Russian
leaders for their efforts to dig their country out of its economic
troubles, and said the fund would make a decision on a bailout loan
as soon as possible.
	   Russia must first take control of its budget before considering
a ruble devaluation, ``which will not resolve the budget problem
but only make it worse,'' Gilman said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Investors have been fleeing Russia's markets for weeks, worried
that the Central Bank would be unable to keep spending reserves to
keep the currency stable.
	   The shaky ruble is one of several problems that have combined to
cause Russia's economic crisis, which has led to a steep drop in
the stock market and forced interest rates up to 80 percent.
	   Russia's stock market has lost about half its value since the
beginning of the year, and the Central Bank has been using hard
currency reserves to keep the value of the ruble steady.
	   Until now, relatively low inflation and the ruble's stability
have been seen as one of President Boris Yeltsin's most important
successes, and the economic crisis has been confined to the
financial markets.
	   Devaluation would increase consumer prices, and the Kremlin
fears that could lead to social unrest. A wave of miners strikes
last month intensified that anxiety.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, appearing on the television
program Zerkalo, warned that devaluation would ``impoverish the
population, lead to skyrocketing prices and the dollarization of
the economy.''
	   Some analysts have said devaluation is inevitable, and the
government is trying too hard to prevent it.
	   But Gilman said experience in other countries suggest that
devaluation causes more problems than it cures. ``Any talk of the
devaluation of the ruble is out of place in this context,'' he
said.
	   Russia wants at least dlrs 10 billion from the IMF to build up
its Central Bank reserves _ in part to back up government bonds and
in part to have adequate reserves to forestall a run on the ruble.
	   The IMF has insisted on a strict austerity regime if Russia is
to qualify for the loan.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko unveiled a new austerity plan
last week that officials said appeared to meet many of the fund's
criteria. But the hard-line lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, has delayed action on legislation needed to implement the
plan.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a business magnate and executive secretary of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, said on Zerkalo that the
absence of political stability was partially to blame for the
crisis. Russia has a government, he said, ``but it is unable to
carry out its own decisions.''
	   Berezovsky also said the media must share the blame for the
crisis. ``Hope dies last and the media is trying to make hope
die,'' he said.

Netanyahu accused of trying to stall peace process meeting with Spanish prime minister, quotes. No pick up

Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with fresh Netanyahu comments,
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders and other critics on Sunday
blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for an
international peace conference, accusing him of putting up new
roadblocks to peace.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Netanyahu was
trying to ``escape'' from his commitments, and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said the prime minister was trying ``to torpedo the
peace process.''
	   Netanyahu, however, said the proposal for a European-sponsored
conference to discuss Mideast regional issues _ but not the
Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically _ was intended to
complement the bilateral negotiations, not replace them.
	   In a meeting with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, Netanyahu said he would be happy if such a conference were
held in Madrid, as was the case in 1991. ``I am very fond of that
city,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``If at a certain moment there is a need for Madrid to serve as
the venue for a peace conference, rest assured that we will be
willing to do this,'' Aznar responded when the two men addressed
reporters.
	   Netanyahu argued that the Palestinians were the ones holding up
the negotiations, claiming they have failed to keep their
commitments to collect weapons, outlaw militant groups, arrest
suspects and complete the repeal of articles in the Palestinian
National Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
	   ``This is what is delaying the process, nothing else,'' he said.
	   Asked if an agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank would be reached before the Knesset recesses on July 29,
Netanyahu told Israel Radio, ``I estimate this issue will be
concluded by then.''
	   ``I can't say for sure,'' he added, ``because I can't tell the
Palestinians what to do.'' Later however, Netanyahu said progress
between the two sides had been made in recent weeks and that ``the
gap which remains is not wide and can be bridged.''
	   The United States is pushing Israel to accept a U.S. proposal
for turning over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian
Authority. The Palestinians have already accepted the offer, but
deadline after unofficial deadline has passed without a response
from Israel.
	   Netanyahu, who faces serious opposition to any withdrawal from
hard-liners in his own Cabinet, in recent weeks flirted with the
possibility of holding a national referendum on any agreement to
shore up support for a withdrawal, but has appeared to back away
from that idea in recent days.
	   Critics charged that both suggestions were stalling tactics to
avoid moving the peace process forward.
	   ``It is futile for the Palestinians to respond to every new idea
he comes up with, because he does not mean it and does not take it
seriously,'' Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Sunday.
``The only thing he takes seriously is killing the peace process.''
	   Even Education Minister Yitzhak Levy, a member of Netanyahu's
governing coalition, questioned the usefulness of holding a
conference now.
	   ``At this moment our goal is to reach the final status agreement
(with the Palestinians) ... and this is what the government should
be working for,'' he said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, said Israel had
already made ``sufficient'' compromises to reach agreement on the
West Bank redeployment, and that the few remaining differences on
the size and details of the redeployment could be resolved ``in
very little time.''

Disappearance of U.N. envoy prompts renewed calls to fulfill peace pact throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with UNITA reaction in 5th and 6th graf; SUBS
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) - The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared, the international community on Sunday urged
former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of its four
remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the U.N. and the so-called ``troika,''
made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States, called on UNITA
to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state administration''
throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, from Mali, disappeared Saturday
when his plane crashed in the Ivory Coast. Rescuers on Sunday
reached the plane's wreckage, surrounded by mangled body parts and
personal identity documents, including one belonging to 59-year-old
Beye.
	   There was no sign of survivors in the accident that happened
just days before the U.N.'s July 1st deadline for the former rebels
to hand over their strongholds to government control. Failure to
comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA said the U.N. should immediately appoint a new special
envoy to Angola to fill the ``huge void'' left by Beye's
disappearance, a spokesman said by phone from the former rebels'
headquarters in Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of the
capital.
	   He refused to evaluate Beye's personal contribution to the peace
process. ``We will not comment the work of those who are no longer
with us,'' he said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The Joint Commission overseeing the peace process also called on
the U.N. to appoint a new special envoy to Angola ``as soon as
possible''.
	   Major Kofi Obeng will temporarily replace Beye as president of
the commission _ which includes representatives for the Angolan
government, UNITA, the U.N. and the ``troika'' _ officials said in
Luanda. Obeng, from Ghana, has headed the U.N. peace keeping forces
in Angola since April.
	   Beye was on a mission in search of support from other African
states to push Angola's troubled peace process to conclusion when
his plane crashed.
	   The 1994 accord has passed numerous deadlines without
fulfillment. The reluctance of the former rebels to give up their
strongholds has become one of the major sticking points.
	   Last month Beye had threatened to resign as envoy, saying that
neither UNITA nor the Angolan government had the ``political will''
to fully comply with the accord.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ fought a civil war for nearly two
decades against the government following Angola's 1975 independence
from Portugal.
	   An estimated 500,000 people died before the peace accord was
signed.
	   Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio said in Lisbon: ``I pray that
peace in Angola will be definitively concluded in the short term.
This is undoubtedly the best way to pay homage to the figure of
that distinguished African (Beye).''
	   South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in a statement
that the envoy had ``always displayed a passionate desire to
promote the best interests of the Angolan people.''

Optimism mixes with frustration as world's largest AIDS conference begins AP Medical Editor 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with conference under way.
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The largest AIDS conference ever began Sunday with
a mixture of optimism over potent new virus-killing drugs and
frustration that AIDS still spreads explosively in parts of the
world that cannot afford these medical breakthroughs.
	   About 13,200 scientists, doctors, advocates and journalists
gathered for the 12th World AIDS Conference to hear 5,400
presentations on new treatments, insights into the basic workings
of the virus and how the disease affects everyone from pregnant
women to prisoners to ``commercial sex workers,'' the conference
euphemism for prostitutes.
	   During the week-long meeting, scientists are expected to discuss
newly developed treatments that may offer alternatives to protease
inhibitors, the class of drugs that have revolutionized AIDS care.
Moreover, experts believe they are closing in on simpler regimens
that will require people to take far fewer than the 20 pills a day
that are now common.
	   Doctors will also hear encouraging reports on preventing the
spread of the virus from infected mothers to their babies during
birth. Already, researchers have shown that brief treatment with
the drug AZT cuts this hazard in half, while longer use coupled
with Caesarean delivery virtually eliminates the risk.
	   Despite such progress, ``there is news so devastating that few
in this room could have predicted or imagined it a decade ago,''
Dr. Peter Piot, head of the United Nations AIDS program, told the
opening session.
	   His organization estimates that 12 million people around the
world have already died of AIDS, and another 31 million are alive
but infected. Each day, 16,000 more people catch the virus.
	   Since the last international AIDS conference, in Vancouver two
years ago, 10 million people have contracted HIV, said Piot. ``That
represents a collective failure of the world.''
	   Sunday's opening ceremonies were briefly disrupted by chanting,
horn-blowing demonstrators protesting the high cost of AIDS drugs.
A year's treatment with protease inhibitors and other drugs can
cost dlrs 10,000 or more. More than 90 percent of HIV-infected
people live in parts of the world where these medicines are simply
too expensive to be widely used.
	   ``We forget that of the millions of people living with AIDS,
most are condemned to death because of the absence of care,'' said
Peter Lamptey of Family Health International, an anti-AIDS
organization in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
	   In the United States, Europe and other wealthy parts of the
world, the epidemic has leveled off or is declining. After
explosive spread, it is also beginning to abate in some poorer
areas, such as Uganda, Senegal, Brazil and parts of Tanzania.
	   However, Piat noted that ``this epidemic is truly out of control
in many countries,'' including some parts of Asia, Africa and
Eastern Europe. One-quarter of the population is infected in
Botswana and Zimbabwe. Four million people have HIV in India and 3
million in South Africa.
	   Strategies that helped tame AIDS in some places have included
government-sponsored safe-sex campaigns and increased availability
of condoms and treatment for other sexually transmitted disease.
	   Ruth Cardoso, wife of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, told the conference that governments should ``stop the
self-defeating attitude of downplaying the problem's urgency'' and
make AIDS a major priority.
	   Many experts believe that developing an AIDS vaccine is key to
controlling the epidemic. The first large-scale testing of a
possible vaccine began last week.
	   On Sunday, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a
nonprofit group, announced a plan to try to marshal spending of
between dlrs 350 million and dlrs 500 million on vaccine
development over the next nine years. The group said Microsoft
founder Bill Gates had contributed dlrs 1.5 million to its effort.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants dug into
their positions Sunday around a besieged Serb village in Kosovo,
refusing to budge in a showdown that international officials fear
could plunge the secessionist province into all-out war.
	   Tense fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have
maintained an armed ring around Kijevo for 11 days, said they were
still deeply entrenched and were bracing for another attack after
an assault on their positions late Saturday.
	   A KLA commander in Malisevo, about ten kilometers (six miles)
from Kijevo, said Yugoslav airplanes and four helicopters, all
painted black, strafed and bombed the Kijevo positions for one and
a half hours late Saturday night.
	   Occasional small-arms fire was audible Sunday near Kijevo, where
the KLA was barring entry to journalists.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen are estimated to be in
the village, cut off from supplies and support.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and other officials have been
urging both warring sides to refrain from attacks in Kijevo, which
Holbrooke says could result in tragedy and a wider war if Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic orders Serb security forces to smash
the KLA siege with full force as he fears.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo to connect the main Kosovo cities of Pristina
and Pec. Security forces say the Kijevo posts are key to
communications between the guerrillas on either side of the road.
	   Western diplomats and Albanian sources say the Yugoslav army and
Serb police have been concentrating their forces in central Kosovo,
possibly in preparation for another offensive.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an operation on Feb.
28 to try to extinguish growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims to control 30 percent to 40 percent of this
province in Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of
Yugoslavia. They are increasingly supported by the Albanians, who
comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The Serb Media Center, which releases official Serbian
information, said ethnic Albanian guerrillas attacked a police
checkpoint Sunday and killed one Serb policeman near the village of
Prilep, 75 kilometers (47 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who conducted four days of shuttle talks in Kosovo
and Belgrade this week in an attempt to calm the worsening
conflict, said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard had met Friday with people
claiming to be representatives of the KLA.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which has rejected diplomacy in
its efforts to gain independence for predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
	   ``The contacts were with people who said they had this
authority, but at this point that authority remains to be
demonstrated,'' he said.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that the two unidentified KLA
leaders committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in Kosovo,
quoting senior American officials. The KLA leaders also reportedly
agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to
try to provide a common negotiating position, even though they
disagree with his pacifist approach to seeking independence for
Kosovo.
	   Speaking in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told reporters both Gelbard and Holbrooke were ``trying to get a
diplomatic solution'' but NATO planning for other options was
accelerating.
	   ``All options are on the table,'' she said.
	   NATO sent jets screaming over the region June 15 in a warning
aimed largely at Milosevic that military intervention is possible
if Kosovo violence isn't halted.
	   U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger reiterated Sunday
that NATO is prepared to take the necessary steps to stop the
serious escalation of violence in Kosovo.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Sunday he would be very happy if an international conference on
Mideast peace which he proposed last week would be held in Madrid,
Spain, as a 1991 Mideast peace conference had been.
	   ``I am very fond of that city,'' he said as he welcomed Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to Israel.
	   Azner was receptive to the idea.
	   ``If at a certain time there is a need for Madrid to serve as
the venue for a peace conference, rest assured that we will be
willing to make this possible,'' Azner said.
	   Netanyahu added that Aznar could help in ending the current
deadlock in Israel-Palestinian peace negotiations.
	   ``Spain has excellent relations with the Palestinians and the
Arab world,'' Netanyahu said, ``and if Spain uses its influence, if
you, Sir, use your influence, I hope one more push will get the
wagon out of the mud in which it is stuck and lead us towards a
peace with security and reciprocity.''
	   Shortly after arriving to Israel Sunday, Aznar stopped to pray
at one of Christianity's holiest sites, where Jesus is believed to
have been crucified, buried and resurrected. He and his wife Ana
Botella, participated in a private service at the Church of the
Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem.
	   Afterwards they toured the narrow alleys of the walled Old City,
stopping at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and the
Temple Mount which houses shrines holy to Islam.
	   During the tour, Aznar chose not to answer questions from
reporters and did not make a statement.
	   Aznar met later with Netanyahu, one of two meetings scheduled
between the leaders during the visit.
	   The historic Madrid conference which Spain hosted in 1991 opened
the door to dialogue between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
	   Israel and the Palestinians later signed several peace accords
but 16 months ago negotiations broke down over Israeli construction
of a housing project for Jews on a disputed Jerusalem hilltop.
	   Netanyahu has suggested another international gathering modeled
on the Madrid Conference to help restart the process, but the
Palestinians have rejected the idea as a waste of time.
	   Aznar and his wife will be the guests at a state dinner hosted
in the Netanyahu home Sunday.
	   Aznar will also meet with Israel's President Ezer Weizmann
before traveling to the Palestinian autonomy for meetings Tuesday
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister on Sunday
urged the United Nations to move quickly to mediate the Kashmir
dispute or risk a fourth war between Pakistan and India, the
world's newest nuclear powers.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Gohar Ayub, who was
to meet later in the day with the U.N. secretary general's special
envoy, said relentless cross-border attacks in the disputed Kashmir
region could quickly spin out of control.
	   Pakistan claims Indian soldiers killed 26 civilians in the past
week in attacks on Pakistani villages strung out along the northern
territory's contested border.
	   ``The danger is there of cross-border raids or hot pursuit . . .
this is a strong possibility,'' said Ayub. ``That would be
responded to by us sharply and aggressively.''
	   He said Pakistan already has made ``elaborate plans that if
Indian aircraft should come into Pakistan's airspace we would
retaliate quickly and decisively.''
	   India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir
and a third war over Bangladesh, or what was then East Pakistan.
	   Pakistan and India both lay claim to a united Kashmir, divided
between the two countries after the departure of the British
colonizers in 1947. India controls roughly two-thirds of the former
princely state, which is predominately Hindu India's only
Muslim-dominated state.
	   Indian soldiers have been trying since 1989 to put down a
violent secessionist uprising, which India says is being backed by
neighboring Pakistan, which denies the charges. Secessionists are
demanding either outright independence or union with Islamic
Pakistan.
	   Ayub said it's likely that a fourth war between the two
unfriendly neighbors would result in the use of nuclear weapons _ a
concern that has prompted the peace mission by Advaro De Soto, U.N.
assistant secretary general for political affairs.
	   He said Pakistan already has made ``elaborate plans that if
Indian aircraft should come into Pakistan's airspace we would
retaliate quickly and decisively.''

Ramsey in hospital after suspected stroke 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SUFFOLK, England (AP) _ Sir Alf Ramsey, who steered England to
the soccer World Cup title in 1966, was admitted to hospital Sunday
after a suspected stroke.
	   A spokeswoman for Ipswich General Hospital, Suffolk, said the
78-year-old soccer legend was in a ``comfortable condition''.
	   The spokeswoman could not confirm if Ramsey had suffered a
stroke.
	   As an England soccer fan, his sudden illness could not have come
at a worse time, with England facing a World Cup knock-out match
against Argentina at St Etienne, France, on Tuesday.
	   Ramsey, the only England manager to win a World Cup, had limited
involvement at a manager's level following his dismissal as manager
when England failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup finals.

Portuguese vote on whether to permit abortion on demand GMT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The first projections in Sunday's
national referendum on whether to permit abortion on demand
indicated an abstention rate of more than 70 percent, which would
make the ballot void.
	   The result of the referendum, Portugal's first, will be binding
only if more than half of the country's 8.4 million registered
voters participated.
	   An exit poll by state television Radiotelevisao Portuguesa
indicated an abstention rate of between 71 and 79 percent.
	   The poll gave between 47 and 53 percent for the 'yes' vote and
between 46 and 52 percent for 'no.' The margin of error was not
provided.
	   The National Electoral Commission announced at 5p.m. (1600 GMT),
two hours before polling stations closed, that just 20 percent of
the electorate had voted. The weather was fine and hot throughout
the country.
	   The result was due around midnight (2300 GMT).
	   The vote was to decide whether abortion on demand through the
10th week of pregnancy should be ``decriminalized,'' which in
effect will eliminate current prohibitions.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, termination of pregnancy is
permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or in cases of
rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   Lawmakers in February approved a bill relaxing abortion
restrictions, but opponents successfully pushed for the national
ballot which was intended to either overturn or ratify that
legislation.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the legislation would stand
if the referendum was declared void.
	   President Jorge Sampaio appealed for a high turnout in the
referendum on what has been a deeply divisive issue in this mostly
Roman Catholic country.
	   The National Assembly, Portugal's parliament, has been debating
the abortion issue for the past 14 years _ since leftist parties
first won enough seats to press for a discussion.
	   An intense two-week campaign leading up to the ballot featured
marches in major cities and a nationwide media blitz.
	   Abortion rights activists _ backed by leftist politicians _ say
they want to end the estimated 16,000 illegal abortions each year
in Portugal, a nation of 9.5 million people.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions.
	   Women can be imprisoned for up to three years for having an
illegal abortion.
	   Opposition to the easing of the current law has come from older
Portuguese, backed by the influential Catholic church and
conservative parties.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants dug into
their positions Sunday around a besieged Serb village in Kosovo,
refusing to budge in a showdown that international officials fear
could plunge the secessionist province into all-out war.
	   Tense fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have
maintained an armed ring around Kijevo for 11 days, said they were
still deeply entrenched and were bracing for another attack after
an assault on their positions late Saturday.
	   A KLA commander in Malisevo, about ten kilometers (six miles)
from Kijevo, said Yugoslav airplanes and four helicopters, all
painted black, strafed and bombed the Kijevo positions for one and
a half hours late Saturday night.
	   Occasional small-arms fire was audible Sunday near Kijevo, where
the KLA was barring entry to journalists.
	   About 200 Serb civilians and 20 policemen are estimated to be in
the village, cut off from supplies and support.
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and other officials have been
urging both warring sides to refrain from attacks in Kijevo, which
Holbrooke says could result in tragedy and a wider war if Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic orders Serb security forces to smash
the KLA siege with full force as he fears.
	   The KLA holds large areas north and south of the road that
passes through Kijevo connecting it to the main Kosovo cities of
Pristina and Pec. Security forces say the Kijevo posts are key to
communications between the guerrillas on either side of the road.
	   Western diplomats and Albanian sources say the Yugoslav army and
Serb police have been concentrating their forces in central Kosovo,
possibly in preparation for another offensive.
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
Kosovo since Serbian security forces launched an operation on Feb.
28 to try to extinguish growing resistance.
	   The KLA claims to control 30 percent to 40 percent of this
province in Serbia, the dominant republic in what is left of
Yugoslavia. Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The Serb Media Center, which releases official Serbian
information, said ethnic Albanian guerrillas attacked a police
checkpoint Sunday and killed one Serb policeman near the village of
Prilep, 75 kilometers (47 miles) west of Pristina.
	   Holbrooke, who conducted four days of shuttle talks in Kosovo
and Belgrade this week in an attempt to calm the worsening
conflict, said U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard had met Friday with people
claiming to be representatives of the KLA.
	   But Holbrooke said it had yet to be established that the
individuals do represent the KLA, which has rejected diplomacy in
its efforts to gain independence for predominantly Albanian Kosovo.
	   ``The contacts were with people who said they had this
authority, but at this point that authority remains to be
demonstrated,'' he said.
	   The New York Times reported Sunday that the two unidentified KLA
leaders committed to abiding by any cease-fire agreement in Kosovo,
quoting senior American officials. The KLA leaders also reportedly
agreed to cooperate with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to
try to provide a common negotiating position, even though they
disagree with his pacifist approach to seeking independence for
Kosovo.
	   Speaking in Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
told reporters that NATO planning for other options was
accelerating.
	   ``All options are on the table,'' she said.
	   NATO sent jets screaming over the region June 15 in a warning
aimed largely at Milosevic that military intervention is possible
if Kosovo violence isn't halted.
	   U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger reiterated Sunday
that NATO is prepared to take the necessary steps to stop the
serious escalation of violence in Kosovo.

Opposition aims for gains in Baja California mayoral, state congress vote 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Opposition parties set their sights on
winning key mayorships from the ruling party in the northern state
of Baja California as polls opened in state congress and mayoral
elections Sunday.
	   The state, home to burgeoning population and a growing number of
foreign assembly plants, also faces severe development and crime
problems. It was one of the first Mexican states to vote an
opposition-party governor into power.
	   Election officials and police reported few problems as the
state's 2,337 polling places opened at 8:00 a.m. (1500 GMT). At
stake are all 25 seats in the state congress and five key mayoral
posts.
	   A few polling places failed to open on time because of a lack of
personnel.
	   Turnout among the state's 1,231,667 registered voters was light
despite good weather, as state residents apparently stayed home to
watch World Cup soccer play.
	   The opposition National Action Party _ which also holds the
governorship _ is expected to hang onto the mayorships of Tijuana
and Mexicali, the state's largest city and it's capital,
respectively.
	   Polls also favor National Action to take the port of Ensenada,
currently governed by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party,
known by its Spanish initials PRI.
	   Meanwhile, the left-center Democratic Revolution Party is
positioned to take the border city of Tecate from the PRI,
according to recent polls. In the fifth race, the town of Playas de
Rosarito is holding its first mayoral election Sunday.
	   Results are not expected to begin trickling in until after polls
close at 6:00 p.m. (0100 GMT).

Britain sweeps relay to take home track and field cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Britain swept the 4x400-meter
relay in the final day of the European track and field Cup Sunday
to take first place in the men's program and take home the Cup of
Florence.
	   Russia dominated in nine of 19 women's events and finished with
124 points against Germany's 108 to win the Silver Maid Cup. France
was third with 93 points.
	   Ten European nations competed in the two-day meet at Petrovsky
Stadium to decide the two best teams to compete in the World Cup in
Johannesburg, South Africa, in September.
	   Russia was six points behind Britain when Yevgeni Smiryagin won
the pole vault competition with a 5 meter, 60 centimeters jump to
put his team a point ahead while Mike Edwards failed to overcome
5.10 in three tries.
	   Then, in the 110-meter hurdles, Britain's Colin Jackson failed
to better his world record of 12.91, but he crossed the finish line
in 13.17 to win the event.
	   His teammate Douglas Walker came in first in the 200 meters with
a time of 20.42 and put Britain two points ahead. British triple
jumper Jonathan Edwards was just a meter behind his world mark of
18 meters, 29 centimeters to give Britain a lead of 98 points
against Germany's 96.5.
	   Boris Henry of Germany then sent his javelin 84 meters, 77
centimeters to push his country to only 1.5 point lead over Britain
with only one event left in the program.
	   Roger Black, Mark Richardson, James Baulch and Iwan Thomas
cleared the 4x400 meters relay in 3 minutes, 00.95 seconds to win
event and team competition in men's program with a total of 111
points.
	   Germany came in second with 108.5 and Russia was third with 102.
	   Fiona May of Italy has improved her Italian long jump record of
7.03, clearing 7.08 to win the event.
	   About 4,000 spectators watched the meet in the 25,000-seat
stadium.

World Cup: France's heart of soccer is happy, but can't help bleeding a bit 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with post-game color, comments.
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ The heart of French soccer skipped a beat
Sunday and then raced to a delirious pulse in this former mining
town with a downtown stadium that seats more people than its entire
population.
	   France squeaked by Paraguay, 1-0, in sudden-death overtime to
advance to World Cup quarter finals against Italy. The same streets
that days ago were occupied by riot troops facing down English
hooligans and German neo-Nazis were jammed with dancing French
fans.
	   ``I was weeping in there,'' said Gilbert Bournot, a Parisian who
brought his family north for the play-off. ``My heart is
worn-out.'' Marcel Coppet, who also drove up from Paris, just shook
his head, still in shock. ``I need a drink,'' he said.
	   The game at the Felix Bollaert Stadium was a particular triumph
for the locals of Lens, who survived a dangerous week of living
among foreign thugs. They could finally show their true selves _
the most passionate and knowledgeable fans of France.
	   Yet even on a victorious sunny day for the Les Bleus, the city's
heart bled just a bit. Even though Racing Lens became French club
champion against all the odds, none of its players was deemed
worthy of a place on the French squad of 22.
	   That didn't stop the town from partying. One youth shinnied up
the pole of a distinctive monument by the stadium: a revolving
soccer ball in yellow and red, Lens' famed colors of ``blood and
gold.'' Others rode the crowds' shoulders, screaming: ``Allez les
Bleus.''
	   Everywhere, there were swirls of the blue, white and red of the
French tricolor flag.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ First the French prepared, then they partied.
	   Wary of potential politically charged violence connected with
the second-round World Cup match between England and Argentina in
Saint-Etienne, French organizers on Sunday doubled their security
contingent for Tuesday's game to 3,000.
	   But more than 550 kilometers (340 miles) to the north, that was
the least of any Frenchman's thoughts. They were concerned more
about how to celebrate France's 1-0 extra time victory over
Paraguay.
	   Conga lines of happy, face-painted French wearing all kinds of
goofy hats danced through Stade Felix Bollaert and into the streets
of Lens, clogging the narrow avenues and alleys with blurs of reds,
whites, and blues.
	   Their hero was defender Laurent Blanc, who ended more than 113
minutes of goalless play with the first ``Golden Goal'' in World
Cup history. His right-footed sweep off a header by David Trezeguet
from six meters (yards) beat Paraguayan 'keeper Jose Luis
Chilavert, who managed to get the outside of his right hand on the
ball but couldn't keep it from bounding into the net.
	   ``This is the most incredible joy to score in this way,'' Blanc
said. ``We have criticized the Golden Goal in the past, yet here we
profitted from it. What went through me when I scored was just
indescribable.
	   ``We were fighting, fighting, fighting and we got our reward in
the last few minutes,'' the Olympique Marseille defender said.
	   ``I promised myself that I would score in the World Cup and I
did.''
	   The French will have five days to celebrate, and prepare for
Italy in a quarterfinal matchup at Saint-Denis' Stade de France.
	   Nigeria faced Denmark in Sunday's other second-round match, with
the winner earning a quarterfinal pairing against defending
champion Brazil.
	   France's victory in Lens soothed the nerves of 40,000 anxious
Frenchmen in the stadium and the other 58 million across the
country.
	   Chilavert, the flamboyant 'keeper known for his offensive forays
on free kicks and penalties, made four more saves in extra time
before Blanc finally beat him.
	   ``France has a well-deserved victory. They impressed me very
much,'' Paraguay's coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``It was a
great effort from my players but we made a few errors near the end
probably because of fatigue.''
	   The result gave the small town of Lens something to smile about
after living through the tension and violence brought by visiting
fans from Germany and England.
	   In Saint-Etienne, security officials on Sunday warned of the
``speed and severity'' they would act to quell and prevent the
types of outbreaks stirred earlier in the tournament by some
English and German fans.
	   English fans clashed with North African youths in Marseille, and
Germans were accused of beating a French policeman into a coma in
Lens.
	   With English fans already having taunted French police with
chants invoking World War II, French organizers were well aware of
lingering animosity from the 1982 Falkland Islands war between the
English and Argentines.
	   Argentina's 1986 World Cup quarterfinal victory over England on
Diego Maradona's notorious ``Hand of God'' goal only added to the
mix.
	   ``We will not hesitate. Those engaged in violence will be
arrested and punished immediately,'' Saint-Etienne Chief of Police
Jean-Ives Audin said.
	   With an additional 1,500 police on the streets of Saint-Etienne,
the security contingent was almost twice the size used for previous
matches in the city of 200,000.
	   English hooligans and their Argentine counterparts, known as
``barrasbravas,'' have a long history of causing havoc in their
countries, and fought a bloody battle during the 1986 World Cup in
Mexico.

Chilavert vs. Barthez has Chilavert as hero, Barthez as winner 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with match
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Goalkeepers are different and Sunday's World
Cup thriller between France and Paraguay proved it again.
	   On one side stood Jose Luis Chilavert, an enigma more famous
than the rest of the Paraguayan team combined.
	   For 113 minutes Chilavert swatted away everything that came
within his range, yet he was a losing hero Sunday, when he could
not stop the unstoppable _ a point blank volley from Laurent Blanc
that gave France a 1-0 victory and a place in the quarterfinals.
	   Having long called himself ``the greatest,'' on Sunday many
began to believe it.
	   On the other end stood Fabien Barthez, with a shaven head and
fiery, hypnotic eyes that could freeze an opposing striker at
point-blank range. He rarely had to intervene, but did enough to
ensure France's third shutout in four games.
	   Barthez lives life at a heady pace.
	   He loves driving his Porsche at high speeds along France's rocky
Mediterranean coastline and has a love for cannabis that already
has earned him a two-month suspension last year.
	   Now, he is getting high on the World Cup and there was nothing
quite like a confrontation with the mighty Chilavert.
	   Afterward, he jubilantly made the long trek to the opposing end
but turned serious when he met Chilavert face-to-face, the
Paraguayan mired in his disappointment. Both men clenched hands and
embraced.
	   Chilavert allowed only one goal in the so-called Group of Death
against Spain, Bulgaria and Nigeria.
	   Chilavert instills fear in any defense when he comes forward for
his famous free kicks. He also takes penalties for his team, and
already has four goals to his credit for Paraguay. He has even
scored on a 55-meter lob in the Argentinean league.
	   That didn't come into play, with tension being far too high for
any theatrics.
	   He kept shouting at his team and the referee, quickly earning
him a yellow card. And all through the game, he kept wasting time
in every way possible to get his overmatched team into the penalty
shootout, he missed by six minutes.
	   In the 16th minute, Chilavert showed all his class when he dove
and punched away a bouncing shot from Bernard Diomede. Three
minutes later a 20-meter shot from Djorkaeff went just wide.
	   Up to the 114th minute he was unbeatable. Four minutes earlier,
Robert Pires moved up and his right-foot shot had to be stopped by
Chilavert twice.
	   Barthez didn't have the time to show such drama but has proven
in the past he is a winner too.
	   Barthez was just 21 when he won the European Champions' Cup with
Marseille in 1993.
	   Chilavert, 33, has won five league titles in Paraguay and
Argentina, the Copa Libertadores and the 1994 Toyota Cup title with
Velez Sarsfeld against AC Milan.
	   And don't cross his way when he is in a bad mood. His mouth is
almost as big as his hands and some 90 kilos (199 pounds) are
spread out over his 1.88-meter (6-foot-2) frame.
	   Earlier this month, he got into a fight with a journalist who
dared to criticize him.

World Cup: Hiddink keeps faith in Cocu, puts Seedorf in midfield With Sports-Soccer-Netherlands-Yugoslavia. 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Makeshift striker Phillip Cocu will keep
Patrick Kluivert out of the Dutch starting lineup for its round of
16 match with Yugoslavia, coach Guus Hiddink said Sunday.
	   Cocu took Kluivert's place next to Dennis Bergkamp after the
young AC Milan striker was handed a two-match suspension for
elbowing Lorenzo Staelens in the Netherlands' World Cup opener
against Belgium.
	   ``I am very disappointed,'' Kluivert said after hearing he would
be on the bench for Monday's match. ``As a player you want to be in
the starting lineup and if you aren't, of course you are
disappointed.''
	   Cocu, normally a defensive midfielder, scored a goal in each
game he started in Kluivert's place.
	   In another surprise move, Hiddink paired old Ajax teammates
Edgar Davids and Clarence Seedorf in the center of the midfield,
dropping Jonk to accommodate Seedorf.
	   The last time Seedorf and Davids played together in midfield was
on opposing sides in the Champions Cup final in Amsterdam last
month. Seedorf's Real Madrid beat Davids' Juventus 1-0. They have
never played together in the center of midfield on the same team.
	   Hiddink said he was using Seedorf to keep the dangerous Yugoslav
strikers out of range of the Dutch goal.
	   ``Yugoslavia is a team which likes to play deep in your half.
They have a lot of skilled individuals who can win free kicks
around the 16-yard (meter) area and who are very dangerous from
free kicks. They are also good one-on-one so I want to keep them as
far from the goal as possible,'' Hiddink said.
	   Jonk said he was surprised by his omission. ``But the trainer
makes the decision and that's it,'' he said.
	   Hiddink said that the attacking style of both sides could
produce a memorable match.
	   ``I think we could have a nice game,'' he said. ``If the
attitude is right from their side it will be from our side as well,
so it will be a very exciting, promising game.''
	   The lineup as announced by Hiddink: Edwin van der Sar; Michael
Reiziger, Jaap Stam, Frank de Boer, Arthur Numan; Ronald de Boer,
Clarence Seedorf, Edgar Davids, Marc Overmars; Phillip Cocu, Dennis
Bergkamp.

Brazilian media praises Cesar Sampaio, Ronaldinho 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Cesar Sampiao and Ronaldinho,
whose combined goals allowed the national soccer team to beat
Chile, received high marks from critics, Brazilian media reported
Sunday.
	   ``The stars Cesar Sampaio and Ronaldinho shone in the Park of
Princes and Brazil won again,'' O Estado de Sao Paulo reported.
	   The combined goals of the two players gave Brazil a 4-1 victory
over Chile on Saturday and allowed Brazil to advance to the
quarterfinals of the World Cup competition.
	   Most newspapers gave their team high praise in bold headlines
and said the victory enables Brazil to leave behind the defeat it
suffered at the hands of Norway last week.
	   Globo, Brazil's largest newspaper led its sports section with a
large headline reading ``Only three left,'' a reference to the
number of games Brazil must win before it can claim a fifth World
Cup title.
	   Ronaldinho, who was twice named by FIFA as the best player,
received high marks, but most media noted his performance was not
flawless.
	   ``He made made mistakes in the first half but he successfully
inspired himself in the final stage,'' O Estado de Sao Paulo
reported.
	   Soccer critic Armando Nogueira, writing for Folha de Sao Paulo,
called it ``a victory which alleviates anxieties.''
	   ``The Brazilian team played without the brilliant intensity of
other battles but still demonstrated will, discipline and
tenacity,'' he wrote.
	   Brazilian media was critical of the Chilean defense, but stopped
short of blaming goalkeeper Nelson Tapia, whom it absolved of any
blame.
	   Folha de Sao Paulo said it expected the next game, against the
winner of Denmark vs. Nigeria, will be more difficult. ``Either of
those teams will demand more of Brazil than Chile demanded,'' it
said.
	   Ronaldinho made two goals, but lost the ball five times and made
six bad passes, Globo reported.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants dug into
their positions Sunday around a besieged Serb village in Kosovo _ a
showdown international officials fear could plunge the secessionist
province into all-out war.
	   Fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have maintained an
armed ring around Kijevo for 11 days, said they were deeply
entrenched and were bracing for another attack after an assault on
their positions late Saturday.
	   Witnesses said Yugoslav helicopters, all painted black, strafed
and bombed the Kijevo positions for 90 minutes late Saturday night.
The Serb Media Center, which releases official Serb statements,
said the gunners were providing cover fire for the evacuation of
four women and a child from Kijevo.

Iranian-Americans urge better ties with homeland

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For the umpteenth time, Iran was under fire in
Congress.
	   Sen. Dianne Feinstein was leading the calls on this occasion,
urging tighter background checks for students entering the United
States from Iran and other hostile countries. Her concern: American
universities could potentially help terrorist-supporting countries.
	   Feinstein's criticism of Iran was nothing new in Washington, but
the response she received was. Soon after her February testimony,
she was contacted by a group of Iranian-Americans objecting to her
comments.
	   ``We were severely insulted,'' said Dr. Kamyar Kalantar, a San
Francisco physician who says there has never been a terrorism case
in the United States involving an Iranian student or immigrant.
	   Large numbers of Iranians began coming to the United States
during the 1979 Islamic Revolution that drove the shah from power.
	   But with U.S.-Iranian animosities seething _ Iranians held
Americans hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Washington accused
Iran of supporting terrorists, and Iranian leaders tarred the
United States as the decadent ``great Satan'' _ few Iranians got
involved in politics here.
	   Now, led by a savvy new generation and encouraged by the
election of a moderate president in Iran, Iranian-Americans are
increasingly urging the United States to make peace with their
former homeland.
	   ``To take political action is kind of a new frontier. I'm (just)
worried we're too late,'' said Shahriar Afshar, president of the
Iranian Trade Association, a group working to end U.S. sanctions on
Iran.
	   In addition to lobbying members of Congress, Iranian-Americans
are writing newspaper columns and cooperating with other interest
groups to pursue their cause. With about 1 million ethnic Iranians
living in America, they are also considering endorsing candidates.
	   Iranian-American activists interviewed for this story said they
have no ties to any political faction in Iran. But they clearly
support Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to improve
ties with the United States, despite hard-line opposition in his
country.
	   ``It's a new era in Iran. Sure Khatami's got a difficult time.
Now we want to help him,'' Afshar said.
	   More than half the Iranians living in the United States are in
California, with large communities in New York, Texas and
Washington, D.C., activists say.
	   Most have kept a low profile. Some were hindered by language or
cultural barriers. Others feared retribution over Iran's alleged
ties to terrorism and the hostage crisis.
	   ``Being an Iranian in the U.S. during the 1980s was not an easy
time,'' Afshar said. ``We were from a country that it was almost
publicly acceptable to hate.''
	   That appears to be changing with the generation of
Iranian-Americans who grew up in the United States.
	   ``These children are very interested in rediscovering their
roots. They also have a sense on how things are done in the U.S. in
a way their parents did not,'' said Gary Sick, a presidential
adviser during the Iranian revolution.
	   Amir Zamaninia, a spokesman for Iran's U.N. mission, said his
government has no ties with Iranian-American groups. He declined
comment on their growing range of activities.
	   Some U.S. corporations with interest in Iran are joining the
lobbying effort.
	   The San Diego-based Iranian Trade Association has attracted more
than 20 corporate sponsors to its campaign against sanctions, said
Afshar, a 30-year-old former worker in that city's trade office.
Among his sponsors is Conoco, which had a dlrs 1 billion oil-field
project in Iran blocked by the U.S. government in 1995.
	   Gary Marfin, Conoco's manager for government affairs, said the
company's alliance with Iranian-Americans is part of its general
opposition to economic sanctions.
	   ``About the only impact sanctions do have is lost business and
lost job opportunities in the U.S.,'' Marfin said.
	   Another group, Iranians for International Cooperation, seeks to
promote dialogue and cultural exchanges as well as economic ties
between Iran and America.
	   Trita Parsi, a graduate student who leads the group from Sweden,
said opening Iran to the West will reduce tensions and ultimately
help average people in impoverished Iran.
	   Noting that most exiles still have relatives in Iran, he said
ordinary Iranians want friendly ties with the West.
	   ``Khatami has promised more personal freedom, the rule of law
and better relations with Iran's neighbors and the West. We agree
with these goals and want to do what we can to make their
fulfillment possible,'' Parsi said.
	   On the individual level, hundreds of Iranian-Americans have
contacted members of Congress since Khatami's election, said Rep.
Robert Ney, R-Ohio, who is a leading supporter of improving
relations with Iran.
	   ``About 90 percent of these people ask us to please think about
communication'' with Iran, he said.

World Cup: Pair of goals in first 12 minutes gives Danes 2-0 lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Peter Moller scored on nearly his
first touch of the tournament and Denmark scored a pair of goals in
the first 12 minutes to lead Nigeria 2-0 at halftime of their
second-round World Cup match Sunday night.
	   Moller, with 11 caps to his credit and making his first
appearance in France '98, buried his chance from the top of the
penalty area in the third minute.
	   Martin Jorgensen chipped the ball out of midfield to Michael
Laudrup, who touched it into the penalty area before sending it
back to Moller.
	   The 26-year-old striker one-timed a strike that squeezed between
diving goalkeeper Peter Rufai and the right post.
	   Moeller had a hand in Denmark's second goal, blasting a touched
on free kick from five meters outside the arc that forced Rufai
into a two-handed block. But the Nigerians didn't react fast enough
to clear the rebound and Brian Laudrup ran onto the loose ball to
put it away from eight meters.
	   The early goals continued a pattern of first-half woes for
Nigeria.
	   The Africans trailed Spain before rallying twice and allowed the
fastest goal of the tournament, 52 seconds, in a 3-1 loss to
Paraguay.
	   The Nigerians took nearly 30 minutes to recover from the pair of
goals, finally getting some sustained possession and pressure on
Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel, but creating nothing dangerous.
	   The best chance they had came in the 39th minute when Jay-Jay
Okocha worked himself free at the top of the penalty area, but shot
well over the bar.
	   The winner of Sunday night's match was to earn the dubious honor
of meeting defending champion Brazil in the quarterfinals on Friday
in Nantes.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Reaching out to the generation that will lead
China in the new millennium, U.S. President Bill Clinton is
offering encouragement and advice to students on their quest for
political reform and economic prosperity.
	   ``I feel much better'' about signs of openness in China, he
said.
	   After a day of breathtaking sightseeing at the Great Wall and in
the ancient palaces of the Forbidden City, Clinton was to address
students Monday at Peking University, a quiet, leafy campus whose
students were the driving force behind the 1989 pro-democracy
protests in Tiananmen Square.
	   With a history as a center of liberal thinking, the school now
is closely monitored by the government, which restricts visitors.
Some 24,000 undergraduates attend the university, founded in 1898.
	   The administration hoped Clinton's remarks would be broadcast
live across China, as was his vigorous debate over human rights
with President Jiang Zemin at a news conference Saturday.
	   The university appearance was to be Clinton's final stop in this
capital city before an evening flight to Shanghai, the booming
commercial center at the mouth of the Yangtze River. A highlight
will be Clinton's participation in a Shanghai radio call-in show
Tuesday.
	   On his final night in Beijing, Clinton dined privately with
Jiang at his official private residence inside the walled
leadership compound, Zhongnanhai, a former imperial playground next
to the Forbidden City.
	   A White House official said the 3 1/2-hour event, attended by
American and Chinese officials as well as the president's wife,
daughter and mother-in law, was ``more social than substance'' but
touched on the Asian financial crisis, legal codes and the rule of
law.
	   They talked about movies, and Jiang recalled seeing ``Gone With
the Wind'' years ago in Shanghai. Clinton spoke enthusiastically
about climbing the steep path atop the Great Wall on Sunday and
wandering among the golden roofed pagodas of the Forbidden City.
	   Clinton told reporters earlier that the Great Wall was ``even
more magnificent that I had imagined.'' He wrote that message in an
official guest book and underlined the word ``magnificent.''
	   In a cobblestone courtyard near the Forbidden City's Gate of
Celestial Purity, Clinton said China is on a path of progress.
	   ``The last 25 years, it's been changing quite a lot.'' Asked if
China had changed enough, he said, ``After yesterday, I feel much
better.'' He was referring to Saturday's news conference _ an
unprecedented open discussion of differences.
	   U.S. administration officials hit the Sunday morning shows back
home to talk up Clinton's visit and assert that 600 million people
_ half of China's 1.2 billion _ watched Clinton's lively exchange
with Jiang.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger and James Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, all cited
the same number, but it was not clear how they arrived at it. China
has no known television rating system.
	   The officials said extraordinary changes have occurred in China,
but not enough. ``We have a long way to go,'' Albright told
reporters.
	   Berger said a democratic China ``may be a ways off.''
	   ``They now can choose where they work, where they go to
school,'' Berger said. ``Their standard of living has increased
dramatically, there's been some greater degree of freedom of
expression. But when it comes to public expression, public dissent,
this is still quite a repressive government.
	   ``Hopefully it's changing,'' Berger said. ``I believe over time
it will change.''
	   Albright previewed Clinton's remarks at Peking University.
	   ``The purpose of the speech is again to showcase and feature
American values and talk about the importance of culture and
education,'' she said. ``Part of what this trip is about is to
change stereotypical views, helping Americans understand Chinese
better and vice versa. The speech is in that context.''
	   The Clintons began the day by worshipping at Chongwenmen Church,
the largest Protestant church in China. Picking up on the pastor's
sermon about unity, Clinton told the congregation, ``I believe our
faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world of
different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   Parishioners were hopeful Clinton's appearance at the
government-sanctioned church would make a difference.
	   ``Now that he's prayed with us, the Chinese government will
greatly relax its policies toward us Christians and our churches,''
said Liu Suxing. She complained that churches not sanctioned by the
government, where many Christians prefer to worship, often are shut
down. The government ``says there is freedom of religion, but in
reality it's not free,'' she said.
	   There was a brief commotion when a middle-aged woman, unknown to
the parishioners, strode up the aisle to within five feet of
Clinton in the front pew, determined to see the president.
	   She was hustled to the back of the church and remained quietly
for the service. Afterward, she was allowed a few words with
Clinton and expressed hope that China's leaders would become
Christians.

	   CEYHAN, Turkey (AP) _ Rescuers on Sunday pulled out an
11-year-old survivor from the rubble of a quake that struck
southern Turkey a day earlier, killing at least 112 people,
including children crushed at a birthday party.
	   More than 1,000 people were injured across the region. Hardest
hit were Ceyhan and Adana, a city of 1 million people and epicenter
of the quake.
	   Alarmed by scores of aftershocks, tens of thousands of residents
fled, leaving laundry on balconies and taking bedding and TV sets
with them to gardens and other makeshift living areas.
	   ``About 25 people may still be trapped under the rubble in
Ceyhan,'' said fireman Ekrem Dogdu early Sunday evening.
	   Earlier, firefighters dug out the bodies of three children who
were killed at a birthday party in a building that collapsed.
	   Rescuers pulled the 11-year-old survivor who had been pinned
down in the debris of a flattened five-story building for 24 hours.
	   With a crowd applauding, doctors checked the pulse of the tired
boy as he was put into an ambulance. Rescuers were still searching
for his mother, grandparents and two older brothers.
	   Among those killed Saturday were 46 people in Ceyhan, terminus
town for an Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline, which the energy ministry
said suffered no damage.
	   Forty-four people died in Adana, 50 kms (30 miles) to the west.
Among them a small boy whom two American tourists tried in vain to
rescue, private Channel D TV reported.
	   On Sunday, survivors mourned their relatives at area cemeteries.
	   Several victims, wrapped in the traditional Muslim white shroud,
were buried in joint funerals that were hastily arranged because of
the hot weather.
	   Many of the victims in Adana were living in slums districts
where houses were poorly built. The slums are crowded with Kurds
who have fled the war in their southeastern villages between the
army and the guerrillas.
	   The other victims were found in nearby towns and villages.
	   At the outskirts of Adana is Incirlik air base, used by U.S. and
British jets to patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
	   Staff Sgt. Joel Langton of the U.S. Air Force at Incirlik said
35 people affiliated with the base suffered mild bruises and cuts.
He did not give their nationalities.
	   The quake _ Turkish seismologists put the magnitude at 6.3 while
the U.S. Geological Survey estimated it at 6.2 _ was slightly felt
along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, but hotel officials said
foreigners at resorts remained calm.

After South Africa, Chirac lands in Mozambique

<TEXT>
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac
pledged his country's full backing Sunday for economic
reconstruction in Mozambique after years of bloody civil war.
	   ``My message is a message of hope and confidence...you can count
on France, her people, her enterprises, her expertise and, above
all, her solidarity,'' Chirac told a state banquet hosted by
Mozambican President Joachim Chissano.
	   He said Mozambicans have overcome many of their differences
since a peace accord ended 16 years of civil war in 1992. Chirac
saluted what he called the vision and courage of their leaders that
shone as an example in other African conflicts.
	   French investors are already participants in a dlrs 225 million
aluminium smelting project, said Chirac, the first French president
to visit Mozambique.
	   ``We can go further together,'' he said, citing French interest
in the development of telecommunications, energy resources and
railroads.
	   France is one of Mozambique's lowest ranking Western trade
partners, far behind Portugal, Britain, Italy, Germany and neighbor
South Africa,.
	   Earlier Sunday, tribal drummers and dancers greeted Chirac as he
arrived in this former Portuguese colony, where general political
stability has led to record economic growth.
	   His four-nation, six-day tour marks a departure in Paris' policy
toward Africa. After focusing for decades on French-speaking
Africa, Chirac announced last year France would curtail its
military interventions _ and expenditures _ in that region and
reach out to other parts of the continent.
	   Chirac arrived from South Africa, the key stop on a trip aimed
at bringing closer political and economic ties. About 50 top French
business executives are with him.
	   Officials said Chirac will meet in Maputo with former rebel
leader Afonso Dhlakama, now head of the political opposition,
before he leaves Monday for the former Portuguese colony of Angola,
the final stop on the trip that also took him to Namibia.
	   Dhlakama signed a peace accord with the government in 1992 to
end a civil war waged by his Mozambique National Resistance _ known
by its Portuguese acronym RENAMO. The fighting caused Mozambique to
be among the world's poorest nations.
	   The first democratic elections were held in 1996, and economic
reforms spurred a 12 percent increase in gross domestic product
last year, the highest economic growth in southern Africa.
	   Annual inflation fell to 2.4 percent, the lowest in the region,
and compared favorably with European and North American rates.
	   Angola is still battling to implement a peace accord singed in
1994 that ended its civil war. Officials said Chirac's talks there
were expected to review the ailing peace process.
	   In South Africa's wine region, Chirac awarded retired Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu one of France's highest awards for his
anti-apartheid activities.
	   Tutu, who had led protests against apartheid which ended with
South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994, said the struggle
had been inspired by the French revolution.

Disappearance of U.N. envoy prompts renewed calls to fulfill peace pact 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS UNITA statement.
<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The day after the United Nations envoy to
Angola disappeared in a plane crash, the international community on
Sunday urged former rebel movement UNITA to relinquish control of
its four remaining strongholds.
	   In a joint statement, the United Nations and the so-called
``troika,'' made up of Portugal, Russia and the United States,
called on UNITA to ``cooperate fully in the normalization of state
administration'' throughout this former Portuguese colony.
	   Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye disappeared Saturday when his plane
crashed in the Ivory Coast.
	   Rescuers Sunday found the wreckage of the plan surrounded by the
mangled body parts and six personal identity documents, including
one belonging to 59-year-old Beye. There were no signs of
survivors.
	   The accident happened just days before the United Nations' July
1 deadline for the former rebels to hand over their strongholds to
government control. Failure to comply will mean harsh sanctions.
	   UNITA said the United Nations should immediately appoint a new
special envoy to Angola to fill the ``huge void'' left by Beye's
disappearance, a spokesman said by phone from the former rebels'
headquarters in Bailundo, 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of the
capital.
	   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he refused to evaluate
Beye's personal contribution to the peace process.

Puerto Rican privatization sparks war with labor unions With Puerto Rico-Telephone Strike 
</HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A policeman's finger is ripped off
by a bomb. A striking worker is beaten unconscious by riot police.
And it all stems from Puerto Rico's sale of the state telephone
company to a consortium led by U.S.-based GTE.
	   The unions' fury at the deal signed by Gov. Pedro Rossello on
Wednesday reflects frustration at the diminishing influence of
labor in a land where jobs have always been scarce, employers often
abusive and strikes occasionally deadly.
	   The rancor on both sides is amplified by the fact that Rossello
and most of the labor leaders also find themselves on opposing
sides of a debate over Puerto Rico's status. The results of that
debate will decide the future for generations on this Caribbean
island of 3.8 million.
	   Rossello wants to make Puerto Rico, which has been a U.S.
territory for a century, into a full-fledged U.S. state.
	   Union leaders tend toward Puerto Rico's militant minority, who
favor independence. They say Rossello is ``selling the national
patrimony'' to a U.S. firm to boost his statehood agenda and accuse
him of despotism. In protest, they have replaced the double ``S''
in his name with a swastika in placards and flyers.
	   Police have said they suspect a clandestine pro-independence
guerrilla group called Los Macheteros planted a bomb that maimed an
officer Thursday.
	   Protesters have also cut off phone service to hundreds of
thousands, smashed bank machines and torched phone booths. Police
reported more bomb threats overnight Sunday and remained on guard
in front of telephone company offices across the island.
	   With no sign of compromise on either side _ Rossello has shocked
many with his stubborn aloofness _ there are fears that Puerto Rico
will continue its history of violent strikes.
	   In the worst case, Teamsters set a fire at the DuPont Plaza
hotel on New Year's Eve 1986, killing 97 people.
	   That militancy reflected the power union leaders achieved as a
result of the tremendous and rapid transformations in Puerto Rico's
labor market.
	   Even under the Spanish, there was a rash of strikes against
rising prices that started in 1892. The labor movement grew after
the United States took over the island in 1898.
	   ``One of the first things (they) did was to legalize labor
unions and the military governor declared an eight-hour work day,''
said historian Gervasio Garcia.
	   Most workers were unionized as the island moved from
family-based farming to huge plantations, especially sugar
plantations often controlled by U.S. firms.
	   Cane cutters formed a pillar of organized labor as they united
against exploitative plantation owners who paid little _ sometimes
only in coupons valid at overpriced plantation stores.
	   Puerto Rico is now transforming itself into a service economy
increasingly integrated into that of the United States. The power
of unions is on the wane as they find themselves facing the most
free-market leader the island has known.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the 7,900-employee telephone
company is the most ambitious part of Rossello's drive to privatize
everything from utilities to health care to the once-mighty sugar
industry.
	   State-run companies have become increasingly inefficient and
top-heavy with managers.
	   The phone company deal, which was approved by legislators, is
unlikely to unravel because of the strikes. But the protests show
little sign of waning.
	   While fewer than 10 percent of Puerto Rican workers now belong
to unions, according to Garcia, the figure triples among the
territory's 250,000 government workers.
	   Despite protests, Rossello has sold hotels and a shipping
company and is courting private investment in the power industry.
Management of the water company has been privatized.
	   The government has opted to pay for health care through private
insurance companies and is selling off hospitals.
	   And under a proposed school voucher program, Puerto Rico's
government hopes to give families money for their children's
education so they could choose private or public schools.
	   Some of that money would come from funds now allocated to the
University of Puerto Rico _ a hotbed of independence-minded
professors and students _ ensuring more unrest.

Bird's road: French Lick to Hall of Fame AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN
<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ It was just a matter of time for Larry Bird. And
now that time has come.
	   A rule that players must be retired five years has kept him out
of the Hall of Fame. But he's eligible now and set to win a spot in
the basketball shrine on Monday.
	   Will he react with a huge smile? Or will his poker face mask his
emotions? After all, Bird stood, expressionless, as Indiana's coach
when Reggie Miller's 3-pointer with 0.7 seconds left tied this
year's Eastern Conference finals with Chicago.
	   Bird gave no clues, saying he wouldn't talk about the Hall of
Fame until Monday.
	   ``It's kind of hard to speculate on what somebody's feeling,''
said Robert Parish, Bird's frontcourt partner for 12 seasons with
the Boston Celtics. ``I'd like to think that would be a proud
moment for him. It's the crowning jewel of his basketball career.''
	   Just as it's likely to be for the entire Class of '98, which
will be inducted Oct. 2 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the hall's
home.
	   Each year, it admits at least three nominees from the regular
category and one each from the women's, veterans' and international
categories. A panel of 24 unidentified selectors makes the final
picks.
	   The four first-time nominees among the 11 in the regular
category are Bird, Adrian Dantley, Chet Walker and former Harlem
Globetrotter Marques Haynes. The other seven are Larry Costello,
Artis Gilmore, Gus Johnson, Sidney Moncrief and coaches Alex
Hannum, John Thompson and Tex Winter.
	   Jody Conradt, coach at Texas the past 22 seasons, and Harley
Redin, who coached at Wayland Baptist, were nominated in the
women's basketball category. Grady Lewis, a shoe company executive,
and Arnie Risen, who ended his 13-year NBA career in 1958 with
Boston, were nominated in the veterans' category. The nominees in
the international category are Yugoslavian coach Aleksandar Nikolic
and Ubiratan Pereira Maciel of Brazil.
	   Last Tuesday, Lenny Wilkens joined John Wooden as the only
two-time inductees. Already in as a player, Wilkens was honored as
a coach.
	   Bird would be the 24th Celtic chosen, joining Bill Russell, Bob
Cousy, Tom Heinsohn, John Havlicek and coach Red Auerbach, among
others.
	   ``To me, it was obviously a lot different than it will be for
Larry Bird because I had absolutely no confidence in the world that
I would get in,'' said Bill Walton, a Hall of Famer who joined the
Celtics late in his career. ``I had the most frustrating and
disappointing and exasperating career in the NBA.''
	   After a brilliant career at UCLA, he played just 468 NBA games
over 13 years, counting the four complete seasons he missed with
injuries.
	   Heinsohn made the Hall as a player in 1986, the year the Celtics
last won the NBA title, and is now a broadcaster for the team.
	   ``Bird will be elected into the Hall of Fame in the first year
he's eligible, which is an unusual feat,'' Heinsohn said. ``Mine
was like 21 years after (retirement) so I learned to live without
it.''

World Cup: Danes stun much-hyped Nigerians 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Peter Moller scored on nearly his
first touch of the tournament and Denmark had a pair of goals in
the first 12 minutes Sunday night before rolling to a 4-1 victory
over Nigeria and a quarterfinal meeting with Brazil.
	   The victory over the much-ballyhooed Africans put the 1992
European champions into the round of eight for the first time and
in only their second appearance at a World Cup. The only other time
Denmark reached the finals, it advanced to the second round in
1986.
	   It now must face defending champion Brazil on Friday at Nantes
for a place in the semifinals.
	   The early goals continued a pattern of first-half woes for
Nigeria.
	   The Africans trailed Spain before rallying twice and allowed the
fastest goal of the tournament, 51 seconds, in a 3-1 loss to
Paraguay.
	   Nigeria, the 1996 Olympic champion, was the last of five African
teams to be eliminated from the World Cup. After a second-round
appearance in its debut in 1994 and arriving in France with several
highly touted European-based players, Nigeria was touted as an
outsider who could possibly break through Europe and South
America's stranglehold on the tournament.
	   But defensive mistakes squashed their chances early.
	   Moller, with 11 caps to his credit and making his first
appearance in France '98, buried his opportunity from the top of
the penalty area in the third minute.
	   Martin Jorgensen chipped the ball out of midfield to Michael
Laudrup, who touched it into the penalty area before sending it
back to Moller.
	   The 26-year-old striker one-timed a left-footed strike that
squeezed between diving goalkeeper Peter Rufai and the right post.
	   Moller had a hand in Denmark's second goal, blasting a touched
on free kick from five meters outside the arc that forced Rufai
into a two-handed block. But the Nigerians didn't react fast enough
to clear the rebound and Brian Laudrup ran onto the loose ball to
put it away from eight meters.
	   The Nigerians took nearly 30 minutes to recover from the pair of
goals, finally getting some sustained possession and pressure on
Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel, but creating nothing dangerous.
	   The second half was more of the first with substitute Ebbe Sand
scoring on his second touch in the 60th minute.
	   Sand, who had replaced Moller less than 30 seconds before, took
a chip from Michael Laudrup, headed it forward and twisted to
volley a right footer from almost directly on top of the penalty
spot past Rufai.
	   Rufai's inability to hold another shot cost Nigeria a fourth
goal in the 76th minute. Jorgensen sent a low shot in from the
right that Rufai bobbled. Sand chased it down and with Rufai
chasing him, sent it back to Jorgensen, who crossed to Thomas
Helveg.
	   With no one guarding the net, the 27-year-old midfielder ripped
a blast into the roof of the net from just outside the goal box.
	   Nigeria finally saved some pride in the 77th when second-half
substitute Tijani Babangida volleyed in a cross from Mutiu Adepoju
at the far post.
	   With half the quarterifinal field set, Europe had three of the
four places as Denmark joined Italy and host France.

India says peace talks with Pakistan are at dead end 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Peace talks between India and Pakistan
to melt their 50-year rivalry have reached a dead end because of
the tough stands of both sides on Kashmir, the Indian prime
minister's top aide said Sunday.
	   ``India is looking at a wall,'' Brajesh Mishra, principal
adviser to Atal Bihari Vajpayee said in a television interview.
	   Pakistan has said the bitter dispute over Kashmir, which has
caused two wars between the countries, as the core issue for any
discussions. Both sides claim Kashmir. Two-thirds of the
predominantly Muslim territory is controlled by India, with the
rest in Pakistani hands.
	   Foreign Secretaries of both the countries have met in several
rounds of talks in New Delhi and Islamabad, but discussions got
bogged down after India refused to accept Pakistan's demand that a
separate working group be formed to discuss Kashmir.
	   Mishra told the privately owned STAR TV network India was ready
to discuss Kashmir, but would focus on its attempts to regain the
territory under Pakistani control.
	   ``We want to discuss how we can get back POK (Kashmir). Pakistan
wants to talk about a referendum and plebiscite,'' Mishra said.
	   ``Even if we were to sit down, we will have to admit failure.
And then Pakistan will say there must be third party mediation,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   India has rejected third country intervention in the Kashmir
issue. Pakistan has for years tried to internationalize the
dispute.
	   Predominately Hindu India repeatedly accuses officially Islamic
Pakistan of arming and training Kashmiri Muslim separatists.
Pakistan denies the charges. Indian Kashmir is its only
Muslim-majority state.
	   The Kashmir issue is likely to be the hottest topic on the
agenda of India's Vajpayee and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz
Sharif when they meet on the sidelines of the seven-nation summit
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation late July.

	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Fighting spread over the weekend
from Guinea-Bissau's capital to the central town of Mansoa as the
foreign ministers of Portugal and Angola joined efforts to
negotiate peace in the tiny West African country.
	   The government and the rebels met Sunday for the first time,
following an earlier meeting between the Portuguese and Angolan
Foreign Ministers and Guinea-Bissau's President Joao Bernardo
Vieira, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   Both sides will meet again Tuesday, without the mediators,
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama told Lusa.
	   Gama said Sunday's meeting was ``very positive'' and could be
decisive to the restoration of peace in Guinea-Bissau.
	   The talks occurred less than a day after the two ministers met
Guinea-Bissau rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane, an unidentified
official told Lusa.
	   ``The two ministers are analyzing the situation in
Guinea-Bissau,'' the official was quoted as saying. ``They will
pursue their contacts to try to obtain a platform of understanding
between the opposed parties.''
	   Earlier mediation efforts involving church leaders and a Gambian
envoy had failed to bring the side together in talks.
	   Meanwhile, a government delegation met Sunday night with rebel
representatives on a Portuguese navy ship anchored off the West
African county.
	   The government delegation was composed by two former members of
the ruling PAIGC party, Manuel ``Manecas'' dos Santos and Filinto
de Barros. It was not clear who represented the self-proclaimed
military junta.
	   ``We are very hopeful of finding a solution,'' de Barros told
reporters after the meeting.

Dickson wins Cadillac NFL Golf Classic in three-way playoff AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sunday results
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
	   CLIFTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Bob Dickson avoided a nearly
disastrous mistake on the 17th hole, then rolled in a 20-foot
(6-meter) birdie putt on the first playoff hole to win his first
Senior PGA tournament, the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, on Sunday.
	   Dickson's first PGA win since capturing the Andy Williams-San
Diego Open in 1973 wasn't assured until Larry Nelson missed a
5-foot (1.5-meter) birdie putt just seconds later to end the
three-way playoff.
	   Jim Colbert, who was looking for his first win since surgery for
prostate cancer in June, 1997, had missed a downhill 25-foot
(7.6-meter) putt on the par-5, 590 yard (540-meter) No. 18 at the
Upper Montclair Country Club seconds before Dickson converted.
	   The playoff hole marked the end to a congested final round in
which 10 players all hovered within two shots of the lead most of
the sunny, pleasant day.
	   Dickson, who shot a final-round 2-under-par 70, and Colbert (71)
seemed headed for a playoff before Nelson, who was looking for his
third win of the year, roared into the playoff with birdies on the
16th and 18th holes.
	   Nelson, who was trying to join Gil Morgan and Hale Irwin as the
only three-time winners this year, had a chip for an eagle on the
final hole of regulation but could only get it to within tap-in
range.
	   Dana Quigley (68), J.C. Snead (68), defending champion Bruce
Crampton (71) and Dave Stockton (71) all missed the playoff by a
shot with 8-under-par 208 totals. Bruce Summerhays, who was tied
for the lead with four holes to play before bogeys on two par 3s,
led four more golfers two shots behind the leaders.
	   Mike McCullough, who entered the final round with a one-shot
lead over Jay Sigel, fell apart on the back nine and finished at
5-under-par after a 77 along with Sigel (76).
	   Dickson nearly lost the championship at the par-3, 215-yard
(200-meter) No. 17. He put his tee shot on the green about 50 feet
(15 meters) from the pin, then putted with the pin still in the
hole and his caddie standing next to him. Had the ball struck the
pin, it would have been a two-shot penalty.
	   Colbert, who was playing in his group, said he saw the incident
and he was ready to remove the pin had the ball not stopped 5 feet
(1.5 meters) from it.
	   It was fortunate that the tournament had an electronic
scoreboard because there were enough leaders to fill most of the
first two pages.
	   Halfway through the round there were eight players tied for the
lead at 8-under-par. Five players were still tied when Dickson
birdied the 13th to join McCullough, Colbert, Summerhays and Nelson
at 9-under par.
	   Nelson and McCullough lost their share of the lead at the par-4,
12th hole. McCullough double-bogeyed after hitting into the water
next to the green, while Nelson bogeyed the hole.
	   That left Summerhays, Colbert and Dickson, who were all playing
in the same group, in the lead. Summerhays slipped out of
contention with bogeys at the 15th and 17th holes.
	   Colbert and Dickson went head to head over the final three
holes, and Colbert had a couple of chances to win, just missing
birdie putts on the 16th and 18th holes. Dickson kept his chances
alive, making a 5-foot par saver.
	   Nelson, who was two shots back with three holes to play, birdied
the 16th and got into the playoff on the par-5, No. 18, just over
the green in two and then chipping for a tap-in birdie.
	    &UR; DIVOTS &LR;  _ Arnold Palmer shot his second straight 1-under-par
71. He had gone 40 rounds without a sub-par round before breaking
the streak on Saturday.
	   ``I'm been going so poorly and I'm not going to continue that,''
said Palmer, whose last consecutive sub-par rounds were at the
Northville Classic in Long Island in August. ``Yesterday and today
were very encouraging. These rounds will keep me going.''

Sorenstam soars at ShopRite LPGA Classic AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sunday results; NEW to some points
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam was again nearly
perfect, making birdies on the final four holes for a 65 Sunday to
win the ShopRite LPGA Classic by four strokes over Juli Inkster.
	   Sorenstam, who finished at 17-under-par 196, made only one bogey
in 54 holes on the Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort.
	   She goes into the U.S. Open this week with victories in two
consecutive starts and top-10 finishes in 10 of 11 tournaments this
year.
	   Playing the same relentless game of hitting fairways and greens
that won the U.S. Open in 1995 and '96, Sorenstam grabbed a share
of the lead after the first round and never surrendered it,
shooting rounds of 66, 65 and 65.
	   While others made mistakes Sorenstam was sensational, just as
she was when she won her last U.S. Open in 1996 by hitting 51 of 56
fairways at Pine Needles in North Carolina.
	   Her only bogey of the week came on No. 12 on Saturday when she
had a 30-foot (9-meter) putt from above the hole and hit it 15 feet
(4.5 meters) past down the slippery slope, missing the par putt
coming back.
	   She shattered the tournament record of 6 under par on this
course set by Betsy King in 1987 and also broke the 12-under-par
ShopRite record set last year by Michelle McGann on the Greate Bay
Resort course. It was Sorenstam's 14th victory on the LPGA tour.
	   Lorie Kane closed with a 67 and was third at 203 and Helen
Dobson was at 204.
	   Donna Andrews, who had finished second in each of her last four
starts, made a run early with birdies on two of the first three
holes but cooled off and shot a 69 and was among those at 205.
	   Karrie Webb lifted her spirits going into the U.S. Open with a
course-record 64 that included her first hole-in-one in competition
when she sank a 6-iron from 169 yards (154 meters) on No. 7.
	   Webb closed with birdies on the final two holes to be at 6-under
207.
	   Paired in the final group, Sorenstam and Inkster were locked in
old-fashioned match-play golf with Sorenstam holding a two-stroke
lead when the round started.
	   Both players started tentatively and Inkster cracked first when
she missed the second green to the right and chipped poorly,
leaving 15 feet (4.5 meters) for par, which she missed to fall
three behind.
	   Inkster squandered a great opportunity when she hit the third
green in two and had an 18-foot (5.5-meter) eagle putt. She barely
missed the first putt then pulled the second one from 30 inches (76
centimeters) and watched in disbelief as the ball dipped into the
left side of the cup but stayed out.
	   Muttering to herself as she walked onto the fourth tee, Inkster
then reeled off three consecutive birdies, making a 20-footer (6
meters) on No. 4 and hitting irons to inside 3 feet on Nos. 5 and
6.
	   Sorenstam went to the back nine one stroke ahead of Inkster and
two better than Kane, who was playing two groups in front.
	   Inkster stayed within a stroke through 13 holes but she made a
three-putt bogey from 45 feet off the fringe on No. 14, missing a
7-footer for par, then fell threes strokes behind when Sorenstam,
rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on No. 15.
	   Sorenstem closed the tournament with an appropriate flourish,
chipping to tap-in distance for her final birdie.
	   Then it was on to Blackwolf Run for a run at a third U.S. Open
title in four years.

Pakistan seeks international mediation to prevent war 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: ADDS quote from Indian official blaming Pakistan for impasse.
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's foreign minister on Sunday
urged the United Nations to move quickly to mediate the Kashmir
dispute or risk a fourth war between Pakistan and India, the
world's newest nuclear powers.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Gohar Ayub, who was
to meet later in the day with the U.N. secretary-general's special
envoy, said relentless cross-border attacks in the disputed Kashmir
region could quickly spin out of control.
	   Pakistan claims Indian soldiers killed 26 civilians in the past
week in attacks on Pakistani villages along the northern
territory's contested border.
	   ``The danger is there of cross-border raids or hot pursuit . . .
this is a strong possibility,'' said Ayub. ``That would be
responded to by us sharply and aggressively.''
	   He said Pakistan already has made ``elaborate plans that if
Indian aircraft should come into Pakistan's airspace we would
retaliate quickly and decisively.''
	   India and Pakistan have fought two previous wars over Kashmir
and a third war over Bangladesh, or what was then East Pakistan.
	   Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir, divided between the two
countries after the departure of the British colonizers in 1947.
India controls roughly two-thirds of the territory, which is
predominately Hindu India's only Muslim-dominated state.
	   Indian soldiers have been trying since 1989 to put down a
violent secessionist uprising that India says is being backed by
neighboring Pakistan, which denies the charges. Secessionists are
demanding either outright independence or union with Muslim
Pakistan.
	   Ayub said it's likely that a fourth war between the two
unfriendly neighbors would result in the use of nuclear weapons _ a
concern that has prompted the peace mission by Advaro De Soto, U.N.
assistant secretary-general for political affairs.
	   He said Pakistan already has made ``elaborate plans that if
Indian aircraft should come into Pakistan's airspace we would
retaliate quickly and decisively.''
	   De Soto is in the region to try to defuse tensions heightened by
last month's testing of nuclear weapons by both Pakistan and India.
He canceled a trip to India after New Delhi said he was not
welcome.
	   India has flatly rejected international mediation.
	   ``What they should do is come down very hard on India,'' Ayub
said, forcing New Delhi to agree to a third-party mediator.
	   In India, the prime minister's top adviser blamed Pakistan's
tough stance on Kashmir for an impasse in peace talks between the
longtime enemies.
	   ``India is looking at a wall,'' Brajesh Mishra said in a
television interview.
	   He said India was ready to discuss Kashmir _ but only in the
context of gaining control over the area now under Pakistan's
authority.
	   Ayub said the success record of bilateral talks between India
and Pakistan has been grim.
	   Between June 1997 and January 1998, Pakistan and India held
eight separate negotiating sessions involving prime ministers,
foreign secretaries and foreign ministers, said Ayub.
	   ``The end result was nil . . . we have no success with bilateral
talks,'' he said. ``They are just a futile exercise . . . that we
have tried over and over again.''
	   Still, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has agreed to meet
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee July 29 in Sri Lanka at
a summit of South Asian regional countries.

Malian envoy has been politician, diplomat, scholar and educator With Ivory Coast-Plane 
</HEADLINE>
By SAID PENDA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAMAKO, Mali (AP) _ Alioune Blondin Beye, the United Nations
envoy whose plane crashed into a swamp as it tried to land in the
Ivory Coast, cast a long shadow in his native Mali. He has been, at
various times, a politician, a diplomat, a scholar and an educator.
	   While he is believed to have died _ his passport was recovered
at the crash site _ searchers have been unable to positively
identify any of the corpses, or even say precisely how many people
died. No survivors were found.
	   The crash deeply shook people in Mali, where Beye _ a former
university professor and cabinet minister _ has been well-known for
years.
	   ``This is a crisis we're living through,'' said Amidou Diabate,
the Malian minister of justice, who had been a university student
of Beye's, awaiting word on his friend on Saturday. The plane
disappeared Friday night as it tried to land in Abidjan, the
commercial capital of the Ivory Coast. The crash was found Saturday
and searchers reached it Sunday.
	   Mali has been experiencing a turbulent political period over the
past few years, with accusations of coup plots and elections
married by riots, protests and boycotts.
	   But the 59-year-old Beye had been singled out as someone who
could help bring an end to the turmoil. Several prominent
newspapers had suggested he seek high office to help calm the
situation.
	   He has been well-known in the diplomatic community for his
efforts since 1993 to end the turmoil in Angola.
	   Regarded as a consummate diplomat, he was instrumental in
arranging the signing of the 1994 peace pact in Lusaka, Zambia.
	   ``(Beye) carried out his duties as mediator of the Angolan peace
process with great distinction and sense of responsibility,'' the
Portuguese Foreign Minister, Jaime Gama, told the Portuguese news
agency in Dakar, Senegal.
	   Recently, Beye threatened to resign because he said neither side
had the will to see the peace process through.
	   Still, he left Luanda, Angola, on Friday for a tour of five
African countries to win support for his efforts to push the peace
process toward conclusion.
	   He had already visited Togo and was due to go to Ivory Coast,
Gabon, Sao Tome and Principe and Burkina Faso when the plane went
down.
	   ``This is a very heavy blow to the Angolan government and the
negotiation process,'' Essy Amara, the Ivorian foreign affairs
minister told Africa No. 1 radio.
	   Beye, who is married with four children, has served as Mali's
minister of Youth, Sports, Arts and Culture and was its longtime
foreign minister. He was also the legal counsel to the president.
	   He has also lectured in public law at Dijon University in France
and was a professor of Mali's National School of Administration.

French prepare, then party to celebrate ``Golden Goal' 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with Nigeria-Denmark.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ First the French prepared, then they partied.
	   Wary of potential politically charged violence connected with
the second-round World Cup match between England and Argentina in
Saint-Etienne, French organizers on Sunday doubled their security
contingent for Tuesday's game to 3,000.
	   But more than 550 kilometers (340 miles) to the north, that was
the least of any Frenchman's thoughts. They were concerned more
about how to celebrate France's 1-0 extra time victory over
Paraguay.
	   Conga lines of happy, face-painted French wearing all kinds of
goofy hats danced through Stade Felix Bollaert and into the streets
of Lens, clogging the narrow avenues and alleys with blurs of reds,
whites, and blues.
	   Their hero was defender Laurent Blanc, who ended more than 113
minutes of goalless play with the first ``Golden Goal'' in World
Cup history. His right-footed sweep off a header by David Trezeguet
from six meters (yards) beat Paraguayan keeper Jose Luis Chilavert,
who managed to get the outside of his right hand on the ball but
couldn't keep it from bounding into the net.
	   ``This is the most incredible joy to score in this way,'' Blanc
said. ``We have criticized the Golden Goal in the past, yet here we
profitted from it. What went through me when I scored was just
indescribable.
	   ``We were fighting, fighting, fighting and we got our reward in
the last few minutes,'' the Olympique Marseille defender said.
	   ``I promised myself that I would score in the World Cup and I
did.''
	   In Paris, the Danes also had reason to celebrate. Underdogs to
the much-ballyhooed Nigerians, Denmark scored twice in the first 12
minutes and routed the Africans 4-1 to earn a quarterfinal meeting
with Brazil on Friday in Nantes.
	   The Danish team sent their red-clad fan contingent, known as
``roligans'' because of the Danish word for quiet (rolig), into the
streets of Paris with a post-game salute.
	   Peter Moller, who has only 11 caps and was making his first
appearance in the World Cup, scored after only three minutes and
Brian Laudrup added another nine minutes later to put Denmark into
the round-of-eight in only their second time in the World Cup
finals.
	   ``It was fantastic,'' Denmark's Swedish coach Bo Johansson said.
``This reminded me of the good old Danish playing style.
	   ``It is not about preparation and tactics. It is about players
who suddenly find their way of playing.''
	   Nigeria never recovered from the early goals, although it did
managed a period of sustained possession and a few chances late in
the first half.
	   But second-half substitute Ebbe Sand scored 30 seconds after
entering the game in the 59th minute and Thomas Helveg completed
the rout in the 76th to bury the African continent for France '98.
	   Nigeria, the reigning Olympic champ and pegged as having an
outside chance, was the last of five African nations to be
eliminated from the World Cup. Already out were Morocco, Tunisia,
South Africa and Cameroon.
	   Nigeria finally saved some pride in the 77th when second-half
substitute Tijani Babangida volleyed in a cross from Mutiu Adepoju
at the far post.
	   France's victory in Lens soothed the nerves of 40,000 anxious
Frenchmen in the stadium and the other 58 million across the
country. It gave the French five days to celebrate, and prepare for
Italy in a quarterfinal matchup at Saint-Denis' Stade de France.
	   Chilavert, the flamboyant keeper known for his offensive forays
on free kicks and penalties, made four more saves in extra time
before Blanc finally beat him.
	   ``France has a well-deserved victory. They impressed me very
much,'' Paraguay's coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani said. ``It was a
great effort from my players but we made a few errors near the end
probably because of fatigue.''
	   The result gave the small town of Lens something to smile about
after living through the tension and violence brought by visiting
fans from Germany and England.
	   In Saint-Etienne, security officials on Sunday warned of the
``speed and severity'' they would act to quell and prevent the
types of outbreaks stirred earlier in the tournament by some
English and German fans.
	   English fans clashed with North African youths in Marseille, and
Germans were accused of beating a French policeman into a coma in
Lens.
	   With English fans already having taunted French police with
chants invoking World War II, French organizers were well aware of
lingering animosity from the 1982 Falkland Islands war between the
English and Argentines.
	   Argentina's 1986 World Cup quarterfinal victory over England on
Diego Maradona's notorious ``Hand of God'' goal only added to the
mix.
	   ``We will not hesitate. Those engaged in violence will be
arrested and punished immediately,'' Saint-Etienne Chief of Police
Jean-Ives Audin said.
	   With an additional 1,500 police on the streets of Saint-Etienne,
the security contingent was almost twice the size used for previous
matches in the city of 200,000.
	   English hooligans and their Argentine counterparts, known as
``barrasbravas,'' have a long history of causing havoc in their
countries, and fought a bloody battle during the 1986 World Cup in
Mexico.

Netanyahu accused of trying to stall peace process

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders and other critics on Sunday
blasted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for an
international peace conference, accusing him of putting up new
roadblocks to peace.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Netanyahu was
trying to ``escape'' from his commitments, and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak said the prime minister was trying ``to torpedo the
peace process.''
	   Netanyahu, however, said the proposal for a European-sponsored
conference to discuss Mideast regional issues _ but not the
Israel-Palestinian conflict specifically _ was intended to
complement the bilateral negotiations, not replace them.
	   Netanyahu proposed the conference in an interview with a Spanish
newspaper published on Saturday.

	   BENI DOUALA, Algeria (AP) _ Rioting erupted in Algeria's Berber
region for a fourth day Sunday, leaving fourth person dead,
residents said, after tens of thousands of people attended the
burial of Berber singer Lounes Matoub.
	   Shortly after the funeral for Matoub, unrest again broke out in
nearby Tizi-Ouzou, the regional capital 100 kms (60 miles) east of
Algiers. Youths attacked more government buildings and stoned
police, who responded with gunfire.
	   A young Berber man was killed, residents said on condition of
anonymity. Residents reported unrest Sunday in other Berber cities.
	   Authorities did not confirm the death, but they announced
earlier that a third man died Sunday of injuries from the rioting
sparked by Matoub's assassination Thursday. About 100 people have
been reported injured.
	   Demonstrating against Muslim militants who murdered their singer
and a government trying to silence their language, tens of
thousands of Berbers attended the village burial.
	   ``No peace without the Berber language,'' read one sign.
	   ``Zeroual, murderer,'' read another placard, focusing anger as
much against militants as against the military-backed government of
President Liamine Zeroual that will impose Arabic as the only
official language next Sunday.
	   ``We are not Arabs!'' chanted some mourners under a stifling
summer heat as women wailed and security forces stood watch in this
village 15 kms (10 miles) south of Tizi-Ouzou.
	   Berbers staged a general strike Sunday, amid what was believed
the largest unrest in the region since the so-called Berber Spring
uprising of 1980.
	   Tizi-Ouzou was already in a shambles Sunday, with most of its
traffic lights, street lamps and bus stops damaged. Rioters had
burned a cinema, state department stores, state banks and Air
Algerie, among other offices. Private businesses were unscathed.
	   No incidents were reported around the funeral at Taourirt Moussa
cemetery next to the village. Both Matoub's family and Prime
Minister Ahmed Ouayhia had appealed for calm.
	   In Paris, Algerians and French intellectuals gathered near the
Eiffel Tower and at Place de la Republique to honor Matoub and
protest his murder.
	   An impassioned defender of Berber culture, the 42-year-old
singer was the latest Algerian artist to be slain during an
insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000 lives.
	   The Arabic-only law move was seen as a government effort to
appease supporters of Islamic movements. The Rally for Culture and
Democracy, in a statement, accused the government of President
Liamine Zeroual of ``passive complicity with the fundamentalists.''
	   The insurgency began after the government scrapped the
second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The Islamic
Salvation Front was expected to win on voter discontent with
corruption and high unemployment. The Front has condemned Matoub's
assassination.

Relatives mark 3rd anniversary of Mexico police massacre 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Relatives of 17 farm workers gunned down by
police in the southern state of Guerrero joined political and
rights activists Sunday at a mass commemorating the third
anniversary of the killings.
	   People from several states grieved and demonstrated in the
hamlet of Aguas Blancas and along the nearby rural roadside where
the killings occurred, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   ``We feel the great pain of the death of these Christians, and
our church will have to work to dignify their memory,'' Roman
Catholic priest Hugo Hernandez Maldonado said in his homily.
	   Leaders of the leftist farmers' group to which many of the
victims belonged led a march near the resort of Acapulco where
police opened fire three years ago.
	   The massacre remains one of the most visible stains on Mexico's
human rights record and may have helped spark a guerrilla uprising
in Guerrero that continues to claim lives.
	   Many of the state's top officials resigned in the wake of the
massacre _ including former Gov. Ruben Figueroa Alcocer _ and 10
police officers were jailed.
	   Figueroa admitted he sent police to dissuade peasants from
marching in a nearby town to demand fertilizer and farm credits.
But he said he never anticipated violence. State lawmakers later
absolved him of any wrongdoing.
	   Witnesses said as many as 300 state policemen stopped the 17
peasants in two trucks and opened fire without warning. Videotapes
later showed the officers placing guns in the victims' hands.

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Fearing a burst of politically
tinged hooliganism in the World Cup, authorities on Sunday doubled
the number of police for the England-Argentina match and promised a
heavy hand to prevent violence.
	   After several outbreaks of violence by English and German
hooligans since the Cup began June 10, officials vowed ``speed and
severity'' in their security measures for Tuesday's match, unveiled
at a news conference.
	   The sporting rivalry between England and Argentina is magnified
by politics. The two countries fought a war in 1982 in the South
Atlantic for possession of the Falkland Islands.
	   ``We will not hesitate. Those engaged in violence will be
arrested and punished immediately,'' Saint-Etienne Chief of Police
Jean-Ives Audin said.
	   The announcement came as France's interior minister admitted
France was caught off-guard by World Cup street violence by English
and German toughs as well as North African French youths.
	   ``The fact they went on the rampage in the cities and not the
stadiums was something relatively new,'' Jean-Pierre Chevenement
told Europe 1 radio.

World Cup: Denmark shocks touted Nigeria 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional. UPDATES with more quotes.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ Denmark exploited Nigeria's two
biggest weaknesses _ defense and discipline _ to soar past the
favored Super Eagles and into the World Cup quarterfinals for the
first time.
	   Surprise starter Peter Moller set the tone, scoring barely more
than two minutes into the game and setting up another goal nine
minutes later in a 4-1 rout Sunday at the Stade de France.
	   ``We're on a high, definitely a high,'' said keeper Peter
Schmeichel, who kept Nigeria's ballyhooed attack at bay.
	   Denmark's only other trip to the World Cup, in 1986, ended in
the second round, but now the 1992 European champions move on to
face defending titlist Brazil at Nantes on Friday.
	   ``It is not about preparation and tactics,'' Denmark coach Bo
Johansson said. ``It is about players who suddenly find their way
of playing.''
	   Nigeria, meanwhile, is again left to ponder what might have
been. The reigning Olympic champion was seen as its continent's
strongest shot at the title in France, but goes home after the
round of 16 for the second straight World Cup.
	   ``That's soccer, isn't it?'' Nigeria winger Finidi George said.
``Denmark has a very good attack. It created several chances and
converted. We only had a few chances.''
	   While Nigeria was touted as the providers of pleasing, attacking
soccer, it never got into its high-speed rhythm against the Danes.
Instead, the last African team in the tournament seemingly did all
it could to jump-start what had been its opponent's ailing attack.
	   In its last outing, Wednesday against Paraguay, Nigeria gave up
the quickest goal of the tournament, falling behind 1-0 after just
51 seconds.
	   The Eagles were inattentive against Denmark from the start,
allowing Denmark's Martin Jorgensen to release Michael Laudrup into
the right side of the penalty area. Denmark's elder statesman drew
two defenders before sliding the ball back to an unmarked Moller,
whose strong left-footed strike from the top of the box hit the net
2:06 after kickoff.
	   Brian Laudrup, Michael's younger brother, made it 2-0 in the
12th minute, pouncing on a rebound and slotting home from 8 meters
(yards) after Nigerian goalkeeper Peter Rufai could only slap down
a strong 20-meter (yard) free kick by Moller.
	   ``Obviously we needed to concentrate more at the beginning,''
Rufai said. ``We lot it all in the first 15 minutes.''
	   Nigeria has built a reputation for comebacks, erasing deficits
against perennial powers Brazil and Argentina at the Atlanta Games
and against Spain in group play in France.
	   And coach Bora Milutinovic's squad had its chances to pull
closer before halftime Sunday.
	   Nwankwo Kanu broke alone into the box in the 17th minute, but
hesitated just enough to allow Schmeichel to smother the ball.
Later in the half, Jay-Jay Okocha twice had open looks at the net
but misfired each time.
	   ``You know after it was 2-0 we had some good chances,'' said
Milutinovic, the only coach to lead four countries to the second
round. ``Maybe everything could have changed.''
	   Little did.
	   Okocha sent two more long drives over the bar in the second
half, while Denmark stretched its lead.
	   Striker Ebbe Sand increased the tally to 3-0 a World Cup-record
22 seconds after entering the match as a substitute for Moller.
Sand took the ball from Michael Laudrup, headed it around defender
Taribo West and volleyed in from the penalty spot in the 60th.
	   Denmark's fourth goal _ one more than it totaled in its first
three games here _ came in the 76th, as Rufai's inability to hold
another shot cost Nigeria. Sand chased down the ball after Rufai
bobbled it and passed back to Jorgensen, who crossed to Thomas
Helveg. The 27-year-old midfielder ripped a blast into the roof of
the net.
	   Nigeria finally tallied in the 78th, when substitute Tijani
Babangida turned in Mutiu Adepoju's cross for a meaningless goal.
	   With half the quarterfinal field set, Europe had three of the
four places as Denmark joined Italy and host France.
	   Relishing their victory, the Danes seemed little concerned about
facing the defending champs.
	   ``We have to try,'' Johansson said. ``Nigeria cannot try any
longer. We will play against the best team in the world. We know
we're not the best team in the world.''
	   ___ &QC;

Report: 52 people killed in riots over price hikes in Yemen 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Government troops clashed with tribesmen
protesting price hikes throughout Yemen over several days last
week, leaving 52 people dead and 214 other injured, a newspaper
reported in its Monday editions.
	   The Yemen Times' report, obtained by The Associated Press late
Sunday, did not elaborate on the violence.
	   Security officials were not available to verify the death toll,
but the English-language newspaper's owner, Abdel-Aziz el-Saqqaf,
is an adviser to President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
	   Earlier Sunday, Defense Minister Mohammed Dhaifullah Mohammed
led a state funeral for 21 soldiers who were killed as they
attempted to quell rioting in Marib, 170 kilometers (105 miles)
northeast of the capital San`a, and al-Jawf, which is just outside
it.
	   It was not clear whether the 21 soldiers were among the dead
reported by the Yemen Times.
	   The riots, which also took place in the south and east, were to
protest the government's June 19 decision to raise gasoline,
kerosene and cooking gas prices 40 percent to meet the
International Monetary Fund's demands.
	   Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani said his government would
not reverse its decision and blamed the protests, which have been
banned, on saboteurs and opposition parties.
	   Eye witnesses said the clashes began when security forces used
live ammunition to disperse the crowds. Tribesmen, who have
complained about not being involved in this Arabian Peninsula
country's political process, then shot back.
	   It was not immediately clear how many civilians and soldiers
were among the dead.
	   Also Sunday, security sources confirmed that tribesmen used
dynamite to blow up parts of a 360-kilometer (225-mile) gas
pipeline between Marib and the Red Sea port city of Rass Eissa.
	   The sources, who spoke under customary condition of anonymity,
also said that security forces managed to open the San`a-Marib
road, which was closed to traffic by the tribesmen.
	   Increasing fuel rates are in line with IMF's requirements to
remove subsidies on petroleum products and other commodities by the
end of 1998 in Yemen.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.

World Cup: Moller comes from end of bench to be hero WITH Sports-Soccer-Nigeria-Denmark AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ He wasn't even a regular on his club
team PSV Eindhoven this season. He didn't play a single minute in
Denmark's first there matches.
	   Patience was a virtue that paid big dividends for striker Peter
Moller.
	   The 26-year-old forward scored only three minutes into the game
and nearly on his first touch as Denmark scored twice in the first
12 minutes enroute to a 4-1 victory over Olympic champion Nigeria.
	   ``Peter had not played anything in the tournament, but he kept
on practicing a lot,'' Denmark's Swedish coach Bo Johansson said
after Denmark clinched its first-ever quarterfinal berth in the
World Cup _ in only its second try.
	   ``I think he practiced more than the other players. He was
patient. When you're patient, it pays off.''
	   Moller's biggest attribute is his strength in the air, but has a
reputation for being inconsistent with PSV. Most of the time, he's
been a reserve although he played a few matches in the Dutch
league.
	   ``It was a dream for me,'' Moller said of his goal. ``Most of
the time I've been a sub for PSV. I haven't played much from the
start, so this was very satisfactory for me to start and then score
a goal.''
	   ``I'm not that kind of player who makes those nice moves. I'm a
hard-working man, so that's what I have to do.''
	   Denmark will face Brazil in the quarterfinals Friday in Nantes.
	   Brian Laudrup, who scored one goal and set up another, said he
wasn't thinking about Brazil just yet.
	   ``Now I'm only thinking about this victory,'' he said, beer in
hand. ``Tomorrow we'll enjoy ourselves and then on Tuesday we'll
think about Brazil.
	   ``We know that it's a dream come true for any footballer to play
against Brazil. Everybody expects Brazil to win. We might be able
to do it again. You never know.''
	   Johansson, who took over as Denmark's coach two years ago when
Richard Moller Nielsen left for Finland, said his team played like
the old ``Danish Dynamite'' teams of the late 80s and early 90s.
Denmark won the 1992 European Championship under Nielsen.
	   ``This was the old Danish way of playing, like Mexico in 1986,''
he said. ``Then Denmark played a couple of fantastic games like
this one.''
	   Johansson, naturally, was looking ahead to the Brazilians.
	   ``We have to try,'' he said after his biggest thrill as a coach.
``Nigeria can't try any longer. We will play the world's best team
(Brazil). We'll give them a hard game. It will be fanastic for
us.''

Indian foreign secretary arrives in Dhaka for talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ India's foreign secretary flew to
Bangladesh on Sunday for high-level talks, less than two weeks
after Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited India to
urge restraint following its nuclear tests in May.
	   ``The visit is to carry on and renew our friendly contacts with
Bangladesh,'' K. Raghunath told reporters after landing at the
Dhaka airport.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met with her Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi June 16. She was the first head
of state to visit India after its nuclear tests, which were later
matched by Islamabad.
	   Raghunath, a former Indian ambassador to Bangladesh, said his
visit ``will give an opportunity to review and update the excellent
relationship between the two countries.''
	   Raghunath was scheduled to meet Hasina before the official talks
Monday.
	   Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman said the two
sides were looking forward to successful discussions.
	   The Bangladesh-India agenda is topped by a dispute over sharing
of the Ganges River water.
	   For years, Bangladesh has protested what it calls inadequate
supply of water from the Ganges River each summer. India says it
needs the water to keep the Calcutta port navigable for ships.
	   The two countries are also expected to discuss the issue of
Bangladeshi refugees living in India.
	   Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which came
to power in February-March elections, had campaigned to send back
the refugees, many of whom never returned after they fled their
country during its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.
	   Both nations also have plans to cooperate in combating
separatist violence in their nations. Rebels from both countries
have often fled to the other across the dense forests or rice paddy
fields at the border.
	   Indian rebel leader Anup Chetia is currently awaiting trial in
Bangladesh on charges of entering the country illegally. The trial
puts on hold India's request that Chetia be extradited to face
murder and kidnapping charges.

High abstention rate clouds abortion referendum result

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Low voter turnout voided a Portuguese
referendum Sunday on whether to lift tight restrictions for
allowing abortions, a deeply divisive topic in this mostly Roman
Catholic nation.
	   The National Electoral Commission said 68.1 percent of the
country's 8.4 million voters did not participate. At least 50
percent turnout was required for the referendum, Portugal's first,
to be legally binding on parliament.
	   The outcome left lawmakers in a dilemma over whether to press
ahead with a controversial project to relax abortion restrictions.
	   Under existing Portuguese law, dating from 1984, termination of
pregnancy is permitted only for strictly defined medical reasons or
in cases of rape, and only until the 12th week.
	   In a landmark decision, lawmakers in February narrowly approved
a bill allowing abortion on demand through the 10th week. However,
opponents successfully pushed for the referendum, which was
intended to either overturn or ratify that legislation.
	   Now, lawmakers must decide whether to enact February's law
without the endorsement of a referendum.
	   Opinion polls had given no indication of potentially high
abstention after an intense two-week campaign leading up to the
ballot. The turnout was the lowest since Portugal replaced Antonio
Salazar's dictatorship with a parliamentary democracy in 1974.
	   Of those who voted, almost 51 percent voted against lifting
current prohibitions, while just under 50 percent voted in favor.
Other ballots were either spoiled or left blank.
	   President Jorge Sampaio on Saturday appealed for a high turnout,
saying abortion was ``a delicate issue'' on which the people had to
express their opinion.
	   Sampaio did not say which way he would vote on the measure, and
parliamentary leaders had instructed their party members to vote
according to their individual beliefs.
	   Politicians, caught unprepared, grasped for explanations for the
high abstention rate.
	   The governing Socialist party blamed its rightist opponents for
forcing a referendum on a reluctant electorate.
	   ``Parliament can now legitimately rule on abortion,'' Socialist
party spokesman Antonio Jose Seguro told a news conference.
	   However, the Social Democratic party, the main opposition party,
said the abstention rate indicated that abortion was not a priority
for the Portuguese and that they were happy with the 1984 law.
	   The National Assembly, Portugal's parliament, has been debating
the abortion issue for the past 14 years _ since leftist parties
first won enough seats to press for a discussion.
	   Abortion rights activists _ backed by leftist politicians _ say
they want to end the estimated 16,000 illegal abortions each year
in Portugal, a nation of 9.5 million people.
	   Government statistics show that each year about 10,000 women are
treated at hospitals following botched illegal abortions.
	   Women can be imprisoned for up to three years for having an
illegal abortion.
	   Opposition to the easing of the current law has come from older
Portuguese, backed by the influential Catholic church and
conservative parties.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A policeman's finger is ripped off
by a bomb. A striking worker is beaten unconscious by riot police.
And it all stems from Puerto Rico's sale of the state telephone
company to a consortium led by U.S.-based GTE.
	   The unions' fury at the deal signed by Gov. Pedro Rossello on
Wednesday reflects frustration at the diminishing influence of
labor in a land where jobs have always been scarce, employers often
abusive, and strikes occasionally deadly.
	   The rancor on both sides is amplified as Rossello and most of
the labor leaders also find themselves on opposing sides of a
debate over Puerto Rico's status. The results of that debate will
decide the future for generations on this Caribbean island of 3.8
million.
	   Rossello wants to make Puerto Rico, which has been a U.S.
territory for a century, into a full-fledged U.S. state.
	   Union leaders tend toward Puerto Rico's militant minority, who
favor independence. They say Rossello is ``selling the national
patrimony'' to a U.S. firm to boost his statehood agenda and accuse
him of despotism. In protest, they have replaced the double ``S''
in his name with a swastika in placards and flyers.
	   Police have said they suspect a clandestine pro-independence
guerrilla group called Los Macheteros planted a bomb that maimed an
officer Thursday.
	   Protesters have also cut off phone service to hundreds of
thousands, smashed bank machines and torched phone booths. Police
reported more bomb threats overnight Sunday and remained on guard
in front of telephone company offices across the island.
	   With no sign of compromise on either side _ Rossello has shocked
many with his stubborn aloofness _ there are fears that Puerto Rico
will continue its history of violent strikes.
	   In the worst case, Teamsters set a fire at the DuPont Plaza
hotel on New Year's Eve 1986, killing 97 people.
	   That militancy reflected the power union leaders achieved as a
result of the tremendous and rapid transformations in Puerto Rico's
labor market.
	   Even under the Spanish, there was a rash of strikes against
rising prices that started in 1892. The labor movement grew after
the United States took over the island in 1898.
	   ``One of the first things (they) did was to legalize labor
unions and the military governor declared an eight-hour work day,''
said historian Gervasio Garcia.
	   Most workers were unionized as the island moved from
family-based farming to huge plantations, especially sugar
plantations often controlled by U.S. firms.
	   Cane cutters formed a pillar of organized labor as they united
against exploitative plantation owners who paid little _ sometimes
only in coupons valid at overpriced plantation stores.
	   Puerto Rico is now transforming itself into a service economy
increasingly integrated into that of the United States. The power
of unions is on the wane as they find themselves facing the most
free-market leader the island has known.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the 7,900-employee telephone
company is the most ambitious part of Rossello's drive to privatize
everything from utilities to health care to the once-mighty sugar
industry.
	   State-run companies have become increasingly inefficient and
top-heavy with managers.
	   The phone company deal, which was approved by legislators, is
unlikely to unravel because of the strikes. But the protests show
little sign of waning.
	   On Sunday, leaders of a labor coalition representing as many as
50,000 workers _ mostly government employees _ agreed to hold a
two-day strike to protest the telephone company's privatization.
	   The Greater Committee of Labor, Religious and Cultural
Organizations said the date of the stoppage has not been set, but
would probably occur sometime after Wednesday.
	   About 6,400 telephone workers have gone on strike to protest the
sale of the company.

Durant gets first tour victory AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ Joe Durant, who had a great start in
last week's U.S. Open, birdied three of the last five holes Sunday
to pull away from Vijay Singh and win the Western Open for his
first victory on the PGA Tour.
	   Durant had a 6-under-par 66 to finish with a 17-under 271 total,
two strokes ahead of Singh, the third-round leader. Singh was up
and down throughout a final-round 72, his first round over 70 in
the tournament at Cog Hill's Dubsdread course.
	   U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen couldn't duplicate his magic of last
weekend, shooting a 71 and finishing in a tie for third at 277 with
Dudley Hart, who tied the course record with a 9-under 63.
	   Greg Kraft, the first-round leader who finished second in the
1994 Western Open, fell apart on the final day of the dlrs 2.2
million, Motorola-sponsored event. He shot a 3-over 75 to finish at
10-under 278. Steve Stricker, the 1996 Western Open champion, also
was at 278 after shooting a 71 Sunday.
	   Tiger Woods had another strong round, shooting a 69 to finish at
7-under 281. But the defending champion was never in contention
after his dismal first round, when he shot a 4-over 76 and was in
danger of missing the cut.
	   It has not been an easy season for Woods, who has won only one
PGA Tour event and wasn't in contention at the Masters or the U.S.
Open. His putting has been his biggest problem, but Woods said he
was pleased with how he played this week.
	   ``My game is very close,'' he said. ``I've got a real good
feeling because I'm over the putter now thinking, `I'm hoping
they're going to go in,' to `I know they're going to go in.' That's
a big difference.''
	   Until this week, Durant had never even led after a round in a
PGA Tour event. His best finish was a tie for fifth at last year's
Honda Classic.
	   Frustrated with not winning, he left golf for about six months
at the end of 1991. He was 129th on the money list last year with
dlrs 97,669.
	   Durant led the U.S. Open for a few holes last week and was just
two strokes off the lead after the first round. He brought that
same form with him to Cog Hill. He led after the second round, and
was four strokes behind Singh coming into Sunday.
	   He birdied Nos. 1 and 3, only to lose a stroke with a bogey on
No. 4. He got it back on No. 5 and then picked up another stroke
with a birdie on No. 9 to put him at 14 under.
	   After birdies on Nos. 10 and 11, Durant bogeyed No. 12. But he
got the stroke back with a birdie on 14 to start his string of
three straight. He also birdied 17, but bogeyed 18 after hitting
his second shot into the rough off the green and chunking his first
chip shot.
	   Trading birdies and bogeys on the front nine, Singh was never
quite being able to get ahead. After bogeying 14, he chipped in
from 40 feet (12 meters) for an eagle on the par-5 15th.
	   But he bogeyed 16 after putting his second shot into a trap, and
the tournament was Durant's.
	   Kraft was in the hunt through the front nine, even tying Singh
for the lead at 14 under on No. 7, but he bogeyed 8 and 10, and he
knocked himself out of the running on 14.
	   His tee shot on the par-3 went into the bunker, and after
putting his second shot on the fringe, he two-putted for a bogey
that put him 11 under.
	   Hart, who started the day at two under, had five birdies on the
front nine and four on the back to tie the course record held by
Jeff Sluman (third round, 1992), and John Adams (third round,
1993). He almost had the record to himself, but his birdie putt on
No. 18 rolled just below the hole.
	   ``I wasn't really thinking about a course record,'' said Hart,
who withdrew from the U.S. Open after hurting his wrist in the
first round. ``That doesn't mean as much as shooting as low as you
can and finishing well in the tournament.''

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Colombian President
Ernesto Samper left the Dominican Republic on Sunday after signing
agreements to fund new power plants and fight money laundering.
	   Samper agreed to set aside 20 percent of profits from petroleum
sales to the Dominican government to underwrite development loans
to that country. Dominican President Leonel Fernandez said the
loans would be used for building new power plants to resolve
frequent electricity shortages.
	   During Samper's visit, the two leaders also agreed to exchange
information about large transactions moving across their borders in
an attempt to thwart money laundering.
	   Samper and Fernandez also signed a declaration rejecting
economic pressure from wealthier countries _ a jab at the United
States, which has tied economic aid to ``certification'' that
countries are cooperating with anti-drug efforts.
	   ``We express our rejection of policies that attempt to confront
this problem in a unilateral way, by way of internal legislation
with extraterritorial effects, manifested in qualifications or
certifications of other countries,'' the declaration said.
	   It also complained that Latin American countries' external debts
have stifled many anti-drug efforts.
	   The Dominican Republic is a popular transshipment point for
cocaine and heroin coming from Colombia because of its long,
lightly guarded coastline and its proximity to Puerto Rico, a U.S.
territory.
	   U.S. officials estimate that 15 percent of Colombian cocaine
reaching the United States comes through the Dominican Republic. A
large amount stays in the country, leading to high rates of drug
addiction.
	   The trade has also brought money laundering, corruption and
violent crime. ``The only law that the drug traffickers don't
violate is that of supply and demand,'' Fernandez lamented
Saturday.
	   Samper apologized for the crime and addiction the drug trade has
brought.
	   ``We are very ashamed of the social and policing problems that
the terrible problem of drugs coming from Colombia produces for
countries that are our friends,'' he said.
	   Dominican officials said Saturday they have begun a broad
investigation of 10 local businesses, from lumber companies to
legal betting houses, in connection with money laundering.
	   Before boarding an airplane for home on Sunday, Samper
inaugurated a new Museum of Colombia at the Columbus Beacon, a
monument built in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's hoped-for
future of political compromise faces a fundamental test Monday when
the Parades Commission rules whether Orangemen can march through
the Catholic section of a fiercely Protestant town.
	   The annual confrontation between Catholic protesters and
Protestant Orangemen in Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) southwest of
Belfast, has caused bloodshed and bitterness the past two years.
The commission's long-awaited verdict has much of Northern Ireland
living in dread.
	   Expecting trouble no matter what, the British army headquarters
in Northern Ireland confirmed late Sunday it had airlifted in more
than 1,000 extra soldiers from England to back up the police if
needed.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Reaching out to the generation that will lead
China in the new millennium, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Monday that human rights ``are the birthrights of people
everywhere'' and that ``freedom is a powerful engine of progress.''
	   Clinton bluntly challenged China's repressive system in a speech
at Peking University, a quiet, leafy campus whose students were the
driving force behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square.
	   The president said that some people in America and China
question whether closer relations between the two countries are in
each other's interests. ``But everything we know about the way the
world is changing and the challenges your generation will face tell
us that our two nations will be better off working together than
apart,'' Clinton said.
	   Excepts of his address were released in advance by the White
House.
	   With a history as a center of liberal thinking, Peking
University is closely monitored by the government, which restricts
visitors. Some 24,000 undergraduates attend the university, founded
100 years ago.

	   Clinton's address came after a day of breathtaking sightseeing
at the Great Wall and in the ancient palaces of the walled
Forbidden City.
	   Contrary to Clinton's argument, China's communist government
contends that the way human rights are protected depends on a
country's condition. President Jiang Zemin and other leaders argue
that stability is essential to economic prosperity.
	   Clinton, in his remarks, said the United States does not seek to
impose its vision on others. ``But we are convinced that certain
rights are universal,'' the president said.
	   Clinton added, ``I believe that everywhere, people aspire to be
treated with dignity ... to give voice to their opinions ... to
choose their own leaders .. to associate with whom they wish ... to
worship how, when and where they want.
	   ``These are not American rights or European rights or developed
world rights,'' Clinton said. ``They are the birthrights of people
everywhere.''
	   He said economic security is an essential element of freedom but
that ``true freedom must mean more than economic opportunity. In
America, we believe that freedom itself is indivisible.''

By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ The Treasury Department has given air carriers
permission to resume direct charter flights between Florida and
Cuba as early as July 2.
	   The companies must wait for landing permits from Cuba before the
flights can start, said Vivian Mannerud, manager of Miami's Airline
Brokers Co.
	   American Airlines and Marazul Charters of Miami also have
licenses, said Mannerud, a leading charter organizer before flights
were canceled.
	   Island Air Charters, in Fort Lauderdale, and Cuba Paquetes Inc.,
in Hialeah, also have said they received notice from the Treasury
Department's Office of Financial Asset Control, which supervises
all embargoes, that direct flights could resume.
	   Charter flights from Miami now make a brief stopover in the
Bahamas before heading to Havana.
	   President Bill Clinton canceled direct fights to Cuba in 1996 as
part of a series of measures to punish Havana for shooting down two
planes that were looking for refugees over international waters.
Four people, including three U.S. citizens, were killed.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduras is considering
re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time
since ties were broken in 1961, Foreign Minister J. Fernando
Martinez said Sunday.
	   Though optimistic about the chances for renewed ties, Martinez
said a final decision would have to be made by Honduran President
Carlos Flores Facusse. He didn't say when that decision might come.
	   Ruben Chavez, director of the Cuban Interest Section which
opened seven months ago in the Honduran capital, said ``Havana is
willing to maintain any kind of ties with Honduras.''
	   Honduras, a conservative ally of the United States during the
Central American civil wars of the 1980s, does not have a similar
office in Havana, but did authorize the first direct airline
flights to the island in March.
	   Panama and Nicaragua have diplomatic relations with Cuba, while
Costa Rica has an interest section in the Cuban capital.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Relatives of 17 farm workers gunned down by
police in the southern state of Guerrero joined human rights
activists Sunday at a mass commemorating the third anniversary of
the killings.
	   People from several states grieved and demonstrated in the
hamlet of Aguas Blancas and along the nearby rural roadside where
the killings occurred on June 28, 1995, the government news agency
Notimex reported.
	   ``We feel the great pain of the death of these Christians, and
our church will have to work to dignify their memory,'' Roman
Catholic priest Hugo Hernandez Maldonado said in his homily.
	   The massacre remains one of the most visible stains on Mexico's
human rights record, and may have helped spark a guerrilla uprising
in Guerrero that continues to claim lives.
	   Many of the state's top officials resigned in the wake of the
massacre and 10 police officers were jailed.
	   Witnesses said as many as 300 state policemen stopped the 17
peasants in two trucks and opened fire without warning. Videotapes
later showed the officers placing guns in the victims' hands.

	   MIAMI (AP) _ The Treasury Department has given air carriers
permission to resume direct charter flights between Florida and
Cuba as early as July 2.
	   The companies must wait for landing permits from Cuba before the
flights can start, said Vivian Mannerud, manager of Miami's Airline
Brokers Co.
	   American Airlines and Marazul Charters of Miami also have
licenses, said Mannerud, a leading charter organizer before flights
were canceled.
	   Island Air Charters, in Fort Lauderdale, and Cuba Paquetes Inc.,
in Hialeah, also have said they received notice from the Treasury
Department's Office of Financial Asset Control, which supervises
all embargoes, that direct flights could resume.
	   Charter flights from Miami now make a brief stopover in the
Bahamas before heading to Havana.
	   President Bill Clinton canceled direct fights to Cuba in 1996 as
part of a series of measures to punish Havana for shooting down two
planes that were looking for refugees over international waters.
Four people, including three U.S. citizens, were killed.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ An overcrowded truck crossing the Andean
foothills plunged off a cliff Sunday, killing at least 12 and
injuring 10, many of the seriously, police reported.
	   The truck was traveling from the central city of Cochabamba to
the coca leaf producing region of Chapare when it went off the road
and fell down a 40-meter (130-foot) embankment. The bus was loaded
with natural gas canisters and plaster.
	   Police said heavy snow in the region could have caused the
accident.

For Release at 0100 GMT Clinton Tells Students Human Rights Are Universal AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Reaching out to the generation that will lead
China in the new millennium, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Monday that human rights ``are the birthrights of people
everywhere'' and that ``freedom is a powerful engine of progress.''
	   Clinton bluntly challenged China's repressive system in a speech
at Peking University, a quiet, leafy campus whose students were the
driving force behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square.
	   The president said that some people in America and China
question whether closer relations between the two countries are in
each other's interests. ``But everything we know about the way the
world is changing and the challenges your generation will face tell
us that our two nations will be better off working together than
apart,'' Clinton said.
	   Excepts of his address were released in advance by the White
House.
	   With a history as a center of liberal thinking, Peking
University is closely monitored by the government, which restricts
visitors. Some 24,000 undergraduates attend the university, founded
100 years ago.
	   Clinton's address came after a day of breathtaking sightseeing
at the Great Wall and in the ancient palaces of the walled
Forbidden City.
	   Contrary to Clinton's argument, China's communist government
contends that the way human rights are protected depends on a
country's condition. President Jiang Zemin and other leaders argue
that stability is essential to economic prosperity.
	   Clinton, in his remarks, said the United States does not seek to
impose its vision on others. ``But we are convinced that certain
rights are universal,'' the president said.
	   Clinton added, ``I believe that everywhere, people aspire to be
treated with dignity ... to give voice to their opinions ... to
choose their own leaders .. to associate with whom they wish ... to
worship how, when and where they want.
	   ``These are not American rights or European rights or developed
world rights,'' Clinton said. ``They are the birthrights of people
everywhere.''
	   He said economic security is an essential element of freedom but
that ``true freedom must mean more than economic opportunity. In
America, we believe that freedom itself is indivisible.''
	   ``We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom
strengthens stability,'' the president said. ``In the global
information age, freedom is a powerful engine of progress.''
	   U.S. officials hoped Clinton's remarks would be broadcast live
across China, as was his vigorous debate over human rights with
Jiang at a news conference Saturday.
	   Clinton said the greatest source of China's strength is in the
minds and hearts of its citizens. ``It is profoundly in your
interest _ and the interest of the world's _ that those minds be
free to reach the fullness of their potential,'' he said. ``That is
the message of our times and the mandate of the 21st century.''
	   The university appearance was Clinton's final stop in this
capital city before an evening flight to Shanghai, the booming
commercial center at the mouth of the Yangtze River. A highlight
will be Clinton's participation in a Shanghai radio call-in show
Tuesday.
	   On his final night in Beijing, Clinton dined privately with
Jiang at his official private residence inside the walled
leadership compound, Zhongnanhai, a former imperial playground next
to the Forbidden City.
	   A White House official said the 3 1/2-hour event, attended by
American and Chinese officials as well as the president's wife,
daughter and mother-in law, was ``more social than substance'' but
touched on the Asian financial crisis, legal codes and the rule of
law.
	   They talked about movies, and Jiang recalled seeing ``Gone With
the Wind'' years ago in Shanghai. Clinton spoke enthusiastically
about climbing the steep path atop the Great Wall on Sunday and
wandering among the golden roofed pagodas of the Forbidden City.
	   In a cobblestone courtyard near the Forbidden City's Gate of
Celestial Purity, Clinton said China is on a path of progress.
	   ``The last 25 years, it's been changing quite a lot.'' Asked if
China had changed enough, he said, ``After yesterday, I feel much
better.'' He was referring to Saturday's news conference _ an
unprecedented open discussion of differences.
	   Administration officials talked up Clinton's visit and assert
that 600 million people _ half of China's 1.2 billion _ watched
Clinton's lively exchange with Jiang.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger and James Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, all cited
the same number, but it was not clear how they arrived at it. China
has no known television rating system.
	   The officials said extraordinary changes have occurred in China,
but not enough. ``We have a long way to go,'' Albright told
reporters.
	   Berger said a democratic China ``may be a ways off.''
	   ``They now can choose where they work, where they go to
school,'' Berger said. ``Their standard of living has increased
dramatically, there's been some greater degree of freedom of
expression. But when it comes to public expression, public dissent,
this is still quite a repressive government.
	   ``Hopefully it's changing,'' Berger said. ``I believe over time
it will change.''
	   The Clintons began the day by worshipping at Chongwenmen Church,
the largest Protestant church in China. Picking up on the pastor's
sermon about unity, Clinton told the congregation, ``I believe our
faith calls upon us to seek unity with people across the world of
different races and backgrounds and creeds.''
	   Parishioners were hopeful Clinton's appearance at the
government-sanctioned church would make a difference.
	   ``Now that he's prayed with us, the Chinese government will
greatly relax its policies toward us Christians and our churches,''
said Liu Suxing. She complained that churches not sanctioned by the
government, where many Christians prefer to worship, often are shut
down. The government ``says there is freedom of religion, but in
reality it's not free,'' she said.

Nowitzki still undecided on future 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ The Dallas Mavericks brought Dirk Nowitzki to
Texas on Sunday, only four days after acquiring the German star
amid doubts they could get him to play in the NBA this season.
	   Whether or not Nowitzki will suit up for Dallas next season is
still uncertain.
	   But it appears much more likely than when coach and general
manager Don Nelson pulled off a three-way trade during Wednesday
night's NBA draft to land Nowitzki.
	   ``We're going to continue to sell him,'' Nelson said Sunday.
``We've gone a couple of big steps in the right direction. I don't
know when he'll make a decision.''
	   Nelson, along with his son and assistant coach Donnie Nelson,
and Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. went to Germany on Thursday to
court Nowitzki, who had hinted he would play in Europe for another
one or two years.
	   The recruiting committee needed only two days in the tiny
Bavarian town of Wurzburg to persuade the 6-foot-11 (2.10 meters)
forward to go to Dallas.
	   Now the Nelsons hope a red-carpet tour will clinch their bid to
sell the 20-year-old on an immediate jump to the NBA.
	   ``Just the fact that we brought him back is a big step,'' Nelson
said. ``We want to show him around where he has some idea where he
would be living. Hopefully we can never let him go until he makes a
commitment. That's the idea.''
	   The Mavericks had two big hurdles to persuading Nowitzki. First,
he wanted Dallas to consent to him leaving the team in February to
play Olympic qualifying games for his country. Don Nelson has
agreed to that.
	   Secondly, the Mavericks had to persuade Nowitzki that he's ready
for the NBA because it had been suggested he wasn't strong enough.
	   ``It's a big decision that has to be made,'' Nowitzki said after
arriving at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and shooting a
few baskets for reporters. ``I think I'm not ready yet, but they
try to convince me that I'm ready. ... We'll see.''
	   The Nelsons promise he's wrong on that point.
	   ``When people see him play, they'll understand,'' Donnie Nelson
said. ``People aren't educated about this guy. To Mavericks fans,
he's just a name. When people see him play, it'll all make sense.''
	   Nowitzki, the ninth overall pick in the draft, averaged 17.5
points and 10 rebounds for DJK Wurzburg last season.
	   He dazzled scouts at the Nike Hoop Summit in San Antonio in
March with 33 points with 14 rebounds. Then he returned to Germany
and enlisted in the army to fulfill his military obligation.

Europeans looking strong again as France, Denmark move into quarterfinal AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ What are the chances of Brazil vs. Europe again in
the World Cup quarterfinal?
	   That was how World Cup '94 turned out when seven European
nations made it to the last eight only for the South American
soccer giant to win the title for a record fourth time.
	   It could easily happen again.
	   Host France edged Paraguay 1-0 and Denmark outplayed Nigeria 4-1
Sunday to reach the last eight of World Cup '98. With Italy already
there along with defending titlist Brazil, that makes it three out
of four from Europe.
	   Monday's games were an all-European encounter between
Netherlands and Yugoslavia while Germany was expected to beat
probably the weakest survivor, Mexico.
	   If the results go according to form, that would make it five
European teams out of six, with Argentina the only other nation
outside of Europe left in the competition.
	   Argentina faces England on Tuesday, the day Romania meets
Croatia.
	   While the Danes fired in two early goals against Nigeria on the
way to a comfortable win to reach the quarterfinal for the first
time, the French barely made it to the last eight.
	   After his forwards laid siege to the Paraguayan defense but were
unable to break through it or get past inspired goalkeeper Jose
Luis Chilavert, defender Laurent Blanc found a way through with six
minutes of overtime left.
	   Striker David Trezeguet headed down a cross from Robert Pires
and the veteran Olympique Marseille defender drove the ball home
from close range to create World Cup history.
	   It was the first sudden death ``Golden Goal'' in the history of
the championship. Golden Goals were only introduced to the World
Cup this year.
	   ``This is the most incredible joy to score in this way,'' Blanc
said. ``We have criticized the Golden Goal in the past, yet here we
profited from it. What went through me when I scored was just
indescribable.''
	   A relieved host now goes on to face three-time titlist Italy at
Saint-Denis July 3 for a place in the semifinals, while Denmark
faces Brazil at Nantes the same day.
	   Peter Moller and Brian Laudrup put the Danes ahead inside the
first 12 minutes at the Stade de France, helped by poor defending
and goalkeeping by the Nigerians.
	   The Africans looked like a shadow of the team who triumphed at
the Olympics two years ago. Star players such as Nwankwo Kanu,
Finidi George and Jay-Jay Okocha were just not firing.
	   Ebbe Sand and Thomas Helveg added further goals in the second
half before Tijani Babangida replied for the dispirited Nigerians.
	   While the Nigerians go home earlier than expected, the Danes
will try to dethrone the Brazilians.
	   ``We have to try,'' their Swedish coach, Bo Johansson, said.
``Nigeria cannot try any longer. We will play against the best team
in the world. We know we're not the best team in the world.''
	   On this showing, neither is Nigeria.
	   ``That's soccer, isn't it?'' Finidi said. ``Denmark has a very
good attack. It created several chances and converted. We only had
a few chances. We lost it all in the first 15 minutes
	   ``It is really disappointing not to go through from the second
round,'' the Real Betis midfielder said. ``But that's life.''
	   With the Argentina-England game looming at Saint-Etienne on
Tuesday, organizers have doubled the size of the security force to
prevent major trouble for a matchup that has a spicy background on
and off the field.
	   Argentina and Britain went to war in 1982 for possession of the
Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. Although some political
goodwill has been restored since, a confrontation on the soccer
field allows old wounds to be reopened.
	   Then there was Diego Maradona's ``Hand of God'' goal at the 1986
World Cup, when the Argentine star got away with punching the ball
into the net and his team knocked England out in the quarterfinal.
English fans haven't forgiven Argentina for that.
	   English followers have already misbehaved at Marseille and Lens
and, because only 2,000 tickets are officially available for them,
many thousands more are expected to show up in Saint-Etienne hoping
to buy them on the black market.
	   The first of the extra 1,500 police were deployed as the English
fans began arriving Sunday. Local officials said bars would close
at 11 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday and police had orders to arrest
anyone for public drunkenness.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Beatle George Harrison disclosed Sunday
that he has been battling throad cancer since last summer _ and is
winning.
	   ``I'm not going to die on you folks just yet. I am very lucky,''
the 54-year-old singer was quoted as telling the News of the World.
	   Harrison told the Sunday tabloid that he first noticed a lump on
his neck last July while he was gardening at his 200-room mansion
in Henley, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) west of London, which he
shares with his wife, Olivia, 47, and their 19-year-old artist son
Dhani.
	   He had surgery in August to remove the lump, which was found to
be cancerous, followed by two courses of of radiation therapy at
the Royal Marsden Hospital, Britain's leading cancer treatment
center.
	   ``I got it purely from smoking. I gave up cigarettes many years
ago but had started again for a while and then stopped in 1997,''
Harrison was quoted as telling the paper.
	   In January, the singer went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, for tests and was told that the cancer had not returned.
He returned to the clinic in May for further tests, the paper said.
	   ``I went back and was given the final all-clear _ a clean bill
of health,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   ___
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Prince Charles marveled at a new
16-kilometer (10-mile) suspension bridge over Lisbon's River Tagus
during a royal visit to Portugal.
	   The sleek, white bridge, named Vasco da Gama as part of this
year's 500th anniversary celebrations of the Portuguese
adventurer's discovery of a sea route to India, was designed by the
British company Trafalgar House.
	   The prince's motorcade stopped halfway across the bridge
Saturday to take in the panoramic view of Lisbon. He also visited a
refurbished Roman Catholic church in the riverside town of
Alcochete, where he was greeted by the town band and children with
flowers.
	   ___
	   APPLETON, Wisconsin (AP) _ Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan,
suffering from Alzheimer's disease, doesn't do much entertaining
anymore. Still, he turned on the charm for a visiting 10-year-old
named after him.
	   Reagan Gillespie, who sent Reagan a framed photograph of
himself, was invited to meet the 87-year-old ex-president on
Friday.
	   Not speaking much, Reagan still offered a handshake ``like a
grandfather would give,'' the boy said.
	   The photograph that sparked the invitation for three generations
of Gillespie men was accompanied by a passage from the Book of
Proverbs: ``There is honor in a great name.''
	   ``He still has a twinkle in his eye, and he is so genuinely warm
inside, I think that will be with him forever,'' said Steve
Gillespie, the boy's father.
	   ___
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ It was only fitting that filmmaker
Vincent Gallo would unveil ``Buffalo '66'' in his hometown,
Buffalo.
	   The maverick writer-director-actor admits that it's very
important to him that his film succeeds in the upstate New York
industrial city where he grew up. The premiere was Friday.
	   ``If people in Buffalo don't support this film I'll be
brokenhearted,'' he said. ``I don't care about New York. I don't
care about Los Angeles. I don't care about Europe. I don't care
about Cannes or Sundance or anywhere else. I want this movie to be
popular in Buffalo.''
	   Gallo, 36, left Buffalo at age 16 for New York City, going on to
make the films ``Palookaville'' and ``The Funeral,'' and compose
movie scores. He is also a successful painter, sculptor and Calvin
Klein model. Other film credits include ``Arizona Dream,'' with
Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway.
	   Gallo acknowledges his blunt, outspoken manner bothers the
Hollywood establishment. He was criticized at the Sundance Film
Festival for refusing to run the standard interview gantlet, but he
makes no apologies.
	   ``I'm not interested in the mainstream,'' he said. ``I am not a
socialist and it offended a lot of politically correct socialist
commie film festival jerks.''
	   ___
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Israel's transsexual pop star Dana
International backed out of a German TV appearance Sunday, saying
she had been the target of death threats.
	   The singer _ known as Yaron Cohen until a sex change operation
five years ago _ became a celebrity throughout Europe after winning
last month's 25-nation Eurovision song contest, broadcast live
throughout the continent.
	   Her selection as Israel's representative caused a furor among
Orthodox leaders at home, who called her a disgrace to the Jewish
state, and raised eyebrows among some European viewers.
	   Suedwestfunk network spokesman Arthur Landwehr said the singer
canceled her appearance on the ``Always on Sunday'' program because
of death threats, but Landwehr had no details on the nature of the
threats or how they were delivered.
	   A record company manager quoted in Germany's mass-circulation
Bild newspaper said the singer continually has problems with
threats. ``We take these death threats seriously,'' Joachim Uhrig
was quoted as saying.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Luxury for France and misery for Paraguay.
When the French forwards fail, defenders streak forward and do
their job.
	   Veteran defender Laurent Blanc saved France with the World Cup's
first sudden-death ``Golden Goal'' for a 1-0 win Sunday,
eliminating Paraguay, the surprise team of the tournament so far.
	   ``I promised myself I would score in the World Cup and I did,''
said Blanc.
	   Sounds like a bold prediction.
	   But it was Blanc's 14th goal for France, an incredible record
for a defender. He is now the second top goalscorer for the current
team behind forward Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Blanc's uncanny knack of scoring vital goals put France in
Friday's quarterfinal against Italy and sent Paraguay home,
victimized by its forwards' inability to score.
	   Yet, for a small nation of less than five million, the South
Americans produced one of the strongest defenses and one
larger-than-life leader _ goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert.
	   Chilavert kept the French at bay with sterling saves, screaming
a continuous stream of instructions to his team. Six minutes before
the end of sudden-death overtime and a subsequent penalty shootout,
in the 114th minute, his luck ran out.
	   Blanc was in the right place to collect a header from forward
David Trezeguet. The Olympique Marseille center-back volleyed it
home with such power even Chilavert could not stop it.
	   ``We have criticized the Golden Goal in the past, yet here we
profited from it. What went through me when I scored was just
indescribable,'' Blanc said.
	   Now up come the Italians _ a team that is as familiar as close
cousins.
	   ``We will find a lot of friends again,'' said French coach Aime
Jacquet. ``It will be a great match and hopefully it will be a
great win for us.''
	   That will force more reshuffling among Jacquet's men.
	   Star playmaker Zinedine Zidane is coming back after a two-match
red card suspension and well rested to lead Les Bleus against many
of his Juventus Turin teammates.
	   ``He was the happiest man of all,'' Jacquet said. ``Now he can
come back and be at the heart of the team again.''
	   Yet the coach has new problems.
	   Three-goal youngster Thierry Henry had a strained left and was
hobbling with a thick pack of ice on it during the post match
celebrations.
	   World Cup starting striker Stephane Guivarc'h came on as a
substitute after a two-week injury and was far from convincing.
Meanwhile the return of another striker, Christophe Dugarry, who is
out with a torn hamstring, is still doubtful.
	   Five of France's best players, including Zidane, Djorkaeff,
Lilian Thuram and captain Didier Deschamps are currently playing in
Italy and the Azzurri, who beat Norway to reach the quarterfinals,
know what's ahead.
	   ``Unfortunately it's France,'' said goalkeeper Gianluca
Pagliuca, whose team has eliminated modest opponents Cameroon,
Austria and Norway.
	   ``For the first time in this World Cup we are aware (we are
playing) a team that can beat us.''

Wide-open World Cup as officials point to impressive stats AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cool weather and hot tactics have helped create a
wide-open World Cup.
	   Statistics from the tournament's 48-game first round show teams
are attacking and running the field, despite improved goalkeeping,
officials said Sunday.
	   ``We see there is more room on all these teams to go for it,''
said Gerard Houllier, the head of FIFA's technical study committee.
	   An 11-point analysis of detailed studies of the first round
found the players in better shape and better skilled, and the
coaches more open to attack than during the 1994 tournament in the
United States.
	   ``The technical level is extremely high. All players have a
level of technical expertise much higher than in 1994,'' Houllier
said.
	   Even the weather is cooperating. While scoring is virtually
unchanged from four years ago, Houllier said the players are more
active in milder conditions.
	   ``The climate is cooler,'' he said. ``It was hot in the United
States in '94. Teams were more focused on controlling the ball. We
are seeing more counterattacks and faster scoring. The one-on-one
and other shows of athletic ability certainly are much higher than
in 1994. The players are playing harder and running faster.''
	   Houllier, a former coach of the French national team, said more
teams use formations that encourage offense, with the 3-5-2
featuring an athletic, play-calling sweeper the favorite. Four
years ago, most used a lineup with four deep defenders.
	   Pressing defense is all but gone, replaced by block formations
that force attackers to dribble more, creating tighter patterns and
the chances of fast breaks.
	   ``In the United States, there were a lot of goals off short
passes,'' Houllier said. ``Here, a lot of goals (14) have been
scored on breakaways.''
	   Strikers remain the top scorers. But Houllier and Jurg Nepfer,
FIFA's technical coordinator, said midfielders have found the mark.
	   In the first round, midfielders scored 47 times, or 37.3 percent
of all goals, compared with 25.8 percent in 1994. Strikers, who
supplied 65.6 percent of the goals four years ago, were down to
52.4 percent (66 goals) this year, Nepfer said.
	   The average game has seen 2.63 goals, compared with 2.47 in '94
and well up from the 2.28 goals-per-game average of the
defense-dominated 1990 tournament in Italy.
	   While the average score isn't changed much from '94, the average
scoring play is. The number of long-range goals, from outside the
penalty area, was 13 or 10.3 percent, compared with 20.5 percent
last time. Scores inside the goal area, conversely, were way up,
33-15, or a jump form 16.1 percent to 26.2 percent.
	   Corner kicks, meanwhile, have produced 17 goals, compared with
just four at the same stage four years ago.
	   ``The teams are very good at playing the ball in the air,''
Houllier said.
	   The most dramatic change, however, has been in goal, he said.
	   ``The goalkeepers are playing better than in 1994,'' he said.
``We've seen some great saves and great, great plays by the
goalkeepers. Teams from Asia and Africa have made great advances in
training their goalkeepers.''

Eds: Includes items on FIFA's reason for referee change, Gascoigne,
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA said it changed referees for Sunday's
Nigeria-Denmark match because of a Spanish connection, not
political pressure.
	   The referees' committee substituted Urs Meier of Switzerland for
Jose-Manuel Garcia-Aranda of Spain because Nigeria had played in
Spain's group in the first round.
	   Keith Cooper, FIFA's spokesman, said there had been ``no
pressure whatsoever'' from outside the committee to make the
change.
	   African soccer officials had complained about biased officiating
after Nigeria was the only one of five teams from the continent to
advance.
	   Nigeria did request that the match be refereed by a non-European
but that was received after the change was made, Cooper said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paul Gascoigne, arguably the most controversial
ommission from the 1998 soccer World Cup, arrived back in England
Sunday without any fanfare.
	   The 31-year-old former England playmaker dominated the headlines
when he was axed from the squad by Glenn Hoddle on May 31 because
he was not considered fit enough for the tournament.
	   The public outrage that followed his axing has subsided and
rising stars like Michael Owen and David Beckham have started
replacing media space once reserved for ``Gazza''.
	   The Middlesbrough midfielder arrived back at Gatwick airport
after vacationing in Florida with his family.
	   Gascoigne left England days after he was dropped by Hoddle on
May 31 and while England has been progressing through the World
Cup, he has been rejuvenating in the sun.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Italian coach Cesare Maldini said he had
expected France to win Sunday's second-round match with Paraguay
and advance to meet his team in the quarter-finals.
	   ``It's the quarterfinal match we had been expecting, against the
home team,'' Maldini said Sunday.
	   The two teams meet at Saint-Denis on July 3.
	   ``It will be a match between Italy and several Italian-based
Frenchmen, he said referring to the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Youri
Djorkaeff, Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps, Lilian Thuram.
	   ``For sure France will have the support of the fans, they will
take more risks to advance,'' Maldini said,
	   Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca said he had been hoping to
play Paraguay in the next round.
	   ``Unfortunately it's France,'' he said. ``For the first time in
this World Cup we are aware (of playing) a team that can beat us.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ British bookmaker Ladbrokes is torn between
focusing on the soccer World Cup and Wimbledon tennis _ so it is
offering twin betting packages on both.
	   Ladbrokes is offering odds of 400-1 for Tim Henman to beat
Australia's Pat Rafter in straight sets at Wimbledon Monday and
England to beat Argentina 3-0 at Saint-Etienne Tuesday.
	   As the scores get closer, the odds get shorter.
	   A three sets to one win by Henman and a 3-1 win by England is
rated a 225-1 chance, while the odds on Henman beating Rafter 3-2
and England beating Argentina 3-2 are 200-1.
	   The odds on Sam Smith beating Nathalie Tauziat 2-0 and England
beating Argentina 2-0 are 125-1, while a 2-1 result in both games
is rated an 80-1 shot.
	   Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said twin results were long but
if any of them came off, the bookmakers would be paying out major
sums to patriotic gamblers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ If England plays for the World Cup title, it
reportedly will have some very high level support in the stands at
Saint-Denis.
	   Queen Elizabeth II will attend the final if England makes it,
according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency. The
British monarch handed the world-championship trophy to the English
team when it won the World Cup at Wembley in 1966.
	   An unidentified ``senior member'' of the royal family is
scheduled to travel to Saint-Etienne for Tuesday's second-round
match between England and Argentina, PA said Sunday. It did not
identify the source of the information.
	   Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son and heir to the throne,
and her grandson Prince Harry attended England's 2-0 victory over
Colombia Friday night. Charles wrote to the team on Saturday that
he and his son had enjoyed the match.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Eliminated from their first chance at a
World Cup, Jamaica's national soccer team returned home to a hero's
welcome nonetheless.
	   Thousands of fans waved flags and cheered as the team, named the
Reggae Boyz, walked off an airplane at Kingston's international
airport Saturday night and were greeted warmly by dignitaries on
the tarmac.
	   The Jamaicans lost 1-3 to Croatia and 0-5 to Argentina, dashing
their hopes of a championship. They managed a win over Japan, a
fellow World Cup newcomer, by 2-1 on Friday.
	   The win was the first for a Caribbean team in any World Cup
match since a victory by Cuba in 1936.

Dollar, stocks higher in early Tokyo trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was stronger against the Japanese
yen early Monday, though it fell somewhat following the release of
a key central bank business survey. Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 143.12 yen in early trading, up 1.84 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late Friday level in New
York of 142.44 yen.
	   The U.S. currency, however, slipped below the 143 yen level
following the release of the Bank of Japan's ``tankan'' quarterly
survey of business sentiment, traders said.
	   Traders said that the dollar moved lower after Japanese
investors sold the U.S. currency to book profits after confirming
that the data fell within market expectations.
	   Before the survey was released, the dollar had risen above 143
yen for the first time since the U.S. and Japan intervened in
currency markets and jointly sold dollars on June 17. But after the
data came out, the dollar fell as low as 142.55 yen.
	   The results of the closely watched central bank survey showed
that its ``business condition diffusion index'' dropped to minus 38
from minus 31 in the previous survey, taken in March and released
on April 2.
	   The index measures the percentage of companies seeing conditions
are improving minus the percentage seeing conditions worsening.
	   ``We are concerned about the weakness of the yen. This concern
is shared by the Group of Seven and Asian countries,'' said
Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's
Finance Ministry.
	   On the stock exchange, share prices edged higher on improved
market sentiment following news Friday about the possible merger of
a troubled major bank.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 86.86 points, or 0.57
percent, to 15,296.90 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Friday, the index had risen 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 5.49 points, or 0.46 percent, to 1,196.31. The TOPIX
gained 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, Friday.
	   Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. said Friday that they had agreed to aim for a merger in
one year's time. Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank had been looking for
a partner to save it from major trouble caused by massive problem
loans.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.260 percent from Friday's finish of 1.230 percent,
driving its price down to 111.51 yen from 111.73 yen.

Williams-Williams matchup looms at Wimbledon GMT on Centre and Court 1 AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Play scheduled to begin at 1000 GMT on outside courts and 1100
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ They're doubles partners and sisters,
and they may soon be foes.
	   Teen-agers Venus and Serena Williams were one round from a
showdown Monday at Wimbledon. It would be the tournament's first
match between sisters since Gail and Carol Sherriff of Australia
played in 1966.
	   Venus beat Serena in their two previous meetings. Even other
players find the prospect of a sibling showdown at Wimbledon
intriguing.
	   ``Serena has a better chance here than Venus,'' Monica Seles
said. ``Just a few games that I saw her play on grass, I really
liked her play better than Venus. But then Venus has such a great
serve. Anything can happen.''
	   That was a mantra during an unpredictable first week at
Wimbledon.
	   The tournament has been tough on comebacks, tabloid
photographers and U.S. males, but good for the Williams sisters,
umbrella salesmen and Sam Smith, a female.
	   The first week claimed Steffi Graf, heartthrob Anna Kournikova
and 14 of the 16 American men entered, including Andre Agassi.
Still around were two Britons, heartthrob Patrick Rafter and
defending champions Pete Sampras and Martina Hingis.
	   Four days of play were delayed by rain last week, leaving the
tournament 13 matches behind schedule, but officials kept with
tradition and permitted no play Sunday.
	   Photographers suffered the first loss of the event when
Kournikova withdrew due to a thumb injury. Her departure meant
diminished media attention for a tournament already overshadowed by
the World Cup.
	   Wimbledon newcomer Serena Williams, 16, dodged the rain puddles
and made a big splash by easily winning her first two matches. Her
equally impressive 18-year-old sister set a women's record with a
125-mph (200 kph) serve.
	   Venus was scheduled to play Chanda Rubin in a rain-delayed
third-round match Monday. Serena was to play Virginia
Ruano-Pascual.
	   The Williams-Williams winner would face a path that could
include Jana Novotna in the quarterfinals, Hingis in the semifinals
and Seles or Lindsay Davenport in the final.
	   On the men's side, Richard Krajicek and Goran Ivanisevic are a
likely matchup in one semifinal. The other is expected to pit
Sampras against Rafter, Tim Henman or Petr Korda.
	   Henman, trying to become the first Englishman to win Wimbledon
since 1936, is glad to share the nation's favor with fellow Briton
Samantha Smith, who goes by Sam. She earned her first Wimbledon
victory last week at age 26, then promptly won twice more, beating
1994 champion Conchita Martinez to reach the round of 16.
	   Two other former champs, Graf and Agassi, suffered setbacks in
their comebacks. Graf, a seven-time titlist plagued lately by
injuries, lost 6-4, 7-5 to Natasha Zvereva, a player she had beaten
in their 17 previous meetings.
	   Steffi was iffy about returning next year.
	   ``It would be nice to play again and, hopefully, be in different
shape and enjoy myself,'' said Graf, 29. ``But I've learned enough
to take what's coming up next (as it comes). So I don't know.''
	   Agassi still hasn't reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam
since 1996. He lost to unseeded Tommy Haas, who promptly lost to
unseeded John van Lottum.
	   ``Right now,'' Agassi said, ``I feel I have a lot more to do
with some of these defeats than my opponents.''
	   Also bidding adios was second-seeded Marcelo Rios, who lost to
Francisco Clavet and then ripped Wimbledon as ``just another
tournament.''
	   Only 17 of 32 seeds survived the first week, and more surprises
are likely during the second half of the fortnight.
	   ``On grass especially, it makes no difference if you're a
star,'' Hingis said. ``Everybody can beat you if you aren't 100
percent.''

Japanese business survey shows deteriorating confidence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Business sentiment at major Japanese companies has
deteriorated since April, according to the results of a
closely-watched central bank report released Monday.
	   The Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' survey showed that much
of corporate Japan remains worried over anemic growth in the
domestic market and the prospects for recovery in other Asian
nations hit by a financial crisis.
	   The survey's ``business condition diffusion index'' _ which
measures the percentage of major manufacturers seeing conditions
improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen _ fell to
minus 38 from minus 31 in the previous survey released in early
April.
	   Still, that was better than an average forecast of minus 44 by
economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires and not as steep a decline
as the drop to minus 31 in April from minus 11 in December.
	   Also Monday, Japan's trade ministry said industrial production
in May fell a seasonally-adjusted 2 percent compared to the
previous month. That was below the 0.1 percent rise forecast by
private economists polled by Dow Jones.
	   In the tankan results, the Bank of Japan said the 9,264 firms
surveyed expect the diffusion index to improve to minus 34 three
months from now.
	   A minus 49 result for a diffusion index of small manufacturers
was the worst since May 1975, when the index fell to minus 51,
according to a Bank of Japan official.
	   Big manufacturers remain cautious about the direction of the
yen, with most forecasting an average rate for the dollar of 125.75
in the business year to March, 1999.
	   The yen has recently fell to its lowest levels in eight years.
In early Tokyo trading Monday, it was quoted at 143.12 yen to the
dollar.
	   It rose as high as 142.55 yen, however, after the tankan was
released as investors sold dollars to take profits on the U.S.
currency's recent rise. Traders said that since the survey results
came within market expectations, there was no immediate incentive
to sell the yen.
	   Japan, plagued by slumping consumer demand and problems in its
banking system, is in its worst economic recession since the end of
World War II.

Ferrari Prancing Back 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MAGNY COURS, France (AP) _ With a 1-2 finish by Ferrari, the
Formula One season has suddenly become a two-horse race.
	   Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine on Sunday gave the Italian
carmaker its first sweep of the top two positions in a Grand Prix
since 1990.
	   It was the 41st time the proud Italian team -- with the red cars
with the famed black horse as its symbol -- went 1-2 in a race and
the 116th victory for it. Both are records in Formula One.
	   But in the 1990s, the prancing stallion stumbled a bit. Now with
Jean Todt as team chief and Schumacher and Irvine as drivers, the
Ferraris look to be ready to challenge the McLaren-Mercedes that
had been dominating the early season.
	   Ferrari has gone 1-3 and 1-2 in the last two races and have
finished ahead of the McLarens in both races.
	   ``These promising statistics make me feel optimisic about the
future,'' said Schumacher, who won the driving title in 1994 and
1995 with Benetton.
	   Schumacher gave credit to his Ferrari team now.
	   ``It's hard work, many nights and night shifts that the team
provided what we had here this week,'' Schumacher said. ``They
really pushed hard to make it for us and we are here.''
	   Sunday, Schumacher took advantage of a race re-start to win.
	   Irvine, acting a a buffer between Schumacher and Hakkinen for
most of the race, came in second, 19.5 seconds behind, holding off
Hakkinen for the last 15 laps of the race.
	   ``During the race I thought of Eddie who did a faultless job
today and helped to close the gap to only six points,'' Schumacher
said.
	   Hakkinen, with four early wins this season, has 50 points.
Schumacher now has 44.
	   Schumacher did 1 hour, 34 minutes, 45.026 seconds for the 71
laps of the 4.25-kilometer (2.641-mile) Magny Cours circuit. He
averaged 190.963 kph (118.864 mph) for the 301.75 kilometers (187.5
miles).
	   It was Schumacher's 30th career victory and third this season.
He also has won the French Grand Prix four of the last five times.
	   The race had to begin twice. The first time Jos Verstappen, who
had replaced Jan Magnussen at Stewart-Ford this week, stalled out
just before the start as the rest of the field roared away.
Hakkinen had the lead but the race was stopped.
	   On the re-start Schumacher and Irvine pulled ahead of Hakkinen
on the first turn, a perfect start for the Ferraris.
	   ``I thought I had a good start and then when I saw Eddie in
second I thought that's the scenario I'd like to have,'' Schumacher
said.
	   Schumacher pulled away from his teammate Irvine who forced the
McLarens to lap about a second slower than Schumacher in the early
stages.
	   ``I didn't want to push too hard,'' Irvine said.
	   Schumacher was not challenged after that and Irvine held off a
determined bid by Hakkinen for second.
	   Hakkinen took his chance with an inside move on a curve on the
20th lap. He had passed Irvine but couldn't hold the line and spun
out. He got back on track quickly but lost more than four seconds.
	   ``I tried once, the corner was too tight to take it at that
speed,'' said Hakkinen.
	   He kept looking for an opening but Irvine kept closing the door.
	   Hakkinen didn't want to risk anything.
	   ``I think you have to be fair out there and cannot bang someone
into the grass,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Hakkinen took one final chance when Irvine missed a gearchange.
	   ``I had the worst downchange of gears and it happened on the
last corner of the last lap,'' Irvine said. ``I just locked the
rear wheel.''
	   On the final curve, it became a drag race down the straightaway
with Irvine holding off Hakkinen.
	   Jacques Villeneuve, last year's Formula One champion, was fourth
in Williams-Mecachrome. Villeneuve beat Schumacher for the title in
the last race of the 1997 season after a dramatic collision forced
Schumacher out of the race.
	   Alexander Wurz of Austria was in fifth with a Benetton-Playlife
followed by David Coulthard, plagued by problems fueling in the
pits, in sixth with a McLaren-Mercedes.
	   The next race is the British Grand Prix, July 12.

Five financially weak Korean banks ordered closed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government ordered the closure of
five shaky banks Monday as part of its effort to restore foreign
investor confidence in South Korea's beleaguered economy.
	   The action was in keeping with Seoul's promise to restructure
its inefficient financial and industrial sectors in exchange for a
dlrs 58 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Liquidation of the weak banking sector is an imperative task
we can no longer postpone,'' said Lee Hun-jae, head of the
Financial Supervisory Commission.
	   Lee identified the five banks to be closed as Kyungki, Chung
Chong, Daedong, Donghwa and Dongnam. Together, they hold bad loans
estimated at ``several billion dollars,'' his office said.
	   Lee said five bigger commercial banks _ Korea Housing, KorAm,
Shinhan, Hana and Kookmin _ will take over the five insolvent
banks. He did not spell out the takeover conditions, but local
media reported that the government has promised to write off much
of the failed banks' debts.
	   Lee indicated that more financially weak banks could fold in the
coming months. The closures announced Monday were the first in the
nation's history.
	   Analysts agreed that the closures would help woo back foreign
investors whose massive exodus from South Korean markets fueled a
foreign currency crisis late last year.
	   ``It marks the first important step toward reorganizing the
troubled banking sector and left an important lesson that even
banks can collapse,'' Kim Ho-hwan, an economic analyst, said.
	   In a statement designed to head off a run on the insolvent
banks, Lee said the the government will guarantee payment of their
deposits.
	   South Korean banks maintained cozy relations with past
military-backed governments and even financially shaky banks could
survive with preferential government loans and other favors.
	   But the environment has changed as South Korea undergoes radical
reforms under stiff conditions which came with the IMF's bailout.
	   The government previously had shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks, or finance companies. In mid-May, it named 55 heavily
indebted companies subject to liquidation.
	   The supervisory commission said the five banks to be closed were
selected from among 12 banks ordered early this year to improve
their capital-to-asset ratio to internationally accepted levels.
	   The 12 banks were given until the end of May to improve their
financial status or face closure or merger. The government finished
reviewing the progress of their restructuring programs Saturday.
	   The commission allowed the other seven banks to stay open
temporarily, with an order to improve their finances within the
next month or face closure or merger.
	   Word of the government's list leaked last Friday, prompting
massive withdrawals of deposits.

Reds 5, Tigers 2

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Steve Parris got his first victory in nearly
three years as the Cincinnati Reds completed a three-game sweep of
the Detroit Tigers with a 5-2 victory Sunday.
	   Bret Boone hit a two-run double for the Reds, who have won four
straight after an 11-game losing streak. Bobby Higginson and Damion
Easley homered for Detroit.
	   Parris (1-0), making his first start of the season, won for the
first time since pitching Pittsburgh to a 3-2 victory over Florida
on Aug. 20, 1995. He went six-plus innings, allowing a run on nine
hits.
 &UR; Astros 12, Indians 3 &QC; 
	   In Cleveland, Moises Alou homered, had three hits and drove in
three runs as Houston beat the hometown Indians.
	   The Astros took two of three from the Indians in the interleague
meeting of Central division leaders.
	   Alou, who hit three homers for Florida against the Indians in
the 1997 World Series, hit his 16th of the season against Nagy in
the fourth to put Houston up 4-2.
 &UR; Braves 10, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, Tom Glavine joined teammate Greg Maddux as the only
11-game winners in the NL and matched a career-high with three
RBIs.
	   Glavine (11-3) allowed five hits, walked one and struck out one
in seven innings.
	   Randall Simon, recalled from the minors Sunday, also had three
RBIs for Atlanta. He drove in a run with a single in the first, and
added a sacrifice fly in the fourth and a run-scoring single in the
eighth.
 &UR; Expos 8, Orioles 4 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Vladimir Guerrero had three hits, including a
two-run homer, as the Montreal Expos handed the Baltimore Orioles
their sixth straight loss.
	   Javier Vazquez (2-6) allowed four runs in five-plus innings to
win for the first time in 11 starts. Ugueth Urbina got the final
two outs for his 20th save.
	   The Expos swept the three-game series, only their second series
sweep of the season.
 &UR; Devil Rays 5, Phillies 4 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Fred McGriff hit a two-run homer in the first
inning and a tiebreaking single in the eighth for Tampa Bay.
	   The Devil Rays won two of three at Veterans Stadium, their first
winning series on the road since May 22-24 at Seattle.
	   Reliever Albie Lopez (4-2) pitched three shutout innings for the
victory, and Roberto Hernandez got four outs for his 17th save.
 &UR; Cubs 6, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Sammy Sosa had two singles and an RBI
but failed to homer for the third straight game as the Chicago Cubs
snapped a seven-game losing streak.
	   Sosa, whose 19 homers in June are a major league record for
homers in any month, increased his RBI total to 78 with a single in
the fifth off Pat Rapp (7-7). But the Cubs outfielder, whose 32
home runs are second in the majors to Mark McGwire's 36, has now
gone three games without a homer for the first time in two weeks.
	   Jeremi Gonzalez (7-5) gave up eight hits and three runs in 5 1-3
innings as the Cubs snapped their longest losing streak since a
nine-game slide last July 24-Aug. 1.
 &UR; Twins 3, Cardinals 2 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Bob Tewksbury twice used lob pitches to
transform Mark McGwire's swing from menacing to meek, and Otis
Nixon drove in the winning run with a squeeze bunt in the seventh.
	   Kept off-balance by Tewksbury's surprising pitch selection,
McGwire went 1-for-4 with a single. He also hit into a fielder's
choice off reliever Hector Carrasco to end the top of the seventh
with the bases loaded.
	   McGwire, trying to break Roger Maris' record of 61 homers,
finished the three-game series 2-for-11 with one homer, his 36th,
in the Cardinals' win on Saturday night.
 &UR; White Sox 10, Brewers 8 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Chad Kreuter, Frank Thomas and Albert Belle hit RBI
singles as the Chicago White Sox rallied in the eighth inning to
halt Milwaukee's six-game winning streak.
	   Jeff Cirillo set a career high with five hits for the Brewers,
including a double in a two-run eighth that made it 8-7. But the
White Sox came back to stop a three-game losing streak in the
bottom half.
	   Bill Simas (3-3) pitched 1 1-3 hitless innings for the win.
 &UR; Giants 7, Rangers 0 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Mark Gardner pitched a three-hitter and J.T.
Snow hit a grand slam and drove in five runs for San Francisco.
	   Gardner (7-3) gave up a leadoff single to Tom Goodwin in the
fourth and nothing else until Kevin Elster's two-out single in the
eighth.
	   Gardner struck out five without walking a batter. Snow, who hit
three grand slams while playing for the California Angels, hit his
first NL slam in the second inning off Aaron Sele (11-5).
 &UR; Rockies 11, Athletics 10 &QC; 
	   In Denver, first-year player Todd Helton hit a two-out, two-run
homer in the seventh inning, highlighting a five-run rally by host
Colorado.
	   Oakland's four-run seventh, featuring Matt Stairs' pinch-hit
two-run single, had given the A's a 9-6 lead.
	   Dante Bichette hit a two-run homer and RBI single for the
Rockies.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 3, Mariners 2 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Yamil Benitez homered on the first pitch by Bobby
Ayala in the bottom of the ninth inning to lift Arizona over
Seattle.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 32nd home run for the Mariners.
	   Ayala (0-6) retired the Diamondbacks in order in the eighth, but
couldn't handle Benitez, who hit his second homer in as many games
and fourth in his last seven starts.
 &UR; Marlins 5, Red Sox 1 &QC; 
	   In Miami, first-year player Ryan Dempster pitched seven strong
innings for his first career victory as the Florida Marlins avoided
a three-game sweep.
	   Boston's Nomar Garciaparra went 1-for-4 to extend his hitting
streak to 20 games, tying Colorado's Larry Walker for the major
league high this season.
	   Dempster (1-3) gave up one run and four hits with six
strikeouts. Antonio Alfonseca pitched two innings for his third
save, striking out Darren Bragg with the bases loaded and two outs
in the eighth.
 &UR; Angels 11, Padres 3 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Jarrod Washburn improved to 4-0 and fellow
first-year player Justin Baughman had his first four-hit game as
Anaheim avoided a three-game sweep in a matchup of West Division
leaders.
	   Cecil Fielder hit a two-run homer in the seventh and Garret
Anderson added a three-run shot in the eighth as the Angels won
their 21st game in June, setting a club record for victories in a
month.
	   The Padres' three-game winning streak ended with their most
lopsided loss of the season, but they still share the NL's best
record with Atlanta at 53-29. Washburn, making his sixth big league
start, allowed two runs and eight hits in seven innings.

State Parliament orders apology over claims of child sex cover up 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A state Parliament committee on Monday
ordered a maverick legislator to apologize for claiming New South
Wales' premier and opposition leader conspired to cover up a child
sex ring involving judges.
	   But the committee stopped short of expelling member of
Parliament Franca Arena, who had also claimed that some state
judges were members of a Satanist cult that performed human
sacrifices.
	   She made her claims last year on the floor of Parliament, which
meant she was immune from slander or libel lawsuits.
	   All the purported conspirators immediately denied it was true
and denounced Arena.
	   Arena also named several prominent people whom she claimed were
pedophiles under state investigation.
	   One of them, former Wollongong mayor Frank Arkell, was found
murdered Saturday, his head bludgeoned.
	   He had beaten numerous charges brought against him by the Child
Protection Enforcement Agency last year, but still had four counts
pending of having sex with young men.
	   Another man Arena named in Parliament as a pedophile, retired
state Supreme Court judge David Yeldham, committed suicide, gassing
himself in his automobile in his garage.
	   Yeldham had been interviewed by investigators working on Justice
James Wood's independent judicial inquiry into police corruption.
	   They found that police had concealed the arrest record of
Yeldham, who led a secret life meeting men for sex in public
toilets. But no evidence came to light suggesting that he preyed on
children.
	   Arena was ordered Monday by Parliament's ethics committee to
publicly apologize to her legislative colleagues and the people she
claimed were helping protect child molesters, including Premier Bob
Carr and opposition leader Peter Collins, or face indefinite
suspension.
	   The Legislative Council Standing Committee on Parliamentary
Privilege and Ethics found Arena's conduct fell below the standard
expected of members of Parliament and brought the upper house into
disrepute.

Decision day for Northern Ireland's most contentious Orange march

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ A commission that will rule
Monday on whether to allow an annual Protestant march through a
hostile Catholic neighborhood faces a no-win situation, with the
British government deploying troops in anticipation of trouble no
matter what the decision.
	   The long-postponed verdict by the Parades Commission comes just
four days after the election of a new 108-seat Assembly for
Northern Ireland, bedrock of April's peace agreement among eight
parties.
	   Protestant and Catholic politicians alike now hope that same
spirit of compromise will defuse the looming confrontation next
Sunday in embittered Portadown, a staunchly Protestant town
southwest of Belfast.
	   But, illustrating why the conflict has so far defied solution,
they both expect the other side to respect their own community's
rights and back down.
	   About 2,000 members of the Orange Order fraternal group want to
parade as usual from their rural church back into Portadown via
disputed Garvaghy Road, home to the town's alienated Catholic
minority. Local anti-Orange protesters led by a former IRA
prisoner, Breandan MacCionnaith, are threatening to mobilize
thousands of Catholics and block the road.
	   The British government has deployed more than 1,000 extra
soldiers from bases in England in anticipation of violence. These
``emergency battalions'' raise the total troop level in Northern
Ireland to 19,000, ready to support the province's 13,000 police.
	   Two years ago, police blocked the Orangemen outside the church
and ordered them to march a different way back to town. But after
four nights of Protestant mob mayhem _ during which major highways
were blocked, businesses torched, the airport closed, the port
blockaded, and a Catholic taxi driver abducted and executed _ the
police caved in and forced the march past enraged Catholic
residents.
	   Last year, police endured three nights of intense Catholic
rioting and Irish Republican Army gun attacks after launching a
surprise predawn raid on Garvaghy Road and clubbing several hundred
protesters off the roadway.
	   The Portadown Orangemen have refused to talk directly with the
Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition, arguing that it and other
anti-Orange protest groups are IRA fronts and that their own civil
right to public assembly shouldn't be infringed.
	   The Parades Commission, which is appointed by the government but
officially independent, has ordered several smaller Orange parades
barred from Catholic areas. The commission is composed of three
Catholic and three Protestant professionals led by an English
former labor-union negotiator.
	   The commission originally intended to publish its Portadown
verdict six weeks ago. But fearing that the peace process would be
undermined, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told Graham to
suppress his report until after May's public referendum on the
Belfast peace agreement and last week's Assembly election.
	   Orange leaders presume that the commission long ago decided to
try to restrict their 80,000-member organization in Portadown.
Reflecting the group's favorite slogans of ``No surrender,'' ``Not
an inch'' and ``What we have we hold,'' they have refused to meet
the commission.
	   A hard-line Orange faction, calling itself ``the Spirit of
Drumcree'' after the name of the Anglican church that is the
march's focal point, is openly threatening to organize a repeat of
the 1996 chaos.
	   The Garvaghy Road protest leader, MacCionnaith, said he thinks
there's ``a 50-50 chance'' that the commission will order the
parade barred this time.
	   ``The British government knows it will take a major military
operation to secure the Orangemen's passage this year,''
MacCionnaith said.

Treasurer rejects suggestions Australia to go into recession 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Treasurer Peter Costello on Monday
rejected predictions Australia is heading for a recession,
insisting strong domestic economic growth will cushion it from the
full impact of the Asia crisis.
	   A survey of 11 academic economists published Monday placed the
chances of a recession striking in the next two years from between
``probable'' to ``very high.''
	   But responding to the survey's findings on an Adelaide radio
station, Costello said: ``Oh no. It is true there has been a
serious downturn in Asia and that will affect the Australian
economy, in fact most of Asia is now in recession.
	   ``But the Australian economy has been remarkably strong in the
last quarter, probably the fastest growing economy amongst
developed nations in the world, and whilst Asia will affect it and
it will make it harder for Australia in the future, the fact that
we're coming into it with strong growth means that we'll be able to
withstand it.''
	   The Australian dollar fell against the U.S. dollar recently when
dealers linked Australia to the Asia crisis, although it has since
managed to regain some ground.
	   Asked whether it was wrong in retrospect for the government to
have tried to talk up the currency, Costello replied: ``We don't
try and talk a particular level for the Australia dollar.''
	   Costello said he merely made the point that the currency should
be based on fundamentals including the inflation and growth rates,
``And they have been very strong in Australia.''
	   A volatile world environment, particularly for the yen, made it
easier for other currencies to become caught up in events.
	   ``But my point has always been that when you're looking at the
Australian dollar, it's the Australian fundamentals that are
important,'' he said.

	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ Residents of this devastated city slept
outdoors overnight Monday as aftershocks from a deadly earthquake
continued to rock the area.
	   This southern city and the nearby town Ceyhan, 50 kilometers (30
miles) to the east, were hardest hit by the 6.3 magnitude quake
Saturday, which killed 112 people, according to the latest toll.
	   Almost half of Ceyhan's 80,000 residents fled town, turning it
into a ghost town as night approached.
	   Up to 70 aftershocks kept panicking residents away from their
homes, while hospitals set up makeshift outdoor treatment centers
to treat the more than 1,000 injured people.
	   ``I want my bed,'' cried Olgay Tan, 38, as she lay on a blanket
in a park.
	   But her husband, Ahmet, wanted to be cautious. ``I am terribly
scared. I can't enter my home without thinking of an imminent
quake.''
	   Another survivor, Nevin Ozsener, said sleeping outside didn't
bother her. She was far more concerned about finding the money to
rebuild her badly damaged house.
	   She was hoping for government aid, or she may be lucky enough to
benefit from the 250 billion Turkish Lira, approximately dlrs 1
million, that business magnate Sakip Sabanci promised to donate to
the disaster-stricken region.
	   The Sabancis, who control Turkey's second-largest conglomerate,
comes from Adana. The family is among the world's riches, according
to Forbest magazine.
	   Rescuers pulled out only one survivor in Ceyhan Sunday, an
11-year-old boy who, despite spending close to 24 hours trapped
under a collapsed building, seemed to be in good health. Rescuers
were still searching for five members of his family.
	   Three other children, trapped under a building during a birthday
party, were not as lucky. Their dead bodies were dug out from the
rubble Sunday.
	   ``About 25 people may still be trapped under the rubble in
Ceyhan,'' fireman Ekrem Dogdu said Sunday evening.
	   Rescue operations were halted late Sunday because of darkness.
	   The dead include 46 people in Ceyhan, and 44 in Adana, where
most victims lived in poorly built homes in city slums. Most of
these areas are crowded with Kurds who have fled the war in
southeast Turkey between the army and the autonomy-seeking
guerrillas.
	   The other victims were found in nearby towns and villages.
	   On Sunday, survivors mourned their relatives at area cemeteries.
	   Several victims, wrapped in the traditional Muslim white shroud,
were buried in joint funerals that were hastily arranged because of
the hot weather.
	   At the outskirts of Adana is Incirlik air base, used by U.S. and
British jets to patrol a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
	   Staff Sgt. Joel Langton of the U.S. Air Force at Incirlik said
35 people affiliated with the base suffered mild bruises and cuts.
He did not give their nationalities.
	   The quake _ Turkish seismologists put the magnitude at 6.3 while
the U.S. Geological Survey estimated it at 6.2 _ was slightly felt
along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, but hotel officials said
foreigners at resorts remained calm.
	   Several government buildings also collapsed, despite a public
works ministry decree ordering safety measures in the construction
of buildings in earthquake-prone regions, the daily Sabah noted.
	   Much of Turkey sits atop the Anatolian fault, and earthquakes
are frequent.

<TEXT>
	   CAM PHA, Vietnam (AP) _ The grime-covered workers don't pay much
attention to the scenic backdrop of islands dotting Halong Bay as
they shovel coal into baskets and haul 25-kilogram (55-pound) loads
on their heads.
	   This is the coal industry, Vietnam-style: labor-intensive,
unhealthy and unlikely to make major changes soon.
	   Half or more of the workers at 60 local companies affiliated
with state-owned Vinacoal are involved in manual labor, and that
doesn't include the day laborers who load ships basket by basket.
Only the strip mines use heavy machinery.
	   The tourist hotels serving Halong Bay are only 24 kilometers (16
miles) away, but few visitors ever take the short ferry ride to
Vietnam's main coal region. Only Chinese tourists making the
arduous 4 1-2 -hour drive from the border are guaranteed a glimpse.
	   Halong is boats cruising among greens and blues. Cam Pha is coal
trucks churning up dust that covers everything and washes out the
colors to a dull, dark gray.
	   But in an area with few resources other than coal, mining draws
generation after generation of locals to the backbreaking work,
even entire families.
	   Monthly pay ranges from 600,000 to 1.2 million dong (dlrs 46 to
dlrs 92), which is still better than the national average of less
than 570,000 dong (dlrs 25).
	   ``The best part of this job is when I get paid on the 15th and
30th of each month,'' 22-year-old Ta Thi Sau said as she took a
brief respite from shoveling waste at a coal-washing pit.
	   ``I wish I had a better job, but we can't find anything else.
This is considered the worst job here, but I need seniority to move
up.''
	   Company officials claim only a tiny fraction of workers suffer
from work-related ailments, with checkups every three months in
three clinics.
	   But the workers, some with hacking coughs, tell of using water
to wash gray muck from their sinuses every night.
	   Some, particularly the women, wear face masks to keep out the
worst of the dust that can cause black-lung disease and other
respiratory problems. Most do without in the steamy heat, saying
masks don't help much anyway.
	   ``Of course we're very vulnerable,'' said Bui Thi Nhi, 38, who
has moved up to one company's quality control division during 20
years on the job. ``Now you may feel good, but you don't know if
you will suffer from cancer 10 or 20 years from now.''
	   Overall, 70,000 people in the area work for the companies that
produced 10 million tons of good-quality, low-sulfur coal last
year. Three million tons were shipped overseas, mainly to Japan,
Britain and Hungary.
	   The average workday, six days a week, starts around 6 a.m. so
the workers can take a two- to three-hour break during the midday
sauna-like conditions.
	   The steady procession of workers who cross wooden planks to load
ships by hand can carry 6 to 7 tons per person each day _ all for
20,000 dong (dlrs 2).
	   Nearby are teams of scavengers, who make even less by collecting
leftovers for home use or for sale. Some are in their early teens,
going to school in the morning, then coming to dig for the best
pieces.
	   As tourism grows at Halong Bay, local officials are worrying
about the long-term impact of the mines on the environment.
	   Coal leaches into the bay from the storage and loading
facilities. A volcano-like mountain of waste has been growing since
1954, each truck looking like an ant as it dumps its load.
	   The coal companies claim the situation has improved in the last
few years, when the first regulations on coal-waste dumping took
effect. Each company has been told to submit a long-range
environmental plan.
	   Coc Sau Coal Co. claims it allocates 1.5 percent to 2 percent of
its total expenses for environmental protection: planting trees and
having water-spraying trucks follow coal trucks to keep the dust to
a minimum.

Opposition aims for gains in Baja California mayoral, state congress vote from polling stations, background.

<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ The opposition National Action Party had
its sights on retaining the mayorship in the largest Mexican city
along the U.S. border as voters went to the polls.
	   The PAN, as it is known by its Spanish initials, aimed for a
fourth straight victory Sunday in Tijuana over the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which rules at the national level.
	   Baja California, home to a burgeoning population and a growing
number of foreign assembly plants, faces severe development and
crime problems. It was one of the first Mexican states to vote an
opposition-party governor into power, and it currently has a PAN
governor.
	   The main contenders in the five-candidate race for Tijuana mayor
were Francisco Vega de la Madrid of the PAN, Amador Rodriguez
Lozano of the PRI and Jesus Ruiz Barraza of the left-center
Democratic Revolution Party.
	   At stake were five key mayoral posts in Baja California and all
25 seats in the state congress.
	   Election officials and police reported few problems while the
state's 2,337 polling places were open from 8 a.m. (1500 GMT
Sunday) to 6 p.m. (0100 GMT Monday). A few polling places failed to
open on time because of a lack of personnel.
	   By law, no campaigning was permitted in the last three days
before the election. Liquor sales also were banned over the
weekend.
	   Final results in Mexican elections can often take several days.
	   Turnout among the state's 1,231,667 registered voters was light
despite good weather, as state residents apparently stayed home to
watch World Cup soccer play.
	   The PAN was expected to hang onto the mayorships of Tijuana and
Mexicali, the state capital.
	   ``Right now, it seems that all is well,'' PAN supporter Juan de
Dios Rodriguez, 34, said after casting his ballot in downtown
Tijuana.
	   ``We see that it (the PAN) has done many things for Tijuana,''
added voter Teresita Gonzalez Bustos, 25, who works in a Sony
maquiladora, or assembly plant near the U.S. border. She said she
has noticed improvements in the streets and schools.
	   But Juana Flores Rodriguez, 29, said she liked the promises of
Rodriguez Lozano, who has said he would bring paved roads, storm
drains and running water to shantytowns.
	   ``He is willing to work,'' Flores said. She said Rodriguez
Lozano, a 47-year-old federal senator, is someone ``who you can
present problems to and who can bring solutions.''
	   Vega, 43, is a former state finance director running for his
first elective post, while Ruiz is the 58-year-old founder of
Centro Universitario Tijuana, a private university.
	   Polls favored the PAN to take the port of Ensenada, currently
governed by the PRI.
	   Meanwhile, the PRD was positioned to take the border city of
Tecate from the PRI, according to recent polls. In the fifth race,
the town of Rosarito Beach was holding its first mayoral election.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Reaching out to the generation that will lead
China in the new millennium, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a
speech broadcast across China Monday that human rights ``are the
birthrights of people everywhere.
	   Clinton urged China's communist leaders not to fear an open
society. ``Freedom is a powerful engine of progress,'' he said in a
speech at Peking University.
	   Students and faculty members warmly welcomed the American leader
as he strode into a hall on the quiet, leafy campus whose students
were the driving force behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
	   ``We are convinced certain rights are universal,'' Clinton said,
although he said the United States does not seek to impose its
vision on others.

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Behind the broken brick
wall that once sheltered the School of the Martyrs, children play
in a sandy courtyard haunted by the ghosts of last year's civil
war.
	   There's Mrs. Tsongo, the fourth-grade teacher killed by a
gunman's stray bullet. Her old classroom sits empty and quiet.
	   Another teacher met the same fate.
	   And they remember the soldier's mangled corpse that pupils found
just days before the school was abandoned, then converted into a
base by the rebel Cobra army, which put President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso into power.
	   ``None of us can be the same anymore,'' says Martyrs' principal,
Jeanne Bitsoua. ``We had teachers killed here; we had fighting
right here. You can't erase those things.''
	   The students are like youngsters throughout Brazzaville. They
remain deeply troubled by the bloodshed in this central African
nation, which is adjacent to the much larger Congo, the scene of
its own civil war last year.
	   Preliminary studies by the United Nations Children's Fund
indicate nearly all Brazzaville's 450,000 children witnessed
killings, brutality and rape during the four-month civil war. It
was a war of torture, severed limbs, piles of abandoned bodies and
random killing.
	   Officials mounting a UNICEF project aimed at psychological
healing say that of 2,000 children interviewed in the capital so
far, about 90 percent display symptoms of post-traumatic disorder
related to the war.
	   And while many children suffered through the war as victims,
many others were recruited as fighters by both sides of the
conflict.
	   ``You're just 14 and you're goaded into killing people, or told
to help hold somebody down while they are raped or maimed or
killed,'' says Dominique Serrano-Fitamant, a psychologist who
consults for UNICEF. ``How do you then go on to lead a normal
life?''
	   Caught at the center of fighting in the dying days of the war,
the School of the Martyrs was exposed to some of the worst
bloodshed and the mental scars run deep.
	   ``When I came back to school I asked about Mrs. Tsongo,''
12-year-old Etou Loubaki says, staring down at his feet. ``They
told me she was dead.''
	   Etou and his family made a gruesome trek out of Brazzaville to
get away from the fighting.
	   ``There were bodies all along the road,'' he says in little more
than a whisper.
	   Images seared into memory still evoke nightmares of how the dead
seemed to stare up from the ditches, he adds.
	   The fighting wrecked Brazzaville. From street to street,
buildings lie in heaps of rubble. The city's only skyscraper, owned
by the state-run oil corporation, is a shell-torn shambles.
	   In the School of the Martyrs _ named for Congolese nationalist
heroes of generations past _ classrooms are void of chairs, desks
and even chalk for the blackboards. Bullet holes and profane
wartime graffiti mar cement and brick walls.
	   Even though the guns fell silent months ago, Etou still barely
eats and can't focus on his lessons, says teacher Suzanne
Kolindzami, who replaced Mrs. Tsongo.
	   He isn't alone.
	   Eating disorders, sleeplessness, aggressiveness, emotional
withdrawal and incoherent speech patterns are some of the more
common symptoms identified in most of the children surveyed so far
by UNICEF, Serrano-Fitamant says.
	   ``We aren't just talking about some few cases here,'' she says.
``This is an entire generation, and the long-term consequences
could be devastating for the country.''
	   UNICEF and the Red Cross are setting up a treatment center for
children whose wounds from the war are psychological and not
physical.
	   Staffed by therapists, teachers and psychologists, the center
will use discussion groups, individual counseling and a nurturing
environment to help the children cope with their troubling
memories. ``It's not magic,'' says Antoine Makonda, UNICEF's local
educational director. ``The scars will still be there, but we want
to teach the children to live with what they've gone through.''

Five financially weak Korean banks ordered closed UPDATES with bank employees resisting closure order, mobilization of police to enforce government order 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of employees of five shaky
banks picketed or refused to work Monday to protest a government
order shutting down the institutions.
	   Police were mobilized to enforce the order, but banking
regulators were barred from entering the headquarters of the five
banks by picketing employees.
	   The Financial Supervisory Commission ordered the banks closed
Monday as part of the government's effort to restore the confidence
of foreign investors in South Korea's shattered economy.
	   ``Liquidation of the weak banking sector is an imperative task
we can no longer postpone,'' said Lee Hun-jae, the supervisory
commission's chairman.
	   Lee identified the five banks to be closed as Kyungki, Chung
Chong, Daedong, Donghwa and Dongnam. Together, they hold bad loans
estimated at ``several billion dollars,'' his office said.
	   Lee said five bigger commercial banks _ Korea Housing, KorAm,
Shinhan, Hana and Kookmin _ will take over the five insolvent
banks. He did not spell out the takeover conditions, but local
media reported that the government has promised to write off much
of the failed banks' debts.
	   Lee indicated that more financially weak banks could fold in the
coming months. The closures announced Monday were the first in the
nation's history.
	   Analysts agreed that the closures would help restore foreign
investor confidence.
	   ``It marks the first important step toward reorganizing the
troubled banking sector and left an important lesson that even
banks can collapse,'' Kim Ho-hwan, an economic analyst, said.
	   Despite a government promise of job security for most employees,
thousands of workers staged sit-downs or did not report to work
after turning off their banks' main computer systems.
	   About 1,000 helmeted riot police with meter-long batons and
plastic shields ringed the head office of failed Donghwa Bank in
Seoul, where 1,500 bank employees staged a sit-down overnight.
	   The protesters blocked the entry of 150 government officials and
financial experts to supervise the takeover order.
	   Similar protests were reported at other banks in Seoul and three
provincial cities _ Pusan, Taegu and Taejon.
	   In a statement designed to head off a run on the insolvent
banks, the supervisory commission said the government will
guarantee payment of their deposits.
	   South Korean banks maintained cozy relations with past
military-backed governments and even financially shaky banks could
survive with preferential government loans and other favors.
	   But the environment has changed as South Korea undergoes radical
reforms under stiff conditions which came with a dlrs 58 billion
bailout by the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The government previously had shut down 14 troubled merchant
banks, or finance companies. In mid-May, it named 55 heavily
indebted companies subject to liquidation.
	   The supervisory commission said the five banks to be closed were
selected from among 12 banks ordered early this year to improve
their capital-to-asset ratio to internationally accepted levels.
	   The 12 banks were given until the end of May to improve their
financial status or face closure or merger. The government finished
reviewing the progress of their restructuring programs Saturday.
	   The commission allowed the other seven banks to stay open
temporarily, with an order to improve their finances within the
next month or face closure or merger.
	   Word of the government's list leaked last Friday, prompting
massive withdrawals of deposits.

	   The president said that some people in America and China
question whether closer relations between the two countries are in
each other's interests.
	   But everything we know about the way the world is changing and
the challenges your generation will face tell us that our two
nations will be better off working together than apart,'' he said.
	   With a history as a center of liberal thinking, Peking
University is closely monitored by the government, which restricts
visitors. Some 24,000 undergraduates attend the university, founded
100 years ago.
	   Clinton's address came after a day of breathtaking sightseeing
at the Great Wall and in the ancient palaces of the walled
Forbidden City.
	   Contrary to Clinton's argument, China's communist government
contends that the way human rights are protected depends on a
country's condition. President Jiang Zemin and other leaders argue
that stability is essential to economic prosperity.
	   Clinton said, ``I believe that everywhere, people aspire to be
treated with dignity ... to give voice to their opinions ... to
choose their own leaders .. to associate with whom they wish ... to
worship how, when and where they want.
	   ``These are not American rights or European rights or developed
world rights,'' Clinton said. ``They are the birthrights of people
everywhere.''
	   He said economic security is an essential element of freedom but
that ``true freedom must mean more than economic opportunity. In
America, we believe that freedom itself is indivisible.''
	   ``We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom
strengthens stability,'' the president said. ``In the global
information age, freedom is a powerful engine of progress.''
	   Clinton said the greatest source of China's strength is in the
minds and hearts of its citizens. ``It is profoundly in your
interest _ and the interest of the world's _ that those minds be
free to reach the fullness of their potential,'' he said. ``That is
the message of our times and the mandate of the 21st century.''
	   The university appearance was Clinton's final stop in this
capital city before an evening flight to Shanghai, the booming
commercial center at the mouth of the Yangtze River. A highlight
will be Clinton's participation in a Shanghai radio call-in show
Tuesday.

Dollar higher, stocks rise in Tokyo 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday trading
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was stronger against the yen in
late morning trading Monday, but profit-taking following the
release of a key central bank report left it off earlier highs.
Tokyo stocks rose moderately.
	   At late morning, the dollar bought 141.70 yen, up 0.42 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late Friday level in New York of
142.44 yen.
	   At one point, the dollar moved as high as 143.40 yen, its
strongest level since Japan and the United States conducted joint
dollar-selling intervention on June 17.
	   But the U.S. currency shed some of its early gains on
profit-taking after the Bank of Japan's ``tankan'' quarterly survey
of business sentiment came in not quite as dismal as economists had
expected.
	   That result caused U.S. hedge funds and European investors to
sell dollars for yen, traders said.
	   The survey's ``business condition diffusion index'' _ which
measures the percentage of major manufacturers seeing conditions
improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen _ fell to
minus 38 from minus 31 in the previous survey released in early
April.
	   Still, the figure was better than an average forecast of minus
44 by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The weakness of Japan's economy has been pulling down the yen.
Analysts fear that a falling yen will rekindle the Asian currency
crisis by further weakening the already battered currencies of many
countries in the region.
	   ``We are concerned about the weakness of the yen,'' Haruhiko
Kuroda, head of the international bureau at Japan's Finance
Ministry, said Monday.
	   On the stock exchange, share prices moved higher on improved
market sentiment following news Friday about the possible merger of
a troubled major bank.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 139.16 points, or 0.91
percent, to 15,349.20 at the end of the morning session. On Friday,
the index closed up 77.82 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.63 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,201.45.
The TOPIX gained 5.29 points, or 0.47 percent, on Friday.
	   Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. said Friday that they agreed to start negotiations for a
merger to take place in a year's time. Ailing Long-Term Credit Bank
had been looking for a partner to save it from problems caused by
massive bad loans.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.275 percent from Friday's finish of 1.230
percent, driving its price down to 111.39 yen from 111.73 yen.

Clinton Tells Students Human Rights Are Universal under way. AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: Combines previous, with new quotes. Q and A with students
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a speech
broadcast across China Monday that human rights ``are the
birthrights of people everywhere.
	   Clinton urged China's communist leaders not to fear an open
society. ``Freedom is a powerful engine of progress,'' he said in a
speech at Peking University.
	   Students and faculty members warmly welcomed the American leader
as he strode into a hall on the quiet, leafy campus whose students
were the driving force behind the 1989 pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
	   ``We are convinced certain rights are universal,'' Clinton said,
although he said the United States does not seek to impose its
vision on others.
	   Asked during a question-and-answer session with students to
defend U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan, Clinton said the United States
was sticking to its policy of encouraging reunification talks
between China and Taiwan, and that any U.S. weapons sold to the
island nation are strictly for defensive purposes.
	   ``U.S. policy is not an obstacle to China-Taiwan
reunification,'' Clinton said.
	   He also sought to dispel China's contention that the United
States' security treaty with Japan is aimed at containing China's
military development.
	   ``We cannot see the agreements of today through the mirror of
yesterday's conflicts,'' Clinton said.
	   Asked during a question-and-answer session with students to
defend U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan, Clinton said the United States
was sticking to its policy of encouraging reunification talks

	   ``U.S. policy is not an obstacle to China-Taiwan

	   He also sought to dispel China's contention that the United
States' security treaty with Japan is aimed at containing China's
military development.
	   ``We cannot see the agreements of today through the mirror of
yesterday's conflicts,'' Clinton said.
	   Clinton's speech, including his off-the-cuff response to
students' questions, was broadcast live by government media _ as
was Clinton's vigorous debate over human rights with President
Jiang Zemin at a news conference Saturday. U.S. officials were
delighted by the government's openness, which they said was
unprecedented during a visit by a foreign leader.
	   Clinton said some people in both America and China question
whether closer relations are worthwhile.
	   ``But everything we know about the way the world is changing and
the challenges your generation will face tell us that our two
nations will be better off working together than apart,'' Clinton
said.
	   A banner at the back of the hall declared: ``The U.S. and China
An Enduring Friendship.''
	   The president departed from his text at one point to stress
concern about the environment, telling university faculty and
student they would have to help ``lead the way'' in saving the
world from greenhouse gases that are destroying the ozone layer.
	   He praised China for having a positive economic role in the
region.
	   ``China has steadfastly shouldered its responsibility to the
region and the world in this latest financial crisis, helping to
prevent another cycle of dangerous devaluations,'' he said.
	   With a history as a center of liberal thinking, Peking
University is closely monitored by the government, which restricts
visitors. Some 24,000 undergraduates attend the university, founded
100 years ago.
	   Clinton's address came after a day of breathtaking sightseeing

Treasurer rejects suggestions Australia to go into recession 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Australia growth rate in new 5th graf
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Treasurer Peter Costello on Monday
rejected predictions Australia is heading for a recession,
insisting strong domestic economic growth will cushion it from the
full impact of the Asia crisis.
	   A survey of 11 academic economists published Monday placed the
chances of a recession striking in the next two years from between
``probable'' to ``very high.''
	   But responding to the survey's findings on an Adelaide radio
station, Costello said: ``Oh no. It is true there has been a
serious downturn in Asia and that will affect the Australian
economy, in fact most of Asia is now in recession.
	   ``But the Australian economy has been remarkably strong in the
last quarter, probably the fastest growing economy amongst
developed nations in the world, and whilst Asia will affect it and
it will make it harder for Australia in the future, the fact that
we're coming into it with strong growth means that we'll be able to
withstand it.''
	   The economy expanded 1.3 percent in the first quarter and 4.9
percent over the last year.
	   The Australian dollar fell against the U.S. dollar recently when
dealers linked Australia to the Asia crisis, although it has since
managed to regain some ground.
	   Asked whether it was wrong in retrospect for the government to
have tried to talk up the currency, Costello replied: ``We don't
try and talk a particular level for the Australia dollar.''
	   Costello said he merely made the point that the currency should
be based on fundamentals including the inflation and growth rates,
``And they have been very strong in Australia.''
	   A volatile world environment, particularly for the yen, made it
easier for other currencies to become caught up in events.
	   ``But my point has always been that when you're looking at the
Australian dollar, it's the Australian fundamentals that are
important,'' he said.

Poverty said growing cause of preventable death in New Zealand 
</HEADLINE>
By RAY LILLEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Higher rates of death due to
poverty and the growing gap between the well-being of rich and poor
must be addressed, a New Zealand government-funded committee on
public health warned Monday.
	   Low income, unemployment and poor and overcrowded housing are
all leading to growing public health problems in the country, the
National Health Committee said in a report.
	   More people are set to fall ill and die of diseases such as
tuberculosis, meningococcal disease and respiratory illness because
they are living in poverty, it said.
	   ``The link between poverty and ill-health is clear; with few
exceptions, the financially worst-off experience the highest rates
of illness and premature death,'' said the report.
	   The report highlights income as the single most important
modifiable determinant of health, warning that persistent health
inequalities between the haves and have-nots caused by
socio-economic factors are likely to worsen.
	   New Zealand has high rates of cardiovascular disease,
respiratory disease, breast and bowel cancer, motor vehicle
injuries and suicide compared to other developed countries, the
report said.
	   ``The major cases of premature death and ill health in New
Zealand _ cancer, ischaemic heart disease and motor vehicle crashes
_ are in many cases preventable,'' it said.
	   The country's infant mortality rate has not improved at the same
rate as in other Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development countries.
	   In 1960, New Zealand's rate was sixth out of 21 OECD countries,
but by 1995 it was 15th.
	   The report argues reducing socio-economic inequalities in health
is fair because people have limited control over the socio-economic
factors that harm their health.
	   Reducing those inequalities benefits wider society through
reductions in communicable disease, reducing alcohol abuse, mental
illness and violence.
	   It also has economic benefits by reducing unnecessary
expenditure on treatment services, thus freeing resources for other
uses.
	   Effective interventions suggested include improving employment
opportunities, increasing physical activity, providing adequate
income maintenance for those who become ill, and better targeting
health services at people in low socio-economic groups.
	   Health Minister Bill English said the findings were not news to
policy makers, and reinforced government strategies in a number of
areas.
	   ``I was looking for some new solutions, they're not there. This
is a report that covers ground that is fairly familiar to all of
us. What we have to do is provide solutions to real problems.''

President Bill Clinton might have to bypass the scenic southern
city of Guilin have receded, the official newspaper China Daily
reported Monday.
	   The city was mopping up after flooding in the region over the
past few weeks had left 800,000 people stranded and more than
200,000 homeless. Torrential rains triggered landslides and other
calamities that killed ``dozens of people,'' the report said.
	   At least 370 people have died this year in seasonal floods
triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rains.
	   The state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late Sunday that flood
waters in southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, had
peaked.
	   But the China Daily said that traffic on the main rail trunk
between Beijing and the Guangdong provincial capital, Guangzhou,
was still blocked by flooding in central China.
	   To prevent flood waters from sweeping away a key bridge along
the line, engineers had towed a ``specially weighted'' train onto
the line.
	   Medical workers were working to prevent possible flood-related
epidemics, as rescue operations continued in other flood stricken
regions, the report said.

Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES lead to show survey result worst in four
By CHESTER DAWSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Business sentiment at major Japanese companies has
deteriorated to its worst level in four years, according to the
results of a closely-watched central bank report released Monday.
	   The Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' survey showed much of
corporate Japan remains worried over anemic growth in the domestic
market and the prospects for recovery in other Asian nations hit by
a financial crisis.
	   The survey's ``business condition diffusion index'' fell to
minus 38 in June from minus 31 in the previous quarter. The
diffusion index measures the percentage of major manufacturers
seeing conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen.
	   The June tankan survey marked the fourth consecutive drop and
the lowest level since a minus 39 in August 1994. The worst ever
tankan result, a minus 67, was recorded in 1975.
	   Still, the most recent survey showing was better than an average
forecast of minus 44 by economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires.
It was also not as sharp a decline as reported in April when the
March tankan came in at minus 31, down from minus 11 in December.
	   Also Monday, Japan's trade ministry said industrial production
in May fell a seasonally-adjusted 2 percent compared to the
previous month. That was below the 0.1 percent rise forecast by
private economists polled by Dow Jones.
	   In the tankan results, the Bank of Japan said the 9,264 firms
surveyed expect the diffusion index, or DI, to improve to minus 34
three months from now. The Bank of Japan said this indicates
optimism over the impact of a recently-approved government stimulus
package designed to jump start the economy.
	   ``Improvements in the DI for big companies reflect high
expectations for the government's steps in the second half of the
fiscal year,'' said Shosaku Murayama, director for research and
statistics at the central bank.
	   A minus 49 result for a diffusion index of small manufacturers
was the worst since May 1975, when the index fell to minus 51,
according to a Bank of Japan official.
	   Big manufacturers, many of which are dependent on exports,
remain cautious about the direction of the yen, with most
forecasting an average rate for the dollar of 125.75 in the
business year to March, 1999.
	   The yen recently fell to its lowest levels in eight years, a
boon to exporters because it increases the yen value of profits
earned overseas. In midday Tokyo trading Monday, it was quoted at
141.48 yen to the dollar.
	   Japan, plagued by slumping consumer demand and problems in its
banking system, is in its worst economic recession since the end of
World War II.

Chinese-born legislator resigns from prime minister's party 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's first Chinese-born
legislator resigned from Prime Minister John Howard's conservative
party Monday, saying she is outraged over its obeisance to Pauline
Hanson's right-wing populist One Nation Party.
	   The resignation of New South Wales state legislator Helen Sham
Ho from the Liberal Party _ which, despite its name, is the more
conservative of the mainstream parties _ was announced the same
day.
	   Sham Ho has been critical of the conservative governing
coalition's stance on Hanson's party.
	   Sham Ho said she will become an independent and seek the Labor
Party's support to become upper house president in New South Wales
after being discouraged from contesting the post by the Liberals,
who wanted to avoid offending One Nation.
	   The position became vacant following the resignation of Max
Willis last week.
	   ``My decision to run for the presidency was a difficult one. It
comes after much soul searching and deliberation with my family,''
she said.
	   ``As an Australian who has served the people of New South Wales
for over ten years I have been deeply distressed over the growing
politics of division that is turning Australians against
Australians.
	   ``To be told by the Liberal Party that I cannot contest the
presidency because I would offend the One Nation party is offensive
and insulting to all Australians,'' she said.
	   She said the Liberal Party in Queensland had actively assisted
One Nation in that state, forming a deal to swap votes with each
other in districts they did not win.
	   This was ``a great disappointment,'' Sham Ho said.
	   ``This decision can be contrasted with the Australian Labor
party, which has taken a strong stand against One Nation party and
has demonstrated that it has a real commitment to equality for all
Australians,'' she said.
	   Willis quit his post last Friday amid allegations he was under
the influence of alcohol during a late night parliamentary session.
