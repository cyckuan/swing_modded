<HEADLINE> SADC Poised To Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Almost all SADC
countries are poised to attract foreign investment on the basis
of their political stability and economic reforms, SADC Executive
Chairman and Botswanan President Ketumile Masire said today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a conference of Southern African Development Community
(SADC) trade ministers and United States and regional businessmen
in Gaborone, Masire said the SADC governments are making major
efforts to remove impediments that often frustrate direct
investment flows.
</P>
<P>
The conference, convened under the initiative of the US
Department of Commerce, was co-chaired by US Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown and Abdallah Kigoda, Chairman of the SADC ministers of
trade and Tanzanian minister of commerce.
</P>
<P>
Brown was on a US commercial development mission to Africa to
increase US trade with sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Most SADC countries are liberalizing their economies through
the relaxing of exchange controls, reduction of taxes, the easing
of import and export regulations, easier access to work and
resident permits, and are allowing foreign ownership of business
in their countries," Masire said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, Brown said the American government
and private investors should respond to the efforts of the SADC
member countries to attract trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a pay-off. This conference is an important
first step in that direction," Brown said.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the conference, attended by 12 SADC trade
ministers, 48 US businessmen and 100 businessmen from the region,
would identify real opportunities for both the governments and
private investors and lay a blueprint for further cooperation
between the US and SADC.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Coalition Talks Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (xinhua) -- Leaders of the Turkish
Motherland Party (ANAP) and the Islamic Welfare Party (RP) today
announced their failure in the coalition talks, which could
possibly lead to early elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-hour last round meeting with RP leader
Necmettin Erbakan, ANAP Chairman Mesut Yilmaz told a press
conference that the breakdown was due to their divergence on
which party would take charge of the economy and
Directorate-General of Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
But Yilmaz said the failure of coalition talks could not be
interpreted as a result of "fight over armchairs," a reference to
divvying up of cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
"The essential reason is, we could not reach a positive
conclusion in the process (of coalition talks) whether we could
go along with the common responsibility in harmony," said Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia News Agency reported that Yilmaz, who was assigned
two weeks ago to form a government after both RP leader Erbakan
and caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller failed to set up a
coalition, would ask to meet with president Suleyman Demirel
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ANAP's decision-making body will discuss tonight
whether to let their leader Yilmaz to return the mandate to
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Welfare Party appeared on top in the December 24
general election but its 158 deputies in the 550-seat parliament
fell short of a simple majority to form a government on its own.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of two center-right parties, Yilmaz and Ciller,
refused to compromise on who would be the prime minister and
failed to set up a coalition which is widely hoped by the public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
The failure of efforts to bring the Islamic RP to power may
bring a sigh of relief for supporters of secular systems at home
and Turkey's Western allies.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Welcomes Kuwait's Announcement on Normalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 24 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan
welcomed the recent announcement by Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdallah al-Sabah on plans to start
normalization of ties with Jordan, the Kuwait News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Al-Oabas published today, King Hussein said
this "normalization is on its way to become a reality."
"an Arab brother ... and a comrade of the long march."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad and Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Te
recently exchanged letters to pave the way for normalizing ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Jordan have soured since Iraq's
1990-1991 invasion of Kuwait during which Amman sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
the Jordanian king denied the reports that he was previously
informed about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, asserting that Jordan
was in no way backing the Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti people has the right to ask for an explanation of
the Jordanian stance and we have the right to answer," he said in
the interview given Monday in the Royal Court in Amman.
</P>
<P>
On the Jordanian-Iraqi federation, he said it was not a
Jordanian proposal but "it was a reaction to the opinion of some
Iraqis and I had said that the federation could be one of the
solutions."
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, King Hussein said the Israeli
early elections will boost the peace chances, noting that
normalization with Israel takes time.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Hashimoto Focus Discussions on Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto held an hour meeting
in Santa Monica, California last night, focusing their discussions
on the security issue, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"They discussed the security relationship, and there will be a
reaffirmation of our very strong security ties when the president
visits (Japan) in April," said Winston Lord, assistant secretary
of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at the end of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I think you will look forward to a security declaration at
that time," Lord told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lord said that Clinton and Hashimoto spent "a few minutes" on
the issue of U.S. presence on Okinawa, which is the highly
controversial issue in the wake of last year's rape of 12-year-old
Japanese school girl by three U.S. servicemen.
</P>
<P>
"They both agreed that they should work on this issue, looking
toward the president's visit and beyond the president's visit,"
Lord noted, "but they did not get into any specific fields."
</P>
<P>
Clinton assured Hashimoto that he knew the Okinawa issue was
"an important issue for Japan and for the people of Okinawa and
for the prime minister, and he pledged our best efforts to make
progress on that issue," Lord added.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials taking part in the meeting between Clinton
and Hashimoto said that the two leaders "agreed to give top
priority to deal with the Okinawa issue to strengthen bilateral
ties based on the U.S.-Japan security treaty."
</P>
<P>
"I was able to receive a strong signal from President Clinton
that the U.S. side was serious and earnest about the Okinawa
issue," Hashimoto told a news conference after the meeting with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side showed me that they too, regard the Okinawa
issue as central to maintaining the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty
system," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
Lord stressed that the two leaders discussed "many areas" of
mutual concern but none in great detail.
</P>
<P>
On trade, Clinton made it very clear there's a lot of
"unfinished Business," and he specifically mentioned four sectors
of interest to the U.S., which are semiconductors, insurance, film
industry and civil aviation, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto expressed that these trade issues should not be blown
up to a level that hurts overall ties, like the car trade dispute.

<HEADLINE> Trial Postponed Again For Alleged Deputy of Aideed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic court of north
Mogadishu has once again postponed the trial of Abdurahman Gabow
Mohamud, who was declared "deputy president" weeks ago by
self-claimed Somali president Mohamed Farah Aideed.
</P>
<P>
The trial would be resumed very soon, said acting chairman of
the court Sheikh Abdi Ali Alasow today.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Mohamud began on February 17 and was then
adjourned until today.
</P>
<P>
Mohamud was arrested on the night of February 11 after his
residence was raided by sharia militiamen supporting north
Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Mohamud was charged with possessing illegal weapons and
sponsoring organized crimes in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In early February, Mohammed Farrah Aideed, who controls south
Mogadishu, announced the appointments of six north Mogadishu
Abgal clan leaders, including Mohamud.
</P>
<P>
The six Abgal clan leaders soon denied knowledge about the
appointments, saying they would support neither north
Mogadishu strongmen Ali Mahdi Mohammed nor Aidded.
</P>
<P>
Mohamud insists that he is a political prisoner, imprisoned
under the cover of Islam which has been misused by Ali Mahdi. It
is not known what will become of Mohamud if he is convicted.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the Islamic court of north Mogadishu
has interfered in the political differences between rival leaders
in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Greece Seeks EU Support  (By Chen Dechang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis returned here today after his brief European tour which
was aimed at establishing stronger ties with EU and winning
support from EU partners in Greece's dispute with Turkey over
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival this afternoon, Simitis
declared that the result of his tour was "positive".
</P>
<P>
During his tour, first of its kind since he assumed premiership
a month ago, Simitis held talks with EU Commission President
Jacques Santer and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in
Brussels, with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn and with
French President Jacques Chirac in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Simitis, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos on the trip, focused in his talks on next month's EU's
Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in Turin, Italy, and asked for
more EU funds to support Greece's economy in order to meet the
criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty on European economic
convergence.
</P>
<P>
Measures have already been taken by the new Greek government to
absorb more effectively and quickly the EU funds, which reached
831 billion drachmas (about 36 billion U.S. dollars) during the
1994-95 period compared to the target of 1,063 billion drachmas
(about 46 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Simitis' visit took place at a time when the immediate threat
of war in the Aegean has subsided following last month's military
standoff between Greece and Turkey but both sides remain on
partial alert and were conducting military maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Greek side also sought the approval from
its EU partners that practical measures should be taken against
Ankara until it shows willingness to "respect the international
law."
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told press during the tour that specific action the
Greek side wanted to take includes a blockage of further EU
financial aid to Ankara and the suspension of steps toward the
development of Turkey's ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic measures, Simitis also asked for
more active European role in mediating future crisis with Turkey,
instead of leaving the main task to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington was the one which stepped in to prevent a war at end
of last month over the disputed islet of Imia, and U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Holbrook subsequently accused the
European Union of a dangerous inactivity.
</P>
<P>
One of Greek targets of its campaign for more practical
European support is the indirect guarantee of the Greek borders
against a possible Turkish attack. It has been seen by the local
observers as a modest substitute for something Greece has long
been seeking but with no success so far, namely, a strict military
guarantee of its borders either by NATO or the West European
Union.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that during the forthcoming intergovernmental
conference, Greece would seek approval of a statement that borders
of member states are also the borders of EU in an effort to
obtain more substantial support from Europe for its territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly stated that international law and
treaties clearly prove that the Imia Island belongs to Greece and
refused bilateral talks with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said at the end of his European tour that "all European
leaders agreed that existing Greek-Turkish differences should be
solved with peaceful means within the framework of international
law."
</P>
<P>
The Greek government and opposition parties now all agreed that
a recourse to the international court at the Hague over the Aegean
dispute would be to Athens' advantage because it maintained that
its sovereignty over the Aegean Islands "is not negotiable".
</P>
<P>
"Now," the Greek prime minister said, "the problem is beginning
to be positioned in the legal framework which Greece always
wanted."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) today delayed the
release of a tethered satellite by one day from space shuttle
Columbia because of mysterious computer problems.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, as the Columbia astronauts were checking out the
Italian Tethered Satellite System (TTS) and its subsystems, they
found problems with two computers that are critical to satellite
operations.
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, the astronauts replaced a suspect cable between
two computers and solved the problem. But a few moments later,
fresh trouble developed. As the astronauts were powering up the
payload bay computers, the computer Smart Flexible
Multiplexer-Demultiplexer was overloaded.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle crew, with the help from engineers on Earth,
resolved the trouble this morning, but NASA decided it was predent
to wait an extra day to further study the mysterious problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the previous schedule, Columbia's crew will unreel
the TTS 20.5 kilometers into space in the end of a thin tether at
3:37 p.m. Saturday. As the satellite flies through Earth's
ionosphere and across magnetic field lines at eight kilometers per
second, some 5,000 volts of electricity should be generated.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Food rations in refugee
camps in Tanzania's northwestern Kagera region are running out
and the regional authorities have appealed to international aid
agencies to come to their rescue.
</P>
<P>
Kagera Commissioner Philip Mangula told reporters in the
regional capital town of Bukoba yesterday that the World Food
Program (WFP) had food reserves to last only two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in refugee camps is quite alarming and the
security risk is very tense as the refugees are being given half
ration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mangula said that with food running out, the refugees had
been limited within a four-kilometre walking distance to avert
possible security risks.
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner also called upon the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to look for tenderers who
would supply fuel wood to the refugees following the restriction
on movement.
</P>
<P>
At present there are about 600,000 refugees in Kagera region,
most of them Rwandans.

<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today said children born after independence should adopt a
positive attitude towards education and cultivate an appreciation
of Zimbabwean culture.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing thousands of children at
the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the 21st February
Movement and his 72nd birthday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
As future parents and leaders, the children should make
maximum use of peace and stability prevailing in the country to
mould themselves into useful and socially acceptable
Zimbabweans, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The 21st February Movement was founded in 1986 with the
purpose of fostering good citizenship in Zimbabwean youths.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to urge this movement to strive for high moral
rectitude for its members so that they can develop a positive
outlook to life, abstaining from drugs and alcohol abuse and
refrain from leading promiscuous and morally decadent lives,"
Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"The onus is on you to augment family efforts and those of
other institutions that are working hard to develop in you a
sense of responsibility, self discipline and courage," he added.

Patrick Mayhew indicated today that talks between his government
and Sinn Fein may resume shortly, reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Belfast, the Ulster Secretary said that the
government was not yet in a position to fix a date for all-party
talks, which, he stressed, depends on agreement among all sides
concerned on elections in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew made this statement in response to Sinn Fein, political
wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which challenged earlier
the British government to convene all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator
with the British government Martin McGuinness said the British
government should give a guarantee it is prepared to hold talks on
the future of the crisis-stricken province.
</P>
<P>
Then, he promised, he was quite prepared to go to the IRA to
ask them to stop their bombing campaign which they resumed two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But the British Prime Minister John Major should make a
statement ensuring that his government is going to be part of a
process of meaningful negotiations about the future of Ulster, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish people are screaming out for peace negotiations now,
not in three months' time, He added.

<HEADLINE> 50 People Injured in Clashes in Dhaka </HEADLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- At least 50 Bangladeshis were
injured during clashes between opposition activists and police
here today, the first day of the 3-day "non-cooperation movement"
staged by the opposition parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Police sources and witnesses said that the first day of the
movement passed off amidst bomb blasts and stray clashes in
different parts of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The opposition activists attacked a procession brought out by
the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the morning,
leaving at least 10 injured, the sources said, adding that police
fired tear gas and picked up several persons near the secretariat,
the Central Administrative Center including various ministries, in
the afternoon when the opposition activists were picketing.
</P>
<P>
Unruly opposition activists also set ablaze autorickshaws, it
was reported.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League enforced the program to press their demand for cancellation
of the February 15 national elections by the BNP along with some
small parties and independent candidates, resignation of the BNP
government and fresh elections under a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition's program, the attendance of the
government officials and employees was reported to be satisfactory
while many Dhaka-bound launches arrived from different parts of
the country. All the scheduled flights operated as usual.
</P>
<P>
But shops, commercial establishments and private offices were
seen closed while road and rail communications across the country
were disrupted due to blockades at various points of the networks.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Telugu Desam (Naidu), a
major party of the national front-left parties combine, will table
a no-confidence motion against the Indian government during the
brief session of parliament beginning Monday, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion assumes significance in the context of
the reported grumbling in the ruling Congress party over the
actions of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in the hawala case
resulting in the resignations of a number of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The national front-left parties combine, or the third force,
will meet tomorrow morning to finalize their floor cooperation
strategy including its stand on the no-trust move of the Telugu
Desam faction.
</P>
<P>
The brief session of parliament beginning Monday is believed to
be the last one in the run-up to the general elections which may
be held in April.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, the opposition parties today also made it
clear that they will raise the hawala case, a 18-million-US-dollar
bribery scandal, and many other controversial issues in the coming
session of the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Ambassador: Greece Adopts Hostile Attitude toward Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Ambassador to Greece
Umit Pamir said today in Istanbul that Greece has been maintaining
its hostile attitude toward Turkey and has raised the issue of the
disputed Imia islets in the Aegean Sea on various international
forums following the Imia crisis.
</P>
<P>
Pamir, who was recalled Thursday night by the Turkish Foreign
Ministry "for consultations" of the increasing tension between
Turkey and Greece, said that for this reason, it is necessary for
Turkey to study the situation between the two NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is now moving to fight against all the diplomatic
initiatives by Greece aimed at blocking Turkey's path in the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU sources said that Greece had made it harder for Turkey
to be granted a five-year ECU 375 million (487 million
U.S. dollars) aid package to help it adjust to the customs union
it concluded with the EU last March.
</P>
<P>
Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said earlier in
a statement that Turkey has the strength and the determination
to respond to the Greek policy of enmity and no step that Greece
takes against Turkey will go without a response.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal has also said that as
Turkey indicated before, Ankara is firm in its determination not
to allow Greek actions that aimed at harming Turkey's interests
in the Aegean at the EU or at other international organizations
to go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
"Greece must know that it will pay the price for every step it
takes against Turkey," added Baykal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece staged a military confrontation in the
Aegean last month over the disputed Imia islets.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Likely to Import Sugar from India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is likely to import
over 150,000 tons of crystalline white sugar from India this year,
following export of 442,806 tons of refined sugar last year,
analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
India has offered to sell such sugar at 12 rupees (about 0.3 US
dollar) per kilogram, about 1,470 rupees (about 41 US dollars) per
ton less than the international market prices, according to the
Financial Post based in the commercial city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Pakistan would import a total of 300,000 to
400,000 tons of refined sugar this year, and if the situation
remains unchanged, it is feared that next year the deficit would
be 500,000 tons to 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The controversy between sugar mill owners and sugarcane growers
over the price of sugarcane remains unresolved in the country,
adversely affecting the sowing of sugarcane between February and
March.

<P>
PYONGYANG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- A Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO) survey team left here today after
completing its fourth inspection of sites for two proposed
light-water nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
The survey team, which arrived in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) last Friday, toured Sinpo in the province
of South Ham Gyong to study its geology, according to the Korean
Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The team, consisting of American, South Korean and Japanese
nuclear experts, started its inspections last August of suitable
sites on which to build the nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the United States and the
DPRK last June, the KEDO, a multinational consortium led by the
U.S., South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying the two
light-water reactors to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
A framework agreement was signed in October 1994 stipulating
that the two 1,000 megawatt light-water reactors be supplied to
the DPRK in return for a freeze on Pyongyang's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO has selected South Korea as the main supplier of the
reactors.

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian opposition parties
today demanded state-funding of elections and opposed any
"piecemeal" attempt to raise the ceiling on electoral expenses to
remove the ills in the country's electoral system, the Press Trust
of India said.
</P>
<P>
At an all-party meeting convened by Indian Home Minister S.B.
Chavan, leaders of various political groups in parliament also
demanded introduction of a new bill -- Lok Pal bill -- to deal
with complaints of corruption in high places and which will also
cover the office of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called as a follow-up to a recent Election
Commission proposal to raise the ceiling on election expenses of
candidates for parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders favored immediate steps to set in motion
the process of state-funding without which they felt the recent
Election Commission proposal would have no meaning.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Chavan said at the meeting that the cabinet would
discuss both the issues on electoral reforms and Lok Pal bill and
he would get back to the leaders once the government took a
decision on them.

NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young Sam, who arrived here today on a three-day official visit,
said the trip will be a "turning point" in the economic relations
between India and South Korea, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
"India and South Korea have excellent economic cooperation. My
visit here would be a turning point to substantially increase
South Korean investments in India," Kim told reporters immediately
after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremonial welcome here, he was greeted by Indian
President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who is the first ever South Korean head of state to visit
India, is scheduled to hold official talks with Rao Monday to be
followed by the signing of two agreements on protection of
investments and setting up an Indo-South Korean Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second summit meeting of the two leaders since
they had last met in Seoul in September 1993 when Rao was on an
official visit there.
</P>
<P>
Kim is here on the first leg of his three-nation tour which
will also take him to Singapore and Thailand. He will be in
Bangkok to attend the first ever Asia-Europe summit.
</P>
<P>
The two agreements to be signed Monday will help the two
countries to achieve a targeted two way trade of 5 billion US
dollars by the turn of the century. Bilateral trade last year was
little less than two billion dollars with the trade imbalance
being heavily in favor of South Korea.

Century" as Asia stands on the brink of leadership in the new
economic and world reality.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs

<HEADLINE> Adequate Chemical Fertilizer Supplies For Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Local Chinese government
offices are making greater efforts to see that farmers have
adequate amounts of chemical fertilizer and at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of investigations done by eight teams sent
by the State Council, China's cabinet, in 14 provinces and
autonomous regions before the Spring Festival that have taken
several measures.
</P>
<P>
These include increasing chemical fertilizer production,
controlling prices, and simplifying distribution methods.
</P>
<P>
These efforts got the backing of the central government. In
1994, the State Council promulgated a special document on
production and distribution of chemical fertilizers, and
controlling price hikes and quality.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun pointed out recently that chemical
fertilizer supplies are linked to the development of China's
agriculture and the stability of rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He called on plants and government administrators to develop
"firm measures" to guarantee supplies and reasonable prices of
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the chemical fertilizer required for this
year's spring planting has already been produced, and 13 massive
chemical fertilizer production lines and 6.5 billion-yuan special
projects will go into production this year and next.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by departments concerned, one ton of
chemical fertilizer can add two to three tons of grain in China,
which consumes more than 100 million tons of chemical fertilizer
every year. The grain increase takes up 30 percent of its annual
total grain output.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Inaugurates Giant Oil Rig in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today inaugurated a giant oil rig in a bid to
accelerate competition in exploration of strategically important
oil resource in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities claimed that the platform is the first
Iranian-made oil rig to be launched in the land locked Sea with
an oil reserve of 150 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
The drill rig is to function with the capacity of boring 1,000
meters deep down the sea bed, according to a report carried by
Iran's official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The report said that four giant economic and development
projects are to be inaugurated during Rafsanjani's tour of the
northern province of Mazandaran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities described the Caspian Sea as the
"second Persian Gulf" rich in oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian oil expert predicted that the Caspian Sea littoral
states will be able to exploit 12 million barrels of oil per day
and export about half of it until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
There is a gas reserve of 75,000 billion cubic meters in the
sea, the expert added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is trying its best to convince the Caspian Sea littoral
states that there exists no route more economical and secure than
Iran to transfer the Caspian gas and oil.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh has stressed that Iran
offered the best condition of cooperation for transfer of the
region's oil and gas to the international market and this is a
political decision adopted by Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, specialists believe that there is a long way ahead
for Iran to achieve its goal.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacles in this regard are Washington's opposition
to any kind of agreement with the Islamic Republic being a party
and the inability of the Caspian Sea littoral states to carry out
big projects without West's support.

<P>
ZAGREB, February 24 (Xinhua) -- International mediator Carl
Bildt on Friday described as a "tragedy" the massive exodus of
Serbs from areas to be returned to Bosnian government control.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people have already left and I would expect more
to leave, which is a tragedy, a tragedy for the people," said
Bildt, the international community's high representative for
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Bildt made the remarks
while touring Vogosca, the first of the five Serb-controlled
Sarajevo suburbs which will be turned over to the Muslim-led
Bosnian government under the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"The entire aim of the peace process is to start trying to
bring people together," Bildt said. "But what we are seeing here
is that the country is still falling apart."
</P>
<P>
The former Swedish prime minister said that Bosnian Serb
authorities had sown panic in the suburbs whereas the government's
efforts to persuade Serbs to stay came "too little, too late".

<HEADLINE> Iran to Stop Pumping Oil for Export by 2008 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran, the second largest oil
exporter in the world, would run out of its oil resource for
export in 15 more years, a high-ranking official warned here
today.
</P>
<P>
Morteza Alviri, a presidential adviser and the chairman of
Iran's Free Trade Zones, said that his country has to think of an
alternative to oil revenue because it would run out of its oil
for export in the 21 century.
</P>
<P>
Alviri said in the liberal weekly Bahman published today that
by the year 2008 Iran's oil reserves will have been diminished to
the point that it will not be able to export oil.
</P>
<P>
"According to the oil experts, we will reach this point by the
year 2008," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alviri added that reduction of oil resources coupled with
increasing domestic consumption would make the country unable to
export oil.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Iran should think about "liberating" itself
from an oil-dependent economy through increasing its non-oil
goods.
</P>
<P>
Iran now earns over 14 billion U.S. dollars annually by
exporting 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day. The oil revenue
makes up about 70 percent of the total export income of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Iran announced on February 13 that the country's
total oil reserve stands at 140 billion barrels, a whopping 48
billion barrels increase as compared with last years's official
figure.
</P>
<P>
The National Iranian Oil Company said that the total oil
reserve which could now be exploited is 93 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
As for gas reserves, Iran ranked second after Russia with
total gas reserves of 21 trillion cubic meters, said Mehdi
Hosseini, Director of the NIOC's Exploration.
</P>
<P>
Hosseini criticized the rampant energy consumption in the
country, saying that if the Iranians only conserved 20 percent of
the energy each year, Iran could "build two refineries with a
capacity of 150,000 barrels, four petrochemical factories with a
production capacity of 500,000 tons and thousands of schools and
hospitals."
</P>
<P>
Many Iranian officials and energy experts have called on the
nation to conserve energy. Some have even called for increasing
oil prices in a bid to encourage people to adopt energy saving
measures.

<HEADLINE> New Financial Irregularities Found in British Rail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Rail privatization in Britain
was mired in fresh controversy Friday night after two senior
British Rail (BR) directors were suspended amid new allegations of
financial irregularity.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that the disclosure is an
embarrassment to the government, adding to a growing list of
alleged irregularities in parts of the former BR as they await
transfer to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The latest blow followed an internal BR audit that
found that 500,000 pounds (765,000 U.S. dollars) of credit
had been "disguised" in accounts and apparently hidden from anyone
bidding from outside BR for Loadhaul, one of three freight
companies to be handed over to the private sector today.
</P>
<P>
Labour's transport spokesman, Brian Wilson, said that there was
a "dirty" pattern hanging over the whole privatisation process and
called for an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transport insisted Friday night that the case
underlined the effectiveness of BR's auditing.
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed that the irregularities came to light during
pre-sale audits of the business and would not impede the hand-over
of Loadhaul to an American firm which had been made aware of the
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the irregularities are, they didn't affect the sale
process," a Transport Department spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou's Coldest Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Few people hung around for
very long in the parks and shopping centers in the capital city of
south China's Guangdong province for this year's Spring Festival
-- and no wonder, this was the coldest in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the local Central Meteorological Station, the
temperature dropped to 2.4 degrees Celsius at lowest, and
temperature averaged three to five degrees during the week.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival is China's most important holiday. It
started on February 19 this year and lasts a week. Parks are
holding various activities to attract more people and families,
and it is also a good time for local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
In the center of the downtown area of Guangzhou, Donghu Park
spent over two million yuan on a windmill show with various
windmills from around the world, expecting to sell more than
20,000 tickets every day during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
However, cold rainy weather caused most people to stay at home,
and only 300 tickets were sold every day, making it hard for the
sponsors to recoup their investment.
</P>
<P>
Compared with previous holidays, some shops have been very
quiet, leaving salesmen to outnumber the buyers.
</P>
<P>
This was not the coldest winter on record in Guangzhou, but a
record for Spring Festivals, and most businessmen scaled down
their activities, leaving them with a good opportunity to stay
home with their wives and children, eating and drinking.

<HEADLINE> Wiberg Wins Slalom for Second Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg
claimed her second gold in the World Alpine Skiing Championship,
winning Saturday's slalom with a second place for Patricia Chauvet
of France and bronze for Slovenia's Urska Hrovat.
</P>
<P>
Wiberg, who took gold earlier this week in combined, finished
with a combined time for two runs of one minute 31.46 seconds.
Chauvet, only the sixth fastest after the first run, had the
quickest second run to finish in 1:32.32 in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Hrovat, the leader after the first run, finished in 1:32.33.
</P>
<P>
The steep, icy slalom course was probably the most severe test
for women racers this season. In the first run, 28 racers crashed
out leaving only 33 alive for the second run.
</P>
<P>
Among those failing in the first run were Norway's Marianne
Kjoerstad, Sonja Nef and Anita Wachter of Austria, Karin Roten of
Switzerland, Katja Koren of Slovenia and Martina Ertl of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Wiberg, 25, is regarded as the sport's best all-around skier.
She won Olympic gold in 1994 in combined and in 1992 in giant
slalom. She also took gold in giant slalom in the 1991 world
championship but missed the 1993 championship in Japan because of
injury.

<HEADLINE> 1.6 Million S. Leoneans to Vote in Elections Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Over 1.6 million Sierra
Leoneans will vote on Monday to elect a civilian president and 68
members of parliament in the first democratic election in 29
years.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one third of the eligible voters are residing in the
capital, displaced by a civil war running for nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
Elections officials have also gone to nearby Guinea and
Liberia to register Sierra Leonean refugees which number close to
200,000 as a total. This is the first time Sierra Leoneans have
been registered and will vote from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Twelve paramount chiefs were being elected today which will
increase the members of parliament to 80, elections officials
told xinhua.
</P>
<P>
the military government of brigadier general julius maada bio
has declared Monday as a public holiday for voters "to exercise
their franchise without hindrance," but political observers are
predicting a low turnout mainly in the interior where rebels of
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have warned they will
disrupt polling through violence.
</P>
<P>
The RUF opposes holding elections on February 28 and favors
its postponement. It took up arms to fight against the Joseph
Momoh regime in 1991.
</P>
<P>
There are 13 candidates running for president but only four
stand a good chance in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Observers say there is a "possibility" of a second round being
held in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The leading presidential candidates include the former
secretary of state for finance, Dr John Karimu who worked in the
military regime and is running for the National Unity Party
(NUP).
</P>
<P>
Election forecasters say Karimu stands "an extremely good
chance of clinching the presidency."
</P>
<P>
The NUP says "it can end the war in no time" but has not
stated how.
</P>
<P>
The next best party is the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP),
the oldest party in the country and formed the first government
after independence from Britain in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Its leader, Tejan Kabba, a former United Nations
administrator, says the party "can bring economic sanity by
revising outdated models of finance." He did not say what these
"outdated models" were.
</P>
<P>
The All Peoples Congress (APC) which stands very little chance
both for the presidency and parliament was in power when the
military staged a coup in 1992. Its former leader, Joseph Momoh,
fled to Guinea after the takeover and the party is now led by a
lawyer, Eddie Turay.
</P>
<P>
There is only one woman in the presidential list but she is
only a running mate for the National Alliance Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Jeredine Sarho was a former diplomat for Sierra Leone in
France. The chances of her party being elected "remains a remote
possibility," observers said.
</P>
<P>
The election is being held against the background of whether
there should be election before peace or peace before election.
</P>
<P>
Although a delegates conference called to solve the question
voted overwhelmingly for election first, the issue remains "far
from solved."
</P>
<P>
The military government favors peace but it has been under
strong pressure from the major powers of the west and General Bio
has to say, "we have to go by the wishes of the majority."
</P>
<P>
Pursuing this objective, the government on Thursday sent a
middle level delegation led by the Foreign Secretary, Melvin
Chaloba to Cote d'Ivoire to "start preliminary talks with the RUF
to provide the setting for peace talks with it on February 28."
</P>
<P>
The date was set by RUF leader Foday Sankoh in a radio
conversation with General Bio some three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two peasants were killed on Monday by RUF rebels at a
village in a southern district to warn the military government
against holding elections as planned on February 28.
</P>
<P>
Consistent rebel attacks in the past have devastated nearly 40
percent of the rural areas, killing over 20,000 civilians and
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
These raids have also led to the shut down of the two main
companies -- the U.S.-owned Sierra Rutile and the Swiss run
Sierra Leone Ore and Metal Company (sieromco) -- which generate
about 60 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The main factor in the election remains the RUF," a senior
government official told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
But the election is being seen by many civilians as "setting
the stage" to get the army back to barracks and "let the
civilians be in charge once again."

<HEADLINE> New Breakthrough Reported in Irian Jaya Hostage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Free Papua Movement (OPM)
in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, agreed to free the remaining 13 hostages
including six foreigners, on February 25.
</P>
<P>
A reporter of the nationwide evening newspaper "Suara
Pembaruan" today in Wamena, Irian Jaya, quoted authorized sources
as saying that the new breakthrough was reached in an agreement
between the representatives of the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) and OPM on the morning of February 23.
</P>
<P>
ICRC has recently acted as a mediator to seek the unharmful
release of the remaining 13 hostages from OPM. ICRC sent a
four-member team to Irian Jaya for the mission.
</P>
<P>
On February 8, OPM kidnapped 26 people including seven
foreigners who were on a scientific expedition. Later, 13
hostages including one Germany were released. The remaining 13
hostages including six foreigners are still in the hands of OPM.
One hostage, a Dutch woman is five-month pregnant and reportedly
in bad health.
</P>
<P>
OPM kidnappers reportedly informed ICRC representatives that
the health condition of hostages was good. They are willing, in
their traditional way, to hand over all hostages in Gesalama
village on the morning of February 25.
</P>
<P>
Although ICRC managed to get in touch with some OPM kidnappers,
however, they did not see by themselves the hostages, and they
also failed to meet OPM leaders.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, ICRC representatives are making every effort to meet
hostages and have direct contact with OPM leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief for General Affairs of the Indonesian Armed
Forces (ABRI) Lt. Gen. Soeyono was quoted here today by the
national news agency Antara as saying that "ABRI will go ahead
with persuasive approaches" in rescuing hostages held by OPM in
Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an argument by some quarters suggesting
that the ABRI launch a military operation rather maintaining its
persuasive approaches in attempts to rescue the 13 hostages.

<HEADLINE> Space Exploration Risky Business, Li Peng Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua)-- Premier Li Peng said here today
that those who work in the space industry should set strict
demands, constantly sum up their experience and lessons and not
become either overly proud or discouraged since the industry is
working for a cause that is inherently risky.
</P>
<P>
"During the process of shifting from the traditional planned to
the socialist market economy, the space industry should set up a
strict system ensuring quality and safety," the Premier said
during a visit to people from the industry working during the
traditional Spring Festival this morning, to whom he extended his
greetings.
</P>
<P>
Li said that both the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the State Council, China's cabinet, have pinned
their high hopes on the sector and he hopes that they will make
greater contributions to the growth of the overall national
strength and to the development of the country's high technology.
</P>
<P>
The premier also visited the State Electric Power Control and
Telecommunications Center and extended new year's greetings to
people on holiday work shifts.
</P>
<P>
"The power industry involves every Chinese household and is of
vital importance to the national economy," Li said, adding that he
hopes the center will improve its operations to ensure safety and
improved results in national power network production.
</P>
<P>
The premier also visited the General Control Room of the Huabei
Electric Power Group and extended festival greetings to people
working there.

<HEADLINE> UK Industry Investment Cut Sparks Recession Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Further evidence of the fragile
state of the British economy was revealed in statistics published
Friday, showing that manufacturers have cut back on investments and
made little headway in reducing huge stockpiles of goods.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the Central Statistical Office,
manufacturing investment in the fourth quarter of last year fell
by nine percent from the previous quarter, or five percent lower
than in the same period in 1994, although spending for 1995 as a
whole rose by 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, stockbuilding in manufacturing in the last
quarter of 1995 was only slightly reduced, from 769 million
pounds (1,177 million U.S. dollars) in the third quarter to 647
million pounds (990 million U.S. dollars), despite a fall in
output in December.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected drop raised concern among City and industry
observers about the worsening climate in manufacturing. It also
cast a shadow over government hopes of a consumer and investment
-led revival in economic activity this year.

ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Three persons were killed

Taliban launched rocket attack on the capital city of Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
Two Soviet-made BM 21 rockets fell on a busy road near the

routine business, suddenly there was a terrific bang and a huge
cloud of dust covered the whole area," the report quoted an
eyewitness as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the third rocket barrage on Kabul in the last four
days. After enjoying a relative calm month of Ramazan which ended
Tuesday, the city was again in the grip of fresh wave of attacks.

Meanwhile, there was renewed intense fighting on the frontlines
south of Kabul, which has been besieged by Taliban for the last

<HEADLINE> Indian MP Denies Having Accepted Any Fund from PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Suraj Mandal, member of the
Indian parliament, today denied having accepted any fund from
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao for supporting Rao in a
no-confidence motion against Rao's government in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that a conspiracy has been hatched to tarnish my
image," Mandal told the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
Mandal, leader of the Jharkhand Mufti Morcha (Soren), said that
he had an account in a branch bank in Delhi and had been
depositing money there received from various quarters as donations
for running the party.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot disclose from where I have received money," he said
in reply to a question, noting that it was certainly not from
Prime Minister Rao.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court Friday issued a notice asking the Central
Bureau of Investigation why it had not investigate the source of
money deposited by the MP in the bank account.
</P>
<P>
A public petition submitted to the court alleged that Prime
Minister Rao had paid 3 million rupees (about 82,000 US dollars)
to Mandal to bribe him to vote against the no-confidence vote.

ISLAMABAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto said today that Pakistan was ready for bilateral talks with
India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs
(PIIA) in the southern port city of Karachi, she said that
dialogue should be meaningful and thus the basic point on the
agenda of the talks should be the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Benazir stated that a couple of years ago, Pakistan and India
exchanged non-papers but each country rejected other's non-papers.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that during the period, Pakistan played a more
responsible role.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto recalled that in January 1994, the Indian
foreign secretary was invited for talks but no result was
produced.
</P>
<P>
In May 1995, President of Pakistan Farooq Leghari proceeded to
India for the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation) summit.
</P>
<P>
She said the Indians are not yet ready for dialogue with
Pakistan on the Kashmir issue.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Improve Cement Distribution System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
implement a new cement distribution system starting this planting
season to keep cement prices low and protect farmers from
speculative traders.
</P>
<P>
The new mechanism will be stated in a decree issued by the
Minister of Industry and Trade in the near future, Syamsuddin
Abbas, a senior official of the Ministry of Agriculture, disclosed
this recently.
</P>
<P>
The issue of fertilizer distribution emerged after the widely
reported countrywide shortages of fertilizer, which continued from
December last year until January this year.
</P>
<P>
The government said the shortage were caused by an early
planting season this year and the inability of fertilizer
producers to meet the sudden increase in demand.
</P>
<P>
However, several analysts suspected that the shortages were due
to speculations by traders who bought large amounts of supplies
from the storehouses of cement factories and held back the stocks
to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
Two state-owned cement factories, Pt Pupuk Sriwijaya and Pt
Petrokimia Gresik, are major fertilizer manufacturers which have
been appointed by the government to handle the distribution of
fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia produces 7 million tons of fertilizer a year and
consumption reaches over 5 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Killing of Iraqi General Kamel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti condemned here today the
killing of General Hussein Kamel and described it as "a
premeditated crime."
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel and his bother Saddam Kamel, both sons-in-law of
Iraqi President Saddam, who defected to Jordan last August and
returned to Baghdad Tuesday, were reportedly killed together with
their father by his clan members Friday in Baghdad shortly after
their wives, two daughters of the president, divorced them.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, the prime minister said that King
Hussein did not want General Kamel and his family to go back, but
they left Jordan and returned to Baghdad by their own volition.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti pointed out that Jordan's accusation of the criminal
act does not aim at defending Kamel and his demeanor but at
upholding human rights and dignity, the value and principle in
which Jordan always takes pride.
</P>
<P>
He said Kamel and his family were accorded hospitality,
security and great care during their six-month stay here in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on return of Kamel to Iraq, Royal Court Chief Awn
Khasawneh said that Jordan had not interfered directly or
indirectly in influencing Kamel's decision to return home, nor
had it facilitated his return, according to the daily Jordan
Times today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fawzi Tueimeh, chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee at the Lower House of Parliament, said that Kamel had
left Jordan by his own will, as he did when he came to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Tueimeh stressed that Jordan had no interest in giving any
bigger role to Kamel or any one else seeking political asylum in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Al Kallab, a columnist at a local newspaper, said the
return of Kamel and his family has relieved Jordan of a heavy
security and political burden which it shouldered for almost six
months.
</P>
<P>
With the departure of Kamel, Jordan has now more room to open
dialogue with Iraqi opposition and to maintain its relations with
the Iraqi regime, said the columnist, quoted by the daily.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President to Visit US in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides will visit Washington in June to meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Clerides himself in an interview with the
private television station Antenna Friday night to mark his three
years in office.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any news about his meeting with President
Clinton, the President said "my visit to Washington will take
place around June this year."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the U.S. has shown increased interest in the
Cyprus problem, in addition to British, Italian, French, German
and Russian interest to push the Cyprus peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. interest in Cyprus indicates America's wish to
find a solution, which the U.S. believes would have a positive
effect on Greco-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that American, British and Italian officials have
recently visited the island for talks on the Cyprus question, the
President revealed that Russian and German officials are due to
arrive on the island as well as European Union Commissioner for
External Affairs Hans Van Den Broek.
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify the most significant achievements during his
three years in power, the President cited a defense agreement
with Greece, providing Cyprus with sea, air and land cover from
the Greek military in case of Turkish offensive against Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Paving the way for European Union membership and getting the
Cyprus question out of isolation are another two important
moves," Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
The President also disclosed his intention to stand for the
presidency for another five-year term if the state of his health
allows it, adding "If the people want me and if my services are
needed."

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Should Develop in Peace: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 24 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe urged
all countries in southern Africa to exploit peace and stability
now prevailing in the region to the full in order to enhance
development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing diplomats accredited to Zimbabwe at a reception in
Harare on Rriday, he said SADC member states were committed to
the adoption of a common approach to developmental strategies.
</P>
<P>
"In Southern Africa, we are glad and happy that peace is now
prevailing in the whole region. It is our sincere hope that 1996
will bring peace to our brothers and sisters in Angola who have
been subjected to civil war since their independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the U. N., the president said Zimbabwe and other developing
countries stood firm in calling for the reform of the organs of
the U.N., with particular focus on the security council, in order
for the world body to be democratized and reflect present
realties.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the domestic affairs, Mugabe said the first phase
of the economic reform program which ended in 1995 had registered
significant successes because of support from foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is committed to the second phase of the program and
determined to have it fully implemented, he said. "Our major
focus is now on rationalizing and commercializing our
parastatals, speeding up the indigenization program and with it,
carrying out significant land reforms in a manner that increases
substantially the land held by communal and small-scale farmers
versus that in the commercial sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe stressed, "democracy has been the cornerstone of the
peace and political stability Zimbabwe has enjoyed since the
attainment of independence in 1980. Indeed, this shall continue
to be the case in future."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian ADR Center to Settle Disputes for Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The newly-established
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Center in Indonesia will help
companies, both local and foreign to settle their civil disputes.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today at a seminar by Nyoman Moena,
chairman of the Indonesian ADR Center. The ADR Center,
established by a number of business people last December, will
soon open its services later this month, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that companies with civil disputes will not have to go
to court or arbitration agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to Moena, ADR has become a worldwide trend now.
Large multinational companies prefer using ADR centers to courts
or arbitration agencies, because once a large company brings a
civil case to court, it puts its image at stake as people usually
take a closer look at the negative aspects of the company.
</P>
<P>
He added that settling business disputes through ADR centers is
less costly than litigation.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the Indonesian ADR center, Moena
said, it is expected that business contracts between companies in
Indonesia will include a clause stating that they will use the
center to settle any dispute as a first alternative before going
to arbitration agencies or courts.

<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) has granted 980,000 US dollars to Zambia to strengthen the
capacity of the planning departments of social sector ministries
and institutions in the African country.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed here on Friday by
Zambian permanent secretary at the national commission for
development planning Jotamy Madubanse and UNDP representative in
Lusaka Gary Davies.
</P>
<P>
Madubanse told the signing ceremony that Zambia appreciated
the help from donors and would continue its program to improve
the lives of the vulnerable in the society.
</P>
<P>
The social sector infrastructure and services had deteriorated
over the years, which had adversely affected the welfare of the
Zambians, especially the poor who were usually the victims of the
situation, he observed.
</P>
<P>
The ministries which would benefit from the grant include
health, education, community development, local government and
housing.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The central government has
decided to spend 117 million US dollars this fiscal year 1995/96
on services and salaries for district staff under the system of
decentralization.
</P>
<P>
The local daily "the New Vision" today quoted Francis Lubanga,
director of the decentralization secretariat as saying 22.4
million dollars are being spent on decentralized services
(non-wage), 17.9 million dollars for delegated services, and 2.1
million dollars for urban councils.
</P>
<P>
He said salaries and wages for all district staff will be 75.3
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization system, a major administrative reform
measure was launched in October 1992, aimed at making
administration more effective and speeding up mass participation
in policy-making and national development.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, most of the administrative powers are
concentrated at the district levels, with the central government
in charge of only policy-making, supervision and training.
</P>
<P>
The central government retains responsibility for national
planning, defense, foreign affairs, immigration, security and
national projects.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from local newspapers, the system has
yielded results in promoting development in economy, particularly
in the financial and resources distribution, planning and
personnel management. Thus it has since in October 1992 got
financial support from the foreign donors.

<HEADLINE> Hill Banned From National Team Until 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Squash firebrand Anthony Hill
has been banned from representing Australia until 2001 following
his ill-tempered display at last November's world team
championship in Cairo, Squash Australia announced in Brisbane on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This, as far as we can ascertain, is the first time it has
been necessary for us to ban a member from one of our national
teams," said Squash Australia executive director Phil Trenorden.
</P>
<P>
Hill, 26, had already been banned for two years by the World
Squash Federation (WSF) and for three months by the Professional
Squash Association (PSA).
</P>
<P>
The PSA also fined him 2,100 U.S. dollars over the incident in
Cairo during a semi-final rubber against Pakistan's Mir Zaman Gul.
</P>
<P>
The WSF had charged Hill with "physically and verbally abusing
his opponent, verbally abusing the referee, showing dissent,
throwing his racket and generally bringing the game into
disrepute."
</P>
<P>
Gul, awarded a series of penalty strokes when Hill barged into
him, won the match to clinch a 2-1 victory for Pakistan over the
top-seeded Australians.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who has indicated he would appeal against the sanction,
has 28 days to lodge notification with Squash Australia.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Thailand Lays Solid Track to ASEM (by Xiong ping, Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- As the Asia-Europe meeting
(ASEM) is approaching, Thailand's preparation work is in full
swing to secure that the event, the first ever in history, will be
moving on a smooth path toward success.
</P>
<P>
At the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center, the venue of
the meeting, staff workers are bustling about to decorate the
meeting hall. At the Bangkok International Airport and deluxe
hotels around the city, police and immigration officers are
tightening security to block any terrorist and pretest activities.
</P>
<P>
Also, at the Foreign Ministry, a huge fleet of 165
Mercedes-Benz cars are ready to serve the VIPs (very important
persons) attending the meeting on March 1-2.
</P>
<P>
These are just a few scenes in Bangkok which is waiting to
greet arrivals of leaders and senior officials of China, South
Korea, Japan and the seven ASEAN nations as well as 15 European
nations.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has done a great deal of preparation since Singaporean
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong initiated such a gathering in October
1994.
</P>
<P>
As a coordinator representing the ten Asian nations, Thailand
had played an active role in downplaying discussions on such
sensitive and controversial issues as human rights, child labor
and environment standards.
</P>
<P>
Thailand believes that the key to the success of the ASEM is to
seek common points to bring the two continents together to discuss
their future cooperation in view of great differences in economic
and social development levels between them.
</P>
<P>
Over the past month, Thailand has successfully hosted the Asian
Foreign Ministers' meeting and Asian Economic Ministers' meeting
as well as a number of senior officials' and experts' meetings,
which highlighted Thailand's coordinative role.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa will hold
separate informal talks with foreign leaders on February 29, one
day before the ASEM, to seek further consensus on those sensitive
issues.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government attached great importance for the ASEM. To
focus on preparations for the meeting, Banharn rescheduled his
state visits overseas and postponed his decisions on the cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The ruling coalition and some opposition parties in the country
have called for a truce during the ASEM.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will for the first time host such a large
international meeting. To strengthen security for the
participants, the government will deploy over 5,000 policemen at
the meeting place and hotels where foreign leaders stay and along
key traffic routes, twice as many as those deployed during the
fifth ASEAN summit.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government will impose tough restrictions on protest
activities during the ASEM. Thai police and immigration officers
are closely following and monitoring international terrorists,
especially those members from a Japanese cult called "Aum Supreme
Truth". An anti-terrorism rehearsal involving some 5,000
policemen was launched on February 18.
</P>
<P>
Foreign leaders are expected to stay in Bangkok from February
29 to March 3. To ease the traffic flow in the capital, the Thai
government has announced a four-day holiday during the period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Thailand has recruited a record number of
interpreters for the ASEM as speeches at the meeting will be
simultaneously translated into 17 languages, even more than those
languages used at a European Commission conference and the United
Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Confident that the country has the ability to host the meeting,
Banharn said the success of the meeting will help enhance
Thailand's prestige in the world.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Defectors Killed in Gun Fight with Family Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's sons-in-law Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother Saddam
Kamel who returned to Baghdad from exile in Jordan Tuesday were
shot dead in a gun fight with a group of their cousins Friday
night, a statement from Iraq's Interior Ministry said Friday
midnight.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Hussein Kamel and his brother clashed
with their cousins who stormed their house in a Baghdad
suburb. Hussein Kamel, Saddam Kamel as well as their younger
brother Hakeem Kamel and their father Kamel Hassan were killed
in the raged gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The state-run TV said late Friday night that two of the
attackers were also killed and three others were wounded in the
shoot-out and two passers-by and one child were also killed.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspapers carried today a message sent by attackers to
President Saddam Hussein saying that they killed the two
defectors because they betrayed the homeland and their
family. "They have become a branch of disgrace in the tree of our
family, and thus we felt that this branch of disgrace should be cut
from the tree of our family," they said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, who are from the same family of President Saddam
and the two defectors, requested the President for pardon
because their act came in defense of their honor and the
security of the country.
</P>
<P>
General Ali Hassan al-Majeed, the uncle of the two defectors,
had cabled President Hussein last august on behalf of the family,
saying that Hussein Kamel and his brother Saddam Kamel should
shed their blood for their treason.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel and his brother fled to Jordan last August with
their families and vowed to overthrow President Saddam. On
thursday they divorced their wives, two daughters of President
Saddam, because of their betrayal to their country.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Korean Trade Up in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade between South Korea and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) exceeded 300
million U.S. dollars last year for the first time since bilateral
trade started in 1988, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The National Unification Board (NUB) said inter-Korean trade
last year amounted to 310 million dollars on an approval basis and
287 million dollars on a customs-clearance basis, up 35 percent
and 48 percent respectively over 1994, according to the NUB.
</P>
<P>
With the 150,000 tons of rice that South Korea donated to the
DPRK last year added, the trade volume would increase to 540
million dollars in value, the NUB said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, processing-on-commission trade, namely the shipment
of South Korean raw materials to the DPRK for processing, rose 60
percent last year over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of trade items skyrocketed from 63 in 1994 to 206 in
1995 and the number of South Korean firms doing business with the
DPRK also shot up from 53 to 213 during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, South Korea's purchases from the DPRK
totaled 120 million dollars on an approval basis, up 26 percent
from 1995, but sales plunged 55 percent to 4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since the South Korean government took steps for economic
opening toward the DPRK in 1988, the total inter-Korean trade had
reached 1.12 billion dollars by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Price Hike Under Control During Vietnam's Tet Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
claimed success in curbing the traditional hike in consumer prices
in the days leading up to "Tet", the lunar new year holiday.
</P>
<P>
While official figures have yet to be released, the state-run
Vietnam News Agency reported today that February's price index is
expected to be only 1.5-2 percent higher than that of the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
The figure for the previous year was 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the successful control on inflation to
government measures to increase supply and prevent hoarding and
exorbitant pricing.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese celebrated the latest Tet holiday on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israeli Positions in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah (Party of God) announced that they
launched this morning a series of attacks on Israeli positions in
south Lebanon, killing and wounding several Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
that one group of its fighters launched an attack at 6:05
a.m. (0405 GMT) on an Israeli position between the southern
Lebanese towns of Tomat and Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and medium machine-guns and anti-tank rockets were used
by the guerrillas in the fighting, and the enemy suffered a heavy
material and human loss, the militant group said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Shiite fundamentalist organization
added, its guerrillas fired artilleries at the Israeli position
at Kafrhouna in Jezzine area.
</P>
<P>
Another group of the Moslem guerrillas carried out an attack
at 6:35 a.m. on an Israeli patrol at the entrance of the Israeli
post at Dabsheh.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, the guerrillas opened a dense fire with
machine-guns and caused a heavy casualty among the Israeli
patrol, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas also launched attacks on the Israeli
positions at Dabsheh, Sejoud and Bir Kalab this morning, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Israeli occupation forces this morning
bombarded a number of southern Lebanese villages in Nabatiyeh area
and Western Bekaa, causing no casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces combed Jisr Lousi, Bourkhoz and Kaukab with
heavy and medium machine-guns, and the operation lasted half an
hour, security sources reported, without mentioning the
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters and helicopters carried out reconnaissance
 flights at low altitude over the areas of Nabatiyeh and
Marjauyoun for more than ten minutes, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia confirmed the
guerrilla attacks, saying that its positions at Ali Taher,
Kafrhouna, Tomat Niha and Jezzine were shelled by Hezbollah
guerrillas, saying that no casualties were caused among the
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah spearheads a guerrilla war against the Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon, trading daily fires with the Israeli
forces and their surrogate militia and making south Lebanon the
last active battlefield of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

LONDON, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- John Major dismissed speculation of an autumn general
election on Friday as his dwindling Westminster majority raised
the prospect of defeat for the Government in Monday's Commons vote
on the Scott report.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- A conflicting picture of events leading up to the grounding
of the supertanker Sea Empress has been given to the government
inspectors who are investigating the disaster, it emerged on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- UK manufacturers slashed investment at the end of last year,
suggesting some businesses have fresh doubts about the economic
outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- John Major battened down the hatches Friday night in the
wake of the third defection from Conservative ranks in five
months, insisting that his government will weather Monday's
Commons vote on the Scott report and survive into next year
without a crisis election.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Predicts Higher Inflation Rate in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA) has predicted that the
combined effects of the new tax and oil price hike will trigger
higher inflation rate this year, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
According to NEDA's Socio-Economic Planning Secretary Cielito
Habito, the government's 1996 inflation target of six to seven
percent is likely to be revised to 9.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the figure is based on preliminary analysis by
economic officials on the possible impact of the expanded value
added tax and the oil price increase.
</P>
<P>
But he assured that the inflation would remain at the single
digit level as the agriculture sector would be a good performer
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' inflation rate was 8.1 percent in 1995, much
higher than the targeted 6.5 to 7.5 percent. Failure to achieve
the target was mainly attributed to the rice shortage in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cancels First Vice-President's Trip to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced in the last
minute today that it has canceled an official visit by its First
Vice-President Hassan Habibi to Syria as a gesture to cool down
the Tehran-Damascus relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Iran's Presidential Office in a
telephone call with Xinhua, but the official gave no reasons for
putting off Habibi's trip which was scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Iran cancelled Habibi's visit to
Syria. On December 30, Iran called off a scheduled visit by
Hassan Habibi to Syria.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, diplomats here said that Syrian Prime
Minister Mahmoud Zouebi had also cancelled his two-day visit to
Tehran, which was supposed to start on February 20.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the cancellation of high-ranking
official visits by the two sides indicates that the relations
between the two former strategic allies are growing cold and
remain strained. This is because of the peace talks between the
Syrians and Israelis and the declaration issued in Damascus on
December 28 by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which accused
Iran of occupying the Abu Musa and Tunb islands.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Syrians had promised the Iranians that
they would abstain at the GCC voting on the islands, but again
their commitment toward the Arab community overwhelmed their
friendly sentiments toward the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has been getting seriously embarrassed
as Syrians were sitting, eating and living together with Israelis
in a Maryland villa in the United States.
</P>
<P>
If Syria is to sign a peace deal with Israel, Iran will be
much more isolated than it was before, like Iraq, Sudan and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts noted that the Iranian authorities are
getting tougher in their stance toward the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
claimed publicly that Iran was opposed to the Middle East peace
process, saying, "It is a great danger to the cause of
Palestine."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani noted that the peace process is injustice and it
will lead to future war between Palestine and Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei said that the
Israelis covet the Middle East's water resources and are busy
laying the foundation of economic, political and social domination
of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States is "helping Israel achieve its
regional objective of stripping the Arabs of their wealth, and to
this end uses pressure tactics such as the use of the human rights
issue to coerce the regional countries into submitting to Israel's
will."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the statements by Khamenei and Rafsanjani
could be interpreted as Iran's opposition to a joint U.S.-Israeli
move to alter the profile of the Middle East and weaken the
Moslem world.

JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority

between the West Bank and Jordan to protest Israel's misconduct,
reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
A PA official said the border crossing will be closed as from

In reaction to the announcement, The Israel Airport Authority

Bridge Crossing is solely under Israel's responsibility.

The IAA claimed that the passage over the bridge will continue
no matter whether or not Palestinian workers will show up.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources disclosed that two PA members, Jamil

difficulties for Palestinians at the Allenby bridge crossing.
</P>
<P>
Shahor said he would look into the complaint.

<P>
In accordance with the Oslo Accords between Israel and the
PLO, the Allenby Crossing is jointly administered by the two
sides, but security responsibility rests with Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Two cholera cases have been
reported to a designated cholera center in Lusaka, "Zambia Daily
Mail" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Permanent secretary at the Ministry of Health Kawaye Kamanga
was quoted as saying that preventive measures to curb further
spread have been put in place.
</P>
<P>
The two victims aged four and eight years are from one family
in the capital's Chaisa compound. The health workers are
investigating the source and circumstances under which they
contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
In parliament, Health Minister Michael Sata said the
government was sending a medical team to Kabwe to prevent cholera
spreading to Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Cholera which first broke out in northern Zambia last month
spread to Kabwe, about 150 kilometers north of the capital, a
fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
Cholera cases have also been reported in some areas in

<P>
NEW DELHI, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
reported to convene an all-party meeting today to discuss
electoral reform that has become a vital issue as the hawala
scandal is shaking the country's political spectrum, according to
the Hindustan Times.
</P>
<P>
The hawala scandal refers to a three-year-old,
18-million-dollar bribery case involving a large number of Indian
politicians.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is likely to be attended by leaders of various
parliamentary groups, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to discuss the setting up of a
new watchdog body, the Lok Pal, which may bring within its purview

<P>
They call for the establishment of an independent body of
eminent people, like judges of the Supreme Court, to appoint
members of the Lok Pal, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM Hints at Resignation After ASEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Foreign Minister
Kasem S. Kasemsri has strongly hinted that he may resign soon,
probably after the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
His unexpected statement came amid increasing criticism by
fellow Nam Thai (Thai Leadership) Party MPs, some of whom have
long lamented his appointment to a ministerial post after he
failed to win a House seat during last year's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Kasem, a veteran diplomat, was hand-picked by Nam Thai leader
and Deputy Prime Minister Amnuary Virawan as foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
His opponents have become more vocal with the approach of the
Asia-Europe Meeting, set for March 1-2, claiming that he has not
achieved much at his post as foreign minister in dealing conflicts
with neighboring countries, such as Malaysia and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Kasem was quoted today by The Nation as saying that he had long
ago given Amnuay Virawan "an undated letter of resignation," which
he said he could fill in the date any time Amnuay wants to.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'm prepared to resign at any time."
</P>
<P>
He hinted that after the biggest international event of the
year in Bangkok, the Asia-Europe Meeting, he would make a decision
to move shortly afterwards.

JERUSALEM, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Defense
Minister Orri Or has declared that Israel will not agree to a
prisoner exchange deal with Hezbollah (Party of God) unless the
whereabouts of missing airman Ron Arad are determined, reported
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Or made the statement in an interview with Israel Television
Friday night following an offer by Hezbollah to exchange bodies of
two Israeli missing soldiers for Hezbollah members held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Naswala.
</P>
<P>
Ron Arad was missing in a military operation in Lebanon more
than a decade ago when his plane was brought down.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities believe that Ron Arad is still alive,
either being held somewhere in Lebanon by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, an Islamic fundamentalist organization, or being
imprisoned in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government and Ron Arad's family have made all
efforts in order to determine his whereabouts, including appeals
to the international community and various world leaders for
help.

In addition, officials of the regional government and its 13
prefectures have signed an agreement recently, which will ensure

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Currency Rand In Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's currency
Rand has dipped sharply against the U.S. dollar since last
Thursday at Johannesburg Stock Exchange, with traders warning
that South Africa could be on the road to a Mexico-style
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The great sell-off on the financial markets entered its fifth
consecutive trading day on Wednesday, with sickly Rand dropped to
a record low of 4.0250 to the dollar as speculators continued to
bail out of South African financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"Everything is in total disarray. The market is completely
dependent on Rand's every move," said one trader, adding "market
nerves are shot."
</P>
<P>
South African Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Chris de Swardt
said on Wednesday the central bank had been active again in the
market "with the purpose of ensuring changes as orderly as
possible, not with the intention of guarding an exchange level."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reserve Bank's General Manager of gold and foreign
exchange reserves Bertus van Zyl said Wednesday the Bank had been
active in the local market again "to support its functioning" and
had lost dollars in the process.
</P>
<P>
The Rand began falling last Thursday owing to a widespread
rumor about President Nelson Mandela's ill-health and the talk of
an imminent lifting of foreign exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
The rand went down five percent on Monday against the dollar
after a slide triggered by a rumor that Mandela, 77, had suffered
a mild heart attack on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to delegates at an investment conference on Tuesday,
Mandela said: "The lifting of the exchange control regulations is
now only a matter of time and detail."
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg and Reserve Bank
Governor Chris Stals moved on Tuesday to soothe the nerves of the
financial market, insisting the government would hold to its
policy of gradually easing exchange controls and would not
attempt to peg the Rand.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg said South Africa would not fight the foreign
exchange market to defend the Rand or target its exchange rate,
while Stals said the bank had no intention of fixing the exchange
rate at any predetermined level.
</P>
<P>
Stals and Liebenberg both confirmed that the monetary
authorities would be committed to a gradual abolishment of
exchange controls, saying it was impossible to decide on what the
equilibrium exchange rate for the Rand should be.

<HEADLINE> South Korean President Leaves For Asia Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 24 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam left here today for India on a 10-day Asia trip which
will also take him to Singapore and the first Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) in Thailand on March 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony at the Seoul Airport before his
departure, Kim said that the ASEM is expected to provide momentum
for expanding the cooperative relationship between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that he will put forth his best effort to reinforce
relations with non-aligned countries and economic diplomacy to
open the Asia-Pacific era.
</P>
<P>
"Asia is making a great contribution to our growth as the
fastest growing export market and the largest construction
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim, the first South Korean president to visit India, will hold
talks with Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders will discuss ways of increasing economic
cooperation between the two countries and enhancing collaboration
in such international fora as the United Nations, a government
official here said.
</P>
<P>
Kim is accompanied by 39 leading businessmen on his four-day
visit, a sign of his determination to seek closer trade and
business ties with India.
</P>
<P>
During his state visit to Singapore on February 27-29, Kim will
meet Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and discuss bilateral
cooperation in trade and in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum and the forthcoming ASEM session, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Kim is the first South Korean president to visit Singapore in
15 years although he previously held two rounds of summit meetings
with Goh.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM conference starts on February 29 in Bangkok, bringing
together leaders from China, Japan, seven members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 15 members of the
European Union (EU) as well as the EU executive president.
</P>
<P>
Kim is also scheduled to meet with Chinese Premier Li Peng and
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton for sideline talks on economic
and trade issues, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean president had planned to hold his first summit
meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Bangkok
before returning home on March 4, but officials here yesterday
virtually ruled out the possibility of an exclusive meeting
between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Seoul and Tokyo have slipped to a record low
in years because of Japan's fresh claims to Tokto (Takeshima)
Island in the East Sea (Sea of Japan).
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a summit meeting between the two leaders at this
time would do any good to either side," a senior presidential aide
said.
</P>
<P>
Kim's official entourage includes Foreign Minister Gong
Ro-myung, International Trade and Industry Minister Park Jae-yoon,
Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Koo Bohn-young,
Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign Affairs and National
Security Yoo Chong-ha and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Kim
Dong-jin.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Gov't Clears Allegations Against Former PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
cleared the allegations that former prime minister Girija Prasad
Koirala was involved in a business scandal of the country's flag
carrier, which caused a loss of ten million rupees.
</P>
<P>
The Abuse of Authority Investigation Commission, a governmental
agency, announced Friday that corruption allegations against
Koirala in an appointment of a sales agent in Europe for the
state-run Royal Nepalese Airlines Corporation (RNAC) were
baseless.
</P>
<P>
The commission concluded that Koirala had done nothing wrong as
a prime minister in 1993 by directing RNAC to speed up the
implementation of its deal with a London-based company.
</P>
<P>
The deal had caused a loss of more than ten million rupees
(about 200,000 US dollars) for the national airlines.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the previous Communist (UML) government
disclosed that Koirala was found guilty of abuse of his authority
in accordance with a RNAC report on the case.
</P>
<P>
Later the minority UML government was replaced by the present
coalition government led by the Nepali Congress (NC) Party after
it lost a no-confidence vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Koirala, a senior NC leader, led a majority NC government in
1991 before stepping down due to internal struggle in his own
party in November 1994.

relations, Senator Sam Nunn said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to develop "a purposeful, coherent
and consistent" policy toward China as well as a strategy for
implementing that policy.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the U.S. government, the executive branch as
well as Congress, currently have not developed such a policy
towards the most populous and the most rapidly developing country
on earth," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for a dialogue at all levels, including leaders of
the two countries, to find common ground and to develop an
understanding of each other's views, adding that the U.S. policy
should be based on a framework of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Challenging the argument by some Congress members in favor
of sanctions against China, he added that "our friends in Europe
and Japan would be most delighted to fill any Chinese need which
might develop if we employ economic sanctions."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Gov't Warning Against Opposition Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
sounded a stern warning against the 3-day non-cooperation movement
launched this morning by the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
According to a Home Ministry press note published here today,
the government has taken adequate security measures for smooth
movement of all types of vehicles during the period.
</P>
<P>
Stringent legal action will be taken against persons engaged in
unlawful and terrorist activities, the press note warned, adding
that some political parties were indulging in illegal activities
even terrorist acts in the name of political program.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties this morning began their
3-day non-cooperation movement to press home their demand for
cancellation of what they called "one party farcical" national
elections on February 15 and resignation of the present government
to pave the way for a neutral caretaker government to oversee
fresh general elections.
</P>
<P>
All government officials and employees were requested not to go
to office during the movement.
</P>
<P>
In the name of these political programs, they intimidate people
through bomb-blasts and arson and by damaging vehicles and
ransacking business enterprises and try to cause loss of life and
property and disrupt the normal life of the people, the press note
said.
</P>
<P>
Owners of vehicles would be given due compensation if they
suffered any damage while plying their vehicles in the interest of
maintaining normal life, the government promised.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
officials also warned that opposition activists trying to damage
vehicles and other property and obstructing normal life would be
handled with a heavy hand.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the law enforcing agencies have been instructed to
resist opposition activists," a BNP Standing Committee member
said, adding that stern legal action would be taken against all
sorts of disruptive activities.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the government decision to take tougher
measures has been taken in line with the prime minister's
pre-election warning against unlawful activities in the name of
agitation.

WARSAW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Results of the investigations

Kwasniewski.

<HEADLINE> Gene Treatment of Cancer Has Long Way to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Though gene treatment of cancer
offers cancer patients a new hope, the fact that none of them has
recovered through gene treatment indicates that there remains a
long way to go to cure the deadly illness.
</P>
<P>
Researchers attending the 22nd German Cancer Conference, held
in Berlin, said none of the 2,000 cancer patients who accepted
gene treatments has recovered from the disease, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Attendants from around the world submitted to the conference
158 reports on gene treatment, 80 percent of which said doctors
tried to stimulate patients' immune systems in an effort to
counter the cancer cells in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
But experts said a true gene treatment means changing the
hereditary information of the abnormal cells.
</P>
<P>
Many difficulties are hindering doctors' efforts to combat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Doctors haven't found a way to acquire enough gene, as well as
a reliable carrier for the gene to reach the focus.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cells whose gene has been changed artificially can't
survive long enough, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the attendants said that among all
cancer cases, 5 percent are hereditary.
</P>
<P>
About 50 kinds of cancers have been identified to be related to
inheritance, including thyroid cancer, eye cancer and skin cancer,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Doctors still differed on whether to carry out an advanced
genetic analysis to help diagnose people's possibility of
contracting cancer.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today held
a meeting in Santo Monica, California, to discuss overall
relations between two countries, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a good opportunity for us to get better
acquainted," Clinton told reporters at the opening of meetings
with Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
"We have a broad and deep friendship with Japan," Clinton said,
"our relationship should be one of respect and friendship, even
when we have different opinions and different interests."
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged that there have been problems between the
two countries, saying "We have taken these issues seriously, far
more seriously than previous American administrations.
</P>
<P>
"We can be firm with each other, strong with each other, we can
even disagree with each other," Clinton said. However, he said it
was important to have a strong partnership with Japan in security
and economic matters.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry said on Thursday
that the meeting between Clinton and Hashimoto would be one of the
first meetings that is not defined simply by the trade issue.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Japanese trade disputes have lost urgency and will not be
at the center of Friday talks, McCurry added.
</P>
<P>
The presure on trade issues has been reduced primarily because
of lower U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the two leaders would be setting the agenda,
making the necessary preparations for Clinton's visit to Japan in
April.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. forces have inspected
about 68,000 merchant ships since 1993 in implementation of the
U.N. embargo against the former Yugoslavia, said a general of NATO
troops today.
</P>
<P>
Frank Ropers, commander of NATO's navy stationed in the
Mediterranean, said in Barcelona that they have checked more than
54,000 merchant ships since July 1993, when NATO and the
U.N. decided to impose an embargo on former Yugoslav regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement and a pledge made at last
week's Balkan summit in Rome, the U.N. Security Council was to
lift U.N. sanctions against Bosnia when Bosnian Serbs complied
with the accord.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on Friday
suspending economic sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
But the United States said it has not yet made a decision on
whether to support lifting the sanctions, insisting on more
evidence that Bosnian Serb leaders were ready to cooperate with
NATO peace efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Public life in the Nepali
capital of Kathmandu seems unscathed by a nationwide transport
strike since Friday though other parts of the country are not so
lucky.
</P>
<P>
Buses on Kathmandu streets were obviously less frequent than
usual Friday but mini-buses, taxis and three-wheeled tempos
remained on the road.
</P>
<P>
However, other parts of this Himalayan kingdom suffered from
the indefinite strike launched by the Federation of Nepal
Transport Entrepreneurs (FNTE).
</P>
<P>
Reports from other cities said that public life was somewhat
affected as large numbers of buses remained off the road
throughout Friday.
</P>
<P>
The FNTE called the strike after the government rejected its
demand to increase public transport fares by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier urged the organization to call off its
strike plan and resume the talks for solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
Other transport organizations in the country boycotted the FNTE
strike Friday, which might explain the almost undisturbed life in
the capital city.

The sources said the talks "have been proceeding in a positive

BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to shoot a film on
the "Opium Wars" (1840-1842), according to today's "Guangming
Daily".
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin, a noted film director, disclosed that with an
investment of 100 million yuan (12.1 million US dollars), the film
is to be shot in April after one-year preparations.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that his plan was backed by his film company in
Shanghai and China Hengdian Group Corporation in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
According to his plan, the film will be shot at Humen on the
coast of Guangzhou where the Chinese army, commanded by Lin Zexu,
resisted the foreign invaders together with the people of
Guangzhou in the "Opium Wars".
</P>
<P>
From 1840 to 1842, British aggressors launched wars against
China when the Government of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) tried to ban
foreign opium trade in China. The wars resulted in the cession of
Hong Kong and indemnities to Britain.

<P>
China is rich in oil resources, but in terms of per capita

Wang explained.

The president revealed that in the coming five years, the
company will seek multinational cooperation mainly in the Middle
East, Russia, Central Asia, and some other regions.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the cooperation will be carried out in "an
active but discreet way."
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to attract a foreign investment of two

<HEADLINE> Italy, Paraguay to Better EU-Mercosur Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli and visiting Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria
Ramirez Boettner today held talks on strengthening ties between
the European Union (EU) and the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
A communique, released by the Italian Foreign Ministry, said
Agnelli believed that a regional cooperative framework agreement,
signed in December in Madrid during the EU summit meeting, marked
a qualitative improvement of bilateral relations between the two
regions and had a great significance.
</P>
<P>
The EU has become the biggest trading partner and a major
investor of the South American Common Market (Mercosur), which
groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and has a
population of 200 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, trade volume between Europe and the Mercosur amounted
to 34.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli and her Paraguayan counterpart also agreed to
strengthen their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency in the
first half of 1996, said she will help organize a delegation of
Italian entrepreneurs to visit Paraguay in a bid to facilitate
Italian investment in the South American country.

avenged his Australian Open defeat at the hands of Italian Renzo
Furlan in the quarter-finals of the European Community tennis
championship in Antwerp, Belgium, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, seeded fourth and ranked 10th in the world, fought
back with one set down to beat the Italian 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, setting
up a semi-final clash against Australian Open champion Boris
Becker of Germany.
</P>
<P>
The world fourth ranked Becker, who missed Germany's Davis Cup
match against Switzerland and last week's Dubai Open because of
inflamed leg ligaments and a back problem, breezed past Spain's
Francisco Clavet 6-3, 6-3 in another quarter-final match earlier.
</P>
<P>
The hard-hitting Croat met tough challenge from the 26th ranked
Furlan, who took the first set and pulled back from a 5-2 deficit
in the second to force it into a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
But the big server Ivanisevic, who hit 25 aces, struggled to
break Furlan's resistance after winning the tie-break 7-4.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic has run his winning streak to 13 matches following
the victories in Zagreb and Dubai.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Troops Kill 14 Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
troops have killed 14 members of the Muslim extremist group Abu
Sayyaf and wounded 11 since they started to storm the rebels' camp
last Tuesday in Sulu, southern Mindanao, said a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that at least one high-level commander of Abu
Sayyaf was among those killed, adding that two government soldiers
were also injured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that the government troops, while pursuing
the rebels, massacred 30 civilians praying at a mosque in Patikul,
Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Armed Forces Southern Command Edgardo
Espinosa denied the alleged massacre in a telephone interview,
saying that the report was propaganda circulated by Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf, estimated to have between 200 and 500 gunmen in the
southern Philippines, is a radical offshoot of the Moro National
Liberation Front which is now having peace talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
The extremist group is engaged in a bombing and kidnapping
campaign against Christian targets aimed at setting up a
fundamentalist Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the group raided Ipil town in Mindanao, killing 56
civilians and policemen and wounding 48.

<HEADLINE> Germany not to Abandon Conscription, Says Kohl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today
that Germany will not abandon conscription and will follow
France's military reforms closely.
</P>
<P>
While the German government pays "much attention" to the
reforms of the French army, Kohl said, it has no reason to give up
the long-tested principle of conscription system.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac announced Thursday that France
will move its armed forces from conscription to an
all-professional army over six years and cut the size of its
nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Kohl hailed Chirac's support for the Franco-German defense
cooperation, the Eurocorps and the Franco-German Brigade which
forms part of the Eurocorps.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the French decision to give up Hades
short-range mobile missiles, which can only be launched to Germany
during wartime and has long worried the German people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the German troops
are mainly for national and allied defense, different from
France's all-professional army, which is aimed at projecting
troops overseas.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, conscription is a must for Germany, he said, adding
that Germany will maintain close and effective cooperation with
France in security and defense.

<HEADLINE> China Uses Grand Canal to Transport Coal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The ancient Grand Canal, a
traditional passage for grain shipments from South to North China,
has become a key route for coal shipments from the north to the
south, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The waterway was used to transport almost 24.5 million tons of
coal from North China to the energy-starved Yangtze River Delta in
1995, giving strong support to the development of China's economic
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
The canal's freight volume is expected to further expand after
a major dredging project is completed in 1997, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Coal from Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui and Shandong Provinces
and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is transported by train
to Xuzhou, the northern most city of Jiangsu Province, and then
taken by ship to the southern cities in Jiangsu and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Not enough coal to satisfy the mounting need for power in the
region can be transported by train. The ancient canal was chosen
to ease the shortage and feed the hungry factories.
</P>
<P>
The almost 2000-year-old Grand Canal was an important passage
way in the past. It started in Beijing and ended in Yangzhou, then
an economic center.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Progress to Stalled N. Irish Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged both British and Irish leaders to try to break the
deadlock over the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton voiced the appeal during his separate telephone
conversations with the British and Irish Prime Ministers en route
to the western U.S. state of California, White House National
Security Adviser Anthony Lake told reporters accompanying the
president's visit.
</P>
<P>
Lake said that the U.S. government believes that all parties
involved in the Northern Ireland peace process should look at
using proposed elections leading directly to all-party talks as a
way to keep peace efforts alive in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both British and Irish leaders told Clinton that they were
"making progress" and would talk to Clinton later again next week
to brief him on the progress, Lake said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether an Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire was a
prerequisite for the all-party peace talks the Sinn Fein Party,
a political wing of the IRA, seeks, Lake said that was up to the
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the ceasefire needs to be restored if we're going to
get some of the parties to sit down with Sinn Fein," Lake said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, upset with British Prime Minister John Major's delay
in holding all-party peace talks, abruptly ended an 18-month-old
ceasefire and resumed bombing attacks in London on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein criticized Major for proposing the elections instead
of holding the all-party peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, which helped mediate the ceasefire
in Northern Ireland in 1994, has been encouraging the Irish and
the British to "look at elections to see whether that is way as to
what kind of elections they might be and how they would then leap
forward to talks."

<HEADLINE> Northwest China's Economy to Take off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The mammoth potential of the
country's far Northwest is poised for development over the next
few years, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provincial governments and the
authorities of Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions
have worked out their own five-year plans for the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The development of agriculture, metal ore mining, petroleum and
natural gas exploration and petrochemicals will be given top
priority.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest covers more than three million square kilometers
and has a population of just 80 million. It will strive for an
annual economic growth rate of at least 1.4 percentage points
higher than the country's average during 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
It will vigorously develop the local oil, natural gas, mining
and metallurgical industries.
</P>
<P>
This will be an initial step of the five-year plan to
strengthen the capacity of industrial materials supply, in a bid
to prepare for the local economy to take off by the end of this
century, when Xinjiang aims to be the country's most important
cotton, livestock, sugar, oil and natural gas production center.
</P>
<P>
In addition, from 1996-2000, the Northwest will double its
local electrical generating capacity to 9.47 million kilowatts a
year. It will also be manufacturing 20 million tons of coal a year
by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The local facilities, involving transport, telecommunications
and other service items, will also be developed.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Iraqi Defectors Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Two prominent Iraqi defectors
were killed three days after they returned home following their
six-month-long stay in Jordan, reports reaching here from Baghdad
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother
Saddam Kamel, both of whom were sons-in-law of President Saddam
Hussein, were killed when their relatives and clan members stormed
their residence on grounds that the two men were traitors.
</P>
<P>
The presidents' two daughters have been granted divorces from
their husbands, who defected to Jordan with their wives and
several close supporters last August.
</P>
<P>
Saddam's two daughters - Raghad and Rana - presented a demand
Thursday to seek a divorce from their husbands.
</P>
<P>
"They are refusing to stay married to men who betrayed the
homeland, the trust and the lofty values of their noble families,"
the official Iraqi News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel and his brother, together with their families,
returned to Iraq Tuesday evening after Iraq's supreme body, the
Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), and the Ba'th Socialist Party
decided to accept their return.
</P>
<P>
When they set foot on the Iraqi soil Tuesday, the two men were
welcome back as "ordinary citizens." This welcome, however, turned
out to be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, clan members declared that the two
men's blood should be shed for their "treason to the homeland" and
then stormed their residence in Baghdad, killing the brothers in a
gun battle.
</P>
<P>
The two men vowed to overthrow their father-in-law during the
exile in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The two daughters of the president said in their report that
they did not know the fact of their husbands' defection in Jordan
until after Hussein Kamel appeared in a press conference to
expound their purposes. The two women said they immediately asked
to see daughters of King Hussein and informed the monarch's
daughters that they did not know the real intentions of Hussein
Kamel.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel, was the former head of Saddam's weapons programs,
and his brother Saddam Kamel was the deputy head of Saddam's
palace security before his defection.

ROME, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo today met with his Italian counterpart Susanna
Agnelli on promoting the relationship between the European Union
(EU) and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South Africa would make efforts to expand cooperation
with the EU, though some EU member countries refused to open their
farm product market to South Africa and "boycotted" cooperation
with it.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, whose country is holding the rotating presidency of
the EU in the first half of 1996, said the Italian government will
try to clear obstacles hindering the establishment of the EU-South
African cooperative relationship.
</P>
<P>
She also voiced her hope that the EU would sign a new agreement
of cooperation with South Africa during Italy's six-month
presidency tenure.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. NSA Employee Nabbed for Spying for Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A former employee of the
U.S. super-secret National Security Agency (NSA) was arrested
today in Pennsylvania by FBI agents on charges of spying for the
former Soviet Union, the U.S. Justice Department announced here.
</P>
<P>
Robert Lipka, 50, was arrested at his home in Millersville,
Pennsylvania, on charges of passing U.S. classified documents to
the Soviet Union in the mid-1960s, the justice department said.
</P>
<P>
Lipka worked at the NSA, part of the U.S. Defense Department
and based in Fort Meade, Maryland, from 1964 to 1967 and had
access to secret intelligence communications as the agency
conducts electronic surveillance of communications worldwide.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Michael Stiles told a news conference in
Philadelphia that the FBI believes Lipka was the unidentified
NSA spy mentioned in the biography of former Soviet KGB chief
Oleg Kalugin.
</P>
<P>
Kalugin said in the book that there was a young American
soldier at the NSA in the mid-1960s voluntarily caming to the
Soviets and passing on "realms of top-secret material."
</P>
<P>
But FBI officials described the Lipka case as "a historical
case," saying that they believed there was no evidence of spying
after the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Justice Department officials said that the Lipka case was
not as serious as the Aldrich Ames scandal. Ames, a former U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official now serving a life
sentence in prison, was convicted of passing some of most closely
guarded U.S. secrets to Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Beats England Twice in World Badminton Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Danish men's and women's
teams dealt crushing defeats to England in the semifinals of the
Thomas and Uber Cup badminton world team qualifying rounds on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's All-England champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, ranked
fourth in the world, battled through three tough games to beat
England's Darren Hall 17-14, 16-17, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
Hall, ranked 23rd, battled to level the match in the second
game but the Dane had that little bit extra in the decider as he
set the stage for the sweep.
</P>
<P>
The other two singles were also three-game affairs but Denmark
took both doubles in straight games.
</P>
<P>
In the Uber Cup, the Danes were far too strong for England and
dropped only one game in the tie.
</P>
<P>
World number seven Camilla Martin was tested in the second
game against Julia Mann, but won it 12-11 win to start the sweep
for Denmark's women.
</P>
<P>
In the Thomas Cup, Sweden's Jens Olsson sliced to a straight
games win over the Dutch team's top singles player Jeroen van
Dijk, and then added a doubles win with Par-Gunnar Jonsson to cap
an overall 4-1 drubbing.
</P>
<P>
Olsson, ranked 19th in the world, held off a determined van
Dijk in the second game 17-15. Only Chris Bruil, playing in the
third singles slot, could manage a win for the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
The other women's tie provided a bit more suspense, but
Russia's top player Elena Rybkina led her team to a 3-2 upset win
over Sweden.
</P>
<P>
After splitting the first two games, Rybkina dismissed Catrine
Bengtsson who took the third game to the limit before falling
12-10.
</P>
<P>
The Russians iced their spot in Saturday's finals of the
qualifier when Rybkina and Marina Yakusheva swatted away Maria
Bengtsson and Margit Borg in the number one doubles, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
After the qualifying ends on Saturday, three teams will move
on to world finals of both competitions in Hong Kong in May.

STOCKHOLM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Two adventurers from Finland
and Sweden will leave Stockholm on Sunday in a bid to become the
first to ski 800 kilometers across the ice from Greenland to the
North Pole without back-up.
</P>
<P>
Pulling 130-kilogram sleds, Bjoern Thelin, 43, and Petter
Reuter, 26, hope to reach the North Pole in the beginning of May
after battling severe cold, hungry polar bears and drifting ice
floes.
</P>
<P>
The Greenland route is considered much more challenging because
of stronger ocean currents, which always push the ice surface away
from the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures are expected to be minus 50 degrees celsius during
the first weeks of their adventure, which will be the most
arduous part because of the cold, constant darkness and strong ice
shifts.
</P>
<P>
The two plan to begin skiing March 2 from De Long Fjord on
northwestern Greenland.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Urged Not to Delay Return of Serb Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday urged the government of Croatia not to delay the
return to Croatia of Croatian serb refugees who fled the country
last summer.
</P>
<P>
"It underlines that the exercise by members of the local Serb
population of their rights cannot be made conditional upon an
agreement on the normalization of relations between the Republic
of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," said a
presidential statement read by Madeleine Albright, U.S. envoy to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The council made the request out of concern that little
progress had been made on the return of Croatian Serb refugees to
Croatia. Croatian officials argued they fear the return of Serb
refugees would pose security threat to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential statement, the council emphasized that the
promotion of strict respect for the rights of persons belonging to
the Serb minority is relevant to the successful implementation of
the Basic Agreement of 12 November 1995, according to which
Eastern Slavonia will be under the jurisdiction of Croatia within
two years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the statement also called upon the Croatian
government to give due consideration to granting amnesty to local
Serbs remaining in detention on charges arising from allegedly
taking arms in support of the "Republic of Serb Krajina".
</P>
<P>
Croatian government has given grant amnesty to 451 Serbs
prisoners but 389 persons remain in detention in prisons.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed concern that isolated incidents of
killings and other violations of human rights against elderly Serb
population in Croatia had been reported and asked Croatia to
prevent such incidence from recurring.
</P>
<P>
"The council looks to the Croatian government to ensure the
security and well-being of that population and ensure the
provision of basic humanitarian assistance," the statement said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The New York Stock Exchange
witnessed another active trading Friday, with the Dow Jones
industrial average closing at a record high after a surge of 92
points Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip barometer was up 22.03 points at 5,630.49, which
beat the previous session's high of 5,608.46. In the broader
market, declining issues led advancers by a small margin on active
volume of 443 million shares. The transaction was smaller than the
Thursday session.
</P>
<P>
The market was largely affected by government statistics and
the bond trading. The Dow Jones index experienced ups and downs
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
The bond market initially rose on a weaker-than-expected 0.9
percent rise in fourth quarter U.S. gross domestic product, but it
sold off after January U.S. housing starts were reported up a
surprisingly strong 4.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> US, Pakistan to Discuss F-16 Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Pakistan will begin a series of meetings in Washington next month
to decide how to repay Pakistan for 28 F-16s it bought from the
Unite States but never received, a U.S. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration approved the sale of 60 F-16 aircraft
to Pakistan in 1988.
</P>
<P>
But in October, 1990, the deal was suspended when
then-President George Bush refused to certify that Pakistan did
not have a nuclear weapon program.
</P>
<P>
By then, Lockheed Company, the F-16s prime contractor, had
already manufactured 28 aircraft, and Pakistan had paid 658
million dollars for these planes by March, 1993, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
Last month President Bill Clinton approved a congressional
measure that authorizes the United States to sell the planes to a
third country and give the proceeds to Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The official said negotiations with some countries to buy the
planes were underway but he admitted that finding buyers for the
10-year-old aircraft would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
The official also said that the 28 F-16s will be expected not
to fetch the same amount in a third-party sale, so Pakistan wants
the United States to pay the difference.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Gain Upper Hand on Grass Fires in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters reported
gaining an upper hand in battling raging grass fires in southern
U.S. today, after the blaze torched dozens of homes and injured at
least 49 people.
</P>
<P>
The raging fires also blackened thousands of acres in five
counties in Texas, destroyed more than 65 homes along with about
90 other buildings and an equal number of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The main blaze, started to spread Tuesday near Poolville, a
small town about 35 miles northwest of Fort Worth, had burned
across at least 16,500 acres by late morning. But fire officials
said about 70 percent of the fire was contained.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, aided by helicopters and air tankers, also
contained a 6,000 acre fire about 40 miles west of Poolville. But
an 8,000 acre blaze in nearby Shackelford County and a 5,000 acre
fire at Fort Hood were still burning out of control.
</P>
<P>
Texas Governor George W. Bush asked for federal assistance to
aid victims and towns. Property loss caused by the fires were put
at millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Texas said record heat and high wind have been
feeding thousands of grass fires across the state. Some 84,000
acres have been charred in the state this year, more than four
times the total area burned in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Muslim-Croat Police Exceed Authority,  U.N. Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslim-Croat
federation police that entered Sarajevo's Vogosca suburb this
morning are behaving contrary to the rules of conduct and might
accelerate local Serbs' departure, a U.N. refugee agency spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), said in Sarajevo that federation police "are
conducting patrols unsupervised by international police, which is
a direct violation of agreed rules of conduct."
</P>
<P>
Vogosca, an industrial suburb, is the first of five Sarajevo
districts that should be handed over to Muslim-Croat federal
control by March 20 under the Bosnia peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Federal police unit entering Vogosca today included 16 Muslims,
14 Serbs and two Croats. This ethnic ratio was modelled after the
1991 census for this area, as decided at the Rome summit at last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as of today, Vogosca is having a new mayor,
37-year-old Muslim Muhamed Kozadra.
</P>
<P>
Federation police have set up a checkpoint on the road between
the suburbs of Vogosca and Ilijas, and are stopping cars and
checking identification papers and baggage, Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
He said he feared this kind of behavior by the Muslim police
could drive those Serbs who might have been prepared to stay in
their homes in Vogosca to leave instead.
</P>
<P>
The flag of the Muslim Sarajevo government, instead of the
federation's flag, was raised on the Vogosca city hall building
this morning, which was not in keeping with agreements, Tanjug
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
So far, thousands of Serbs have fled the affected districts of
Sarajevo to avoid possible retaliation for the three and half year
siege of the downtown Sarajevo dominated by the Muslims.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Dutch tourist was shot
and killed today in a smash and grab robbery when she and her
husband pulled into a gas station in Miami to ask for directions.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Dutch woman and her husband, driving a rental
car, stopped at a gas station shortly before 10 a.m. to ask for
directions when they were attacked by robbers.
</P>
<P>
"They were approached by two black males who at gun point
attempted to rob the victims. Shots were fired and the female
victim was struck in the upper torso while sitting in the car,"
said Ruby Espinosa, a detective with Metro-Dade County Police.
</P>
<P>
The robbers grabbed the purse and fled in a car with dark
tinted windows. The car was driven by a third man. The robbers
were still at large.
</P>
<P>
The woman was rushed to a hospital where she was pronounced
dead. She was in the front passenger's seat with the windows up
and the doors locked when the gunfire shattered the window.
</P>
<P>
The woman's husband, who had gotten out to ask for directions,
was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose identity was not immediately released by
police, was the second European tourist killed in Florida this
year. Last month, a German man was beaten to death after a night
of drinking in the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, there were 12 fatal attacks on foreign tourists in the
state internationally known as a vacation haven. The killing
raised questions about tourist safety in the Sunshine State and
severely damaged its billion dollar tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Supply Improves In Lagos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- With fuel shortages eased in
Lagos, long queues of vehicles at filling stations disappeared in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Attendants of filling stations said they began receiving fuel
supplies from yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The queues first appeared a week ago when motorists began
panic buying in anticipation of the muslim festival of
Eid-el-Fitri on February 19-20.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the rush for fuel was also occasioned by the fear
that the pump price of fuel might be increased by the government.
However, the fear was soon dispelled by the announcement of the
government budget which did not hike the fuel price.
</P>
<P>
Because of the scarcity, commuters were either forced to pay
cut-throat fares charged by commercial bus drivers, or had to be
stranded for hours at bus stops waiting for the few buses plying
on the roads. Some primary schools even closed because there was
no fuel for their school buses.
</P>
<P>
Expressing apologies to the public for the shortage of
petroleum products, Nigerian Petroleum Resources Minister Dan
Etere said yesterday that "we have enough fuel to go round".
</P>
<P>
The scarcity occurred because most of the tank drivers are
muslims, who went on their legitimate leave, disrupting a free
distribution to various petrol stations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The drivers started lifting fuel from depots from yesterday,
the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Police Enter Serb Suburb of Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Muslim-Croat police and
international police forces entered the Sarajevo municipality of
Vogosca early today, the first since the Bosnia peace agreement
was signed in Paris in last December.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb Interior Ministry said the deployment of mixed
police forces in Serb suburb Vogosca passed without any incidents
or problems.
</P>
<P>
But international mediators meanwhile accused Bosnian Serb
leaders of having needlessly sent thousands of Serb civilians into
exile.
</P>
<P>
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHFR) press spokesman
Kris Janowski said in Vogosca today that the Serb leaders were
responsible for the exodus of Serbs, who he said had not wanted to
leave, Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, thousands of Serbs fled their homes to
other Serb towns, an exodus organized by the Serb authority before
the Muslim police formally patrol in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Another UNHCR spokesman, Christiane Berthiaume said, "We think
that the departure of Serbs from Serb suburbs in Sarajevo is
political manipulation."
</P>
<P>
She said Serbs were leaving the Sarajevo suburbs even though
they had been given sufficient guarantees for their safety.
</P>
<P>
Vogosca, an industrial suburb of Sarajevo, is the first of five
municipalities to be placed under federal control by March 20 this
year in line with the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Federal police unit working in Vogosca included 16 Muslims, 14
Serbs and two Croats. This ethnic ratio was modelled after the
1991 census for this area, as decided at the Rome summit at last
weekend, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
High Representative of the international community for civilian
affairs in Bosnia Carl Bildt said in Vogosca on Thursday that he
was concerned over the exodus of Serbs from this Sarajevo suburb
and this was a tragedy which might have repercussions on all
Bosnia in the future.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also accused the Muslim government and the Serbs of
having failed to send on time positive messages to Serbs in the
Sarajevo suburbs and to stop the massive fleeing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Republican lawmaker on
Friday called on leaders of the House of Representatives to
consider forming a special committee to investigate the burgeoning
problem of teenage drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Representative Frank Wolf, Republican of Virginia, sent a
letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Democratic leader
Richard Gephardt, asking them to assemble a "one-time" panel to
determine why drug abuse among school children has skyrocketed and
recommend possible courses of action to the standing House Drug
Policy Working Group.
</P>
<P>
"America is losing the drug war," said Wolf, an eight-term
House member. "Drug use is increasing at an alarming rate."
</P>
<P>
Wolf cited recent studies indicating use of marijuana,
stimulants and methamphetamine is way up, and that up to one-half
of the children surveyed experimented with illicit drugs by their
final year in high school.
</P>
<P>
"Something must be done," Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
The special panel would look into coordinating drug policy of
various government agencies, improvement of drug treatment
delivery, intelligence and research, and the initiation of more
effective rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
He said he wished to get the committee process moving as
quickly as possible, because many members of Congress will soon be
too busy with re-election campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Commission on Population and Development to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Commission on
Population and Development will hold its second session at U.N.
headquarters to discuss reproductive rights and health next week.
</P>
<P>
Such issues as family planning, maternal and child health,
abortion and information on sexuality will be the central theme at
the session from coming Monday through Friday, according to U.N.
Department of Public Information (DPI).
</P>
<P>
The commission, which was founded in 1946, will hold a general
debate on national experience in population matters as in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
It will then examine the recommendations concerning
reproductive rights, reproductive health and world population
monitoring put forward at the International Conference on
Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994. The activities
of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the implementation of the
Program of Action and those of inter-governmental and
non-governmental organizations will be reviewed as well.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. secretary-general's report on world
population monitoring delivered last year, some 20 million
abortions were performed unsafely among the estimated 45 million
performed worldwide in 1990. More than 70,000 women are estimated
to die annually because of complications arising from unsafe
abortion.
</P>
<P>
Each year sees five million neonatal deaths, of which 3.5
million occur within the first week of life and are largely a
consequence of the lack of proper care during pregnancy, delivery
or the first critical hours after birth.
</P>
<P>
Several reports putting before the commission also indicate
that adolescent abortion is a growing area of concern. The
prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among unmarried
adolescents suggests that premarital sexual activity is common and
may be increasing.
</P>
<P>
The reports also noted that there are 333 million cases of
sexually transmitted diseases worldwide, including about 20
million infected with HIV.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Urges Syria to Open Talks on Water Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today urged the Syrian government to open talks with
Turkey on the long-running dispute over the sharing of the
Euphrates River waters.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the leaders of Bahrain, United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Egypt to explain Turkey's
position, the president said Syria has so far not agreed to
Turkey's repeated calls for dialogue on the issue of sharing
waters from the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Demirel also called on Syria to "abandon using terrorism as a
foreign policy leverage" and stop supporting the anti-Turkey
illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
"Syria must give up using terror as an instrument of its
foreign policy and seek a solution to its problems with Turkey in
a way fitting to good neighborly and brotherly ties," said
Demirel.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Arab countries would not be a party to
Syria's "groundless attacks on Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq agreed in their talks last week to launch an
international campaign to force Turkey to accept "fair and
reasonable sharing" of the Euphrates, which flows to Syria and
Iraq from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
They urged banks and firms to stop aiding the building of the
projects on the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Syria holds Turkey's multi-billion-U.S. dollar plan for the
construction of several dams on the Euphrates has led to a sharp
decline in the flow of waters to Syria which uses it for drinking
and irrigation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's RP Wants Equal Responsibility with ANAP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
Chairman Necmettin Erbakan said today that the Motherland Party's
(ANAP) demand for full control of Turkey's economy for five years
solely by itself was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there should be "equal say and equal
responsibility" between the partners of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan spoke at a press conference following the failure of
the coalition talks with ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yilmaz attributed the collapse of the coalition
talks with the RP to the differences between the two parties over
the administration of the ailing Turkish economy and the RP's
demand to affiliate the Religious Affairs Directorate to a state
ministry chaired by a RP member.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz pointed out that in view of the current situation of
Turkey's national economy, ANAP wanted to keep all economic
portfolios and affiliated institutions.
</P>
<P>
Although the RP at the initial stages of the coalition talks
accepted that key demand of the ANAP, it changed its approach
later and wanted a share in economic administration of the country
as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was assigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form a
coalition government on February 3 after Erbakan and caretaker
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller failed to find partners in the
parliamentary political parties.
</P>
<P>
On February 19, the ANAP and the RP leaders agreed in principle
to form a coalition government, but left the issues of the
distribution of the cabinet members to be solved by a technical
commission formed by the two parties.

AMMAN, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Information Minister
Marwan Muasher denied today any previous contacts with the Iraqi
officials regarding the returning home of high-ranking Iraqi
defector Hussein kamel.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that general Hussein took his own decision to
return to Iraq, denying any interference from the Jordanian side.
</P>

Hussein Kamel and his brother Saddam Kamel, who returned to
Baghdad from a six-month exile in Jordan Tuesday, were shot dead

Hussein, divorced them.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel and his brother fled to Jordan last August with
their families and vowed to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian information minister criticized the way Hussein
was killed and the lack of a just trial.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports that Udai, son of Saddam Hussein, is
being treated in jordan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
condemned the kinging of Hussein Kamel and described it as a
"premeditated crime."
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, the prime minister said that King Hussein
of Jordan did not want Hussein Kamel and his family to go back ,
but they left Jordan and returned to Baghdad by their own volition.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) and the United States today signed a
memorandum of understanding on the development of bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed by visiting US Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown and SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende at the close
of a conference of SADC trade ministers and US businessmen in
Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
It identified six sectors as having major growth potential,
namely, business, energy, financial services, infrastructure,
telecommunication and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The conference, convened under the initiative of the United
States Department of Commerce (USDOC), was the last event of
Brown's US commercial development mission to Africa, an
initiative to increase US trade with sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the memorandum, the SADC and USDOC would work

major sectoral conferences in the US and in southern Africa, so
as to develop and implement a strategy for expansion of trade and
investment.

Speaking before the signing ceremony, Brown said within
sub-Saharan Africa at this point, the SADC offers the strongest
potential for economic growth and the expansion of commercial
ties with the US.
</P>
<P>
No other grouping of countries on the continent offers such
bright prospects both for its own development and for vibrant,
profitable business partnership with the American business
community, Brown added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the SADC market of 135 million people
accounts for more than half of all US exports to sub-Saharan
Africa.

LAGOS, February 24 (Xinhua) -- The National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria (NECON) has assured of its readiness to
conduct a successful non-party local government election next
month in spite of logistics difficulties.

The Zonal Commissioner of NECON, Abu Egbunu, was quoted today
by the News Agency of Nigeria as giving the assurance yesterday
in Lokoja, capital of Kogi state, central Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the determination of NECON in the exercise was
based on the crucial role the election would play as a pace-
setter toward putting Nigeria on the path of participatory
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if the country must move forward in her
socio-political and economic development, it was logical to
install an enduring democracy.

state and local governments.

The local government election is the first to be conducted at
the lowest level in the transition-to-civil-rule program of the
Nigerian military federal government.
