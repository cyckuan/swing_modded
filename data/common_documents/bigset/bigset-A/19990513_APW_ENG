<HEADLINE> Profile of Treasury Secretary Rubin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For years it was a joke among Wall Street  
watchers: When Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin finally decided to 
leave, the stock market would take a dive. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. investment banker, a millionaire  
many times over, may have been mostly unknown to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	But to Wall Street traders, business leaders and even many  
Republicans, he was the linchpin -- with Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan -- who held together the Clinton administration 
policies that some credited with fostering the nation's economic 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody always believed that as long as he was secretary of  
the Treasury, nothing bad could happen,'' Clinton said Wednesday as 
he announced Rubin's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average did indeed take an initial  
200-point drop when Rubin's resignation was announced. But at a 
time when the economy continues to boom, it quickly recovered, 
perhaps because Greenspan is still around or because most believe 
the administration's economic policies will not change. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, 60, who spent most of his life as a trader on Wall Street  
before joining the Clinton administration six years ago, gave the 
markets confidence because they knew he thought like them and had 
the president's ear -- whether his actual policies helped the boom 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was his close relationship with Greenspan that mattered  
most. They met each week for breakfast to hash over everything from 
the October 1997 stock market crash to the subsequent boom to the 
Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin insisted that no one in the Clinton administration  
publicly should criticize Greenspan's actions at the Fed. And as 
the central bank pursued policies that led to low inflation, Wall 
Street cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans were pleased. House Ways and Means  
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, praised Rubin for being 
``a strong and sometimes solitary voice within the Clinton 
administration for open markets and fiscal discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans did criticize Rubin over the 1995 government  
shutdown, and his handling of first the Mexican crisis and then the 
Asian one. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview once, Rubin said the controversial Mexican  
bailout was ultimately praised for the wrong reason -- because it 
worked. Instead, it should have won praise because it was the 
rational economic decision to make, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also frustrated some fellow Democrats, especially when he  
helped steer Clinton toward deficit reduction early on, hoping it 
would lead to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin had long ``pined for private life,'' Clinton noted, and  
made no secret of the fact that he wished to return to New York 
City, where his wife continued living. He told reporters he had no 
immediate plans, although he is viewed as a possible candidate for 
the Fed chairmanship if Greenspan does not want a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who has two grown sons, became a retired partner at  
Goldman, Sachs during his government years and put his own fortune 
-- estimated at more than $100 million -- in a blind trust. He 
entered an arrangement where he could neither profit nor suffer 
from the firm's performance, Treasury officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Goldman went public in the second-largest initial  
public offering in history, gaining $3.66 billion. Some senior and 
retired partners made millions, but Rubin missed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton joked Wednesday that Rubin came to Washington ``to help  
me save the middle class and he'd stayed so long that by the time 
he left, he'd be one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, Rubin responded dryly, has always found that joke  
``a lot funnier than I have.''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Amtrak Deaths Ruled Accidental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) -- The deaths of 11 people in the collision  
of an Amtrak train and a steel-laden truck were ruled an accident 
and not homicide Thursday by a coroner's inquest jury -- a decision 
that does not prevent prosecutors from bringing charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak's City of New Orleans slammed into the truck March 15 in  
Bourbonnais. Investigators have been looking into whether the truck 
driver tried to go around the crossing gates and beat the train. No 
one has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	The coroner's inquest jury heard testimony Thursday from two  
Bourbonnais police officers and the town's fire chief and 
deliberated just 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	John R. Stokes, the truck driver, attended the hearing but  
declined to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are not bound by the findings of a coroner's jury,  
made up of six ordinary citizens who had been called for jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Stokes -- who was driving on a probationary permit because of  
previous traffic violations -- will lose his commercial driver's 
license June 1 for 60 days because of a ticket unrelated to the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been ticketed at least seven times for moving violations  
since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Spielberg To Preview Fla. Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Michael  
Douglas were among the celebrities on hand for a preview of 
Universal Studios' newest theme park, Islands of Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the 110-acre park doesn't open until May 28, Universal,  
and its partner, London-based The Rank Group, have been giving a 
preview to hundreds of reporters, analysts and company executives 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I continue to be amazed by what everyone has accomplished  
here,'' Spielberg said during a ceremony Wednesday. Spielberg 
served as the park's creative consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making a theme park is like making movies and plays and then  
building an entire city to contain them,'' he said. ``The hopeful 
result is the same as in the movies. We just want people to be 
dazzled and entertained.''

<HEADLINE> Hardaway Slump Hurting Heat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Hardaway still wasn't talking Thursday, so  
his numbers were left to speak for themselves: 6-for-32 from the 
field, 1-for-14 from 3-point range, one ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Miami Heat facing elimination Friday night in Game 4 of  
their first-round series with the New York Knicks, most fingers 
were pointing to Hardaway as the main culprit for Miami's dismal 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently, things haven't been going his way thus far,''  
teammate Alonzo Mourning said, ``but I know he can turn things 
around. I've seen him turn things around, and this series is far 
from being over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had a miserable night in Game 3 as the Heat lost by 24  
-- their second blowout defeat in the series. He shot just 1-for-8, 
including 0-for-5 on 3-pointers, and lost his composure by getting 
ejected early in the fourth quarter when he realized the game was a 
lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
	At practice Thursday, Hardaway refused to speak to the media and  
stood on the court shooting while his teammates tried to come up 
explanations for his slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all keep talking about Timmy, Timmy, and Timmy's our point  
guard,'' Mourning said. ``But listen to me, we've got a lot of 
confidence in him. He knows what he has to do to get us going, and 
he's capable of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim's a competitor and a clutch player all his career, and if  
anybody can come back, he can,'' Dan Majerle said. ``Tim's our 
leader obviously, but if Tim's not doing it someone else has to do 
it. Look at everybody's numbers, except Zo's, and they're down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Heat's second leading scorer in this series is  
Voshon Lenard, who has been limited to 23 minutes of garbage time 
in Game 1 and Game 3, but has produced 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away Lenard's 6-for-8 shooting from 3-point range, and the  
rest of the Heat are a shocking 8-for-49. At one point in Game 3, 
they were 0-for-17 from behind the arc. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerle has shot just 2-for-13 in the series, Keith Askins  
hasn't scored a single point, Jamal Mashburn has gone to the free 
throw line only three times and P.J. Brown' scoring and rebounding 
numbers have dipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have tried to contain Hardaway by picking him up  
defensively well above the 3-point line and by having their big men 
sprint back on defense to establish position in case Hardaway 
drives past his man in transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's best effort of the series came in Game 2, when he had  
11 assists, but shot 1-for-5 from the field. In Game 1, he shot 
4-for-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Game 2, I don't think we were successful against him at  
all,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He dominated the game 
without shooting, and I think that's what great players do. As far 
as the other games, everybody goes through tough stretches, and 
he's just gone through a tough stretch. But we never have, and 
never will, underestimate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has greatness in him and we've seen it many times. We  
expect him to give his best game tomorrow, and we're going to have 
to be right and ready to limit that greatness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are trying to become just the second eighth-seeded  
playoff team in NBA history to knock off a No. 1 seed. Denver did 
it to Seattle in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	At their practice Thursday, the Knicks talked about avoiding the  
kind of loss in intensity they had between Games 1 and 2, when they 
went from a 20-point victory to a 10-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of the questions they faced were the same ones being  
posed to the Heat: What's wrong with Hardaway? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything's going on. I think Tim is playing hard  
and he's just not scoring the way he has in the past,'' New York's 
Latrell Sprewell said. ``So maybe he's not putting up the numbers, 
but I think he's very important to what they're doing on the 
floor.''

<HEADLINE> London Museum Opening Mummy Exhibit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The British Museum will open two galleries of  
ancient Egyptian burial artifacts Friday, containing newly 
researched mummies, coffins and other tomb finds from its vast 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	The new displays will show burial practices over 3,000 years,  
from 2500 B.C. to the early centuries A.D. Exhibits will include 
models, toys and figures to give a better conception of the life of 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last major reorganization of (the mummies) was in 1898 and  
not much was done to them since then,'' said John Taylor, assistant 
keeper of Egyptian antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
	The mummies were added to the museum's collection in 1756, three  
years after its founding. But only recently, as technology 
advanced, have they been closely examined. 
</P>
<P>
	They were sent to London hospitals for scanning, producing X-ray  
type pictures of thin slices ranging from head to foot, without 
disturbing the wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been able to discover ages, diseases, parasites,  
embalming methods and what's in the wrappings,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	One mummy, never displayed before and one of the best-preserved,  
is of an anonymous woman, her skin a deep brown color and hair 
still on her head. 
</P>
<P>
	``She lived about 700 B.C., which we worked out from the very  
sophisticated and costly embalming method, so she must have been 
the wife of an important and wealthy man,'' Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Museum's entire holdings include 80 human and more  
than 1,000 animal mummies, including cats, dogs, baboons, bulls, 
crocodiles, snakes and falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Egyptians mummified almost everything that moved, as they  
were considered representative of gods or goddesses and so could be 
objects of devotion,'' Taylor said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Miami Commissioner Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former Miami city commissioner already serving  
time in prison for voter fraud was sentenced Thursday to four years 
in federal prison and $3.2 million in restitution in a separate 
mortgage fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
	Humberto Hernandez, sentenced last year to 364 days in prison on  
the fraud charges, will serve the sentences concurrently, U.S. 
District Judge Joan Lenard said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would be eligible for parole in three years.  
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was elected to the city commission in 1996. He was  
convicted in August 1998 of a misdemeanor voter fraud charge 
stemming from accusations that he covered up an illegal absentee 
vote by a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after his conviction, Hernandez reached a plea agreement  
on separate charges that he was part of a mortgage fraud ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was among several elected and appointed Miami  
officials charged in wide-ranging public corruption investigations.

<HEADLINE> Sarazen Was An Ambassador for Golf  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gene Sarazen was 97 when death caught up with him Thursday  
morning in a hospital bed in Florida, so it's hard to argue he 
lived too little or left us even a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not the same thing as saying the Squire won't be  
missed. A whole generation of kids, led by Tiger Woods and David 
Duval, may already have learned to play golf as skillfully as 
Sarazen did at a tender age. But there are still a few lessons they 
could learn about handling the fame and fortune that follows -- and 
few role models have held up as gracefully for as long as Sarazen 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Joe DiMaggio, who preceded Sarazen in death by little more  
than two months, there was never a better ambassador for his game. 
And like DiMaggio, Sarazen was as humble as guys that good ever 
get. But he was hardly a square. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O'Meara was playing at the Byron Nelson Classic just  
outside Dallas when he found out Sarazen died, and the first thing 
he remembered was a brief conversation they had last month at the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `My mind is going good, but everything else ... I  
can't play golf. I can't walk. It sucks to be 97.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And here O'Meara paused. For a moment, he worried the anecdote  
sounded disrespectful. And so O'Meara quickly added, ``That's 
exactly what he said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one would doubt it. Nobody liked a funny story more than the  
Squire. Sarazen sat graciously for interviews well into his 90s, 
but even after all those years, it was impossible to pin down the 
source of his modesty. That's because most of the time he was too 
busy lampooning his roots, his upbringing, or the threadbare state 
of golf when he became, at age 20, one of its brightest lights. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time he saw his name in the newspaper, after making a  
hole-in-one, he decided Eugenio Saraceni was a handle better suited 
for a violin player than a golfer. So he changed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The only time his father, an Italian immigrant carpenter, ever  
watched his son play, the freshly dubbed Gene Sarazen missed a 
40-foot putt. He recalled the old man asking him that night, `You 
mean to say they pay you fellows to play that game and you couldn't 
put that thing in the hole?''' 
</P>
<P>
	A pro's feet were more likely to swell than his head back then,  
Sarazen would point out, because a sponsor who plunked down $250 
expected the golfer to play in an exhibition during the day and 
turn up on the floor of a department store afterward to hawk some 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was,'' Sarazen said with some satisfaction, ``pretty tough  
in those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even after the rewards changed and his life got easier,  
Sarazen never misplaced his sense of responsibility. The pride in 
his craft, in the way he carried himself, even in his clothes, 
remained unchanged to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, already into his 90s, Sarazen was having  
trouble hitting the golf ball and so he called then-Masters 
chairman Hord Hardin to say that he might not come out to the 
tournament. For nearly two decades, Sarazen hit a ball off the 
first tee in his ceremonial role as an official starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene, people don't come out here to see you hit a golf ball,''  
Hardin told him. ``They come out to see if you're alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Sarazen made a trip across the Atlantic to promote his  
role in designing a golf course and then stopped off at the British 
Open. It was being played that year at Royal St. George's, which 
was next door to the Prince's course, where Sarazen won his only 
British Open, among seven major titles, in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's fame back in the States was assured by many things:  
his major titles, his famed double-eagle at the Masters and the 
invention of the sand wedge, among other things. But in Britain, 
lore had it that he had made eagle twice on a long and difficult 
par-4 at Prince's en route to winning the British. 
</P>
<P>
	When a writer preparing a book had sent Sarazen a letter asking  
about the tournament, Sarazen replied he could not remember the 
details, or even if the story were true. And so, during a windswept 
morning on his brief stay in England, he graciously agreed to be 
driven in a golf cart out to the hole to see if that would stir 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time they made it back to the clubhouse, the writer  
jumped out of the golf cart and headed toward some friends to share 
his story. An old friend of Sarazen's, meanwhile, sidled up to the 
cart and asked, ``So, did you or didn't you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen was quiet for a moment, and then he smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Did,'' he said with a twinkle in his eye. ``At least, I hope  
so.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Lobby Does Old-Fashioned Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though on opposite sides of a fiery issue, Bob  
Walker and James Baker shared the same lookout near the Senate 
floor and the same mission -- stopping any legislative aide who 
scurried by to give their latest gun control pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association,  
cajoled willing listeners with a plea not to insert gun control 
provisions in the juvenile crime bill as a knee-jerk reaction to 
the Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the head of Handgun Control Inc., grabbed his cellular  
phone any time he got a taker to order that the latest gun control 
literature be shipped immediately to that aide's office. 
</P>
<P>
	For both, there's no time to waste.  
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists on both sides of the gun issue have had just three  
weeks to react since juvenile crime legislation now before the 
Senate was instantly transformed into a vehicle for gun control 
measures by the Littleton high school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	So they're using the oldest form of influence peddling in the  
business -- walking the halls of the Capitol to make personal 
pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lobbyists buttonholed lawmakers and aides, senators  
began debating the juvenile crime legislation, while Democrats 
tried to amend the bill to include new restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first vote on gun control since the Littleton shooting on  
April 20, the Senate on Wednesday rejected fresh restrictions on 
sales at gun shows. Instead, lawmakers signaled support for 
voluntary background checks on private sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who back stricter gun laws believe the Littleton shooting  
has given momentum to their efforts. ``It would have been much more 
difficult to bring these issues to the floor of the Senate without 
that tragedy,'' Handgun Control spokeswoman Naomi Paiss conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker contended that the gun control forces were trying ``to  
build their legislative agenda based on tragedies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA finds itself in the unaccustomed position of being alone  
in opposition to some of the provisions being proposed for the 
juvenile crime bill. That's because the Colorado tragedy caused a 
split in the usually united pro-gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group that represents gun manufacturers, distributors  
and dealers has endorsed such measures as increasing the minimum 
age for buying a gun to 21 and banning violent juveniles from ever 
owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	American Shooting Sports Council Executive Director Robert  
Ricker admitted getting some double takes when he tells lawmakers 
or their aides that he favors some restrictions on gun owners' 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to re-examine our positions so we can concentrate on  
the areas where we can help prevent more tragedies,'' Ricker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ricker and Baker said the two gun groups still agree 95  
percent of the time, just not on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA, one of Washington's most potent lobbies, isn't  
conceding defeat. It has taken out full-page ads in major national 
newspapers, sent mailings to the states where senators are wavering 
and activated its grass-roots lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because Bill Clinton and his anti-gun cronies in the Senate  
are trying to exploit the recent school shootings, we urgently need 
you to call your two U.S. senators immediately and urge them to 
oppose the Clinton gun control package,'' an NRA alert to members 
said, urging each member to also call five other supporters of gun 
owners' rights and encourage them to follow suit. The NRA also 
plans to send a letter later this month to all of its millions of 
members, urging them to call their senators and representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker also previewed another argument the gun lobby is making  
all over Capitol Hill -- that lawmakers don't need new laws, they 
just need to enforce the current ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not going to enforce the laws we currently have, what  
sense does it make to pass another one?'' Baker asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NRA supporters in Congress admit that emotions are  
running against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever there is a disaster, there are always people who will  
be more prone to pass something as a knee-jerk response than under 
normal circumstances,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress after  
approving a waiting period for handgun purchases and a ban on 
certain assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the most restrictive provisions of the crime bill were  
responsible for some Democratic members losing their seats and the 
Democrats losing control of the House,'' said Rep. Maurice Hinchey, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dynamics may have changed since then, lawmakers said.  
Barr admits that the Democrats would have a year and a half before 
the next election for gun owners' passions to cool. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., said he believes the House  
would enact new restrictions on guns if they pass ``the 
common-sense reasonable test.''

<HEADLINE> Worm Enzyme May Help Extend Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A cell-protecting enzyme needed for long life in worms may help  
in finding better treatments for Alzheimer's and other human 
diseases associated with aging, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding of the enzyme reported today in the journal Nature  
``gets us closer to understanding what's involved in the aging 
process and where we can intervene,'' said Anna McCormick, a 
biochemist at the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers led by biologist Martin Chalfie at Columbia  
University studied a nearly microscopic roundworm known as 
Caenorhabditis elegans. When it is well fed, it survives only about 
three weeks, but it can withstand food shortages in a larval state 
for at least two months. Several genes in this worm were already 
linked to the larva's longer life, but their mechanism wasn't 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	The research team from Columbia and Dartmouth College identified  
an enzyme known as a cytosolic catalase that seems to act as a 
central agent in allowing some worms to live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	When the normal gene that makes the enzyme, ctl-1, is removed,  
the worms die sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is to determine whether a similar enzyme exists in  
humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers argue that cytosolic catalase allows longer life  
by performing a function it was already known to serve: blocking 
cell damage caused by oxygen compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Such oxidative damage -- analogous to metal rusting -- has been  
implicated in human aging and diseases like Alzheimer's, Lou 
Gehrig's and Parkinson's. Vitamin E, an antioxidant, is now used to 
prevent heart attacks and treat Alzheimer's in some patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of the catalase gene bolsters the theory that  
oxidative damage is central to both aging and its diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The worm gene ``should give impetus to people working on the  
human genes to try to look for things like this,'' Chalfie said. It 
may eventually be possible to protect human nerve cells by boosting 
catalase with a drug, McCormick suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegfried Hakimi, a McGill University biologist who also studies  
life span in roundworms, said researchers should now seek to 
establish if higher levels of cytosolic catalase alone will make 
worms live longer, not just block cell damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Johnson, a University of Colorado geneticist who also works  
with roundworms, cautioned that their life-extending mechanisms may 
ultimately have limited relevance to human disease. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said researchers have made roundworms live five times  
longer with genetic manipulations. Johnson thinks such work 
suggests that people can also live longer with the right drug -- or 
mix of drugs -- in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure how much of a magic bullet it will be. I think it  
will be a variety of bullets,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bargainers Complete Kosovo Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate bargainers agreed to a compromise  
package Thursday financing the bombardment of Yugoslavia and aid to 
Central America, dropping controversial proposals to create loan 
guarantee programs for ailing steel and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate planned to vote on the wide-ranging  
spending measure next week and ship it to President Clinton. 
Working into the night, negotiators from the two chambers capped 
their third day of bargaining by agreeing to consider the proposed 
loan programs in a separate bill in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending legislation contains $11.8 billion for the air  
campaign in the Balkans, Kosovo's refugees and a general military 
buildup -- twice Clinton's spending request -- plus other items 
driving the total price tag toward $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Clinton had said progress was being made,  
despite White House veto threats over the defense boosts, planned 
domestic cuts and other provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some effort to trim down the bill some and get it in  
a position where I can sign it, and I hope it will be done 
quickly,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also contains nearly $1 billion to help Central  
American countries rebuild from last fall's Hurricane Mitch, plus 
$566 million to aid U.S. farmers harmed by low commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., two  
House Republicans reversed themselves Thursday, as House 
negotiators voted 12-11 to reject a program helping the steel 
industry by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Byrd working with top lawmakers in search of a  
compromise for his steel proposal, which might end up in separate 
legislation. Also under consideration was a provision by Sen. Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M., that would set up a similar program for small oil 
and gas firms. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bargainers had voted 13-10 early Thursday to accept  
the steel provision, infuriating conservatives by adding to the 
bill's cost and jeopardizing passage of the overall measure. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Hastert, Reps. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, and Joe  
Skeen, R-N.M., switched and voted against Byrd when the issue was 
reconsidered in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some discussions,'' Regula said of his meeting with  
Hastert. ``That's his role as leader, which is perfectly 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, approved last month by the Senate, would provide  
$140 million to back $1 billion in loan guarantees for 
moderate-sized steel companies hurt by imports. Among them would be 
the Weirton Steel Corp. of Weirton, W.Va., which would be another 
victory for the 81-year-old Byrd, considered the Senate's 
craftiest, fiercest champion of home-state projects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see here is a steamroller,'' Byrd said of the vote that  
knocked the steel provision out of the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Domenici's $500 million loan program for oil and gas companies  
was rejected by House bargainers early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, a 40-year Senate veteran, also faced pressure from Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott said he would keep the 
bill from the Senate floor until the steel provision was gone and 
the bill slimmed down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard-headedness and caginess don't get you much if you don't  
have a bill to deal with,'' Lott said of Byrd. ``This bill is too 
big, too many riders. Back off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining in the bill was a Senate-approved provision providing  
up to $4.3 million to pay reparations for Japanese people interned 
during World War II, including some from Latin America who were 
placed in U.S. detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders decided against reducing the $900 million in added  
funding the compromise would provide to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency following the tornadoes that hit Oklahoma and 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the package was to be paid for from this year's expected  
$111 billion federal surplus. Republicans, however, were insisting 
on paying about $1.6 billion of it by cutting domestic programs, 
mostly money for food stamps they said was not going to be spent. 
Public housing and foreign aid would also be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contained a provision by Sen. Kay Bailey  
Hutchison, R-Texas, forbidding the federal government from taking 
any of the $246 billion states have won in a pact with the tobacco 
industry. Clinton opposes the provision, arguing some of the money 
belongs to the federal government under the Medicaid 
health-insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Hutchison dropped efforts to include language saying  
the states should -- but not must -- use portions of the money for 
anti-smoking and health programs, which is how the administration 
wants the money used.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Spending Bill Headed for Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders plan to push legislation  
through the House and Senate next week that would double the funds 
President Clinton requested for the battle over Kosovo, assistance 
to U.S. farmers and aid for Central American hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping three days of bargaining, House-Senate negotiators shook  
hands Thursday evening on a package that ultimately swelled to 
nearly $15 billion. Clinton had sought $6 billion for the air 
campaign against Yugoslavia, and just over $1 billion for Central 
America, farmers and assorted other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The final hurdle was overcome after House bargainers, pressed by  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., reversed themselves and 
rejected a guaranteed loan program for some steel companies 
proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. The steel assistance and a 
similar program for ailing oil and gas companies sponsored by Sen. 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., will be considered later in a separate 
package, which unlike the Kosovo measure will have no guarantee of 
reaching the president's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been going to conferences with senators for years,'' said  
29-year House veteran Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Appropriations Committee. ``We always hit one or two 
obstacles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans won a defense increase in the package, which would  
provide $11.8 billion for the air attacks on Yugoslavia, a general 
military buildup and Balkan refugees. That doubling of Clinton's 
request helped the GOP polish its pro-Pentagon credentials and will 
help them live within next year's budget limits. 
</P>
<P>
	They also got language proposed by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas, blocking Clinton from grabbing any of the $246 billion 
states have won from a legal settlement with the tobacco industry. 
Clinton wanted to use a portion of those funds for anti-tobacco and 
other health programs. The president argues that some of the money 
belongs to the federal government under the Medicaid 
health-insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	But three months after Clinton requested the aid for Honduras  
and other Central American countries battered by the deadly 
Hurricane Mitch, he finally got it -- along with four times the 
amount he sought for U.S. farmers hurt by low commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP provisions the administration opposed as  
anti-environmental were either rejected or watered down. These 
included an effort by Alaska's senators to protect commercial 
fishing in Glacier Bay National Park and a drive by Domenici to 
prevent the silvery minnow from being protected in the Rio Grande 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	All but $1.6 billion of the bill's cost will be paid out of this  
year's projected $111 billion federal surplus. The rest will come 
from cuts in domestic programs, mostly food stamp funds some 
lawmakers said would be unused. The administration defeated earlier 
GOP plans to cut money used to back loans by international banks 
and to purchase nuclear materials from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's steel provision was removed from the bill after two House  
Republicans reversed themselves Thursday and House negotiators 
voted 12-11 to reject the program. The two were Reps. Ralph Regula, 
R-Ohio, and Joe Skeen, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some discussions,'' Regula said of his meeting with  
Hastert. ``That's his role as leader, which is perfectly

<HEADLINE> Growing Ford Motor May Challenge GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Under aggressive new leadership, Ford Motor Co.  
is on a roll. There's even talk in Detroit that the world's No. 2 
automaker eventually could overtake No. 1 General Motors Corp. for 
the first time since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
	Becoming No. 1 was ``not something we spend a lot of time  
worrying about,'' William Clay Ford Jr. said after presiding over 
his first annual meeting as chairman Thursday. But he and new 
president and chief executive Jac Nasser have done little to 
discourage the speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure size is a harbinger of success.'' Ford said. ``If  
you do everything else well, size and profitability follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, Ford has been more profitable than GM as  
the larger automaker has fought with its unions and struggled to 
halt its long-shrinking market share. While Ford's annual sales 
still significantly trail GM's by about 1.4 million vehicles, Ford 
has the greater momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Since assuming control in January from the retired Alex Trotman,  
Ford and Nasser have frequently stated their goal to make Ford 
Motor ``the world's leading consumer company that provides 
automotive goods and services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While GM continues to shrink its operations to refocus largely  
on assembling cars and trucks, Ford has been expanding with the 
recent acquisition of Sweden's Volvo and some auto-related 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Ford recently bought the Kwik-Fit chain of automotive  
service shops. In the United States, Ford is launching an ambitious 
expansion into auto recycling, hoping to bring economies of scale 
to a largely fragmented but highly profitable business. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after Thursday's meeting, Nasser hinted  
that more such moves were coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're clearly focusing on growth, both internally generated  
growth and other opportunities that fit into our consumer-oriented 
strategy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone on Wall Street is convinced the strategy will work.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit of head-scratching going on with all the  
acquisitions in the service sector,'' said analyst Gary Lapidus of 
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``Not be cause people disagree with the 
strategy, but the jury is still out on how well they're going to 
execute it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Ford's biggest strength has been its ability to  
expand and improve its model lineup -- especially in light trucks -- 
while cutting costs. In recent years, Ford has killed off 
slow-selling car lines and dominated the market for pickups and 
sport utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've realigned their capacity and model mix more  
aggressively to better serve the needs of the consumer -- more so 
than General Motors,'' Lapidus said. ``I expect them to continue to 
gain market share over the next two years as they introduce a lot 
of very exciting products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Ford has significantly lagged GM in car sales, its newest  
models -- the Focus subcompact, the retro Thunderbird roadster and 
Lincoln LS among them -- hold the promise of a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could become an unbelievable powerhouse on the car side  
of the market,'' said Wes Brown of the automotive consulting firm 
Nextrend. ``That in and of itself will lead to continued growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At GM, ``there's still too much focus on the belief that all you  
need is good marketing and buyers will come,'' Brown said. ``That's 
not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM acknowledges it has room for improvement but is not about to  
relinquish its No. 1 position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're committed to staying No. 1 through the growth of our  
business and a commitment to improving our product line and 
building what the customers want,'' spokesman Tony Cervone said. 
``But we'll do so prudently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, an industry expert at the University of Michigan,  
said GM is gearing up to compete better against Ford's truck 
lineup. Its redesigned full-size pickups have been hot sellers, and 
new SUVs built on the pickup's chassis will debut later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a horse race,'' Cole said. ``There's nothing  
to suggest victory is won or lost for either.''

<HEADLINE> American Air Faces Antitrust Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department on Thursday charged  
that American Airlines, the nation's second largest carrier, cut 
fares and added flights temporarily to drive low-cost competitors 
out of its giant hub airport outside Dallas and Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General  
Joel I. Klein, said his staff is investigating whether other 
airlines engaged in the same tactics at other hub airports around 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Wichita,  
Kan., the government accused American of monopolizing and 
attempting to monopolize passenger service to and from Dallas-Fort 
Worth International Airport, the nation's third largest airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the public who loses out when major airlines succeed in  
driving low-cost competitors out,'' Attorney General Janet Reno 
told a news conference. ``Consumers shouldn't have to pay sky-high 
prices because one airline drives out low-cost competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American was charged with repeatedly trying to drive small,  
startup airlines out of the DFW airport by saturating their routes 
with additional flights and cutting fares. After the competitors 
withdrew or drastically reduced their service, American 
re-established high fares and reduced its service, the government 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said American increased its prices between Dallas-Fort  
Worth and Wichita by 50 percent after it forced Vanguard Airlines, 
a lower-cost competitor, out of that route. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said, ``American adopted a predatory responsive policy.  
... American knew this strategy would be costly and pursued it only 
in order to drive out the new carriers so it could return to its 
monopoly pricing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American replied in a statement, ``We believe these allegations  
of `predatory practices' are unwarranted and go against the very 
essence of free market competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said American's tactics were successfully employed against  
three new entrants into the Dallas-Fort Worth market: Vanguard, Sun 
Jet and Western Pacific. ``The effect on the traveling public was 
devastating'' in terms of higher prices and fewer flights, Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The traveling public ends up paying much more to fly much  
less,'' Klein said, alleging that American deliberately endured 
short-term losses in order to drive out competition. The lawsuit 
quoted American's former chairman, Robert L. Crandall, as saying, 
``If you are not going to get them out, then no point to diminish 
profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Klein said the government sued after negotiations with American  
broke down. He declined to name the other airlines under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One private antitrust lawyer and former antitrust division  
veteran, Marc Schecter, noted the government's lawsuit emphasizes 
that American dominates the DFW hub, with a 70 percent share of 
passenger traffic. Schecter predicted that antitrust division 
attorneys would be looking at hubs where one airline was 
overwhelmingly dominant and how such airlines responded to any 
competition there. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first predatory pricing case brought in the industry  
since airline deregulation in 1978. At that time, major carriers 
established hubs to concentrate their traffic through one or more 
airports. While hubs provide some conveniences for passengers, hub 
carriers frequently charge higher fares on hub routes with little 
competition. Low-cost carriers often can provide competitive 
alternatives to the hub carrier, generally offering fare cuts of 50 
percent or more. A 1996 study by the Department of Transportation 
estimated that low-cost carriers were saving consumers $6.3 billion 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to targeting Vanguard's routes to Wichita, Kan., and  
Kansas City, Mo., American's actions were aimed at Sun Jet's routes 
to Long Beach, Calif., and Western Pacific's to Colorado Springs, 
Colo., the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second case the division has brought alleging  
monopoly tactics by American. In 1983, during the Reagan 
administration, the division charged that Crandall, then American's 
chief executive, called his major competitor at DFW, president 
Harold Putnam of Braniff, and proposed that they coordinate fare 
increases. Putnam was taping the conversation for Justice 
investigators, who ultimately got Crandall and American to agree to 
a court order barring such activity in the future.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds  
rose in the latest week, despite a drop in retail funds, the 
Investment Company Institute reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets in retail money market mutual funds, which are held by  
individual investors, decreased by $2.31 billion to $856.15 
billion, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.443 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.443 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.27 percent from 4.33 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield fell to 4.30 percent from 4.31 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield fell to 4.37 percent from 4.42  
percent the previous week, while the 30-day compounded yield fell 
to 4.39 percent from 4.40 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
60 days, down from 61 days a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online, service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.07 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.09 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts fell to 0.91 percent from 0.92 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.12 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the previous 
week. Yields were 4.36 percent on 1-year CDs, also unchanged; 4.48 
percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.47 percent a week earlier; and

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A substitute teacher has been arrested for  
allegedly taking off his pants in front of a class of fourth

<HEADLINE> 'Atomic Train' Set for Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A runaway train carrying a nuclear weapon and  
radioactive waste careens out of control, creating a potential 
catastrophe for the city of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	No, make that ``hazardous'' waste, not radioactive. NBC, at the  
last minute, overhauled its ``Atomic Train'' miniseries to drop all 
references to nuclear waste materials. 
</P>
<P>
	There's still an atomic bomb on board the train barreling toward  
Denver in the four-hour NBC thriller airing Sunday and Monday, May 
16 and 17, at 9 p.m. EDT and starring Rob Lowe with Esai Morales 
and Kristin Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	In real life, nuclear weapons are not carried on trains, though  
there are plans to carry radioactive wastes from the nation's 
nuclear power plants to Nevada by Train. But NBC said it belatedly 
realized that ``Atomic Train'' did not depict the safeguards that 
would be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although it (the miniseries) is fictitious, rather than be  
inaccurate about the transporting of material we decided to change 
the nature of the material,'' said network spokeswoman Rebecca 
Marks. 
</P>
<P>
	A disclaimer will tell viewers that the movie is not based on  
fact, and that NBC does not ``suggest or imply in any way that 
these events could actually occur.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision had nothing to do with any outside pressure, Marks  
said, adding that no NBC executive had been contacted by any 
nuclear industry representative before the change. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the network last week acknowledged a letter from the  
president of the Idaho chapter of the Health Physics Society, which 
specializes in radiation. It called the movie's premise wrong and 
asked NBC to add a disclaimer similar to the one the network 
ultimately adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	But NBC had already helped fan the flames with its heavy  
promotion of ``Atomic Train'' on the air and in print. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where will you be when disaster strikes? Trains carry nuclear  
materials through America's backyards all the time. What if one day 
... something went wrong?'' was the message in a People magazine 
ad. 
</P>
<P>
	(A Denver TV station decided not to broadcast the series,  
judging it ``incompatible'' with the city's mood following the 
Columbine High School shootings.) 
</P>
<P>
	The film's synopsis: A train carrying a nuclear weapon and  
hazardous waste careers down the Rocky Mountains, crashing 300 
miles west of Denver. A resulting fire detonates a Russian nuclear 
weapon that had been placed on board by a disposal company hired by 
the government to dispose of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe plays a National Transportation Safety Board investigator  
who tries in vain to halt the runaway train when its brakes fail. 
The scenario provides some electrifying stunts as the train races 
through mountain passes at more than 70 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The Las Vegas-based Nuclear Emergency Search Team (NEST), a  
cadre of nuclear weapons experts, is called in to try to prevent an 
explosion, or, if that fails, to be on hand to help clean up the 
first American city devastated by a nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for comment, Energy Department spokesman Derek Scammell  
called the movie Hollywood hype. 
</P>
<P>
	``For starters, we do not transport any type of nuclear warheads  
by train,'' Scammell said. Since 1947, the warheads have been 
shipped by road ``in safe, secure trailers'' by a special 
transportation division, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to move nuclear weapons, the component that  
would detonate the device is not moved with the device,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Atomic Train'' scenario simply couldn't happen, Scammell  
said. ``With all due respect to Hollywood, this is going to be a 
typical Hollywood movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there's a real-life issue to be resolved: the thousands  
of tons of rods of spent radioactive fuel piling up at nuclear 
power plants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear power industry had been promised a disposal site by  
late 1998, but the deadline keeps getting pushed back. Now Nevada 
is fighting plans to put it at Yucca Mountain, 100 miles northwest 
of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 50 million people in 43 states living within a mile  
or less from nuclear shipment routes,'' Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., 
said in a recent interview. ``I keep telling people this is nuclear 
waste that would be laid at your doorstep.''

<HEADLINE> Easy confirmation thought for Summers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Summers may be a harried leap in  
style from the unflappable Treasury secretary he's been nominated 
to replace, but on matters of substance the two could be twins. 
That's expected to earn him an easy confirmation in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, has served since 1995 as deputy to Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin, who announced his long-expected resignation 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right course has been set, and the challenge is to carry  
on,'' Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators key to the confirmation process appear to largely agree  
-- if anyone in President Clinton's Cabinet has had a bipartisan fan 
club on Capitol Hill, it's been Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, they are likely to grill Summers about the  
administration's support for recent international bailouts as well 
as domestic policies in which he has had a strong hand, such as 
President Clinton's proposed Social Security reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, 60, who was co-chairman of the Wall Street firm Goldman  
Sachs &AMP; Co. before he joined the administration, said that beyond 
taking a fishing trip he has not yet decided what he will do next. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt inside myself it was time to go back home,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and Summers have worked together on Clinton's economic  
policies from the beginning. Little change is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any reason for thinking policy will change one  
iota,'' said Lyle Gramley, former Federal Reserve governor. ``It is 
in the international arena where Treasury shines, and that is where 
Larry has been taking the lead for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even from administration critics, Summers and Rubin, along with  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, have won praise for 
helping keep a global economic crisis from derailing the 
high-flying U.S. economy, now in its ninth year of uninterrupted 
growth, a record unmatched in peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers has proved an unlikely economic commando -- a rumpled,  
blustering former Harvard professor parachuting into financial 
trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he saw no  
problems with the Senate nomination. Sen. William Roth, R-Del., 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which must approve the 
nomination, said his panel had a ``good working relationship'' with 
Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he may face some heat from senators who have been  
critical of the administration's support for the International 
Monetary Fund as it assembled more than $100 billion in emergency 
bailout packages during the recent global currency crisis that 
leveled economies in Asia, Russia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of questions he'll have to answer,'' said Senate  
Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., who noted Republicans have also 
found fault with Clinton's proposal for a Social Security overhaul 
this year, which Summers and Rubin helped formulate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's departure had been rumored for more than a year, but he  
reluctantly stayed on, first to deal with the overseas financial 
crisis and then out of concern that he could not leave while 
Clinton was facing impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rubin has groomed Summers for the job, the deputy's  
personal style couldn't be more different. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin is suave and slim and wears impeccably tailored suits. The  
portly Summers, a full professor at Harvard University at the 
tender age of 28, sometimes gives the impression of a preoccupied 
academic who has trouble keeping his shirttail tucked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin appears relaxed and amiable. Summers, who almost always  
works with an open can of Diet Coke at hand, is intense and seldom 
smiles. In his moment of triumph, he got a catch in his throat as 
he thanked his family in his remarks at the Rose Garden ceremony at 
which Clinton announced his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	His blunt self-assurance can rub some members of Congress the  
wrong way. Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., recalled that Summers once 
described Republican efforts to eliminate estate taxes as 
``selfish,'' raising concerns about his ability to avoid making 
``ill-tempered, partisan remarks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even Summers' detractors acknowledge his ability to  
``think outside the box'' and ``add value'' to deliberations on 
almost any topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers grew up outside Philadelphia and hails from a family of  
distinguished economists. At Harvard, he was known for research 
into practical economic questions such as tax policy, joblessness 
and the stock market. In 1991, he left academia to become chief 
economist at the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, he worked on Clinton's transition team and took the job  
of Treasury undersecretary for international affairs. He was 
promoted to deputy secretary after Rubin replaced Clinton's first 
Treasury secretary, former Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Sex Comedy Really Is Funny and Sexy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Experienced theatergoers have come to expect any  
play called a sex comedy to be neither sexy nor funny. ``Things You 
Shouldn't Say Past Midnight'' is a brightly fresh, wildly funny 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
	The play, by actor Peter Ackerman, opened Thursday at the  
off-Broadway Promenade Theater. With six names listed in the 
theater program, the audience expects three couples to act out the 
play's title. A bed slides out to stage center, a couple huddling 
under the covers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben (Mark Kassen) sits up. An argument follows, with lines  
closer to ``The Honeymooners'' than to reality. Finally, Ben shouts 
``Maybe I'm gay,'' and Nancy (Erin Dilly) heads into the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Scene 2 reveals the bedroom of Grace (Clea Lewis), in a  
nightgown, whose visitor for the fifth night running is Gene 
(Jeffrey Donovan). She wants to go to bed; he'd like to talk. Gene 
is the play's most intriguing character, unintentionally funny, an 
Italian working in an Italian organization. The most conventional 
thinker of the six, not college educated and wishing he were, he is 
often the one with the most sensible ideas. He's in love with 
Grace, a zany who just wants a fling. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the play's surprises, Nancy bursts in on Grace and  
Gene for advice. They call Gene's brother Mark (Andrew Benator), a 
psychologist. His bed, shared with an older man (Nicholas Kepros), 
slides onto the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Much advice gets tossed around via speakerphone. ``People don't  
always know what's best for them. That's what friends are for,'' 
pronounces Grace. Nancy phones Ben, putting everybody on the 
speakerphone. Ben repeats Nancy's words that upset him, eliciting 
much commentary, comic and, in Mark's case, insightful. 
</P>
<P>
	The evening's only nudity is briefly in the first scene. John  
Rando directed, keeping ``Things You Shouldn't Say Past Midnight'' 
jumping as the romp it is.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Wants NJ Teams Under One Roof </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman says if the New Jersey  
Nets and New Jersey Devils are interested in state funding for a 
new basketball court and new hockey rink, the teams should put them 
under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
	That seems fine with the Nets, whose president said Wednesday  
the team's new owners are flexible and would ``move heaven and 
earth'' in their quest to have a new arena for both teams built in 
Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Devils owner John J. McMullen, however, said he still wants to  
build a hockey-only arena in Hoboken. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Nets, ``I wish them luck. I hope they get it. There's  
nothing wrong with having two arenas in the state,'' McMullen said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There is if you ask Whitman, who insisted ``everything we've  
seen to date says you have to have two teams in a facility. Put it 
another way: we can't sustain two different arenas in that part of 
the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So somehow, there has to be some type of an agreement between  
Nets and Devils, it would seem, unless one or the other is going to 
move out of the state,'' Whitman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's remarks, her strongest on the topic, came a day after  
the Nets -- to no one's surprise -- advised officials they will move 
the basketball franchise from the state-run Meadowlands sports 
complex to downtown Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which  
operates the Meadowlands, wants to build a new arena for both the 
Nets and Devils at the East Rutherford complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Without offering specifics, the Nets told Whitman and the  
Meadowlands leadership in a letter delivered Tuesday that their 
Newark plan is a good deal for state taxpayers because it ``better 
enables the state to capitalize on existing investment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team did not release the letter, which was obtained  
Wednesday by The Associated Press. It was signed by one of the 
owners as well as the franchise's president, Michael Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman reiterated that her goal is to keep the state's five  
professional teams in New Jersey. ``Where they stay in New Jersey 
is secondary to keeping them here,'' Whitman said. 
</P>
<P>
	All now play at Meadowlands venues: The football Giants and  
Jets, and the New York-New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer 
in Giants Stadium; and the Nets and Devils at the Continental 
Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex also include the Meadowlands Racetrack, a premier  
horse racing venue.

	Dow Closes at Record 11,107.19  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher today on reports  
showing moderate inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average and 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 hit new records. But weakness in some 
technology shares pulled the Nasdaq Stock Market lower. The Dow 
Jones industrial average closed up 106.82 at 11,107.19, breezing 
past its previous closing record of 11,031.59 posted last Friday. 
The Dow is up more than 21 percent so far this year. IBM led the 
Dow higher after Merrill Lynch raised its prediction for how much 
the stock would rise over the next 12 months. That came after an 
analyst meeting yesterday during which chairman Louis Gerstner said 
Internet would play a large part in the company's future, and that 
a quarter of IBM's 1998 revenues came from electronic commerce. IBM 
stock soared 19 1/2 to a record 245, accounting for more than 89 
points on the Dow. The Nasdaq Composite Index was at 2,582.00, down 
24.54.

	Producer Prices Rise 0.5 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most prices charged by factories, farmers and  
other producers remained tame in April, but soaring energy prices -- 
including a record jump for gasoline -- may be starting to affect 
consumers. The government's Producer Price Index for finished goods 
rose 0.5 percent in April, the Labor Department said today. That 
followed a smaller 0.2 percent increase in March and brought the 
annual rate of inflation in prices wholesalers pay to 1.1 percent 
so far in 1999, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for all of 
1998. The April rise was largely due to a 5.1 percent jump in 
energy prices -- the largest in nearly nine years -- which economists 
had expected.

	American Air Faces Antitrust Charge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department charged today that  
American Airlines, the nation's second-largest air carrier, 
monopolized airline passenger service to and from Dallas-Fort Worth 
International Airport. American was charged in a lawsuit with 
repeatedly trying to drive small, startup airlines out of the DFW 
airport, the nation's third largest, by saturating their routes 
with its own flights and cutting fares. The lawsuit was filed in 
U.S. District Court in Wichita, Kan. Although this is the first 
predatory-practices case brought since airlines were deregulated in 
1978, other airlines and their tactics at other hub airports are 
being investigated by the department's antitrust division. American 
called the allegations unwarranted and said they go against the 
very essence of free-market competition. AMR shares were at 74, 
down 3/16.

settled government charges they misled consumers with Internet 
advertisements to lease new computers with low monthly payments, 
federal regulators said today. Dell Computer Corp. and Micron 
Electronics Inc. both agreed to provide consumers with ``clear, 
readable and understandable information in their lease 
advertising,'' the Federal Trade Commission said. The FTC said ads 
from Dell and Micron included important cost information in 
inconspicuous or unreadable fine print, or they omitted the 
information. The FTC settlement, approved 4-0 by the commission, 
becomes final after a 60-day public comment period. Dell shares 
were at 43 1/4, down 11/16. Micron shares were at 10 7/8, down 3/16.

	SEC Targets Online Investment Fraud  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a bid to bolster its ability to fight  
online fraud, the Securities and Exchange Commission has turned to 
Congress for help, asking for an increase in its budget and greater 
leeway in the kind of enforcement actions it can take. Even if it 
gets the help it is seeking, however, the SEC's crime-fighting 
powers will continue to be hampered in several ways, including the 
fact that it can only file civil lawsuits against suspected 
violators. There are other limits: The SEC can bar brokers who have 
violated the law from the brokerage industry, but not from other 
financial activities such as promoting stocks. And it it lacks 
authority to shut Web sites.

died of lung cancer in 1995 after smoking Kools. Charles Steele's 
family had sued for $26 million, claiming the nation's 
third-largest tobacco company sold him an unreasonably dangerous 
product. Jury foreman Gary White said Steele ``was quite aware of 
the dangers, but the pleasures outweighed the dangers.'' On Monday, 
a jury in Memphis, Tenn., cleared B&AMP;W and two other tobacco 
companies of liability in the deaths of three smokers.

continuing operations were $5.7 million, or 18 cents a share, for 
the quarter ended April 30, compared with $5.2 million, or 17 cents

<HEADLINE> House GOP Sets Social Security Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to gain ground in the Social Security  
debate, House Republicans are rushing a floor vote on legislation 
intended to prevent raids on $1.8 trillion in surplus money until 
the program is fixed for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, the Social Security surplus can't be used  
for new spending programs, nor can it be used to offset tax cuts,'' 
said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders on Wednesday ordered that the bill bypass the  
Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee and head directly to 
the floor next week to avoid any snags or chances for Democrats to 
push for changes. Democrats in the Senate have blocked a similar 
Social Security ``lockbox'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. E. Clay Shaw, chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee  
on Social Security, told reporters Wednesday that House passage was 
assured and should serve notice that Republicans are serious about 
working with President Clinton and congressional Democrats to 
ensure the program's future solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has got to be a bipartisan effort,'' said Shaw, R-Fla.  
``One party cannot do it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``lockbox'' proposal would create new legislative hurdles  
for any attempt to use $1.8 trillion in projected surpluses -- out 
of about $2.6 trillion total over the next decade -- for anything 
other than Social Security or Medicare. Both are in jeopardy of 
financial insolvency as the baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats heaped scorn on the proposal, which they said  
allows Congress too many loopholes to get at the money. They also 
said that skipping the committees demonstrates that the GOP isn't 
truly interested in Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	``They appear more interested in political stunts than actually  
saving Social Security,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top 
Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel and his fellow Ways and Means Democrats were scheduled to  
meet later today with Clinton at the White House to map out a 
coordinated strategy for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has outlined a detailed plan to restore the  
program, as have Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer of Texas and 
Shaw, but some GOP leaders say it's doubtful any deal can be 
reached. And House Democrats fear that Clinton might be tempted to 
negotiate with Republicans and leave them on the sidelines, as he 
has done on other high-profile issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to compare notes,'' said Rep. Sander Levin,  
D-Mich. ``We would prefer action if it is positive and appropriate, 
not action for its own sake. We're going to assess where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said  
House passage of the Social Security ``lockbox'' would increase 
pressure on Democrats to drop their filibuster and that he hoped to 
try to revive the measure in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's being blocked by the Democrats. ... They're going to have  
to explain why,'' Lott told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 11,107.19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Thursday on reports  
showing moderate inflation, with the Dow Jones industrial average 
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 pushing to new records. 
</P>
<P>
	But weakness in some technology shares pulled the Nasdaq Stock  
Market lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 106.82 to 11,107.19,  
breezing past its previous closing record of 11,031.59 posted last 
Friday. The Dow is up nearly 21 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.56 to 1,367.56, topping  
its previous closing high of 1,364.00 set Wednesday. But the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 24.54 to 2,582.00. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM almost single-handedly led the Dow higher after Merrill  
Lynch raised its prediction for how much the stock would rise over 
the next 12 months. That came after an analyst meeting Wednesday 
during which chairman Louis Gerstner said the Internet would play a 
large part in the company's future, and that a quarter of IBM's 
1998 revenues came from electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bull beat goes on, led by Big Blue,'' said Alfred E.  
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. IBM shares soared 20 1/2 to a record 246, accounting for a rise 
of more than 93 points on the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer shares rose initially with IBM but later bowed to  
profit-taking. Internet stocks were lower on profit-taking as well; 
America Online dropped 5 13/16 to 132 5/8 and was the most active 
issue on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow transportation average fell 30.99, or 0.82 percent, to  
3,752.51, after the Justice Department said it was investigating 
American Airlines for antitrust violations. The shares of 
American's parent, AMR Corp., dropped 5/16 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the market got a boost from a government report that  
wholesale inflation was in line with expectations. The Labor 
Department said the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in April 
as the price of gasoline jumped significantly. But the index's core 
rate, which strips away volatile food and energy costs, was up a 
mere 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said first-time claims for  
unemployment benefits held steady at a moderate 303,000 last week. 
A more reliable four-week moving average of jobless claims dropped 
by 4,000 to 304,250, suggesting that unemployment will remain at 
4.3 percent this month, near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report, the Commerce Department said retail sales  
rose 0.1 percent in April, as consumers reacted to higher energy 
costs by pulling in their purse strings. That was a smaller 
increase than many analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are now turning their attention to Friday's expected  
release of consumer price data. Taken together, the producer- and 
consumer-price data could give them clues about the Federal 
Reserve's policy meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates,  
though it might if it feels the need to slow the economy and head 
off inflation, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at 
Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``Most people think (central bankers) are more 
inclined to raise rates in August, after they get more indication 
of recovering global economies,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond --  
which moves in the opposite direction from price --falling to 5.75 
percent from 5.82 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks rose early in the day but then dropped  
back, with Citigroup down 1/2 at 73 7/16, and American Express down 
1 1/4 at 124 3/4. J.P. Morgan shares, however, rose 7 5/8 to 146 3/4 on 
takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidate volume totaled 975.2 
million shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.67 to 651.35, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.04 to 800.39. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.58 to 450.84. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo declined 0.57  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt eased 0.02 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 index in London climbed 1.79, following New York's 
lead, while the CAC in Paris rose 0.11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Writes Tell-All Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- In his new autobiography, Gov. Jesse  
``The Body'' Ventura brags about losing his virginity at 16 to win 
a bet, tells of visiting prostitutes in Nevada, admits he used 
marijuana and steroids and confides he doesn't wear underwear. 
</P>
<P>
	Published by Random House/Villard, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed:  
Re-working the Body Politic From the Bottom Up'' is available for 
purchase online and hits stores later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	For some lawmakers, the former pro wrestler's $19.95 tell-all is  
a tell-too-much. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Minnesotans didn't know Jesse Ventura when they elected  
him, they certainly do now. I guess that proves that ignorance is 
bliss,'' said state Sen. Roy Terwilliger, a Republican. ``Frankly, 
I miss the bliss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who shocked Minnesota's political establishment with  
his third-party upset victory last fall, confesses to everything 
from juvenile ``mischief'' -- stealing a ladder and throwing it 
through a school window -- to some serious adult carousing. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he and his high school friends had a bet over who would  
be first to lose his virginity. Ventura won on New Year's Eve, in 
his good friend Jerry Flatgard's bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``But don't worry, Jerry wasn't with me. We weren't that  
close!'' Ventura writes. 
</P>
<P>
	As he escorted the girl out of the house, he gave the thumbs-up  
to his buddies when she wasn't looking. ``And it was funny, but 
after that night I was never again with her. It was just one of 
those things,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is blunt, blustery and profane, like Ventura the man.  
He boasts that he was the first Minneapolis high school swimmer to 
break one minute in the 100-yard butterfly, and he declares: ``I 
was the greatest announcer wrestling's ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even his account of a visit to a Nevada bordello during his Navy  
days is a cause for self-congratulation. He tells of selling his 
belt made of machine-gun shell casings to a hooker in return for 
her services, plus $10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably one of the only people in the world who's gone  
into a Nevada ranch and been paid,'' he writes. ``I used that $10 
to go to another one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	(During the campaign, Ventura called prostitution a victimless  
crime and suggested that Minnesota consider legalizing it.) 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the first 38 pages of the 208-page volume are a recap of  
where he stands on such issues as urban sprawl and the role of 
government. As for his election, he says: ``The bottom line is that 
my opponents were boring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Navy SEAL describes his 17 months of duty in  
Southeast Asia late during the Vietnam War as more partying than 
fighting. He says he loved life in the Philippines, with lots of 
drinking, sex and indecent exposure during ``skivvy checks'' on bar 
tabletops. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy SEALs don't wear underwear, Ventura relates, and the skivvy  
checks were done to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	``To this day, I still honor that tradition most of the time,''  
he writes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura signed the book deal -- for ``mid-six figures'' -- a month  
after his election and dictated most of it into a tape recorder for 
a ghostwriter. He has said some of the proceeds will go toward 
teaching young Minnesotans about politics.

<HEADLINE> Money Wirers Settle Overcharge Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- MoneyGram and Western Union have agreed to  
provide discounts and pay a total of $2.3 million to settle claims 
the companies charged exorbitant fees to wire money from the United 
States to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement announced Wednesday by Western Union parent First  
Data Corp. and MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc. would end lawsuits 
filed in California, Illinois and Texas by predominately poor 
Hispanics who relied on the services to send money to family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $4 billion a year is sent to Mexico, and most who wire  
money use MoneyGram and Western Union. The companies were accused 
of using currency exchange rates far exceeding the prevailing daily 
rates without informing customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies admitted no liability but promised to offer  
discount coupons to customers who had wired money to Mexico since 
1987. The companies also announced plans to donate $2.3 million to 
Hispanic organizations in the United States and agreed to disclose 
currency exchange rates on company forms and in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois  
gave preliminary approval to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	California attorney Fred Kumetz, who has filed separate  
class-action lawsuits against the companies in state court, called 
the settlement a ``sweetheart deal'' and said he would fight it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a problem when a Chicago court ... imposes its will on  
a California lawsuit when California has eight times as many 
affected people and its own set of laws.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore To Hold Hackers' Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore, known for its tough laws against  
computer hackers, plans a worldwide hacking competition to raise 
awareness about computer security issues, a local news report said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers are invited to try their hand at breaking into a  
published set of computer addresses which have been protected by 
security programs designed to prevent unauthorized access, the 
Television Corporation of Singapore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer wizards who successfully break in -- and then identify  
themselves and explain how they did it -- will be given cash prizes 
of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners will be announced at the Infosecurity Asia exhibition  
and conference to be held in Singapore in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest aims to demonstrate hacking prevention methods,  
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore, a tightly controlled city-state known for its strict  
law enforcement, normally threatens hackers with massive fines and 
long jail sentences.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices closed lower today as market  
sentiment was hurt by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's 
announcement that he will resign. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 96.11 points,  
or 0.57 percent, ending the day at 16,851.25. On Wednesday, the 
average rose 204.18 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.58 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.72  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New 
York level of 120.95 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 120.87 
yen to 121.70 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market confidence was weighed down following U.S. Treasury  
Secretary Rubin's decision Wednesday to step down, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would nominate Deputy  
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to succeed Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also reacted negatively to reports Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin had dismissed the country's prime minister, Yevgeny 
Primakov, traders said. In addition, many players sat on the 
sidelines amid expectations for poor corporate earnings reports, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Japanese companies will release profit results later this  
month for the fiscal year ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	But today's declines were limited. Japanese officials reacted  
quickly to word of Rubin's departure, downplaying the possible 
impact on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said, ``I don't expect U.S.  
policy to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 9.18 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,351.97. The 
TOPIX closed up 5.33 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 579.44 million  
shares, down from 648.77 million shares Wednesday. Retreating 
issues outnumbered advancers 812 to 394, with 110 others closing 
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Tour Boat Mechanic Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- A mechanic testified Thursday that he  
replaced a seal on an amphibious tour boat about two hours before 
it sank in about a minute, drowning 13 tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Oliver, a mechanic for Land and Lake Tours Inc., said he  
worked on the drive shaft seal April 30 and May 1. The boat, the 
Miss Majestic, sank shortly after taking on water May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver's statement came before a U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety  
Board, which is investigating the sinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said he was not rushed and that there were two other  
boats available in case his work had not been completed. He was 
confident the seal was replaced properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat's operator testified this week that the boat's bilge  
pump kicked on two days before the fatal accident and that she took 
the vessel in for repairs. The National Transportation Safety Board 
said last week that the problem indicated a hole in the drive shaft 
seal. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said the seal was tight, but acknowledged under  
questioning that it might have been misaligned. When the boat was 
pulled from the water Sunday, there was a rip in an accordion-like 
seal at one end of the drive shaft cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver said Elizabeth Helmbrecht, the boat's operator, gave the  
vessel a visual inspection before selecting it to take 20 tourists 
on a tour of Hot Springs and Lake Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Helmbrecht and seven passengers survived the accident.

<HEADLINE>  Bombing Changes Chinese View of US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- In 1989, Chinese students enamored of democracy  
erected a Statue of Liberty look-alike in protests on Tiananmen 
Square. This week, as they laid siege to the U.S. Embassy, they 
screamed ``Down with the Yankees!'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many Chinese, respect for America evaporated with the NATO  
bombing of China's embassy in Yugoslavia. To the disenchanted, the 
attack left the feeling that American talk of human rights and 
liberty for all is empty rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through American films, we used to think of America as a just  
place,'' said one protester, an employee at an American-run 
Internet firm who gave his surname, Sun. ``Now, we are full of 
doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters burned the Stars and Stripes, yelled profanities  
against President Clinton, rained rocks on U.S. Embassy buildings 
and burned a U.S. consul's home in southwest China. Like the 
students who protested on Tiananmen Square, they marched in ranks 
proudly waving their school flags, wore headbands scrawled with 
slogans and were cheered on by bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, the student protests were aimed at the government. By  
contrast, during the four days of protests that erupted Saturday, 
protesters marched with government support. 
</P>
<P>
	Yan Xuetong, a scholar of international relations, said many  
Chinese believe the air campaign in Yugoslavia has exposed American 
double-standards: The United States is attacking Yugoslavia with 
missiles while seeking to prevent missile proliferation, and 
promoting human rights while causing civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost every issue makes people here feel America is so  
hypocritical. Look at what they are doing, it is totally opposite 
from what they are saying,'' said Yan of the China Institute for 
Contemporary International Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Necessity will likely force the U.S. and Chinese governments to  
mend fences. China wants American investment, technology and 
know-how to develop its economy and help provide badly needed jobs. 
The United States looks to China's cooperation in preventing the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology, and 
its help in reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	Both countries are economically tied, as well. The United States  
is China's second-largest trade partner, while China is the United 
States' fourth-largest. 
</P>
<P>
	But the emotional damage could take longer to repair. Even  
before the embassy bombing, America's image was tarnished for some 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	While many recognize that Americans are freer than they are to  
say and do what they want, they have been bombarded for years by 
communist propaganda that says the price of such freedoms is school 
shootings, crime, drugs and other social ills. The Clinton-Monica 
Lewinsky scandal also was widely reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions over Taiwan in 1995 and 1996, when the United States  
dispatched aircraft carriers to waters off the island China claims 
as its own, also raised nationalist hackles and made some Chinese 
suspicious of Washington. Others already resented U.S. concerns 
over Tibet and China's human rights record as unwarranted meddling. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy bombing brought such emotions to a head. China's  
government supported protests because it had to. Public anger could 
have turned inward, against police, had they enforced their usual 
ban on demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	But by giving protesters the green light and by fanning their  
anger with slanted state media reports, the government may also 
have wanted to distract people from domestic problems: 
unemployment, corruption and the crushing of the Tiananmen Square 
demonstrations 10 years ago on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing and nationally broadcast TV images of relatives  
grieving over the cremated remains of three Chinese reporters 
killed in the attack has also given the government ammunition 
against critics of its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, the U.S. and other Western powers have been  
lecturing us on human rights and other issues,'' reporter Xiong Lei 
wrote in the official China Daily newspaper. ``But the NATO bombing 
has smashed the rosy picture that the U.S. is a guardian of human 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China's state-controlled media helped direct anger toward the  
United States by referring to the NATO campaign as ``U.S.-led,'' by 
ignoring U.S. apologies for the embassy attack for three days and 
by dismissing NATO explanations that it was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The media's strident criticism of the United States was  
``primarily responsible for the very negative feelings that many 
Chinese students are exhibiting,'' U.S. Ambassador James Sasser 
said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The image of China in the United States has probably been  
diminished somewhat by their reaction,'' he said. ``Clearly the 
image of the United States has been diminished as a result of it 
here in China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Protesting students have called for boycotts of American  
products. A poster at People's University in Beijing listed 
domestic brands that could serve as substitutes for Nike sports 
gear and Levis jeans. ``Patriots, don't drink Coca Cola,'' read 
another. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all protesters were one-sided in their criticism. Some said  
China needs U.S. investment and technology to help modernize its 
economy. A Nike employee who came to see the protests worried he 
might lose his job if U.S.-China ties continued to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hate the Clinton government, but we still welcome Americans  
to come to Beijing to visit and invest,'' said Li Jingbo, a 
student. ``We're against the American government, not the people.''

attacks on Yugoslavia and other programs that House-Senate 
bargainers agreed to Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
	--Defense: $11.8 billion for the Yugoslavia attacks, caring for  
refugees and other military programs. This includes $6 billion

<HEADLINE> SEC Targets Internet Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have charged 18 people and  
eight companies with using the Internet to sell bogus securities, 
extending their crackdown on investment fraud in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Securities and Exchange Commission's third nationwide  
``sweep'' against online investment scams, which have cost ordinary 
investors millions of dollars in recent years. The agency announced 
the action Wednesday, alleging that 14 separate schemes deceived 
investors in this country and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the investors lost around $2.25 million, the SEC said.  
</P>
<P>
	The allegedly fraudulent investments included interests in gold  
mines, computer software, prefabricated hospitals in Turkey and a 
product described as a new way of processing gold. Eight of the 
cases involved the sale of so-called ``prime bank'' notes -- 
nonexistent securities promoted as providing guaranteed high rates 
of return. The names of well known U.S. or foreign banks are 
sometimes fraudulently added to the securities' names to bolster 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency made the allegations in eight civil  
lawsuits and six administrative actions. All 14 cases involved 
people allegedly selling or marketing phony securities using the 
World Wide Web and making ``outrageous'' promises to investors, 
such as annual returns exceeding 100 percent or even 2000 percent 
of an initial investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also charged several individuals with acting as  
unregistered brokers and selling unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In some of the cases, the agency said its 200-member Internet  
surveillance team discovered the questionable offerings before any 
securities were sold, preventing any potential investors from 
losing money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is in many respects a pre-emptive strike,'' SEC  
Enforcement Director Richard Walker told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, however, it was too late.  
</P>
<P>
	In one scam, a Dutch man, an Indiana man and a Missouri woman  
allegedly bilked thousands of people out of at least $1.25 million 
in seven schemes that promised investors risk-free returns of up to 
400 percent a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Smith, director of the SEC's Office of Investor Education  
and Assistance, said, ``People spend more time choosing a computer 
than they spend researching Internet investments. Investors can 
take their own pre-emptive strikes against Internet fraud simply by 
checking out investments before they buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC was seeking civil fines and court orders against the  
investment promoters and companies, compelling them to refrain from 
the allegedly fraudulent activity. In two of the cases, federal 
judges have granted temporary restraining orders against the 
promoters and companies. One of the cases was settled, with the 
person charged neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were seemingly mild, but the regulators' options are  
limited. They do not have legal authority to shut down investment 
promoters' Web sites, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The civil enforcement actions were brought by SEC's headquarters  
in Washington and by its offices in Atlanta; Boston; Denver; Fort 
Worth, Texas; New York; Philadelphia and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The actions were the latest moves in a nationwide crackdown  
against investment fraud in cyberspace started by the SEC last 
October. In ``sweeps'' in October and February, the agency targeted 
people promoting legitimate stocks over the Internet who don't 
disclose they are paid to do so by the companies. Such stock 
promotions are known as ``touting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of a Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee, recently proposed increasing the SEC's budget, now at 
$337.4 million, by $5.5 million next year to fight investment fraud 
over the Internet. That would bring the agency's funding to the 
level requested by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cops won't catch every crook in cyberspace, so investors  
need to watch out for themselves,'' said Peter Hildreth, president 
of the North American Securities Administrators Association, which 
represents state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regulators will not allow con artists and charlatans to hijack  
... (the Internet) and turn it into the electronic equivalent of a 
restroom wall,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE: The SEC advises investors to read its guide  
titled ``Internet Fraud: How to Avoid Internet Investment Scams'' 
before buying any investment promoted on the Internet. The 
publication is available on the investor assistance and complaints 
link of the agency's Web site at http://www.sec.gov. It also is available 
by calling 1-800-SEC-0330. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also are urged to report suspicious investment  
offerings to enforcement@sec.gov or to use the Enforcement 
Complaint Center at http://www.sec.gov/enforce/comctr.htm.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Declared for Ex-Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The trial of a former judge accused of  
donning a mask and pistol-whipping a political rival outside a law 
office ended in a mistrial Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Luther C. Edmonds was accused of attacking William P. Robinson  
Jr., a member of the state House of Delegates, outside Robinson's 
law office in 1997. Robinson's masked attacker bashed his face with 
a gun, forcing him to get 30 stitches on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds and Robinson were once friends and political allies.  
They parted ways when Robinson publicly disputed the reason Edmonds 
gave for resigning from the bench during a misconduct inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, a judge for eight years, also is running against  
Robinson in a June Democratic primary for Robinson's House seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution said it will retry the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds was charged with malicious wounding, use of a gun in a  
felony and the unlawful wearing of a mask. He could have faced 28 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said DNA tests showed blood on a gun seized from  
Edmonds' apartment matched Robinson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys said at least 18 people had access to the  
police locker where the gun and blood sample were kept. Jurors 
deliberated 10 hours before the mistrial was declared.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most prices charged by factories, farmers and  
other producers remained tame in April, but soaring energy prices -- 
including a record jump for gasoline -- may be starting to affect 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Producer Price Index for finished goods rose  
0.5 percent in April, the Labor Department said Thursday. That 
followed a smaller 0.2 percent increase in March and brought the 
annual rate of inflation in prices wholesalers pay to 1.1 percent 
so far in 1999, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for all of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The April rise was largely due to a 5.1 percent jump in energy  
prices -- the largest in nearly nine years -- which economists had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	After global economic turmoil pulled energy prices down sharply  
last year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed 
this spring to limit production. Analysts said military fuel 
demands for the conflict in Yugoslavia also may be tightening 
energy markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices posted the largest price gain, an unparalleled  
29.1 percent, breaking the record set in January 1990 during the 
Persian Gulf crisis. Fuel oil prices rose 14.3 percent, the most in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices paid by wholesalers for many other products,  
including food, computers and children's clothing dropped in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding gasoline prices, which are frequently volatile, the  
report ``indicates continued price stability for the U.S. 
economy,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving out food and energy, core producer prices -- which  
economists watch most closely -- climbed a mild 0.1 percent in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors, sensitive that signs of inflation could  
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, chose to focus 
on that positive aspect of the report. The Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks closed up 107 points on Thursday at 11,107. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe the spike in energy prices is likely to  
be temporary, but warn it could lead to more widespread, mild 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil is a very pervasive commodity, I would expect to see  
(higher prices) work their way a little through the rest of the 
economy,'' said economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates in 
Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may already feel pinched.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce Department said  
retail sales rose a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in April to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $239.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A 0.3 percent drop in demand for durable goods -- big-ticket  
items expected to last three or more years -- was led by an 0.8 
percent decline in sales at auto dealers, which analysts attributed 
mainly to the end of new year's discounts. Sales of nondurables, 
such as food and fuel, rose 0.4 percent, however, and excluding the 
jumpy autos category, overall retail sales also climbed 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with April last year, sales were up 7.5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals driving consumer spending remain positive,''  
said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. ``However, 
higher gasoline prices have put a crimp in consumers' 
pocketbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report released Thursday, the Labor Department said  
first-time claims for unemployment benefits held steady at a 
moderate 303,000 last week. A more reliable four-week moving 
average of jobless claims dropped by 4,000 to 304,250. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggests little change ahead in the nation's unemployment  
rate, which edged up to 4.3 percent in April but remains near a 
29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists worry that inflation could become a danger if  
Americans, feeling secure in their jobs, continue to spend briskly, 
and price-containing pressures caused by recent low demand for U.S. 
products overseas begin to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, competition from low-priced imports flooding  
into the United States from economically distressed countries is 
keeping most prices here low. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, for example, the cost of computers fell 3.9 percent,  
the price of children's clothing fell 0.8 percent and the price of 
home electronic equipment fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of passenger cars and light trucks rose 0.2 percent  
and 0.3 percent -- another effect of expiring sales incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs fell 0.9 percent in April. Fish prices dropped 7.1  
percent, the most in five years, after rising sharply in March. 
Dairy, egg and pork prices also fell, offsetting increases for 
fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	At the earliest stages of production, prices rose 0.6 percent  
for intermediate goods and 1.3 percent for crude goods, including 
petroleum. An example of the three stages of production is bread 
for finished, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Bill Nears Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate bargainers moved toward a  
compromise Thursday on a package financing the bombardment of 
Yugoslavia, aid to Central America and other programs after dealing 
a setback to Sen. Robert Byrd's loan program for ailing steel 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators from the two chambers were hoping to shake hands on  
a deal, then speed it through Congress and send it to President 
Clinton for his signature Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation contains $11.7 billion for the air campaign in  
the Balkans, the Kosovo's refugees and a general military buildup -- 
twice Clinton's spending request -- plus other items that have 
driven the total price tag toward $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton expressed optimism that progress was being made, despite  
White House veto threats over the amount of defense spending, 
planned domestic cuts, and other provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some effort to trim down the bill some and get it in  
a position where I can sign it, and I hope it will be done 
quickly,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also contains nearly $1 billion to help Central  
American countries rebuild from last fall's Hurricane Mitch, plus 
$566 million to aid U.S. farmers harmed by low commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., two  
House Republicans reversed themselves Thursday, as House 
negotiators voted 12-11 to reject the steel language by Byrd, 
D-W.Va. The provision was one of the few unresolved matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's proposal faced an uncertain fate when the House and  
Senate consider the compromise, overall bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bargainers had voted 13-10 early Thursday to accept  
the steel provision, infuriating conservatives by adding to the 
bill's cost and jeopardizing passage of the overall measure. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Hastert, Reps. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, and Joe  
Skeen, R-N.M., switched and voted against Byrd when the issue was 
reconsidered in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some discussions,'' Regula said of his meeting with  
Hastert. ``That's his role as leader, which is perfectly 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, approved last month by the Senate, would provide  
$140 million to back $1 billion in loan guarantees for 
moderate-sized steel companies hurt by imports. Among them would be 
the Weirton Steel Corp. of Weirton, W.Va., which would be another 
victory for the 81-year-old Byrd, considered the Senate's 
craftiest, fiercest champion of home-state projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd was promised that a steel loan program would be voted on  
separately by the House. But that did not satisfy him because while 
the Kosovo measure is certain to reach Clinton's desk, a separate 
measure might never get there. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see here is a steamroller,'' he said of the vote  
against him, adding that he would keep fighting for his provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Also promising to continue battling was Sen. Pete Domenici,  
R-N.M., who saw his Senate-approved $500 million loan program for 
oil and gas companies rejected by House bargainers early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, a 40-year Senate veteran, also faced pressure from Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. Lott said he would keep the 
bill from the Senate floor until the steel provision was gone and 
the bill slimmed down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hard-headedness and caginess don't get you much if you don't  
have a bill to deal with,'' Lott said of Byrd. ``This bill is too 
big, too many riders. Back off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining in the bill was a Senate-approved provision providing  
up to $4.3 million to pay reparations for Japanese people interned 
during World War II, including some from Latin America who were 
placed in U.S. detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders were considering reducing the $900 million the  
compromise would provide added funding for the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency following the tornadoes that hit Oklahoma and 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the package was to be paid for from this year's expected  
$111 billion federal surplus. But Republicans were insisting on 
paying for about $1.6 billion of it by cutting domestic programs, 
mostly money for food stamps that they said was not going to be 
spent. Public housing and foreign aid would also be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said they were near  
a deal aimed at easing Clinton's objections to a provision 
forbidding the federal government from taking any of the $246 
billion states have won in a pact with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the bill would say the states should -- but not must --  
use portions of the money for anti-smoking and health programs, 
which is how the administration wants the money used.

<HEADLINE> Flu Season Was Deadlier Than Usual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The U.S. flu season was apparently deadlier than  
usual this year, the government reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu season runs from October through mid-May. The Centers  
for Disease Control and Prevention does not know yet how many 
people died this season from the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in an average flu season, there are about 20,000  
deaths, and about 30,000 when the Type A-H3N2 virus hits -- as it 
did this year, the CDC said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadliest flu season in the past decade was 1989-90, when  
about 44,000 people died. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the flu season got off to a slow start, with few  
cases until mid-January. By February, the flu was widespread in 40 
states. The outbreaks had tapered off by mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain most prevalent was Type A Sydney.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Campaign Tactics Helping Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- James Carville is exhausted but  
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	His candidate, Ehud Barak, is ahead by 10 points and looks like  
a winner. Five months ago, the U.S. campaign strategist couldn't 
find anyone who thought the sincere, but uncharismatic Labor Party 
leader had a chance to defeat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Kicking his feet up onto a coffee table and leaning back in a  
lounge chair, the Louisiana native who helped get President Clinton 
elected smiles with satisfaction at the suggestion that American 
campaign techniques -- simple slogans, endless repetition, 
up-to-the-minute polling of voter whims -- travel well. 
</P>
<P>
	As Israel's '99 campaign heads into its final weekend before  
Monday's vote, American money and methods are reshaping Israeli 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident who heads a  
Russian immigrants party, has an American pollster. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu, whose reputation as a media king has been shaken in  
this contest, also has an American adviser -- strategist Arthur 
Finkelstein, who has helped Republican politicians get elected. 
</P>
<P>
	During Netanyahu's 1996 campaign, Finkelstein peppered campaign  
ads with shocking images of terror attacks and painted Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat as the main beneficiary of the peace process 
in order to portray Netanyahu as tougher than Labor on security. 
</P>
<P>
	That assault crippled the opposition.  
</P>
<P>
	Three years later, Labor went American, hiring Carville,  
Washington pollster Stanley Greenberg and media specialist Robert 
Shrum. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took the loss of the 1996 election for (Labor) to  
understand they needed to change their way of thinking,'' Carville 
said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He has so successfully introduced his famous one-liner from the  
1992 Clinton campaign -- ``It's the economy, stupid'' -- that 
security, once the No. 1 issue in Israel, has virtually vanished 
from discourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville has turned Barak's image from that of a slow-talking,  
TV turnoff into a leader tough on everything from peace to 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, the turnaround in five months,'' Carville said.  
``When I came here on the 14th of December, I couldn't find anybody 
who thought Barak had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Netanyahu has suffered an erosion of support  
from among some of his Likud Party's key constituents, especially 
ex-Soviet Jews and Jews of Middle Eastern origin disgruntled over 
rising unemployment, recession and the faltering peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their successes, the American strategists have often  
found themselves in unfamiliar territory. ``It's hard for an 
outsider to understand how intense it is here and how quickly 
things happen,'' Carville said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Ron Dermer, a pollster from Miami Beach who runs the  
campaign for Sharansky's Israel B'Aliya, language is a barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to learn certain things and get used to translators  
for everything,'' he said, noting that all his polls are composed 
in English, conducted in Russian, the primary language of many of 
Sharansky supporters, and then translated back into English so he 
can analyze the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think we bring a different approach to the elections  
here, and Israel seems ready for that,'' Dermer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	Shmuel Sandler, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University,  
said the outsiders shouldn't interfere. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to go with your gut and understand your nation. For a  
foreigner that's hard. He can give advice on television but not on 
how our lives should be,'' Sandler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's campaigns have been gradually transformed in the past  
decade, with the arrival of commercial TV. Candidates have mastered 
the 10-second soundbite and are comfortable with makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	With the arrival of the high-priced American talent, party  
activists have gradually found their roles diminished in the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates, meanwhile, have learned to make the rounds at  
the homes of wealthy U.S. Jews in search of financing. Netanyahu, 
Barak and Centrist Party candidate Yitzhak Mordechai have all gone 
on U.S. fund-raising trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Israeli law, it's illegal to accept contributions from  
foreigners. But that hasn't stopped the money from rolling in from 
Hollywood, New York and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is ample evidence that wealthy American Jews circumvent  
election laws by funneling money to organizations which benefit 
candidates running for prime minister,'' said David Makovsky, an 
Israeli journalist who investigated campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
	American Jews have been at odds over whether they should be  
involved in Israeli politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Jewish Congress, a U.S. lobbying group, opposes the  
idea. Members of the Reform and Conservative Judaism movements have 
urged their members to support candidates who will advance the 
rights of liberal Judaism in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Israeli expatriates living in the United States are  
flying home for Monday's vote and an estimated 75,000 American 
immigrants living in Israel have the right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has been deafeningly  
silent, in contrast to its warm embrace of Labor's Shimon Peres in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they realized after 1996 what a boomerang effect this  
could have. Israelis don't like to see foreigners taking sides,'' 
Sandler said.

<HEADLINE> Dishman Joins the Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Vowing to prove he's still one of the  
NFL's top defensive backs, Cris Dishman has joined the Kansas City 
Chiefs, a team badly in need of a cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old former Pro Bowler signed a three-year deal and  
will replace former Pro Bowl cornerback Dale Carter, who signed a 
free agent deal with Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got something to prove,'' Dishman said. ``I'm going to  
show everybody I'm the same player I was two years ago and before 
that. The Chiefs were 13-3 two years ago and slipped a little (7-9) 
last year. I think they can get back to where they were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Redskins released Dishman last month, partly to  
save on his $2.7 million salary and partly because he had the worst 
season of his 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dishman impressed the Chiefs with a strong workout. He made  
the Pro Bowl as recently as 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cris Dishman is the veteran cornerback that completes our  
search in the free agency market,'' Chiefs president Carl Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Dishman becomes the Chiefs' other starting corner, they will  
have plenty of experience at that position. The other starter, 
James Hasty, also is 33. Dishman will compete with Carlton Gray for 
the starting job. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our returning cornerbacks, plus Carlton Gray and now Cris  
Dishman, I feel very good about this very important position on our 
team,'' Peterson said. ``We have a good combination of youth and 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dishman spent nine seasons with the Oilers and two with the  
Redskins, making 140 starts in 172 career regular-season games. He 
has 37 interceptions and 17 forced fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked out with a personal trainer in San Diego for 1 1/2 months  
earlier this year in order to get into peak physical shape, and 
said he would go back in June to finish the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teams are going to test me because they think I've lost it,''  
Dishman said. ``I'll have to show a lot of people I haven't lost 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Rubin: A Wall Street Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Robert Rubin spent much of his life  
speculating what the stock market would do. He was good at it and 
made $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to Washington, Rubin did essentially the same  
thing, speculating that if President Clinton would balance the 
budget, he would be rewarded with a booming economy. 
</P>
<P>
	To the surprise of many, that argument caught Clinton's ear.  
</P>
<P>
	And in the six years since, first as a top economic adviser and  
since 1995 as the Treasury secretary, Rubin has gained much credit 
-- in a close partnership with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan -- for the policies of spending restraint that kept 
interest rates low, Wall Street booming and many Americans raking 
in money. That prosperity, in turn, helped smooth Clinton's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Americans wouldn't recognize the slight, silver-haired man  
in his investment banker pinstripes. But Clinton, many Republicans 
and especially Wall Street have always given Rubin considerable 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of  
the Clinton-Gore administration in check,'' said House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, as Clinton put it as he announced Rubin's departure  
Wednesday, ``Everybody always believed that as long as he was 
secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, for years reporters and Wall Street brokers joked how  
the market might sink the day Rubin finally left. He had long 
``pined for private life,'' Clinton noted. The secretary's wife, 
Judith, never moved to Washington, and Rubin, 60, stayed in a hotel 
near the White House, flying home to New York City every weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The market did indeed drop more than 200 points on Wednesday  
morning but quickly recovered, largely perhaps because Greenspan, 
73, still has another year as Federal Reserve chairman and may seek 
another four-year term after that. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Rubin has spent much of the past year grooming his  
deputy, former Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, sending him to 
Capitol Hill and around the world when Asia's economy crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Rubin's close relationship with Greenspan that  
mattered most. Rubin set an early and ironclad rule that no one in 
the Clinton administration could publicly criticize the Fed 
chairman. As Greenspan and the Fed pursued policies that led to low 
inflation, even Republicans were pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leaving Greenspan alone -- they do get credit for that,'' said  
GOP presidential hopeful Steve Forbes, who otherwise bitterly 
criticized Rubin and Summers' handling of the Asian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans did fight with Rubin over the 1997 government  
shutdown and his handling of the Asian crisis. But most considered 
him ``a strong and sometimes solitary voice within the Clinton 
administration for open markets and fiscal discipline,'' said House 
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also frustrated some Democrats, especially early on, when  
Labor Secretary Robert Reich and others complained the 
administration too heavily favored business. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the  
House Ways and Means Committee, said Rubin often repaired frayed 
ties on Capitol Hill when Clinton appeared to bypass Democrats and 
negotiate directly with the GOP on taxes or welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God during all these times we knew we had someone we  
could depend on,'' Rangel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin also pushed often for more private investment in inner  
city neighborhoods, another position Clinton embraced. Yet that 
work never gained him the attention that the economy's boom did. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what he will do when he returns to private life. He  
is viewed as a possible candidate for the Fed chairmanship if 
Greenspan should retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who has two grown sons, put his own millions in a blind  
trust and became a retired partner at Goldman, Sachs during his 
government years. He entered an arrangement where he could neither 
profit nor suffer from the firm's performance, Treasury officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Goldman went public, selling millions of shares in an  
initial public offering that gained $3.66 billion, the 
second-largest in history. Some senior and retired partners made 
millions. Rubin, under his arrangement, missed out.

<HEADLINE> Texas Bank Uses Eye Scan To Get Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- If you can't tell identical twins Michael and  
Richard Swartz apart, do what Bank United of Texas does -- look them 
in the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Bank United became the first in the United States  
to offer iris recognition technology at automatic teller machines, 
providing the Swartzes and other customers a cardless, 
password-free way to get their money out of an ATM. 
</P>
<P>
	``It knows you just by looking at you,'' says Ron Coben, Bank  
United's executive vice-president. ``There's no card to show, 
there's no fingers to ink, no customer inconvenience or discomfort. 
It's just a photograph of a Bank United customer's eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works. A customer has a close-up photo of his eye  
taken at the bank, and the picture is stored in a computer. When 
the customer goes up to the ATM to take out money, he presses a 
button to start an eye scan. The ATM then matches the picture of 
the iris with the one stored in the bank's database to confirm the 
customer's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate, Richard Swartz, a 25-year-old Rice University  
graduate student, had his iris photographed by a bank employee. 
Minutes later, Swartz was able to withdraw $40 out of his account, 
without inserting a card or punching in a secret identification 
code. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Swartz's brother Michael walked up to the machine. But  
since his iris didn't match his brother's, the ATM refused to give 
him access. 
</P>
<P>
	Iris identification -- already used by at 11 banks outside the  
United States -- is expected to eliminate the use of cards and 
passwords, not only at the cash machine but eventually in many 
other kinds of financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	The iris recognition and software process was invented a few  
years ago by Dr. John Daughman, of Cambridge University in England. 
It's marketed in this country to financial institutions by Sensar 
Inc., of Moorestown, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank customers at three locations in Fort Worth, Houston and  
Dallas, can have their iris photographed electronically at the 
bank. Bank United hopes to have more eye-scanning ATMs up and 
running within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The iris is the best part of the eye to use as a identifier  
because there are no known diseases of the iris and eye surgery is 
not performed on the iris, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank United's iris project is the result of a partnership with  
Sensar, which holds a license to the technology from IriScan of 
Marlton, N.J., and ATM-maker Diebold Inc., which unveiled their 
first teller machine in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event clearly establishes iris identification as the  
emerging standard in personal electronic identfication,'' said 
Robert Van Naarden, Sensar's vice president of marketing and 
customer service. ``Iris identification is the most secure, robust 
and stable form of identification known to man. It is far safer, 
faster, more secure and accurate than DNA testing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several other banks throughout the United States are expected to  
unveil iris identification teller machines later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions about privacy concerns, Bank United  
officials said the iris pictures would not be distributed to anyone 
outside the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial analysts consider the system a better way to bank.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a better security system,'' said Ted Julian, an analyst  
who covers the industry for Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester 
Research. ``You not only have to know something, but you have to 
have something, some physical credential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a lot of sense,'' adds Jackie Fenn, analyst for  
Gartner Group of Stamford, Conn. ``Iris recognition is probably the 
most accurate at this point... there's nothing beaming into your 
eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the techno-junkie, there's another attractive attribute.  
</P>
<P>
	``It has a very high cool factor,'' says Coben. ``We think of it  
as James Bond meets stocks and bonds.''

<HEADLINE> Brown &AMP; Williamson Wins Court Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal jury handed the tobacco  
industry its second victory in four days Thursday, deciding Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. was not at fault in the case of a man who 
died of lung cancer in 1995 after smoking Kools. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Steele's family had sued for $26 million, claiming the  
nation's third-largest tobacco company sold him an unreasonably 
dangerous product. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Gary White said Steele ``was quite aware of the  
dangers, but the pleasures outweighed the dangers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a jury in Memphis, Tenn., cleared B&AMP;W and two other  
tobacco companies of liability in the deaths of three smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal, while the $51.5 million award in California was halved by a 
judge. Lawyers are preparing an appeal of the Oregon verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Missouri case, B&AMP;W argued that Steele never tried to quit  
smoking and that he was exposed to a host of cancer-causing 
chemicals through jobs at an aluminum foundry and at a brick-making 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict ``reflects recognition by the jury that Brown &AMP;  
Williamson acted responsibly in the processes of researching, 
testing and designing our products,'' said B&AMP;W attorney Steven 
McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury's conclusions are consistent with the majority of  
court decisions, agreeing that smoking is a matter of personal 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, J. Michael Cronan, said there will be no  
appeal.

<HEADLINE> San Miguel, Marubeni Mull Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine food and beverage giant  
San Miguel Corp. said Thursday it has started talks with the major 
Japanese trading company Marubeni Corp. to explore possible joint 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement to the stock exchange, San Miguel said the talks  
began on May 6 but that no agreement had yet been reached with 
Marubeni ``on any specific area of collaboration or joint 
venture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Miguel last year raised more than $1 billion from the sale  
of its investments in Coca-Cola Beverages and Nestle Philippines 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	San Miguel chairman Eduardo Cojuangco said the company will use  
the proceeds from the sale to pay some debts and to reinvest in San 
Miguel's core businesses -- food, packaging and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	San Miguel has breweries in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and  
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Sponsor: Public Wary on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A survey for Olympics sponsor John Hancock  
concluded that public confidence in the sponsors dropped 
dramatically since the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phooey,'' responded Salt Lake Olympics chief Mitt Romney.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hancock survey of 500 people found 20 percent ``have now  
lost faith in not only the Olympics but in the companies that 
sponsor the Olympics and their products,'' company President David 
D'Alessandro said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, meanwhile, cited surveys made for the U.S. Olympic  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the 1,000 respondents consistently have said  
their feelings for Olympic sponsors have not changed, and 11 
percent said they were even more supportive of sponsors. The 
Hancock survey found only 3 percent to 4 percent said they were 
more likely to buy an Olympic sponsor's product. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case of dueling polls,'' Romney said. ``And in my  
view the duel was decided when General Motors voted with their 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, General Motors Corp. said it wasn't letting the  
scandal stand in the way of its $1 billion Olympics marketing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said the figure in the Hancock poll indicating only  
3 percent to 4 percent were more likely to buy a sponsor's product 
was down dramatically from surveys taken after the 1998 Nagano 
Games. Those surveys found 30 percent were more likely to buy a 
company's products because of its Olympic association. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put $40 million into this type of venture, you don't  
expect it to go the other way on you. You're spending money to club 
yourself over the head,'' D'Alessandro said. John Hancock paid $40 
million for a Sydney sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, who recently announced he was resigning as USOC's  
marketing chief, said D'Alessandro ``exaggerated some very narrowly 
focused data that he and only he is privy to. It's inaccurate, and 
it's done to further his position, which has been to chill the 
Olympic sponsorship market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why D'Alessandro would purposely devalue a cause his  
company supports -- Krimsky told The Salt Lake Tribune, ``To get his 
name back on the front page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro has removed the Olympic symbols from company  
stationery, billboards and its annual report. John Hancock also 
canceled negotiations for $20 million in Olympic television ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney predicted the company's attitude would thaw in the coming  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``My bet is he will end up supporting the athletes and the Salt  
Lake Games when all this is over,'' Romney said. ``He has a beef 
with the IOC, not with Salt Lake and not with the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Fighting for Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans rejected $5.3 billion in emergency  
aid for farmers, but farm state Democrats say they'll continue 
their efforts on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., tried to  
get the money included in a supplemental spending bill being worked 
out by House and Senate budget negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	But when put to a vote, the farm aid proposal, which started as  
a $4.3 billion deal but increased as lawmakers added riders, got a 
14-14 tie vote. One Republican, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., voted 
with all the Democrats in favor of the package. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the committee agreed to $566 million for farmers, which  
includes money to replenish the shrinking coffers that supply farm 
loans. The proposal will still have to get past both floors of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said Thursday the money isn't nearly enough,  
particularly when budget planners agreed to $11.6 billion for the 
air assault on Yugoslavia and to boost defense spending. President 
Clinton had only requested $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is telling farmers ``you better get down and paint your  
tractors in camouflage,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. ``What does 
it take to get the attention of the Republican leadership around 
here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For them, on defense, the sky is the limit,'' said Dorgan.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the agreement helped farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are grandstanding,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran,  
R-Miss., chairman of the Agriculture Committee's appropriations 
panel, adding that the GOP leaders are open to passing more money 
later this year if the administration requests it. ``We gave the 
administration everything they asked for and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selma Sierra, spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., said  
Clinton's request to replenish the farm loan funds was $152 
million, so Republicans increased it fivefold. ``If they think we 
don't care about farmers, then Democrats must be heartless,'' 
Sierra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year passed a $6 billion emergency package for  
farmers as prices plummeted. With low prices expected to continue 
much of this year, many lawmakers have pushed for early emergency 
funds to ease the pain.

<HEADLINE> Sony, Nintendo Sleeping Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With Sega's latest foray into the $6 billion  
video game market on display at the industry's annual gathering 
attracting hordes of eager gamers, you might think rivals Sony and 
Nintendo are looking nervously over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even close, according to representatives for both companies  
at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nintendo stole a bit of Sega's thunder earlier this week,  
announcing a deal with IBM and Matsushita to create the technology 
for its next generation console, a 128-bit device currently 
code-named Dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, industry leader Sony announced it would begin selling  
the so-called PlayStation II, a DVD-based system which is 
comparable to the Dolphin's computing muscle and twice as powerful 
as Nintendo's current model, the cartridge-based N64. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sony has one huge advantage over its rivals -- all the  
current PlayStation games work fine on the new machine. 
</P>
<P>
	Both products should reach the market late next year, and both  
use DVD technology as a software medium. ``There won't be any 
significant difference in graphics quality,'' said Howard C. 
Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America Inc. ``The fight will be 
over who can make the best games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prices have not been announced for either machine. The Dreamcast  
debuts in September for a suggested retail price of $199.99. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the PlayStation and N64 currently retail for $129.99, with  
Sony on top mainly because it has far more games available than 
Nintendo. Sony charges about $10 a game as a licensing fee, about 
half Nintendo's rate, which attracts developers. Also attractive is 
PlayStation's CD format, easier to work with than the cartridge 
Nintendo uses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony, which controls about 60 percent of the U.S. market to 30  
percent for Nintendo and about 5 percent for Sega, has few 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``''Industry experts are not generally supporting Dreamcast.''  
said Sony vice president Phil Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to Sega's vast display, featuring dozens of hands-on  
Dreamcast players, gave mixed reviews.

	``It's OK,'' said Joel Goodman of San Diego, as he tried to  
avoid extermination while playing ``House of the Dead 2.'' ``It's 
got high resolution, but I don't know how it will do against 
PlayStation II.'' Goodman said he would rent the machine before 
deciding if he wanted to purchase one. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Magat, 19, of Gardena, was much more positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great system,'' he said as he pounded on a friend in a  
Dreamcast version of Virtua Fighter. ``It's like getting arcade 
games at home. I have two ordered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the real question is: How does Sega, whose PlayStation  
rival Saturn sank like a stone, plan to compete with its bigger, 
already-entrenched rivals? 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the first on the market, giving it time to gain  
valuable market share. It will also be the first Internet-ready 
home console, allowing gamers to go online, play against others a 
continent away and even send e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Electronic Gaming Monthly editor John Davison thinks  
Sony, with a PlayStation in one of every five American homes, will 
remain the boss after all the latest systems are in stores. ``As 
long as Sony prices PSII carefully, they will clean up.''

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Trees Thrive on CO2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a study measuring the effect of a major  
greenhouse gas, researchers have found that trees exposed to 
increased carbon dioxide grow 25 percent faster than those without 
the extra CO2. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers enriched the carbon dioxide atmosphere in  
100-foot-wide plots of pine trees near Duke University in North 
Carolina to determine how the plants would respond to an increase 
in the atmospheric gas. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least the first two years of the experiment, the trees  
have thrived and grown more vigorously than did nearby trees 
without the added carbon dioxide, said Evan H. DeLucia, the first 
author of study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither DeLucia of the University of Illinois at Urbana and  
William Schlesinger of Duke, principal investigators in the study, 
expect the enhanced growth of the trees to continue in later years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This probably will abate with time,'' said DeLucia. He said  
that earlier studies of trees naturally exposed to high carbon 
dioxide show that a growth spurt from the added gas goes away after 
a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen. Much of the  
carbon from the C02 is incorporated into branches, roots and trunk 
of the plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide is returned to the atmosphere when the plant  
parts decay or are burned. Burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and 
coal, also add CO2 to the atmosphere. Some scientists believe that 
increased fuel use will cause global carbon dioxide levels to 
increase by 35 percent to 50 percent by the year 2050. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased carbon dioxide may have warm the whole Earth, some  
scientists believe, because the gas blocks heat from returning to 
space and traps it about the planet. The gas acts like the glass in 
a greenhouse, letting sunlight in, but preventing the escape of 
heat. This is known as the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLucia said the pine tree experiment was an attempt to  
determine how forests might react to the expected CO2 increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In three test plots, pipes steadily pumped in carbon dioxide,  
keeping the gas level among the trees at 560 parts per million. 
Atmosphere levels at nearby control plots of trees remained at 
about 360 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees in the test plots grew at a rate 16 percent faster in the  
first year and 25 percent faster in the second year when compared 
with pines that had only the normal atmospheric carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	These results, said DeLucia, suggest that global forests might  
absorb about half of the forecast increase in carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trees alone are not going to solve this problem for us,'' said  
DeLucia.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic on Kosovo Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton expressed optimism today  
about legislation that would give him nearly twice the money he 
wants for the bombardment of Yugoslavia, even as the package has 
become a hodgepodge of provisions dealing with tobacco, steel and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers from the two chambers expected to meet again today  
amid fading hopes of striking a compromise bill, whipping it 
through Congress and shipping it to Clinton for his signature by 
week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But before they did, the president bypassed a chance to  
criticize the package. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some effort to trim down the bill some and get it in  
a position where I can sign it, and I hope it will be done 
quickly,'' Clinton told reporters. ``I'm, frankly, pretty 
encouraged this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers agreed to spend $11.7 billion for  
the fighting over Kosovo, the refugees and Balkan states that have 
accepted them, and to strengthen a slew of Pentagon programs, 
dwarfing the $6 billion Clinton requested. That is the biggest 
chunk of the bill, and the item with the strongest political 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also contains nearly $1 billion he sought to help  
Honduras and other Central American countries rebuild from last 
fall's Hurricane Mitch, plus $566 million to aid U.S. farmers 
struggling from low commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the time an often surly bargaining session ended just  
before 1 a.m., the bill's price tag had surged toward $15 billion 
and confusion reigned. Lawmakers added tobacco language opposed by 
the administration, a new loan program for smaller steel companies 
unpopular with conservatives, and still faced questions about how 
parts of the package would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
said he did not know what would happen next beyond a meeting of GOP 
leaders ``to figure out what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure it's in trouble,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top  
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ``It's a mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an earlier veto threat from White House officials, the  
bargainers approved a provision by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
R-Texas, that would bar the federal government from laying claim to 
any of the $246 billion from settlements that states have reached 
with the tobacco industry. Clinton planned to billions of those 
funds for federal programs, but governors -- backed by many members 
of Congress -- want to keep it for the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't veto,'' predicted Hutchison in an interview, saying  
it would jeopardize ``money for troops in Kosovo doing his 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci chided  
Congress for ``trying to take advantage of emergency needs in 
Kosovo and Central America by loading up this bill with everybody's 
pet projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added, ``We've warned them not to load up this legislation''  
with unnecessary provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another complication was the bargainers' acceptance of a  
provision by Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, top Democrat from 
the Senate appropriations panel, for $140 million that would back 
$1 billion in loans for small steel producers hurt by low-price 
imports. The provision is sure to prove unpopular with 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators rejected a similar proposal by Sen. Pete Domenici,  
R-N.M., for $125 million to create a $500 million loan program for 
oil and gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also has $100 million for Jordan and $900 million  
for the costs of recent tornadoes in the Midwest and for a cushion 
for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	In other decisions,  
</P>
<P>
	--Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback lost an effort  
to forgive more than $200 million in interest and penalties owed by 
the state's natural gas producers ruled to have overcharged 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stevens and Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, accepted a  
compromise involving fishing restrictions in parts of their state's 
Glacier Bay National Park and a $26 million buyout for fish 
processors and others. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bargainers dropped a provision by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., for  
up to $40 million for families of the victims of a 1998 accident in 
which a Marine jet sent an Italian ski gondola crashing down a 
mountainside, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	To Clinton's $6 billion defense request, funds lawmakers added  
included $1.8 billion for a troop pay raise that would begin in 
January; $819 million to help Kosovo's refugees and Baltic states 
bordering Yugoslavia; $475 million to modernize overseas military 
bases to $475 million; and $200 million for the Coast Guard.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Lawsuit Issue Returns to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House passage of legislation to limit year  
2000 computer lawsuits puts pressure back on the Senate to agree on 
a companion bill that, unlike the House version, can escape a 
promised White House veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clock is ticking,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chief  
sponsor of the Senate bill, said today. ``The legislation cannot 
wait.'' He said his bill could return to the Senate floor next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has worked with Sen. Christopher  
Dodd, D-Conn., to make the bill more acceptable to Democrats, urged 
the White House to work with Congress. ``Vetoing a responsible bill 
is like sticking a monkey wrench into the high tech industry that 
is driving the nation's prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current Senate version was amended to meet some consumer  
concerns. Unlike the House bill, which caps punitive damage awards 
at $250,000 or three times economic damages in most cases, the 
Senate bill has punitive caps only for defendants that have 50 or 
fewer employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 236-190 Wednesday for legislation that would put  
caps on punitive damage awards, make potential plaintiffs wait 90 
days before filing suits, encourage mediation and limit class 
action lawsuits arising out of computer breakdowns that could occur 
with the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called it  
``the most significant piece of pro-business legislation to pass 
the House this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, while agreeing steps need to be taken to  
stop frivolous Y2K lawsuits, says the House bill would merit a 
presidential veto because it goes too far in restricting legal 
rights to redress wrongs. It ``would be perhaps the most sweeping 
litigation measure ever enacted,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer and attorney groups have urged the White House to  
oppose the legislation while another key Democratic support group, 
the high tech industry, has pushed equally hard for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday two senior White House officials, presidential aide  
Bruce Lindsey and economic adviser Gene Sperling, wrote House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., saying they wanted to find common 
ground and spelling out possible areas of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said the final bill should cover only commercial  
claims, and not restrict consumers from seeking damages for 
computer problems, but did show flexibility on ``proportionate 
liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsors want to stop attorneys from going after big,  
rich companies by limiting damages to a defendant's proportionate 
responsibility for a problem. Consumer groups say this would hurt 
lower income claimants, but the administration said it would accept 
some changes ``given the unique -- once in a millennium -- nature of 
the Y2K problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the House showed little inclination to accept White House  
ideas, defeating on a mainly partisan vote a Democratic version 
that the administration supported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should protect the problem-solvers, not those that are  
sitting on the sidelines now licking their chops hoping the problem 
won't be solved so they can move in like a bunch of buzzards and 
vultures and feed off the carcasses,'' said House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas, in favor of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Mulhern of Public Citizen, which opposes the bill, said it  
was ``reckless and extreme'' to be passing a far-reaching bill when 
no one knows how much disruption will be caused by computers that 
cannot read the 2000 date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have warned of the worst spate of lawsuits in  
American history if companies lose business because they can't get 
supplies or process credit cards, or if consumers have problems 
with medical equipment or filling drug prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was close to a deal on Y2K litigation two weeks ago  
but the bill was pulled from the floor as the Democratic and 
Republican leadership battled over other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, said the House vote Wednesday and the 
Lindsey-Sperling letter ``greatly increases the chances of breaking 
the logjam and passing this bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, press secretary for Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott,R-Miss., said Lott might try to bring the bill up again 
next week. ``We've got to try again because the window is 
closing.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Union Dues Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has reaffirmed his October  
decision that the Communications Workers of America failed to 
inform about 50,000 affiliated workers that they didn't have to pay 
full dues. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth on Thursday stuck with the  
ruling that awarded nominal damages to workers who pay a fee to the 
union for collective bargaining representation but don't become 
full union members. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had appealed the decision in the class-action suit,  
which was sponsored by the National Right to Work Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Any of those workers who now say they didn't want to pay for  
work the union did outside of collective bargaining -- such as 
political advocacy -- between 1987 and 1995 can request 
reimbursement for a portion of their dues. 
</P>
<P>
	In his October ruling, Lamberth said the violation was a  
technical matter, not intentional wrongdoing. Nevertheless, he 
ordered the union to pay $1 to each worker in the class and granted 
workers who were paying the union the fees the right to object to 
such expenditures retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
	The union estimates that the ruling will only affect about  
20,000 members.

	PUESTO CAHUIDE, Peru (AP) -- The presidents of Peru and Ecuador  
met Thursday at a remote jungle camp to formally put into effect a 
peace treaty that ended their long-standing border dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ceremony at the border juncture of the Yaupi and Santiago  
rivers, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and Ecuadorean 
President Jamil Mahuad signed an act sealing the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at the border post Puesto Cahuide, 680 miles north  
of the Peruvian capital, Lima, was the culmination of an October 
treaty that ended a dispute between the Andean neighbors that 
erupted into wars in 1941, 1985 and 1995. 
</P>

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A Brazilian real estate developer is  
planning to build the world's tallest building in South America's 
biggest city, local media reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brasilinvest said it had established a joint venture with the  
Maharishi Global Development Fund of the Netherlands to build 
1,630-foot, 103-story building called the Sao Paulo Tower. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.65 billion building would be 139 feet taller than the  
Petronas twin towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, currently the 
tallest buildings in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans are for the building to include a five-star hotel,  
shopping mall and convention facilities. Construction, expected to 
take five years, is scheduled to get under way in late 2000.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican labor leaders have criticized a  
supreme court ruling allowing government workers to choose which 
union will represent them. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling threatens ruling-party political control over  
government workers -- the only ones covered by the Tuesday court 
decision -- but does not augur widespread changes in Mexico's labor 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federation of State Workers has long supported the ruling  
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has held the nation's 
presidency without interruption since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
	The union's influence over its members has been used in the past  
to help the party by using government resources in election 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Ayala, a leader of the federation, pledged to resist any  
changes in labor laws as a result of the supreme court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take other kinds of action to overturn this (the  
ruling), such as protest marches or the right to strike,'' Ayala 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at private companies already have the right to choose  
among competing unions.

	The hailstorm, which struck Tuesday, caused insurance damage  
claims for an estimated 1,800 cars, the newspaper Reforma reported. 
The balls of ice also shattered windows at homes and schools in the

<HEADLINE> Crude Rises on OPEC Optimism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures posted their first gains in three days  
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid renewed optimism 
oil producer cuts will boost cash prices and on reports of a Texas 
refinery problem. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, silver futures surged nearly 4 percent, while  
palladium also rocketed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude gained after Saudi Arabia said in was in continued  
consultations with other world oil producers in an effort to boost 
cash crude prices to about $20 a barrel by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its  
members made 82 percent of their promised cuts in the first month 
of heavy production reductions. While that report was generally in 
line with other recent estimates, the news helped reinforce ideas 
that prices should not fall drastically unless there is some 
indication of widespread cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said crude prices could show dramatic gains in key  
producers continue to hold their quotas over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices also were supported by news Coastal shut a 10,000  
barrel-a-day unit in Corpus Christi, Texas, because of a refinery 
explosion. While such a small unit is unlikely to have a major 
effort on inventories, market participants noted any sign of 
slowing production is good going into the peak driving season that 
begin on Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for June delivery rose 46 cents to $18.03 a  
barrel; June heating oil rose 1.14 cents to 43.57 cents a gallon; 
June unleaded gasoline rose .72 cent to 52.34 cents a gallon; June 
natural gas rose .92 cent to $2.282 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver futures jumped 3.7 percent on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange in a technically driven rally tied to ideas that demand 
for the metal is on the rise in the important Asian sector. 
</P>
<P>
	July silver rose 18.7 cents to $5.57 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Palladium futures rocketed higher as political turmoil in Russia  
once again caused uncertainty about when that country will export 
more of the industrial metal in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia produce about three-quarters of the world's palladium  
supply and is the second-largest platinum producer behind South 
Africa, but supplies of the industrial metal have largely been kept 
off the market since December amid bureaucratic wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants fear Russia President Boris Yeltsin's  
decision to fire Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and his Cabinet 
and his subsequent impeachment hearings will lead to even greater 
export delays to Western manufacturers, who use the metals in 
automobile emission control devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium prices have virtually been set over the past three  
years by the availability of Russian supplies. When they've been 
held off the market, prices soar. When they're shipped, prices fall 
sharply. Automobile manufacturers now are moving to lower their 
reliance on the metal, but palladium also is experiencing a 
resurgence in demand from the jewelry-making sector. 
</P>
<P>
	June palladium rose $5.25 to $342.25 an ounce; July platinum  
rose $2.30 to $358.60 an ounce.

<HEADLINE> Settlement Sought in Diet Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers representing millions of people who used  
the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national 
settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, The Dallas 
Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks with pharmaceutical giant American Home Products Corp.  
follow last month's settlement in the first trial over alleged 
heart-valve damage from fen-phen. American Home reportedly agreed 
to pay $500,000 to settle that case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good sign both for the company and for  
consumers that lawyers are sitting down and are discussing how the 
litigation can be brought to a prompt and efficient conclusion and 
a fair conclusion,'' Houston lawyer J. Graham Hill, whose partners 
attended a settlement meeting in New York last week, told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home  
marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- and 
Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Madison, N.J.-based company pulled fenfluramine and  
Redux off the market at the Food and Drug Administration's request. 
A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially fatal heart 
valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the drug maker said it has been hit with more than  
2,600 lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The company must put between $3 billion and $5 billion into a  
settlement before it is acceptable, according to some lawyers and 
Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company knows one thing for sure,'' said Houston attorney  
John Eddie Williams, who represents 1,166 fen-phen users. ``If they 
have to try each and every one of these cases, we'll bankrupt 
them.''

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Fellowship of Christian Athletes is  
asking chapters in 7,100 public schools to circulate petitions for 
campus reconciliation as a tribute to victims in the Littleton, 
Colo., school killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The student pledge is named for Cassie Bernall, an FCA member  
and one of 12 students killed at Columbine High School by two 
schoolmates. She was shot after saying she believed in God. The 
organization notes that athletes as well as outspoken Christians 
were targets of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCA, acknowledging that athletes ``can cause emotional  
hardship to those outside of their groups,'' asks pledges to treat 
fellow students with respect and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition also denounces ``racism, hatred and persecution of  
individuals because of their race or religious beliefs,'' and says 
weapons and violence don't solve conflicts.

 *Don't rush the millennium    	
</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The National Association of Free Will  
Baptists says there's no rush to celebrate the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination won't mark its arrival until Jan. 1, 2001.  
</P>
<P>
	``We always like to be different,'' joked Melvin Worthington,  
executive secretary of the denomination based in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Different? Maybe. Accurate? Definitely.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,500 years ago, the monk Dionysius Exiguus was directed by  
Pope John I to compile tables of dates to help local Roman priests 
and bishops determine the correct date for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	Dionysius counted the year of Jesus' birth as 0001, not 0000.  
Thus it follows that the second millennium ends with the year 2000, 
and the third starts with 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Official keepers of time at the U.S. Naval Observatory and  
England's Royal Greenwich Observatory concur. Yet most Christians 
will mark the arrival of the millennium Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number resonates in people's minds,'' says Darren Sherkat,  
associate professor of sociology and religious studies at 
Vanderbilt University. 
</P>
<P>
	Not, however, for the Free Will Baptists, a fundamentalist  
Baptist denomination started in 1727 by a group in North Carolina 
who broke off from the Calvinists. Unlike the Calvinists, they 
believed it's possible to forfeit salvation by sinning. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination now has about 215,000 members, primarily in the  
Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Worthington said the church's millennium-related plans will  
likely include a series of workshops to renew faith, and efforts to 
attract new members, particularly among immigrants. 
</P>

 *Both sides win this debate    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Unitarian Universalist Association can once  
again present religious medals to Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The UUA, whose 250,000 members espouse widely varying beliefs  
including forms of Buddhism and feminist-inspired ``Earth-centered 
spirituality,'' has a more liberal view of homosexuality than the 
Boy Scouts of America. 
</P>
<P>
	While the two groups will remain divided on the issue, the UUA  
will remove from the ``Religion in Life'' award manual any 
reference to concerns about the Boy Scouts' ``homophobic and 
discriminatory attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it will convey the message in pamphlets mailed with the  
manual. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agreed to delete from our manual the language that the Boy  
Scouts objected to,'' said John Hurley, a spokesman for the 
Boston-based association of churches. ``But we are still going to 
be sending this material to scouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Boy Scouts teach traditional family values, said BSA  
spokesman Greg Shields, adding, ``An avowed homosexual wouldn't be 
a role model for those values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many denominations bestow religious medals on scouts. They  
differ from merit badges but may still be worn on scout uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute between the Unitarians and the Boy Scouts came to a  
head a year ago. In April the BSA agreed to the revised manual. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to church members describing the agreement, UUA  
President John A. Buehrens wrote that, ``it is not homosexuality 
but homophobia which is a sin.''	   ------

 *Cell power in prayer tower    	
</P>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Three telecommunications companies will  
get more cell power with the extended prayer tower under 
construction at Centenary United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The church agreed to the $275,000 addition and to lease the  
tower for cellular-phone antennas. The tower, which will nearly 
double in height to 133 feet, will be topped by a lighted cross 10 
feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agreement, each company will pay the church  
$4,000 a year for six years. They could extend the agreement for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular-phone companies have been seeking sites around the  
country, including church steeples, flagpoles, clock towers and 
farm silos. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer tower was built in 1992 with a small meditation room  
at the base. It was rendered unusable when the tower was usurped as 
a pigeon roost. 
</P>
<P>
	Centenary will put the lease money aside for special projects  
such as new ministries or emergency relief, said the Rev. David R. 
Thomas, senior pastor.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen in early  
trading Friday, while Japanese stocks advanced on yet another 
record close on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.74 yen in early trading, up 0.16 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but lower than its late New York level of 
121.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 73.86 points,  
or 0.44 percent, to 16,925.11 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Thursday, the index lost 96.11 points, or 0.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was well-supported by U.S.  
economic data released late Thursday, which indicated inflation is 
still nascent in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	It prompted growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve  
Open Markets Committee will leave interest rates unchanged at its 
meeting Tuesday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 129.90 yen in early  
trading, up from 129.36 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices rose moderately following another  
record close in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 
at 11,107.19 points, up 106.82. 
</P>
<P>
	But gains in Tokyo stocks were limited early Friday as  
participants grew cautious about pushing prices higher before a 
series of closely watched earnings reports for last fiscal year, 
which ended March 31, are released in coming weeks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.08 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,354.05. The 
TOPIX fell 9.18 points, or 0.67 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.260 percent from 1.275 percent late Thursday, driving its 
price up to 102.14 yen from 102.01 yen.

<HEADLINE> Politics at Cannes Film Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- Proving that even the dream world of films  
isn't immune to harsh realities, the first day of the Cannes Film 
Festival was full of reminders of the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest message came from the Oscar-winning Russian  
director whose film was honored with the festival's opening slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Nikita Mikhalkov, director of ``The Barber of Siberia,'' used  
his news conference Wednesday to castigate NATO -- and especially 
the United States -- over the airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NATO action is a tragic, tragic error,'' Mikhalkov said in  
a long, impassioned response to a question. 
</P>
<P>
	He described NATO pilots pushing buttons -- as in a video game --  
as they fired their missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 10 seconds, the plane goes back to its base,'' Mikhalkov  
said, speaking in Russian. ``The missiles are still falling. What 
happens on the ground, the pilot doesn't know. Maybe the bomb has 
hit the Chinese Embassy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He reserved his strongest criticism for the Americans.  
</P>
<P>
	``The United States never fought on its own territory,'' said  
the director, one of the best-known figures in Russia, who has even 
spoken of running for president. ``It never dug trenches on its own 
land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the familiar juxtaposition of glitter and substance that  
seems to characterize Cannes, Mikhalkov appeared hours later in a 
tuxedo, accompanying Faye Dunaway on the festival palace stage to 
declare the 52nd annual Cannes festival open. 
</P>
<P>
	British actress Kristin Scott Thomas, who hosted the ceremony,  
also made a reference to Kosovo. ``What is happening just a few 
hours away by plane,'' she said, ``makes cinema all the more 
precious, as an antidote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhalkov spent 10 years on ``The Barber of Siberia,'' which  
opened the 12-day festival. The film, not among the 22 in 
competition for awards, is a lavish period drama recalling the era 
of Czar Alexander III in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring British actress Julia Ormond and Russian star Oleg  
Menshikov, it premiered in February at the Kremlin in front of some 
5,000 people, among them starlets, Cabinet ministers and tycoons. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie focuses on a romance between a Russian cadet and an  
American woman. Although much of it is played too broadly and some 
dialogue is leaden, Menshikov gives an affecting performance as the 
cadet. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Mikhalkov, considered a nationalist, won an  
Oscar for best foreign-language film in 1995 with ``Burnt By the 
Sun,'' a story of Stalinist repression told through one family's 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of the author of the Soviet anthem, he was a successful  
director in Soviet times, and managed to maintain his popularity 
even after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Summers: A Rumpled Trouble-Shooter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Larry Summers, in line to be the next Treasury  
secretary, has proven an unlikely economic commando during recent 
global economic crises -- a rumpled, blustering former professor 
parachuting into financial trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving for a whirlwind diplomatic mission through Asia last  
year, Summers dropped his passport as he made his way to his seat 
on the plane. Luckily, another passenger returned it. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this occasional lack of polish, Summers, who has served  
as deputy Treasury secretary since 1995, is credited as one of the 
chief architects of the Clinton administration's strategy for 
dealing with global financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch, noted  
Summers' global trouble-shooting role, saying ``he's had very 
intensive on-the-job training.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, President Clinton has picked Summers, 44, to succeed  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who announced his resignation 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Little change is economic policy is expected.  
</P>
<P>
	Top White House economic adviser Gene Sperling said Summers and  
Rubin ``have really worked as partners for years, both in managing 
Treasury and developing policy. Many of their views they've arrived 
at together through shared experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said former Federal Reserve Governor Lyle Gramley: ``I don't see  
any reason for thinking policy will change one iota. It is in the 
international arena where Treasury shines, and that is where Larry 
has been taking the lead for some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said Summers  
will have to answer for the administration's handling of overseas 
economic troubles that didn't go so well, such as International 
Monetary Fund loans to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and  
Means Committee, said Summers faces other ``tough challenges'' in 
working with Congress on tax cuts, trade and Social Security 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also speculation that the scholarly Summers might have  
trouble matching Rubin's political acumen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not to take away from the expertise of Larry Summers,  
but I am glad we have a backup in Stuart Eizenstat,'' the political 
veteran chosen to Summers' deputy, said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. 
``We might compensate for the loss of Bob Rubin with both of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, Summers' style couldn't be more different than  
Rubin's. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, former head of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., is suave and slim  
and wears impeccably tailored suits. The portly Summers, who was a 
full professor at Harvard University at the tender age of 28, 
sometimes gives the impression of a preoccupied academic who has 
trouble keeping his shirttail tucked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin appears relaxed and amiable. Summers, who almost always  
works with an open can of Diet Coke at hand, is intense and seldom 
smiles. Even in his moment of triumph, he got a catch in his throat 
as he thanked his family in his remarks at the Rose Garden ceremony 
in which Clinton announced his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	His blunt self-assurance most of the time rubbed some members of  
Congress the wrong way. Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., recalled that 
Summers once described Republican efforts to eliminate estate taxes 
as ``selfish,'' raising concerns about his ability to avoid making 
``ill-tempered, partisan remarks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even Summers' critics concede the acuity of his analysis  
-- his ability to ``think outside the box'' and ``add value'' to 
deliberations on almost any topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers grew up outside Philadelphia and hails from a family of  
distinguished economists. At Harvard, he was known for research 
into practical economic questions such as tax policy, joblessness 
and the stock market. In 1991, he left academia to become chief 
economist at the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers rise in Washington, however, was slowed by an internal  
World Bank memo he signed that was leaked to the news media in 
1992. ``The economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in 
the lowest-wage country is impeccable,'' it read, in part. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers issued a public apology. He explained that the memo was  
written by an economist working for him, and that he co-signed it 
thinking to stimulate internal debate even though he disagreed with 
its premise. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Summers, who worked on Clinton's transition team, was  
passed over to be chairman of the newly elected president's Council 
of Economic Advisers. He took the job of Treasury undersecretary 
for international affairs instead, after facing questions about the 
World Bank memo during his Senate confirmation hearing in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I make a mistake, it's a big one,'' Summers told senators  
at the hearing.

<HEADLINE> Police Study Proposal Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some House Democrats and civil rights  
activists say another proposed study of police brutality would be a 
waste of time and are calling for meaningful reforms, including 
tougher penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	'' I don't think that this bill is going to help at all if  
police departments don't get it yet,'' Rep. Maxine Waters, 
D-Calif., said Wednesday at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on 
legislation to set up the study. 
</P>
<P>
	She said tougher penalties are needed to deter officers from  
``using the badge and the gun to violate people's civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Rep. Jose Serrano,  
D-N.Y., have proposed creating a five-member panel to study the 
``effectiveness of training, recruiting, hiring, oversight and 
funding policies and practices in law enforcement'' in New York, 
Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, and report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also authorizes $3 million in grants for these cities  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde said the measure proposes solutions ``to bolster the  
confidence the citizens have in their police and to provide 
effective training for police officers'' that cannot be achieved 
through action in the civil and criminal courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Serrano, who represents the Bronx district where the fatal  
police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed street vendor from 
Guinea, has come to symbolize excessive use of force by police, 
said racism wasn't the only factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Police departments, he said, ``must do a better job of  
recruiting, teaching use-of-force policies and selecting 
assignments for officers'' because many lack the skills and 
training to deal effectively with people from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat,  
said a study was unnecessary. ``This is not a new subject in 
criminal jurisprudence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police groups expressed concern about the objectivity of the  
study panel; its members would be appointed by House and Senate 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any commission with political appointees may not have the  
requisite objectivity needed to examine the issues,'' said Sgt. 
Marty Pfeifer, a national board member of the Fraternal Order of 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP also opposes the bill, and suggested that the House  
panel increase funding for several Justice Department programs and 
require police departments to collect statistics on the race of 
drivers pulled over for alleged traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, who testified in support of the  
proposal, told of the agony of learning about how her eldest son 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today as a grieving mother. I'm not a politician. I  
don't understand much about the bill but what I can say is I'm not 
the only victim,'' she said. Federal officials should ``provide 
whatever they can to prevent this kind of situation in the 
future.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Indians May Be for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians, one of baseball's most  
successful franchises in the last five years, are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's board of directors hired two investment firms,  
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to identify 
potential buyers for the franchise, owner Richard Jacobs said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would have to be approved by big league club owners.  
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, team chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder for more than 12 years, said the board of directors had 
agreed it might be an appropriate time to consider a sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch. I don't want an executor of mine to say, 'Well, Jacobs, he 
has no hand from the grave, he can't do anything on this. Let's 
make up our decision, who should be the owner of this team,''' 
Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old Jacobs said he wants to make sure his club ``is  
in good hands going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes at a time when the team could hardly be  
hotter. Cleveland leads the American League Central Division and 
has the best record in baseball at 24-9, the club's best start in 
99 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference called at the ballpark named for him,  
Jacobs noted that the NFL's Washington Redskins recently sold for 
$800 million. That price includes Jack Kent Cooke Stadium and the 
Redskins' training facility. If approved by the NFL, that would be 
a record for any sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers, the most recent baseball franchise to  
be sold, went last year to Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group for $350 
million. That deal included real estate in Los Angeles, Vero Beach, 
Fla., and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he doesn't expect a sale to close until after the  
season and didn't think it would affect the club's performance on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians general manager John Hart agreed. The players ``don't  
deal with Dick on a regular basis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs and his late brother, David, bought the struggling  
Indians franchise for $35 million on Dec. 9, 1986. The team endured 
five straight losing seasons through 1993 while the organization 
placed greater emphasis on player development and scouting. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the Indians moved into Jacobs Field, a state-of-the-art  
ballpark, and have sold out 308 consecutive home games since early 
1995. The team is obligated to play at Jacobs Field for the next 15 
years, according to the terms of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians won American League pennants in 1995 and 1997, and  
finished first in their division for the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't won a World Series since 1948 when they beat the  
Boston Braves in six games. The team has won the last four American 
League Central Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Net revenues for the Indians partnership in 1998 totaled $144.6  
million. The company completed its initial public offering and 
began trading on the Nasdaq stock market on June 4, 1998. The stock 
was sold initially at $15 a share but had a 52-week low of $5.38. 
The stock opened today at $14.75 and was selling at $15.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who has missed only five home games during his tenure as  
owner, said he wants to find a buyer who is committed to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intentions of any potential new owner are very important  
to me, because one of America's greatest baseball cities and its 
fans deserve committed ownership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local candidates emerged last year when the NFL's  
expansion Cleveland Browns were sold to billionaire banker Al 
Lerner for $530 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Cleveland area lawyer Larry Dolan and his  
brother Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems, and 
Cleveland-area businessman Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with 
Jacobs in a bid for the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team belongs to the community, and it has merely been  
entrusted to us to care for it for the past 12 1/2 years,'' Jacobs 
said. ``This is a very important decision that I believe will help 
to assure the continuing success of the team here in Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Abe Pollin announced he was selling his Washington  
Capitals of the NHL and a minority interest in the NBA's Washington 
Wizards. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's New York Jets are likely to go on the market following  
the death of owner Leon Hess. Estimates have put the team's value 
at $500 million.

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most prices charged by factories, farmers and  
other producers remained tame in April, but soaring energy prices -- 
including a record jump for gasoline -- may be starting to affect 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Producer Price Index for finished goods rose  
0.5 percent in April, the Labor Department said Thursday. That 
followed a smaller 0.2 percent increase in March and brought the 
annual rate of inflation in prices wholesalers pay to 1.1 percent 
so far in 1999, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for all of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The April rise was largely due to a 5.1 percent jump in energy  
prices -- the largest in nearly nine years -- which economists had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	After global economic turmoil pulled energy prices down sharply  
last year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed 
this spring to limit production. Analysts said military fuel 
demands for the conflict in Yugoslavia also may be tightening 
energy markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices posted the largest price gain, an unparalleled  
29.1 percent, breaking the record set in January 1990 during the 
Persian Gulf crisis. Fuel oil prices rose 14.3 percent, the most in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices paid by wholesalers for many other products,  
including food, computers and children's clothing dropped in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding gasoline prices, which are frequently volatile, the  
report ``indicates continued price stability for the U.S. 
economy,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving out food and energy, core producer prices -- which  
economists watch most closely -- climbed a mild 0.1 percent in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors, sensitive that signs of inflation could  
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, chose to focus 
on that positive aspect of the report. The Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks closed up 107 points on Thursday at 11,107. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe the spike in energy prices is likely to  
be temporary, but warn it could lead to more widespread, mild 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil is a very pervasive commodity, I would expect to see  
(higher prices) work their way a little through the rest of the 
economy,'' said economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates in 
Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may already feel pinched.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce Department said  
retail sales rose a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in April to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $239.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A 0.3 percent drop in demand for durable goods -- big-ticket  
items expected to last three or more years -- was led by an 0.8 
percent decline in sales at auto dealers, which analysts attributed 
mainly to the end of new year's discounts. Sales of nondurables, 
such as food and fuel, rose 0.4 percent, however, and excluding the 
jumpy autos category, overall retail sales also climbed 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with April last year, sales were up 7.5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals driving consumer spending remain positive,''  
said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. ``However, 
higher gasoline prices have put a crimp in consumers' 
pocketbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report released Thursday, the Labor Department said  
first-time claims for unemployment benefits held steady at a 
moderate 303,000 last week. A more reliable four-week moving 
average of jobless claims dropped by 4,000 to 304,250. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggests little change ahead in the nation's unemployment  
rate, which edged up to 4.3 percent in April but remains near a 
29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists worry that inflation could become a danger if  
Americans, feeling secure in their jobs, continue to spend briskly, 
and price-containing pressures caused by recent low demand for U.S. 
products overseas begin to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, competition from low-priced imports flooding  
into the United States from economically distressed countries is 
keeping most prices here low. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, for example, the cost of computers fell 3.9 percent,  
the price of children's clothing fell 0.8 percent and the price of 
home electronic equipment fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of passenger cars and light trucks rose 0.2 percent  
and 0.3 percent -- another effect of expiring sales incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs fell 0.9 percent in April. Fish prices dropped 7.1  
percent, the most in five years, after rising sharply in March. 
Dairy, egg and pork prices also fell, offsetting increases for 
fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	At the earliest stages of production, prices rose 0.6 percent  
for intermediate goods and 1.3 percent for crude goods, including 
petroleum. An example of the three stages of production is bread 
for finished, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Ready to Rumble at Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- As he crossed the street and walked toward his  
waiting car, D. Wayne Lukas couldn't help but flash a huge smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame trainer had just attended the post-position  
draw for Saturday's Preakness, and his Kentucky Derby winner 
Charismatic ended up in a perfect spot -- No. 6 in a full 14-horse 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the zone,'' Lukas said Wednesday night. ``I'm tickled  
to death with the draw. Things are falling into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, Lukas' other 3-year-old colt, fared well, too, with  
the trainer selecting the No. 3 slot for his third-place Derby 
finisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about Charismatic. I think he's peaked at the  
right time,'' Lukas said, even though the Derby winner was fourth 
choice at 6-1 in the early-morning line. ``And I expect Cat Thief 
to keep everyone honest. It won't surprise me if he wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest jolt was reserved for trainer Bob Baffert, who was  
hoping his star fillies would draw favorable posts. Excellent 
Meeting did and is definitely in; Silverbulletday didn't and may be 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby after a strong finish,  
ended up with the No. 7 post, while Silverbulletday, a winner in 10 
of 11 career starts -- none against males -- got the outside No. 14 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll just mull it over and committee-icize over crabcakes and  
lite beer,'' Baffert said. ``I'm not angry, just disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday drew the rail for Friday's Black-Eyed Susan, and  
Baffert has until the day of the race to decide where to send the 
Mike Pegram-owned filly. He said if Silverbulletday drew anywhere 
from posts 4-10, or the No. 1 slot, she's be a definite Preakness 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But now we have to think about this filly,'' Baffert said.  
``One like this comes along so rarely. Mike and I talk about it a 
lot, and maybe that (the draw) was a signal to tell us not to 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, runner-up in the Derby by neck to the 31-1 shot  
Charismatic, was the 5-2 favorite, while the fillies were next -- 
Silverbulletday at 7-2 and Excellent Meeting at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-horse field, which includes a record 10 Derby horses,  
matches the largest in the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning Colors, Lukas' 1988 Derby winner, was the last filly to  
run in the Preakness, finishing third. Four fillies have won the 
Preakness, but none since Nellie Morse in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas may have a little history on his side, too, as he shoots  
for his fifth Preakness win -- the No. 6 gate has produced 13 
winners of the second leg of the Triple Crown, the most of any post 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also got the only Triple Crown contender in Charasmatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've won a Triple Crown, but I needed two horses to do it,''  
Lukas said, referring to 1995, when Thunder Gulch won the Derby and 
Belmont, but stablemate Timber Country took the Preakness. ``Maybe 
one of these days, we'll win all three with one horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic might be the one, even though his reputation suffers  
because he was put in claiming races twice -- the last on Feb. 11 -- 
and could have been purchased for $62,500 after either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the story all week will be he's a claimer, and  
everything went his way in the Derby,'' Lukas said. ``But don't 
discredit the horse because I was foolish enough to run him in a 
claiming race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, might be light on  
victories, but he's the most seasoned Preakness starter of all. 
He'll be racing for the 16th time -- fourth since the Santa Anita 
Derby on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be a two-week horse,'' Lukas said. ``I think he's  
had a little attitude adjustment from the Derby. He's kind of 
focused. He's been laid back all spring. He ran a good Derby, never 
turned a hair. I think he's ready to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness draw was handled the same way as the Derby draw --  
a draft order was selected and trainers picked their spots based on 
that order. Baffert had the 13th pick with Silverbulletday and 
trainer Carl Nafzger had the 14th pick. When it came time for them 
to make their picks, they held an impromptu coin toss, and Nafzger 
won, taking the 13th post. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Bob's idea,'' Nafzger said. ``I ain't that smart.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 10 Derby horses running Saturday are Charismatic, Menifee,  
Cat Thief, Excellent Meeting, Kimberlite Pipe, Worldly Manner, 
Stephen Got Even, Valhol, Adonis and Vicar. The newcomers are 
Badge, Patience Game, Silverbulletday and Torrid Sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Preakness winner who did not run in the Derby was  
Deputed Testamony in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, is Torrid Sand (Tim Duhey, 60-1);  
Kimberlite Pipe (Shane Sellers, 20-1); Cat Thief (Mike Smith, 8-1); 
Badge (Mike Luzzi, 50-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 5-2); Charismatic 
(Chris Antley, 6-1); Excellent Meeting (Kent Desormeaux, 5-1); 
Patience Game (Corey Nakatani, 30-1);l Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 30-1); 
Worldly Manner (Jerry Bailey, 12-1); Stephen Got Even (to be named, 
10-1); Valhol (Edgar Prado, 99-1); Vicar (Robby Albarado, 30-1); 
and Silverbulletday (Gary Stevens, 7-2).

<HEADLINE>  'Star Wars' Tickets Cause Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Force was kind to those who waited.  
</P>
<P>
	Advance tickets for the first ``Star Wars'' movie since 1983  
went on sale Wednesday amid a frenzied demand matched only by the 
film's hype. And ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' a 
prequel to the earlier George Lucas trilogy, doesn't even open 
until May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop fans across the country from putting up with  
driving rain, long lines, busy signals and clogged Web sites to 
become the first to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	After waiting a week in line -- and enduring the barbs of passing  
hecklers -- Johnny Shipman's faithfulness paid off: The 25-year-old 
welder was the first to buy tickets at a theater in Augusta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just intense,'' Shipman said. ``Cameras all in front of  
me, news crews and everything. ... It was more than I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the film's early mixed reviews, tickets to the debut  
showings sold out within minutes and fans scrambled to get seats 
for later dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years for this,'' said Lee Dahlhauser,  
who bought the first tickets sold in Ames, Iowa, after spending all 
night in line in a driving rain covered with blankets and sheets of 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Director-producer George Lucas initially barred advanced ticket  
sales to prevent scalping, but relented under pressure from theater 
owners. In a compromise, theaters restricted sales to a maximum of 
12 tickets per person. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop people from trying to resell tickets, at least  
on the Internet. By late this morning, the eBay on-line auction 
service had 117 listings for tickets, including a set of four being 
offered in New Jersey that had received a bid of $60 or nearly 
twice the face value. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered in 1977 -- and where fans have been camping 
out for weeks -- the line stretched along Hollywood Boulevard, down 
a side street and to the next block over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important we see it on opening day at Mann's Chinese  
Theatre,'' explained Susanna Modjallal, 30. ``If Lucas thought it 
was good enough to premiere here, it's good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the crowd outside the Senator Theater was three  
blocks long; Pete Levin, 32nd in line, had camped out with his 
sister and friend since 9 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me,'' Levin said of his  
determination to get tickets to the very first showing. ``I want to 
be surprised. I didn't want anyone to tell me the ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought it would be a bit more sane buying tickets by  
phone or over the Internet were in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people called MovieFone for tickets that circuits were  
jammed, even though the ticket service added lines. MovieFone's Web 
site was also swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has been even greater than we expected,'' said  
Christine Fakundiny, director of marketing for MovieFone. ``But 
people are getting through and we are processing them. The advice 
to the war weary is keeping trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Hoffman, 13, of New York, said his mother had allowed him  
to skip school and wait in line all day for tickets. He said his 
mother ``knows how important it is to me.'' And his teachers? 
</P>
<P>
	``For all I know my teacher is on line at some other theater,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Eastgate Theatre in Portland, Ore., Gabe Elliot  
complained about people ahead of him who sang music from ``Star 
Wars'' and recited quotes from the ``Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail'' comedy film while he stood in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Elliot: ``I'm surrounded by psychos.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Capitol Evacuated Over Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The state Capitol was evacuated Thursday  
afternoon and legislative meetings halted after a bomb threat was 
called into Gov. Jesse Ventura's office. No bomb was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor and lieutenant governor were taken out of the  
building at about 3 p.m. The building was reopened about 90 minutes 
later. 
</P>

	Because of the threat, Weaver said access to the building will  
be limited and packages checked until the end of the legislative

<HEADLINE> 49ers Owner Demands Sale Recision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Suspended San Francisco 49ers co-owner  
Eddie DeBartolo Jr. asked a judge Thursday to rescind his sale of 
the team to the family-held corporation run by his sister. He also 
asked for more than $650 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint filed in San Francisco Superior Court was a reply  
to the lawsuit filed last month by Denise DeBartolo York seeking to 
oust her brother from any management role with the team and 
demanding he repay $94 million to the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo said his sister broke promises she made in writing in  
October 1997 that if he stopped playing any management role in the 
company, his financial interests would be preserved. The siblings 
each own a 50 percent stake in the family business, a Youngstown, 
Ohio-based real estate development firm that is also the nominal 
owner of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	``All this was done with one purpose, not a fair, equitable  
sharing of our father's legacy, but a squeeze play to force me out 
of the family business at a price well below my lawful due,'' 
DeBartolo said in a statement. ``I will not compromise what I built 
with my father, nor surrender what he left to me and my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	York spokesman Sam Singer said Thursday night ``there's  
literally not a single true thing anywhere in Eddie's complaint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo said York promised that once his troubles in a  
Louisiana gambling fraud scandal were resolved, he would regain 
control of the team and corporation. The corporation and the 49ers 
have been run by York and her husband, John York, since DeBartolo 
became enmeshed in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But in March, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue forbade DeBartolo  
from exercising any authority over the 49ers' operations, saying he 
was guilty of conduct detrimental to the league for his involvement 
in the gambling fraud case. He sanctioned DeBartolo and fined him 
$1 million, and extended DeBartolo's NFL banishment until at least 
February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eddie's answer to the lawsuit is completely unfounded and  
untruthful,'' Singer said. ``I think that the crux of this matter 
is that Eddie ran up a $94 million debt, he got convicted of a 
felony in the state of Louisiana and now he's looking to blame his 
sister, his brother-in-law, the corporation when he has no one to 
blame but himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo also said Thursday his sister diminished his lawful  
holdings in the corporation, refused to hold shareholder meetings 
and demanded he make payments on obligations that were not due or 
owed, among other allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	No one immediately returned calls Thursday seeking additional  
comment from DeBartolo. 
</P>
<P>
	York on Wednesday asked a federal judge in Ohio to dismiss a  
$150 million lawsuit her brother filed against her for breach of 
contract, alleging she reneged on a deal to turn the team over to 
him as part of an August 1998 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	That deal would have divided the assets of their jointly owned  
business, with DeBartolo gaining sole possession of the team in 
return for $350 million.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Salmon To Be Out 5 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels have been bitten  
severely by the injury bug yet again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, who have had a rash of injuries in recent years,  
will be without right fielder Tim Salmon for at least five more 
weeks because of a sprained left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon joins center fielder Jim Edmonds and shortstop Gary  
DiSarcina on the sidelines for an extended period. The Angels have 
also been without right-handed pitchers Jack McDowell, Jason 
Dickson and Mike James all season, and none are expected back any 
time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	An arthrogram taken late Wednesday revealed Salmon's injury is  
worse than originally thought. He hurt himself diving for a fly 
ball in the fourth inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox 
on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon, hitting .347 with seven homers and 25 RBIs, was  
originally listed as day to day, but finally went on the 15-day 
disabled list Tuesday -- eight days after being injured -- when the 
pain persisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, it was believed Salmon would probably return to  
action next week, but now, it won't be until sometime next month, 
or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon's wrist was placed in a short-arm cast, where it will  
remain for three weeks, and he will then need at least a couple 
weeks to rehabilitate the wrist before playing again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's frustrated, but he knows you can't risk long-term  
injury,'' Angels vice president of communications Tim Mead said 
from New York before the Angels and Yankees met in the finale of a 
three-game series Thursday night. ``That's why he needs to take 
care of it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon, 30, has averaged nearly 30 homers per year since  
becoming a regular in 1993, when he was voted AL Rookie of the 
Year. He entered the season with a lifetime batting average of 
.294.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 11,107.19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly higher Thursday on reports  
showing moderate inflation, with the Dow Jones industrial average 
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 pushing to new records. 
</P>
<P>
	But weakness in some technology shares pulled the Nasdaq Stock  
Market lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 106.82 to 11,107.19,  
breezing past its previous closing record of 11,031.59 posted last 
Friday. The Dow is up nearly 21 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.56 to 1,367.56, topping  
its previous closing high of 1,364.00 set Wednesday. But the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index declined 24.54 to 2,582.00. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM almost single-handedly led the Dow higher after Merrill  
Lynch raised its prediction for how much the stock would rise over 
the next 12 months. That came after an analyst meeting Wednesday 
during which chairman Louis Gerstner said the Internet would play a 
large part in the company's future, and that a quarter of IBM's 
1998 revenues came from electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bull beat goes on, led by Big Blue,'' said Alfred E.  
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. IBM shares soared 20 1/2 to a record 246, accounting for a rise 
of more than 93 points on the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer shares rose initially with IBM but later bowed to  
profit-taking. Internet stocks were lower on profit-taking as well; 
America Online dropped 5 13/16 to 132 5/8 and was the most active 
issue on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow transportation average fell 30.99, or 0.82 percent, to  
3,752.51, after the Justice Department said it was investigating 
American Airlines for antitrust violations. The shares of 
American's parent, AMR Corp., dropped 5/16 to 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the market got a boost from a government report that  
wholesale inflation was in line with expectations. The Labor 
Department said the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in April 
as the price of gasoline jumped significantly. But the index's core 
rate, which strips away volatile food and energy costs, was up a 
mere 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said first-time claims for  
unemployment benefits held steady at a moderate 303,000 last week. 
A more reliable four-week moving average of jobless claims dropped 
by 4,000 to 304,250, suggesting that unemployment will remain at 
4.3 percent this month, near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report, the Commerce Department said retail sales  
rose 0.1 percent in April, as consumers reacted to higher energy 
costs by pulling in their purse strings. That was a smaller 
increase than many analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are now turning their attention to Friday's expected  
release of consumer price data. Taken together, the producer- and 
consumer-price data could give them clues about the Federal 
Reserve's policy meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates,  
though it might if it feels the need to slow the economy and head 
off inflation, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at 
Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``Most people think (central bankers) are more 
inclined to raise rates in August, after they get more indication 
of recovering global economies,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices rose, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond --  
which moves in the opposite direction from price --falling to 5.75 
percent from 5.82 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial services stocks rose early in the day but then dropped  
back, with Citigroup down 1/2 at 73 7/16, and American Express down 
1 1/4 at 124 3/4. J.P. Morgan shares, however, rose 7 5/8 to 146 3/4 on 
takeover speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidate volume totaled 975.2 
million shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.67 to 651.35, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.04 to 800.39. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.58 to 450.84. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo declined 0.57  
percent. In Europe, the DAX index in Frankfurt eased 0.02 percent, 
the FT-SE 100 index in London climbed 1.79, following New York's 
lead, while the CAC in Paris rose 0.11 percent.

<HEADLINE> Elway Meets With Potential LA Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Elway met separately with two potential  
owners of a Los Angeles NFL expansion franchise Thursday about the 
possibility of running the day-to-day operations of a new team as 
well as being part owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, 38, retired earlier this month after playing 16 seasons  
for the Denver Broncos, capping a record-setting career by 
quarterbacking the Broncos to two straight Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting news, that John Elway would consider  
being president of a team in Los Angeles,'' Mayor Richard Riordan 
said after the second meeting of the day attended by Elway and his 
wife, Janet. ``That is the title being discussed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners voted 29-2 two months ago to award an expansion  
franchise team to the Los Angeles area, and set a Sept. 15 deadline 
for reaching agreement with whatever site and group they select to 
operate the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking at all the options of football in Los Angeles,''  
Marvin Demoff, Elway's Los Angeles-based lawyer, said after the 
Elways met with Riordan and billionaire developer Eli Broad for a 
little over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is such a unique opportunity, it's important for him to  
explore it fully,'' Demoff said. ``This is just the beginning of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Broad: ``We talked to him about being a part owner,  
absolutely. We have not made an offer. We said, `We want you, we 
think you would be a great asset for this franchise.' We need 
someone of his caliber to run this franchise, if it is awarded to 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Demoff said Elway and his family enjoy living in Denver, but  
added, ``It's not a stumbling block. If it wasn't Los Angeles and 
professional football, and the opportunity at management at a very 
high level and possibly being president, it wouldn't be a 
consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway starred at Granada Hills High in the nearby San Fernando  
Valley before attending Stanford and joining the Broncos in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Demoff said Elway met for about an hour with former Hollywood  
agent Michael Ovitz, the other potential owner of the expansion 
franchise, earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Demoff said no firm offers were made to Elway by either party.  
</P>
<P>
	Elway didn't attend the 20-minute press briefing, and neither  
did Ovitz. Demoff wouldn't comment when asked whether Elway's 
loyalties lie with Broad or Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan also said he wasn't endorsing either side, but added,  
``I happen to be a very close friend of Eli Broad and I think he 
certainly would be an excellent choice. As mayor of this city, I 
think it's important I don't take sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad heads up the New Coliseum Venture, while Ovitz wanted to  
build a new stadium in nearby Carson. NFL owners said recently they 
are committed to a renovated Coliseum, but have made no decision as 
to ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad said his group has no plans at this time to join forces  
with Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston is waiting if a deal can't be reached in Los Angeles,  
but the inclusion of Elway would certainly seem to help Los 
Angeles' chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first conversation we've had at any length,''  
Broad said. ``I'm hopeful there will be more in the near future. 
John's aware of the timetable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As things now stand, an expansion franchise would begin play in  
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos owner Pat Bowlen has offered Elway a chance to own a  
piece of that team, but as Demoff pointed out, Elway is attracted 
by the possibility of running the team in Los Angeles, an 
opportunity he wouldn't have in Denver.

a side street and to the next block over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important we see it on opening day at Mann's Chinese  
Theatre,'' explained Susanna Modjallal, 30. ``If Lucas thought it 
was good enough to premiere here, it's good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the crowd outside the Senator Theater was three  
blocks long; Pete Levin, 32nd in line, had camped out with his 
sister and friend since 9 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me,'' Levin said of his  
determination to get tickets to the very first showing. ``I want to 
be surprised. I didn't want anyone to tell me the ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought it would be a bit more sane buying tickets by  
phone or over the Internet were in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people called MovieFone for tickets that circuits were  
jammed, even though the ticket service added lines. MovieFone's Web 
site was also swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has been even greater than we expected,'' said  
Christine Fakundiny, director of marketing for MovieFone. ``But 
people are getting through and we are processing them. The advice 
to the war weary is keeping trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Hoffman, 13, of New York, said his mother had allowed him  
to skip school and wait in line all day for tickets. He said his 
mother ``knows how important it is to me.'' And his teachers? 
</P>
<P>
	``For all I know my teacher is on line at some other theater,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Eastgate Theatre in Portland, Ore., Gabe Elliot  
complained about people ahead of him who sang music from ``Star 
Wars'' and recited quotes from the ``Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail'' comedy film while he stood in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Elliot: ``I'm surrounded by psychos.''

<HEADLINE> Chung Says He Got Invite From Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Johnny Chung says he recently received some  
unwanted mail from Vice President Al Gore: an invitation to attend 
a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung testified Thursday in a case brought by a conservative  
group that he received the invitation about a month ago for an 
event in Los Angeles from the vice president by mail and by fax, at 
his home and at his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he was solicited by the Democratic Congressional  
Campaign Committee in the past seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Judicial Watch deposed Chung regarding the alleged sale of  
Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Chung testified that he told his wife, ``This is  
not the kind of mailings I like to receive any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Roger Salazar acknowledged that Chung did receive  
a direct mailing, because his name was on a list used for fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the campaign found out that his name was on one of the  
lists that we purchased, he was immediately removed from the 
list,'' Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung was sentenced to five years' probation after admitting  
that he made $30,000 in illegal contributions, including $20,000 to 
the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. On Tuesday, he 
testified before the House Government Reform Committee.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Film Looks at Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- In the opening moments of ``Kadosh,'' an  
Orthodox Jewish man awakes and recites his morning prayers. In one 
traditional prayer he thanks God ``for not making me a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Amos Gitai, director of the first Israeli film chosen  
for Cannes competition in 25 years, makes his point -- and then he 
keeps on making it. This is a film that starts out bleak and just 
gets bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kadosh'' -- the word means ``sacred'' -- is a brutal attack on  
Orthodox Jewish life and its treatment of women, by a filmmaker who 
says it's his way of voting against the religious right in Monday's 
elections in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the acting is often excellent and the film searing and  
painful, many scenes are unnecessarily, agonizingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is, however, fascinating to watch, mainly because it  
was shot in Mea Shearim, the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in 
Jerusalem that is largely closed off to secular Israel and the rest 
of the world. Gitai managed to film the exteriors and some 
interiors there, providing an authentic view of a mysterious, 
shuttered world. 
</P>
<P>
	The story focuses on two sisters, Rivka and Malka, each  
struggling in her own way with the rules of her religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The beautiful Rivka loves her husband, Meir -- the man who prays  
in the film's opening. But after 10 years of trying, she has been 
unable to get pregnant. In the eyes of their community, this makes 
Rivka not a woman at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, Meir tells his passionate wife that sex is now a sin for  
them, because it is not leading to procreation. 
</P>
<P>
	As Rivka's situation becomes more desperate, her younger sister,  
Malka, finds she has been condemned to an arranged marriage with a 
man she hates -- taking her away from the one she loves, Yaacov, who 
has left Mea Shearim. 
</P>
<P>
	Things get worse: Rivka is forced to leave home and live in a  
room somewhere, so Meir can have a child with another wife -- even 
though a secular doctor has told Rivka it may actually be Meir who 
is sterile. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Malka, she endures a loveless wedding and an absolutely  
awful wedding night -- presented graphically here -- and, when she 
slips off for a tryst with her true love, is discovered and beaten 
by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, suffice it to say, things get worse, not better.  
</P>
<P>
	The film is written by Eliette Abecassis, a woman and a  
practicing Jew based in France who spent time living in Mea Shearim 
for her research. 
</P>
<P>
	The director makes no bones about his desire to make a strong  
political statement with the film, which opens in Israel on June 
10. A U.S. distributor has not yet been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this election, the choice is radical,'' says Gitai, who  
comes from a family that founded Israel's center-left Labor Party. 
``There has practically been a coup d'etat by the religious 
community. We must decide what kind of country we will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An interesting side story is that of the actress who plays  
Malka, 21-year-old Meital Barda. She grew up in an Orthodox family 
but left that life behind. She has several sexual scenes in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family wasn't happy with the thought of me doing such  
scenes,'' she said. ``But in the end, they supported me. I think 
the hand of God was with us.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Meares, Christiansen on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- For the second time in three years, a newly  
signed Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop is on the disabled list -- and 
probably for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates, who were idle Thursday, put shortstop Pat Meares  
(tendon injury) and left-handed reliever Jason Christiansen 
(sprained neck) on the disabled list. They recalled shortstop 
Abraham Nunez from Triple-A Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Francisco Cordova, who hasn't pitched since April  
10 because of shoulder inflammation, is expected to be activated 
off the disabled list this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares has an injured tendon in his left hand that may need  
surgery, which would sideline him until at least mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury is not related to the left wrist sprain that put him  
on the disabled list at the start of the season. However, it is 
related to the left little finger injury that kept him out of a May 
3 game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, a hand specialist told Meares he would ultimately  
need surgery, but Meares hoped to postpone the operation until the 
season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	But Meares had trouble gripping the bat and tried unsuccessfully  
to compensate by taping his left little finger to his ring finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't doing me any good to play,'' Meares said.  
</P>
<P>
	The injury worsened only two weeks after Meares agreed to a $15  
million, four-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, shortstop Kevin Elster was injured in mid-May  
two years ago, not long after signing with the Pirates. He did not 
play again that season and did not re-sign with Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunez began the season with the Pirates and was 5-for-18 (.278)  
with three RBIs in six games.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Va. Mayor Sentenced to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Former Richmond mayor Leonidas B. Young was  
sentenced Thursday to two years in federal prison for obstruction 
of justice, filing a false tax return and two counts of mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney James B. Comey recommended a light  
sentence because Young is cooperating in a continuing investigation 
of criminal activity in Richmond. Young could have received up to 
23 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``My presence here today is a result of my own personal  
misjudgment and, I shudder to say, stupidity,'' Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Baptist pastor who held public office in Richmond for seven  
years, Young was indicted last fall on 19 felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Young peddled influence during his term as  
mayor and defrauded members of his Fourth Baptist Church 
congregation to support extramarital liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to four counts in a plea agreement Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> Mistrial Declared for Former Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The trial of a former judge accused of  
donning a mask and pistol-whipping a political rival has ended in a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	Luther C. Edmonds was accused of attacking William P. Robinson  
Jr., a member of the state House of Delegates, outside Robinson's 
law office in 1997. Robinson's attacker bashed his face with a gun, 
forcing him to get 30 stitches on his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds and Robinson, both 56, were once friends and political  
allies. They parted ways when Robinson publicly disputed the reason 
Edmonds gave for resigning from the bench during a misconduct 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, a judge for eight years, also is running against  
Robinson in a June Democratic primary for Robinson's House seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds was charged with malicious wounding, use of a gun in a  
felony and the unlawful wearing of a mask. He could have faced 28 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, who said they will retry the case, contended that  
DNA tests showed blood on a gun seized from Edmonds' apartment 
matched Robinson's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	But defense attorneys said at least 18 people had access to the  
police locker where the gun and blood sample were kept. Jurors 
deliberated 10 hours before the mistrial was declared Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Third-Gunman Issue Still Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- More than three weeks after the  
bloodbath at Columbine High, there are still some fundamental 
questions that investigators cannot answer with certainty, among 
them: Was there a third shooter? 
</P>
<P>
	Some students ``are very adamant about the fact that there was a  
third gunman,'' said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis. ``All along 
we've been trying to prove or disprove that theory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are leaving open the possibility that another  
gunman joined Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, but so far there has 
been no physical evidence to support the theory. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses claimed to have seen a third gunman in a white  
shirt. But Davis said that one of the two teen-agers was wearing a 
white shirt that day and apparently took off his black trench coat 
during the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballistic tests being conducted by the Colorado Bureau of  
Investigation may help prove or disprove the third gunman theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We match the bullets taken from the wounded and the dead and  
match them to weapons taken from the crime scene,'' said CBI 
Director Carl Whiteside. The tests may determine which gunman fired 
which shots and whether guns that are unaccounted for were used. 
</P>
<P>
	Whiteside said agents are testing hundreds of pieces of  
evidence, including bullets, bullet fragments and shell casings, 
and it could be weeks before the findings are in. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings may also help determine definitively whether the  
teens killed themselves or if it was a murder-suicide. Davis said 
the coroner's office believes both died of self-inflicted gunshot 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and Harris, 18, stormed the school on April 20,  
hurling explosives and blasting away with their guns. When it was 
over, they had killed 12 other students and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said police are busy chasing down some 2,200 leads and  
conducting a tremendous number of interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the outside, it looks like not much is happening. There's  
not big news coming out every day,'' he said. ``But I can assure 
you there is a team of about 80 investigators on this task force 
that are very busy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, investigators are trying to determine  
whether anyone else knew of the attack ahead of time or took part 
in some way. The large number of bombs in the school and other 
places -- about 60 in all -- suggest it may have taken more than two 
people to put them in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``From day one we've always felt like there was a very good  
possibility that that more people were involved,'' Davis said. ``It 
may not mean that there were people actually in the school that 
day, but there's a good possibility that people were involved in 
ways such as supplying weapons or maybe building explosive 
devices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they have determined that Klebold's girlfriend,  
Robyn K. Anderson, 18, bought three of the guns used in the 
rampage. Investigators want to know whether she had prior knowledge 
of the attack. They are questioning her through her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth gun used in the attack was supplied by Mark Manes, a  
22-year-old computer programmer. Manes has admitted selling the 
semiautomatic TEC DC-9 to Harris and Klebold. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said that if it is proved that Manes or Anderson had prior  
knowledge of the attack and supplied the weapons anyway, they could 
be charged with accessory to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms have been building a three-dimensional model of the school 
to reconstruct the rampage. Authorities are also working to profile 
the gunmen themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are working with America Online to track down  
about 50 Web and e-mail addresses and look at Klebold and Harris' 
correspondence. Authorities with a search warrant went to a video 
store Tuesday to find out what video games or movies they rented. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to reserve the possibility, however slight it may be,  
that we do this long, long investigation and come up with the final 
determination that it was Harris and Klebold completely on their 
own,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a possibility, which would almost be a relief,  
to tell you the truth.''

<HEADLINE> Donald O'Connor Returning to Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Donald O'Connor is returning to the  
stage three months after pneumonia nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rumors of my death were highly exaggerated. And although  
many people didn't think I would make it, I have bounced back,'' 
the song-and-dance man said in a statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old entertainer will return to the Historic Plaza  
Theatre stage on May 28 to headline the eighth season of the 
Fabulous Palm Springs Follies. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who lives in Sedona, Ariz., was hospitalized at Desert  
Regional Medical Center on Jan. 30 and was diagnosed with 
pneumonia. Four days later, his condition deteriorated and he was 
moved to intensive care and placed on a ventilator. He was released 
Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor is best known for roles in major movie musicals,  
including a part as Gene Kelly's friend in 1952's ``Singin' in the 
Rain.''

	In the spotlight: Cher, singer, actress, artist.  
</P>
<P>
	Personal stats: Cherilyn Sarkisian was born May 20, 1946, in El  
Centro, Calif. She met Salvatore ``Sonny'' Bono, a backup singer 
and aspiring songwriter, while she was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 16, I met Sonny,'' she has recalled. ``I never saw  
anything like him before in my life. He walked into this room and I 
swear to God, I saw him and everybody else was washed away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair clicked as Sonny and Cher with a string of hits,  
beginning with ``I Got You Babe'' in 1965. They hosted their own 
television variety program, ``The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour,'' 
from 1971-1974. Bono's Dutch-boy haircut, droopy mustache and 
bell-bottom trousers contrasted with Cher's thin, towering figure, 
draped in spectacularly sequined outfits. 
</P>
<P>
	Their daughter, Chastity, was born in 1969.  
</P>
<P>
	After divorcing Bono in 1974, Cher married rocker Gregg Allman  
and gave birth to a son, Elijah. She continued to pursue her 
singing and acting career, interspersed with exercise video and 
infomercial ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Her film roles include ``Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy  
Dean, Jimmy Dean,'' ``Mask,'' ``The Witches of Eastwick'' and 
``Suspect.'' She won an Academy Award for best actress for her role 
in the 1987 film, ``Moonstruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest film is Franco Zeffirelli's ``Tea With Mussolini,''  
which also stars Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith. Her 
new album, ``Believe,'' features the best-selling single of the 
same name. She is also the author of ``The First Time.''

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Mosque Threat Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police were investigating the military  
and medical history of a man who allegedly wanted to torch a mosque 
and was found with bomb components, four guns and two machetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack M. Modig, 39, was being held on $500,000 bond Thursday  
after being arrested on charges of possession of explosives, 
attempted vehicular assault and ethnic intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Modig told them he is ``an enemy of the  
Islamic nation'' and wanted to ``kill Iraqis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested Modig early Wednesday after he was spotted in a  
white Oldsmobile Cutlass parked with the lights off near the 
entrance of the Islamic Center in eastern Denver. Police said a 
sergeant approached Modig, but the car sped off and a chase ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Modig allegedly tried to ram the officers' cars and struggled  
with police when they caught up with him in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In the trunk of his car, authorities discovered 30 gallons of  
gasoline and other bomb components, as well as four guns, two 
22-inch machetes, 850 rounds of ammunition, a black ski mask and 
tactical goggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to burn the mosque because of the Iraqis associated  
with it,'' Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill McCarthy, the suspect's second cousin, said Modig lived in  
the basement of his south Denver home and kept to himself. He had 
served four years in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said Modig has had mental problems since a military  
motorcycle accident in Germany several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The poor guy has paid the price ever since then,'' McCarthy  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy said Modig has been in and out of VA hospitals. He said  
he has never heard Modig utter defamatory remarks about religious 
or ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad, he's such a beautiful person,'' McCarthy said.

<HEADLINE> J&AMP;J-Centocor Talks Reportedly Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merger talks between Johnson &AMP; Johnson and  
Centocor Inc. have been called off for the time being, according to 
a source close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Brunswick, N.J., health care and pharmaceutical giant  
had been in talks to acquire biotechnology firm Centocor, which 
could have given Johnson &AMP; Johnson a much needed presence in the 
cardiovascular drug market. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't immediately clear what led to the stoppage of talks,  
but there is the possibility they may resume, the source said 
Wednesday. Officials at Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Centocor couldn't be 
reached immediately for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Centocor makes ReoPro, a popular drug used to prevent blood  
clotting that had sales of $365 million last year. However, 
Centocor's existing agreement with Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. to co-market 
ReoPro may have proven to be a stumbling block -- Eli Lilly and 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson are competitors in a number of arenas,. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had said that Johnson &AMP; Johnson might want to acquire  
the drug maker to help revive weakening sales of its cardiovascular 
stents, the tiny devices that hold arteries open. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to drugs, Johnson &AMP; Johnson also makes many consumer  
products such as Band-Aids, Tylenol and baby shampoo.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Dall Porpoises Endangered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese fishermen are hunting too many dolphins in  
the Sea of Japan, endangering a population of Dall's porpoises, an 
environmental group charged today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dall's porpoises are being harvested heavily off Japan's shores  
and sold misleadingly as whale meat, a delicacy that earns 
fisherman considerable profit, the Environmental Investigation 
Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunts, which kill about 18,000 porpoises a year, imperil the  
species' ability to sustain its population, which Japan estimates 
at 440,000, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest hunt of any cetaceans species anywhere in  
the world,'' EIA chairman Alan Thornton told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based environmental group urged the Japanese  
government to comply with a 1990 recommendation by the 
International Whaling Commission to regulate catches so they fall 
below 1985 levels of 10,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Thornton said hunting of Dall's porpoises increased dramatically  
after the introduction of a 1986 moratorium on large whale hunting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government insists that its quota on dolphin  
catches of 22,180 a year is sufficient to ensure the survival of 
the Dall's porpoise. 
</P>
<P>
	Dall's porpoise hunting peaked in 1987, after the whale hunting  
moratorium sent dolphin prices soaring in Japan. More than 40,000 
porpoises were caught that year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the government has since imposed regulations on dolphin  
hunting, said an official for Japan's Fisheries Agency, who only 
gave his surname, Hyugaji. 
</P>
<P>
	Hajime Ishikawa, an expert at the Institute of Cetacean  
Research, was skeptical about the EIA's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't understand why they are getting upset about dolphin  
hunting right now,'' said Ishikawa. ``If fishermen were taking 
40,000 porpoises like they were ten years ago it would indeed be 
serious, but that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ishikawa said it was well known that porpoise meat is often sold  
as whale meat, but that the practice was not illegal as porpoises 
are considered a type of whale in Japan.

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Out of Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- As he crossed the street and walked toward his  
waiting car, D. Wayne Lukas couldn't help but flash a huge smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame trainer had just attended the post-position  
draw for Saturday's Preakness, and his Kentucky Derby winner 
Charismatic ended up in a perfect spot -- No. 6 in what is expected 
to end up as a 12-horse field after the filly Silverbulletday was 
withdrawn today and Vicar was expected to be withdrawn Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the zone,'' Lukas said Wednesday night. ``I'm tickled  
to death with the draw. Things are falling into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, Lukas' other 3-year-old colt, fared well, too, with  
the trainer selecting the No. 3 slot for his third-place Derby 
finisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about Charismatic. I think he's peaked at the  
right time,'' Lukas said, even though the Derby winner was the 
third choice at 6-1 in the early-morning line. ``And I expect Cat 
Thief to keep everyone honest. It won't surprise me if he wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest jolt was reserved for trainer Bob Baffert, who was  
hoping his star fillies would draw favorable posts. Excellent 
Meeting did and is definitely in; Silverbulletday didn't and is 
definitely out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silverbulletday will run Friday in the Black-Eyed Susan,''  
Mike Pegram, the filly's owner said today at the Preakness' 
traditional ``alibi breakfast.'' ``I think Bob will be well 
represented in the Derby with Excellent Meeting. We're disappointed 
because we came here to run in the Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby after a strong finish,  
drew the No. 7 post, while Silverbulletday, a winner in 10 of 11 
career starts -- none against males -- got the outside No. 14 spot. 
No Preakness winner ever came out of the No. 14 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday drew the rail for the Black-Eyed Susan, and will  
face seven other fillies. Baffert said Wednesday that 
Silverbulletday needed to draw a post from 4-10, or the No. 1 slot 
to get a shot at the boys for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to tell us not to run,'' Baffert said after  
the draw. ``She's a great filly. The Preakness is a great race. But 
these fillies come around rarely. I have to be careful what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, who had a rough trip in finishing 18th in the Derby, also  
was expected to be withdrawn by trainer Carl Nafzger. Vicar drew 
the No 13 post, and Nafzger said: ``I will not be starting from the 
No. 13 hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Silverbulletday out of the Preakness, jockey Gary Stevens  
became available and will now ride Stephen Got Even on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, runner-up in the Derby by neck to the 31-1 shot  
Charismatic, was the 5-2 favorite, while Excellent Meeting was next 
at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected 12-horse field for the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness  
would include a record nine Derby horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning Colors, Lukas' 1988 Derby winner, was the last filly to  
run in the Preakness, finishing third. Four fillies have won the 
Preakness, but none since Nellie Morse in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas might have a little history on his side, too, as he shoots  
for his fifth Preakness win -- the No. 6 gate has produced 13 
winners of the second leg of the Triple Crown, the most of any post 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also got the only Triple Crown contender in Charismatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've won a Triple Crown, but I needed two horses to do it,''  
Lukas said, referring to 1995, when Thunder Gulch won the Derby and 
Belmont, but stablemate Timber Country took the Preakness. ``Maybe 
one of these days, we'll win all three with one horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic might be the one, even though his reputation suffers  
because he was put in claiming races twice -- the last on Feb. 11 -- 
and could have been purchased for $62,500 after either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the story all week will be he's a claimer, and  
everything went his way in the Derby,'' Lukas said. ``But don't 
discredit the horse because I was foolish enough to run him in a 
claiming race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, might be light on  
victories, but he's the most seasoned Preakness starter of all. 
He'll be racing for the 16th time -- fourth since the Santa Anita 
Derby April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be a two-week horse,'' Lukas said. ``I think he's  
had a little attitude adjustment from the Derby. He's focused. He's 
been laid back all spring. He ran a good Derby, never turned a 
hair. I think he's ready to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness draw was handled the same way as the Derby draw --  
a draft order was selected and trainers picked their spots based on 
that order. Baffert had the 13th pick with Silverbulletday and 
Nafzger had the 14th pick. When it came time for them to make their 
picks, they held an impromptu coin toss, and Nafzger won, taking 
the 13th post. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Bob's idea,'' Nafzger said. ``I ain't that smart.''  
</P>
<P>
	The nine Derby horses running Saturday are Charismatic, Menifee,  
Cat Thief, Excellent Meeting, Kimberlite Pipe, Worldly Manner, 
Stephen Got Even, Valhol and Adonis. The newcomers are Badge, 
Patience Game and Torrid Sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Preakness winner who did not run in the Derby was  
Deputed Testamony in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, is Torrid Sand (Tim Doocy, 60-1);  
Kimberlite Pipe (Shane Sellers, 20-1); Cat Thief (Mike Smith, 8-1); 
Badge (Mike Luzzi, 50-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 5-2); Charismatic 
(Chris Antley, 6-1); Excellent Meeting (Kent Desormeaux, 5-1); 
Patience Game (Corey Nakatani, 30-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 30-1); 
Worldly Manner (Jerry Bailey, 12-1); Stephen Got Even (Gary 
Stevens, 10-1); Valhol (Edgar Prado, 99-1), and Vicar (Robby 
Albarado, 30-1).

<HEADLINE> Two Sponsors Interested in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Organizers of the scandal-bruised 2002  
Winter Games plan to ask for concessions from the International 
Olympic Committee in meetings here next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Organizing Committee wants to renegotiate the  
contract with the IOC to reduce Salt Lake's costs; to defer royalty 
payments on merchandise, sponsorships and tickets; and the chance 
to go after technology sponsors, chief executive officer Mitt 
Romney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're looking for from our other stakeholders is some  
help,'' Romney told the SLOC board's management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC Coordination Commission will meet Monday through  
Thursday, the group's first meeting here since this winter's 
scandal over Salt Lake's excessive wooing of IOC members during its 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen IOC members and members of the Lausanne,  
Switzerland-based organization's staff will review the city's 
preparations for the games, less than three years away. 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles and a  
member of the SLOC board's management committee, said the IOC is 
open to discussion, if not agreement, on concessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will work with them. We always have,'' DeFrantz said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake is $350 million short of meeting its $1.45 billion  
budget, and though two corporations this week began flirting with 
the SLOC, the committee isn't counting on sponsor wariness 
evaporating any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	No new companies have signed on for the 2002 Winter Games since  
last summer, even before the scandal left corporations wondering 
about the value of Olympics sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney on Thursday reviewed some $84 million that could be  
sliced from the budget, including expenses related to the IOC as 
well as no lunches for volunteers and a $2 million cut in his own 
budget, ensuring he gets no paycheck. He first discussed the cuts 
in March, and staffers are scrutinizing the budget in more detail 
before proposing specific reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC could save $1.5 million to $2 million if the IOC will  
allow it to defer paying royalties on merchandise, sponsorships, 
tickets and cash contributions, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	By paying the IOC later, the SLOC can match the payments to its  
revenue stream and avoid borrowing from a line of credit. It would 
save on interest expenses, bank fees and premiums for games 
cancellation insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a lot of money, Romney conceded, but such a gesture  
would have value, he said. ``It ... communicates that the IOC is 
with us,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to specify which parts of the SLOC contract with the  
IOC he wants to renegotiate, but said he plans to ask for the same 
concessions Sydney received. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2002 Summer Games last  
month agreed to let Sydney provide less in the way of such services 
as travel, accommodations and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee also is being asked to accept later  
payments of royalties and a renegotiated contract, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	In neither case is the Salt Lake committee trying to reduce the  
amount of money it owes the IOC as the local franchisee for the 
games, Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in an adversarial relationship. We are in a  
collaborative relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potentially more important to the SLOC is persuading the IOC to  
let the U.S. Olympic Committee and Salt Lake organizers go after 
certain types of technology sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM for years has had a lock on all aspects of technology  
sponsorship through its contract with the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	That changes after the 2002 Summer Games. The IOC has chosen the  
European company Sema as the information technologies systems 
integrator beginning in 2001, and is in negotiations for a computer 
hardware sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is still grappling with the question of what categories  
of technology sponsorship to keep as its own and which to turn over 
to national Olympic committees. Some possible categories include 
suppliers of routers, switches, instantaneous Internet games 
results and Internet ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to pry some of these things loose from the big  
umbrella,'' Romney said. ``We would have the potential to sell in 
each of those categories if they released them to us. Today we 
can't do that.''

<HEADLINE> Grains Rise on Export Hopes / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures advanced today on the Chicago Board  
of Trade amid signs the export outlook for corn and wheat is 
improving. Soybeans retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department reported  
corn exports last week of 1.336 million metric tons, the fifth 
consecutive week that sales have topped 1 million metric tons. The 
unexpectedly strong demand has raised expectations the government 
will boost annual export projections and lower estimates for ending 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also was supported by continued rains across Midwest  
growing regions, which was delaying fieldwork as time runs out for 
getting crops into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced after the USDA reported weekly exports of  
436,400 metric tons for the current and upcoming marketing year. 
The combined total came in above expectations and lent support to 
expectations that Asian demand may be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also saw continued support from the government projections  
that the winter wheat crop will be far smaller than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans moved lower amid worry that smaller corn acreage could  
translate into larger soybeans acreage, at a time when the 
government already is predicting a record crop. Market participants 
also were concerned about the coming competition for exports from 
the competing Brazilian bumper crop. Soybeans found some support 
from strong weekly export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent to $2.71 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 cent to $2.24 1/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to $1.27 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 1 1/4 cents to $4.74 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork and live cattle futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .22 cents to 61.30 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .75 cent to 72.85 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
were unchanged at 59.875 a pound; July pork bellies rose .75 cent 
to 59.025 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Talks Held in Fen-Phen Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The manufacturer of the diet drug combination  
fen-phen is in talks to settle millions of health claims brought by 
people who contend the drug caused leaky heart valves and 
often-fatal lung problems, lawyers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations with pharmaceutical giant American Home Products  
Corp. began several weeks ago, but talks are still too preliminary 
to put a price tag on a possible settlement, Houston lawyer Graham 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how any lawyer on the plaintiffs' side at this  
point could say what it would take to settle all the cases,'' said 
Hill, whose firm represents 100 people who say they developed 
health problems after using fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	James Peterson, another plaintiff's lawyer, said the drug  
company initiated the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the possibility of  
a national agreement Thursday, said American Home would pay 
billions of dollars under such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for American Home, the world's seventh-largest  
pharmaceutical company, declined comment. A trial is scheduled 
later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, American Home reached a settlement in the first  
trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen. The company reportedly 
agreed to a $500,000 settlement to one plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 individual lawsuits have been filed against  
fen-phen, and class-action lawsuits asking the company to pay for 
medical checkups and future medical treatments have been certified 
in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 6 million people in the United States took  
fen-phen. Trial lawyers contend thousands suffered problems such as 
leaky heart valves and primary pulmonary hypertension, an 
often-fatal lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary,  
marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- and 
Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine and Redux  
off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's 
request after a Mayo Clinic study linked the drugs to potentially 
fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides met Wednesday in Houston, Hill said.  
Other meetings have occurred over the past two weeks in 
Philadelphia and New York. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible settlement of the class-action cases could involve  
American Home paying for medical examinations of fen-phen users who 
have not yet reported health problems, Hill said. It has not yet 
been decided whether those diagnosed with problems would be 
eligible for damages.

	Bargainers Complete Kosovo Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A compromise package financing the bombardment  
of Yugoslavia and aid to Central America was agreed upon by 
House-Senate bargainers Thursday night, but the deal drops 
controversial proposals to create loan guarantee programs for 
ailing steel and energy companies. The House and Senate planned to 
vote on the wide-ranging spending measure next week and ship it to 
President Clinton. Working into the night, negotiators from the two 
chambers capped their third day of bargaining by agreeing to 
consider the proposed loan programs in a separate bill in coming 
weeks.

	NATO Planes To Strike From Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- The Turkish military is preparing bases in  
western Turkey for NATO planes conducting airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia, officials said Thursday. The use of Turkish bases for 
NATO attacks completes what alliance officials say is a strategy to 
``encircle Yugoslavia 360 degrees.'' Hungary announced last week 
that NATO combat missions would operate from its soil. Turkey's 
military general staff said in a statement that ``some NATO planes 
will take part in the operation from bases in western Anatolia 
following the completion of our work.'' It did not give a 
timeframe. The Cabinet authorized the military to make arrangements 
for NATO planes Tuesday.

Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson said. The well is 20 to

	GOP Reconsidering Gun Control  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing increased pressure for the vote against  
gun control measures at gun shows, Senate Republicans indicated 
Thursday they may be ready to make concessions on the issue. 
Republicans called for fresh restrictions on sales at gun shows 
less than 24 hours after rejecting them despite public outrage over 
last month's high school shootings in Colorado. But Democrats 
denounced the new offer, saying it contained numerous loopholes. 
``It's the most Swiss-cheesy bill I've ever seen,'' said Sen.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of a charter bus that crashed and  
killed 22 people was fired from bus companies in 1996 and 1989 
after testing positive for marijuana four times, authorities said 
Thursday. A federal investigator also confirmed a report that Frank 
Bedell, 46, tested positive for marijuana when he was hospitalized 
Sunday after the bus veered off a highway and plunged into an

	Netanyahu Losing Some Support

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's  
traditional support among ex-Soviet Jews is faltering, the former 
dissident who leads a powerful immigrants party said Thursday. 
Natan Sharansky, the industry and trade minister in Netanyahu's 
government, also refused to endorse the prime minister -- who is 
trailing badly in the polls ahead of Monday's election. Netanyahu 
had been lobbying Sharansky to make a declaration of support, 
reportedly offering his Israel B'Aliya party three ministries if he 
did so.

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sergei Berezin stuffed a rebound into an open  
net at 2:18 of overtime, giving the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3-2 
victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins Thursday night. The victory 
tied the series, with each team winning once at home and once on 
the road. The Penguins, in position to put a 3-1 stranglehold on 
the Eastern Conference semifinal series, couldn't hold a 1-0 lead 
and then lost because of a defensive error after tying the game on 
Brad Werenka's third-period goal.

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Out of Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- As he crossed the street and walked toward his  
waiting car, D. Wayne Lukas couldn't help but flash a huge smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame trainer had just attended the post-position  
draw for Saturday's Preakness, and his Kentucky Derby winner 
Charismatic ended up in a perfect spot -- No. 6 in what is expected 
to end up as a 12-horse field after the filly Silverbulletday was 
withdrawn today and Vicar was expected to be withdrawn Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the zone,'' Lukas said Wednesday night. ``I'm tickled  
to death with the draw. Things are falling into place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, Lukas' other 3-year-old colt, fared well, too, with  
the trainer selecting the No. 3 slot for his third-place Derby 
finisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great about Charismatic. I think he's peaked at the  
right time,'' Lukas said, even though the Derby winner was the 
third choice at 6-1 in the early-morning line. ``And I expect Cat 
Thief to keep everyone honest. It won't surprise me if he wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest jolt was reserved for trainer Bob Baffert, who was  
hoping his star fillies would draw favorable posts. Excellent 
Meeting did and is definitely in; Silverbulletday didn't and is 
definitely out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silverbulletday will run Friday in the Black-Eyed Susan,''  
Mike Pegram, the filly's owner said today at the Preakness' 
traditional ``alibi breakfast.'' ``I think Bob will be well 
represented in the Derby with Excellent Meeting. We're disappointed 
because we came here to run in the Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, fifth in the Derby after a strong finish,  
drew the No. 7 post, while Silverbulletday, a winner in 10 of 11 
career starts -- none against males -- got the outside No. 14 spot. 
No Preakness winner ever came out of the No. 14 post. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday drew the rail for the Black-Eyed Susan, and will  
face seven other fillies. Baffert said Wednesday that 
Silverbulletday needed to draw a post from 4-10, or the No. 1 slot 
to get a shot at the boys for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to tell us not to run,'' Baffert said after  
the draw. ``She's a great filly. The Preakness is a great race. But 
these fillies come around rarely. I have to be careful what I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, who had a rough trip in finishing 18th in the Derby, also  
was expected to be withdrawn by trainer Carl Nafzger. Vicar drew 
the No 13 post, and Nafzger said: ``I will not be starting from the 
No. 13 hole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Silverbulletday out of the Preakness, jockey Gary Stevens  
became available and will now ride Stephen Got Even on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, runner-up in the Derby by neck to the 31-1 shot  
Charismatic, was the 5-2 favorite, while Excellent Meeting was next 
at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The expected 12-horse field for the 1 3-16th-mile Preakness  
would include a record nine Derby horses. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning Colors, Lukas' 1988 Derby winner, was the last filly to  
run in the Preakness, finishing third. Four fillies have won the 
Preakness, but none since Nellie Morse in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas might have a little history on his side, too, as he shoots  
for his fifth Preakness win -- the No. 6 gate has produced 13 
winners of the second leg of the Triple Crown, the most of any post 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also got the only Triple Crown contender in Charismatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've won a Triple Crown, but I needed two horses to do it,''  
Lukas said, referring to 1995, when Thunder Gulch won the Derby and 
Belmont, but stablemate Timber Country took the Preakness. ``Maybe 
one of these days, we'll win all three with one horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic might be the one, even though his reputation suffers  
because he was put in claiming races twice -- the last on Feb. 11 -- 
and could have been purchased for $62,500 after either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the story all week will be he's a claimer, and  
everything went his way in the Derby,'' Lukas said. ``But don't 
discredit the horse because I was foolish enough to run him in a 
claiming race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, might be light on  
victories, but he's the most seasoned Preakness starter of all. 
He'll be racing for the 16th time -- fourth since the Santa Anita 
Derby April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to be a two-week horse,'' Lukas said. ``I think he's  
had a little attitude adjustment from the Derby. He's focused. He's 
been laid back all spring. He ran a good Derby, never turned a 
hair. I think he's ready to run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness draw was handled the same way as the Derby draw --  
a draft order was selected and trainers picked their spots based on 
that order. Baffert had the 13th pick with Silverbulletday and 
Nafzger had the 14th pick. When it came time for them to make their 
picks, they held an impromptu coin toss, and Nafzger won, taking 
the 13th post. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Bob's idea,'' Nafzger said. ``I ain't that smart.''  
</P>
<P>
	The nine Derby horses running Saturday are Charismatic, Menifee,  
Cat Thief, Excellent Meeting, Kimberlite Pipe, Worldly Manner, 
Stephen Got Even, Valhol and Adonis. The newcomers are Badge, 
Patience Game and Torrid Sand. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Preakness winner who did not run in the Derby was  
Deputed Testamony in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The field, from the rail out, is Torrid Sand (Tim Doocy, 60-1);  
Kimberlite Pipe (Shane Sellers, 20-1); Cat Thief (Mike Smith, 8-1); 
Badge (Mike Luzzi, 50-1); Menifee (Pat Day, 5-2); Charismatic 
(Chris Antley, 6-1); Excellent Meeting (Kent Desormeaux, 5-1); 
Patience Game (Corey Nakatani, 30-1); Adonis (Jorge Chavez, 30-1); 
Worldly Manner (Jerry Bailey, 12-1); Stephen Got Even (Gary 
Stevens, 10-1); Valhol (Edgar Prado, 99-1), and Vicar (Robby 
Albarado, 30-1).

<HEADLINE> Tycoon Behind Russia Dismissals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Whenever there is Kremlin political intrigue, the  
name of Russia's most prominent business tycoon is rarely far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again Thursday, when Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of  
parliament's lower house, said he saw the ``clear political 
intrigues of Boris Berezovsky behind the dismissal of Yevgeny 
Primakov.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Primakov as prime minister on  
Wednesday and named Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin to replace 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky, a multimillionaire with holdings in oil, media and  
airlines, had been at odds with Primakov ever since he was named 
prime minister in September. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eyes of many Russians, Berezovsky is a sinister figure, a  
master manipulator who uses his Kremlin connections and wealth to 
run the country from behind the scenes. Berezovsky, who seeks the 
limelight, dismisses the allegations, insisting he's just a 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named last year to oversee the Commonwealth of  
Independent States, a grouping of ex-Soviet republics, but was 
dismissed from the post in April. 
</P>
<P>
	In parliament on Thursday, Seleznyov said that although he had  
lost his official government job, Berezovsky continued ``to exert 
very serious political pressure on the processes in Russia,'' the 
Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	He said by getting rid of Primakov, Berezovsky stood to profit  
from the political chaos caused by the premier's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was fired by Yeltsin, Primakov publicly criticized  
Berezovsky for meddling in the Cabinet's work. His critics say 
Berezovsky epitomizes the modern Russian business mogul, having 
relied on close Kremlin contacts to build his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	His ties to the Kremlin leadership and Yeltsin's family are so  
close that he was also rumored to have masterminded the ouster of 
two previous prime ministers, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei 
Kiriyenko, to further his own business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of Berezovsky's manipulation, Seleznyov said, was the  
appointment of Railway Minister Nikolai Aksenenko to the post of 
acting deputy prime minister. Besides Stepashin, he was the only 
member of Primakov's Cabinet not to be dismissed along with the 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Aksenenko has been in charge of the nation's railroads since  
1997, and is said to have close ties with Berezovsky and Yeltsin's 
family, according to some politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky also has reportedly cultivated close ties with  
Yeltsin's daughter and political adviser, Tatyana Dyachenko. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent freely to support Yeltsin's 1996 re-election victory,  
and shortly afterward, was named to the Security Council despite 
howls of protest over his lack of government and military 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin later fired Berezovsky, but said he would welcome the  
chance to work with him again.

<HEADLINE> Fish Oil May Treat Manic Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The fatty acids in fish oil may help ease  
symptoms of manic depression, a new study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a four-month study of 30 people undergoing treatment for  
manic depression, researchers found that the omega-3 fatty acids in 
fish oil could act as mood stabilizers, providing short-term 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Stoll, the lead author of the study conducted at the  
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, acknowledged that the 
research was preliminary but said it ``opens the door for more 
research on omega-3 fatty acid's effect on a variety of other 
psychiatric disorders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study is published in the May issue of the Archives of  
General Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects were between the ages of 18 and 65 and were also  
undergoing prescribed treatment for manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen were given pills with the equivalent of 15 cans of tuna  
a day. Sixteen patients were given placebo pills made out of olive 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 14 patients who got the omega-3 fatty acids  
experienced relief of their symptoms; three of the 16 who got the 
placebo described such relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have hypothesized that overactive cell-signaling  
pathways in the brain cause bipolar disorder. The study concluded 
that the ingestion of large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, a type 
of polyunsaturated fat, can dampen these cell-signaling pathways. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingesting the fish oil had no significant side effects other  
than some cases of mild gastrointestinal distress, researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers acknowledged that the study involved a small number  
of patients and might have been compromised because some subjects 
reported a distinct ``fishy'' taste that may have tipped them off 
to their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Francisco Fernandez, chairman of the psychiatry department  
at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill., said he also 
had concerns about the study's methods but said they didn't detract 
from the promising results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, all these things will need to be addressed in a  
follow-up study,'' Fernandez said. ``But I think it's very 
encouraging. It's not something that takes a leap of faith.''

<HEADLINE> Toddler Freed From Kansas Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULVANE, Kan. (AP) -- A toddler who fell 16 feet into a narrow  
well Thursday night was pulled free about five hours later after 
firefighters dug a tunnel to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters freed 17-month-old Jesse shortly before midnight as  
his family waited above. He was strapped to a board and appeared to 
be in good shape, rescuers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was immediately taken away by ambulance to the hospital.  
During the rescue effort, Jesse was ``very vocal, he's been talking 
to us and crying,'' Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 emergency workers worked under emergency flood lights  
as Jesse's parents, whose names were not released, talked to their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters dug a tunnel about 25 feet deep near the well and  
tunneled toward it to reach the child. Rescuers worked in 15-minute 
shifts, digging by hand toward the well and taking dirt out in 
5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 neighbors joined television crews that were kept about  
a block from the scene in a recently built housing development in 
Mulvane, 20 miles south of Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were able to get a rope around his wrist, so he is  
somewhat secure,'' Mulvane Mayor Jim Ford told KSNW-TV. ``And he 
did help with the rope so that's telling us it's doing pretty 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The well is 20 to 25 feet deep and only 8 to 10 inches wide. The  
boy was outside with his father shortly before 7 p.m. when he fell 
16 feet and became stuck with one arm over his head, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers fed oxygen to Jesse through tubes lowered into the well  
to help the child breathe. Thompson said Jesse occasionally grabbed 
hold of a tube or tugged it. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers used lumber to shore up the well's sides to  
prevent rocks or dirt from falling on the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the rescue, Thompson said the diggers were working  
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened in Midland, Texas. It's a very similar  
situation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1987, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an  
abandoned well in Midland and became trapped 22 feet down in a hole 
8 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
	It took emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach the little girl. They  
rescued her after digging a shaft parallel to the one that trapped 
her and then breaking through the wall of the well.

<HEADLINE> China's Entry to WTO Said On Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The furor in Beijing over NATO's bombing of the  
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia should not affect talks on Beijing's 
entry into the World Trade Organization, a top American trade 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remain optimistic ... that we can bring China into the WTO  
on a commercially strong basis ... this year,'' U.S. Trade 
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said bringing China into the world's leading trade  
organizations would be an important step in moving the country 
toward international norms, including the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must continue to engage China (despite) whatever  
difficulties, whatever setbacks there are, and bring it toward the 
global community,'' Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky also it is important to move forward on other  
applications for WTO membership, including those of Taiwan and some 
former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade representative was in Tokyo for meetings with  
officials from the European Union, Japan and Canada on an upcoming 
round of world trade talks scheduled to begin next year in Seattle, 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's bombing of Beijing's embassy in Belgrade last Friday,  
which killed three Chinese journalists, set off waves of protests 
in China and prompted Beijing to cut off discussions on military 
relations and other affairs with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the Tokyo American Center, Barshefsky said  
Japan's foot-dragging on implementing trade pacts with the United 
States was fanning tensions between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``On flat glass, autos and auto parts, insurance and government  
procurement, we have serious concerns about implementation of our 
trade agreements,'' she said in a copy of her speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Full adherence to their spirit and letter is essential to  
trust and progress in the bilateral relationship,'' Barshefsky 
said. ``Failures of implementation lead to rapid erosion of trust 
and rising tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky pointed to the case of steel, which the U.S.  
government has accused Japanese producers of dumping in the 
American market at below-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel exports to the United States soared last year,  
and President Clinton has threatened action unless the exports drop 
to pre-1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the rest of Asia, Barshefsky said Japan should take a  
stronger hand in helping its neighbors recover from the regional 
financial crisis by opening up its markets. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the United States increased its imports of East Asian  
products by $6 billion last year, while Japan's purchases from the 
region fell by $19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan, the world's second largest economy, has not played the  
leadership role it should in supporting Asian recovery or in the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,'' Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the trade talks next year, Barshefsky said the WTO needs to  
be reformed to meet challenges of financial crisis, trade barriers 
and developing countries' access to industrial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, the EU, Japan and Canada agreed Wednesday to  
try to conclude the upcoming world trade talks in three years, less 
than half the time the last round took. 
</P>
<P>
	But an agreement on how to conduct the round eluded the  
minister-level trade officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and the EU want concurrent negotiations on a sweeping  
range of trade issues, but the United States favors an 
issue-by-issue approach. Canada has proposed a compromise plan of 
grouping together related issues to speed up the Seattle round.

<HEADLINE> CNN Loses Equipment Covering War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN is taking a financial beating in Yugoslavia,  
estimating that $1.1 million of its equipment has been stolen, 
damaged or destroyed since the NATO bombing began. 
</P>
<P>
	That includes five CNN-owned vehicles and a rental car. The  
single biggest item, a $400,000 satellite transmitter located next 
to the Serb TV facility in Belgrade, was destroyed when NATO bombed 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``In CNN's existence of nearly 20 years, we've never encountered  
anything like this,'' said Eason Jordan, CNN's president of 
newsgathering and international networks. ``It's unprecedented for 
us and, as far as I know, it's unprecedented for any news 
organization. And the tally continues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The losses are on top of the day-to-day expenses of covering the  
conflict, which Jordan estimated were an average of $150,000 per 
day initially. Those costs are now somewhat lower. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's losses dwarf those of other networks. Executives believe  
CNN is often targeted specifically because the network is seen in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serbian mob that attacked correspondent Brent Sadler before  
they left Kosovo destroyed or damaged three of the vehicles, a 
camera, a night scope and other equipment worth more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have seized CNN equipment at various locations,  
including a hotel in Belgrade, a roadblock in Montenegro, the 
Yugoslavian-Croat border and an Internet work site raided by 
Belgrade police, the network said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Yugoslavian authorities handed a CNN crew a  
receipt for confiscated items. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not necessarily stolen equipment,'' Jordan said, ``but I  
doubt we will ever see it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian authorities ordered journalists from NATO countries out  
when the bombing started, but then allowed many to trickle back in. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN won't talk about security arrangements for its personnel,  
but admit to concern about statements put out by authorities that 
the network is a ``factory of lies'' and that its leaders should be 
put on trial for war crimes, Jordan said. CNN reporter Christopher 
Burns left Yugoslavia in the early days of the attack after the 
network was told his life might be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN can cover some of its monetary losses through insurance, and  
it often charges higher advertising rates during news crises 
because viewership shoots up. But Jordan was not certain how much 
this would make up for what CNN has lost. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS ``has not lost anything of value,'' spokeswoman Sandra  
Genelius said, with the exception of a mobile uplink machine. ABC 
had some tapes confiscated but, along with NBC, said equipment loss 
hadn't been a problem.

<HEADLINE> Reeve Helps California Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Paralyzed star Christopher Reeve believes he  
will someday walk again, but a video of him in a walking motion in 
an experimental therapy session shouldn't be misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Superman'' star was videotaped recently suspended in a  
harness while researchers moved his feet and legs in a walking 
motion on a treadmill. He's participated in research at the 
University of California, Los Angeles, aimed at regenerating nerves 
in the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeve has been paralyzed since 1995 when he was thrown from a  
horse. The video was shared with TV stations on Wednesday, and UCLA 
researchers have been besieged with requests for interviews ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's experimental and researchers don't want to give the  
impression Christopher Reeve is going to be walking anytime soon,'' 
said UCLA spokesman Warren Robak. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have refused media interviews, saying the research  
is too preliminary and would send the wrong message to others with 
spinal cord injuries, Robak said.

<HEADLINE> Wesleyan Reviews Pornography Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- The president of Wesleyan University  
has ordered a review of a class that he says may be too liberal for 
the liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
	The course, ``Pornography: Writing of Prostitutes,'' examines  
pornography as a cultural and political practice. Its reading list 
includes the Marquis de Sade and academic critiques of Hustler 
magazine. As a final project, students must produce their own work 
of pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	One student in Professor Hope Weissman's class submitted a short  
film that focused on a man's eyes while he masturbated. In another, 
a female student acted out a scene of sexual bondage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Weissman, a self-described feminist who helped develop the  
women's studies program at the school, told The Hartford Courant 
that she puts no constraints on her students' project ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I push people over the line, whatever their line is, but only  
when I think they can go there and come back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The projects caught the attention of university President  
Douglas Bennett, who in a memo dated Tuesday and distributed to 
faculty questioned ``the appropriateness of this course in the 
Wesleyan curriculum.'' He ordered a review of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Edwards-Tiekert, a junior majoring in English and American  
studies, complained the review was spurred by media reports -- and 
not complaints from students or alumni. He said the school is 
sacrificing academic freedom for public image. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taken the faculty out of the equation,'' Edwards-Tiekert  
said. ``It just seems like a very dangerous trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Holder, a spokesman for Wesleyan, denied that the  
university is compromising academic standards. He said the class 
went through the traditional approval process when it debuted last 
year, but university officials had no way of knowing every aspect 
of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	``By asserting responsibility for the content of our curriculum,  
we are strengthening it,'' Holder said.

<HEADLINE> `Midsummer' Tests Fans Love of Bard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ever since ``Shakespeare in Love'' dominated  
the Oscars, they've been saying the Bard is hotter than ever in 
Hollywood. But now comes a big test -- the wide release of ``A 
Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie opens Friday with big stars, aggressive advertising  
and promotional tie-ins with cosmetics and spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, it also opens just days before the May 19 release of the  
latest ``Star Wars'' installment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a risk,'' said Lindsay Law, president of Fox Searchlight  
Pictures, which is releasing the Shakespeare movie on 1,000 screens 
-- 150 more than the company's biggest success to date, ``The Full 
Monty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If no one shows up, I'm in trouble,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the successes of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a  
fictionalized account of the Bard's life, filming one of his plays 
largely as written is far from a sure bet for a studio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenneth Branagh-directed ``Much Ado About Nothing'' in 1993  
and ``Hamlet'' starring Mel Gibson in 1990 barely made $20 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Midsummer'' budget was $14 million, a bargain considering  
the cast includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett 
and Calista Flockhart. All worked cheaply for a chance to do 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the cast, ``Midsummer'' may be helped by the  
seven Oscars ``Shakespeare in Love'' won. The movie went on to 
gross more than $94 million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' served as an introduction to the power  
of his prose and poetry -- and may have helped adjust the ear to the 
high language that so often throws off modern movie-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare is no longer some onerous name at the top of a  
curriculum that kids look at and say, `I've got to read this?''' 
Kline said. ``He's now this attractive young English guy who falls 
madly in love with Gwyneth Paltrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Midsummer'' the play is already seen as one of the most  
understandable of Shakespeare's works, and ``Midsummer'' the movie 
sticks closely to the text, though it takes some liberties, 
shifting the setting from the forests of Greece to Tuscany and 
moving the time period up to the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Another change is to Kline's character, Nick Bottom, the hammy  
actor who is transformed into a donkey. Though usually played for 
comic relief, Bottom's role is strengthened in the movie to make 
him the emotional center of the production. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Flockhart for her first big movie role since hitting TV  
stardom as Ally McBeal was one of the many casting coups for 
director, writer and co-producer Michael Hoffman, though he 
acknowledged that in Flockhart's case it was just luck. She had not 
reached her white-hot success when hired to play the lovelorn 
Helena. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low budget means that Searchlight doesn't need  
``Shakespeare in Love'' numbers to break even. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio has hedged its bets by striking promotional deals, a  
common practice for big-studio movies but almost unheard-of for a 
specialty film. Max Factor created a line of ``Midsummer'' 
cosmetics and Classico Pasta Sauce sponsored a sweepstakes and put 
out a cookbook of recipes ``inspired by the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film's soundtrack, featuring performances by opera stars,  
debuted in the Top 10 on the classical charts.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Poised To Eliminate Bruins / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Don't talk to the Boston Bruins about  
pressure. They know all about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is on us now and we've been a team that's  
responded to it pretty well throughout the season,'' Boston 
goaltender Byron Dafoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins trail the Buffalo Sabres 2-1 in the best-of-7 Eastern  
Conference semifinals, with Game 4 set for Friday night in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins say they can handle the pressure of being behind;  
they've done it before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we're in a panic situation yet, but the next  
game is the game,'' Bruins captain Ray Bourque said Thursday. 
``We've got to find a way to put them away. We don't want to go 
home down 3-1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added coach Pat Burns: ``This is not the end of the world. It's  
not how you get knocked down. It's how you get back up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks now the Bruins have been bouncing back. They surged to  
make the playoffs. They ousted Carolina after losing two of the 
first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they're faced with an another uphill climb, thanks to their  
3-2 loss to the Sabres on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a lot of fight left in them,'' said Sabres coach  
Lindy Ruff, whose team won Game 3 with forechecking and a barrage 
of shots in the third period. ``They're not going to go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres faded in the first two periods Wednesday after  
winning the second game in Boston. But they rediscovered their 
physical game just in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't seem like we were fully prepared for it,''  
Sabres defenseman Jay McKee said. ``I don't know why we came out 
that way, but hopefully we can sort it out and come out better 
(Friday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe insists he's not intimidated by the guy at the other end  
of the ice, Buffalo's two-time league MVP, Dominik Hasek. But Dafoe 
was shaky in Game 3, often losing the handle on rebounds and losing 
track of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple times I had a little miscommunication with my players  
behind the net, and a couple of times we got into a little bit of 
trouble,'' Dafoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bruins will need a nearly flawless game from Dafoe to  
even the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're going against Dominik Hasek there's extra  
pressure, because you know you're not going to get a lot of goals 
by him,'' Dafoe said. ``But I'm not the one who scores goals on 
Dominik, and all I can do is keep them off the board as long as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe did that for two periods in Game 3. But the Sabres won it  
with two goals in the third. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to have a better first and second period this time,''  
McKee said. ``Another start like we had the other night could kill 
us. We were lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have received balanced scoring without their leading  
scorer, injured Mirosalv Satan. Defensemen Jason Woolley and Rhett 
Warrener scored goals in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to get contributions from everybody and that  
includes the defense,'' said Sabres forward Dixon Ward, who scored 
the winner. ``We're missing Miro, who provided a lot of spark for 
us, and we have to find it somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who stonewalled the Bruins for the final 51 minutes,  
threw a scare into Buffalo's fans when he crumpled to the ice and 
allowed Boston's go-ahead goal by Anson Carter after being struck 
by a slap shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek took Thursday off, but is expected to play Friday.

<HEADLINE>  White Sox Pitcher Regaining Old Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Father really does know best, just ask Jaime  
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after being demoted to the bullpen with a bloated ERA,  
the Chicago White Sox pitcher is starting to show the form that 
made him one of the NL's best pitchers in 1995. And dear old dad 
deserves some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad used to be a sidethrower. I always saw him pitching  
like that, but I never tried it,'' Navarro said. ``In the 
offseason, I went to Puerto Rico and asked, 'What are you seeing?' 
He said I was maybe way too up to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Once in a while, come from the side like I used to  
throw.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Navarro tinkered with his throwing motion, lowering the angle  
of his arm. Instead of throwing over the top, he sometimes throws 
from around his shoulder. Other times it's lower, and occasionally 
it's even lower than that, almost a sidearm delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deception is there because it's harder for them to see the  
ball,'' White Sox pitching coach Nardi Contreras said. ``It takes 
them a little longer to see the ball, compared to where he was. In 
the past, you were able to see him right away, real easily, which 
gave them a longer look to see what was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that made Navarro easy prey.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Navarro won 14 games for the Chicago Cubs and was one  
of the NL's hottest pitchers with a 3.28 ERA. But when he moved 
across town two years later, he seemed to leave something behind. 
He went 9-14 in 1997 and didn't win a game the final six weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 8-16 last year, tied for the AL lead in losses. He  
didn't win a game after July 15, and manager Jerry Manuel finally 
demoted him to the bullpen. He was even booed by the White Sox 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad,'' Navarro said. ``It was frustrating. The fans  
have their right to be angry because they want to see a winner, and 
I was coming here to help the team, not let the team down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking everything too hard and trying to do too much and  
getting angry at a lot of things,'' he added. ``That just wasn't 
helping me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras tried to get Navarro to alter his throwing motion so  
his pitches wouldn't be so easy to see but had little success. 
Finally, in the offseason, with rumors swirling that the White Sox 
wanted to trade him, Navarro went to visit his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Julio Navarro, who pitched for the Los Angeles Angels, Detroit  
Tigers and Atlanta Braves during his career, told his son the same 
thing Contreras had: He needed to shorten his throwing motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Navarro also told his son he needed to work on his  
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Dad said, `I'd see you get angry last year. You'd get mad  
about one pitch and you were struggling. You've got to slow down; 
you've got to relax,''' Navarro said. ``I never lost confidence in 
myself. Never. I've just got to go out there and believe in myself 
that I can go out there and be a good pitcher, like I used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Navarro's 2-3 record and his 5.03 ERA may not be  
impressive at first glance, there's more to the numbers. He has a 
2.71 ERA over his last four starts. It would be even lower if he 
hadn't given up seven runs -- four earned -- and five hits in one 
inning against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really been on a roll lately,'' Manuel said. ``Other than  
that one inning in Baltimore, we are confident that he has arrived 
and is back to the form that made him one of the top pitchers in 
the NL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, Navarro just shrugged off the Baltimore game.  
In his next start, Monday against the AL West-leading Rangers, he 
pitched four-hit ball for eight innings and gave up just one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just taking things easy,'' he said. ``Whether I  
have a good game or a bad game, I control myself, learn about it, 
learn about what were the mistakes, keep working at it and never 
give up.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Bank Uses Eye Scan To Get Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A Texas bank has become the first in the nation  
to unveil an automatic teller machine that literally looks you in 
the eye before providing you with cash. 
</P>
<P>
	ATM users there will no longer have to deal with secret codes  
and plastic cards. That's because the new machines, introduced on 
Thursday by Bank United of Texas, scan a customer's right eye 
before granting access to the account. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to make lives easier,'' asserted Robert Van  
Naarden, vice-president of Sensar Inc., the Moorestown, N.J. 
license holder for the iris recognition technology used by Bank 
United and placed in three Texas ATM machines customized by 
ATM-maker Diebold Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's how it works: A customer has a close-up photo of his eye  
taken at the bank, and the picture is stored in a computer. When 
the customer goes up to the ATM to take out money, a press of a 
button starts an eye scan. The ATM then matches the picture of the 
iris with the one stored in the bank's database to confirm the 
customer's identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It knows you just by looking at you,'' said Ron Coben, Bank  
United executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept works because the intricate pattern of each person's  
iris is more distinctive than even a fingerprint. An iris contains 
266 measurable characteristics while a fingerprint contains about 
35. 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate, Richard Swartz, a 25-year-old Rice University  
graduate student, had his iris photographed by a bank employee. 
Minutes later, Swartz was able to withdraw $40 from his account 
without inserting a card or punching in a secret code. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Swartz's identical twin Michael walked up to the machine.  
But since his iris didn't match his brother's, the ATM refused him 
access. 
</P>
<P>
	Iris identification is already used at 11 banks outside the  
United States and may eventually be extended to many other kinds of 
financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Three bank machines, one in Fort Worth, Dallas and Houston were  
set up Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank United hopes to have more eye-scanning ATMs up and running  
within the next year. Several other banks in the United States are 
expected to unveil iris identification teller machines later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has a very high cool factor,'' Coben said. ``We think of it  
as James Bond meets stocks and bonds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response to questions about privacy concerns, Bank United  
said the iris pictures will not be distributed to anyone outside 
the bank.

<HEADLINE> Woman Said Shot by Mom Seeks Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Paralyzed from the neck down by a bullet,  
Georgette Smith wants to die, and if she gets her wish, her mother 
could be charged with her murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith, 42, is asking a judge to let doctors disconnect the  
ventilator keeping her alive. She was paralyzed after being shot by 
her 68-year-old mother, who apparently got upset after overhearing 
talk of putting her in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	At an emergency hearing Wednesday, Judge Richard Conrad said he  
wants to talk to Ms. Smith in person before deciding whether she 
can compel Lucerne Medical Center to let her die. The judge said he 
will rule next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I can do is wink my eyes and wiggle my nose, wiggle my  
tongue. I can't move any other part of my body,'' Ms. Smith said in 
a deposition. ``God, don't leave me this way. ... I can't live like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's mother, Shirley Egan, is charged with two counts of  
attempted murder and aggravated battery. Prosecutors plan to pursue 
murder charges if Ms. Smith is allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Egan's lawyer, Bob Wesley, said Thursday that Ms. Egan is  
confused but understands her daughter wants to be taken off the 
ventilator. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly was not her intention to shoot her daughter,''  
Wesley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith and her boyfriend were taking care of Ms. Egan at the  
time of the March 8 shooting. The mother apparently became upset 
after hearing that the two planned to move her to a nursing home. 
She fired at both of them, missing the boyfriend, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullet entered Ms. Smith's neck and severed her spine. She  
can speak with some effort, but she cannot swallow and needs a 
feeding tube. She has no control over her bladder or bowels and 
will always run a high risk of pneumonia, infections, ulcers and 
bedsores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to die because I can't live this way,'' Ms. Smith said  
in the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Smith's daughters, 22-year-old Candace Smith and 19-year-old  
Joeleen Hill, support their mother's decision to end her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's prepared herself because she knows she's lived a good  
life and she doesn't want to finish her life in this way,'' Candace 
Smith said in court Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The world-renowned cardiologist who told Boston  
Celtics player Reggie Lewis that he suffered from a minor fainting 
disorder conceded Thursday that the player showed signs of heart 
problems before he dropped dead shooting baskets in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gilbert Mudge, answering questions publicly for the first  
time since the NBA star's death at age 27, testified during his 
malpractice trial that he never discounted the possibility Lewis 
had a potentially fatal heart condition -- even as he told the 
player and the world that Lewis had a less serious neurological 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one of Lewis' many tests showed a potential sign of  
``life-threatening arrhythmia,'' Mudge said under intense 
questioning by Robert Harley, a lawyer for the player's widow. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the initial diagnosis of 12 doctors at New England  
Baptist Hospital, where Lewis was taken after he collapsed during a 
playoff game in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises turned to Mudge at Brigham and Women's Hospital for  
a second opinion, and he initially agreed. But after further tests, 
Mudge revised the diagnosis and told Lewis he had neurocardiogenic 
syncope, a condition that causes fainting spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, the player died of cardiac arrhythmia while  
practicing jump shots at Brandeis University. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and consultants Mark Creager and  
Peter Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated her 
husband's heart condition. A third consultant later settled for an 
undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Harley suggested that Mudge, suddenly in charge of  
care for ``the most famous patient in Boston,'' was under pressure 
to tell Lewis, his wife, the Celtics and the public what they 
wanted to hear: that Lewis' condition was not as serious as first 
believed, and that he would play professional basketball again. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge did just that during a news conference the day Lewis was  
discharged from Brigham and Women's, and his words came back to 
haunt him Thursday as Harley played a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``After extensive testing, evaluation and review of all data, I  
believe that Mr. Lewis has a normal athlete's heart with normal 
functions. Our testing showed no evidence of cardiomyopathy or 
abnormal life-threatening arrhythmias,'' Mudge said during the May 
10, 1993 event. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge later said, ``I am optimistic that under medical  
supervision Mr. Reggie Lewis will be able to return to professional 
basketball without limitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Harley asked Mudge if he lied during the news conference,  
Mudge replied, ``What I did say was very limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier on the witness stand, Mudge insisted he had been  
considering possible cardiac problems and said neurocardiogenic 
syncope -- which is not related to the heart -- was not a 
``definitive diagnosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Harley, Mudge said that after discharging  
Lewis, he saw him eight times and physically examined him once. He 
also said Lewis' heart rhythms were monitored for a total of one 
hour, 17 minutes between his discharge and his death 11 weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	In a heated exchange characterisic of Mudge's day-long  
testimony, Harley asked the doctor about Friedman's statements that 
he had shared with Mudge his belief that Lewis suffered from a 
defective heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe he actually said to me that sentence,'' Mudge  
said. After pressing from Harley, he added, ``He conveyed the 
thought we had to take it seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Absent from Thursday's questioning was the issue of drugs,  
expected to play a central role in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge, who runs the cardiac transplantation unit at Brigham and  
Women's, has said Lewis confided in him two weeks before his death 
about cocaine use and that the late admission kept him from making 
an accurate diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis has denied her husband ever used drugs.  
</P>
<P>
	But Mudge's lawyer has pointed out that such activity would  
threaten insurance and contract money Harris-Lewis received after 
her husband died. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis, who lives in the Boston area with her 6-year-old  
son and 5-year-old daughter, is suing to recover money Lewis would 
have made had he lived, estimates of which have ranged from $40 
million to more than $100 million.

<HEADLINE>  White Sox Pitcher Regaining Old Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Father really does know best, just ask Jaime  
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after being demoted to the bullpen with a bloated ERA,  
the Chicago White Sox pitcher is starting to show the form that 
made him one of the NL's best pitchers in 1995. And dear old dad 
deserves some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad used to be a sidethrower. I always saw him pitching  
like that, but I never tried it,'' Navarro said. ``In the 
offseason, I went to Puerto Rico and asked, 'What are you seeing?' 
He said I was maybe way too up to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Once in a while, come from the side like I used to  
throw.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Navarro tinkered with his throwing motion, lowering the angle  
of his arm. Instead of throwing over the top, he sometimes throws 
from around his shoulder. Other times it's lower, and occasionally 
it's even lower than that, almost a sidearm delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deception is there because it's harder for them to see the  
ball,'' White Sox pitching coach Nardi Contreras said. ``It takes 
them a little longer to see the ball, compared to where he was. In 
the past, you were able to see him right away, real easily, which 
gave them a longer look to see what was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that made Navarro easy prey.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Navarro won 14 games for the Chicago Cubs and was one  
of the NL's hottest pitchers with a 3.28 ERA. But when he moved 
across town two years later, he seemed to leave something behind. 
He went 9-14 in 1997 and didn't win a game the final six weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 8-16 last year, tied for the AL lead in losses. He  
didn't win a game after July 15, and manager Jerry Manuel finally 
demoted him to the bullpen. He was even booed by the White Sox 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad,'' Navarro said. ``It was frustrating. The fans  
have their right to be angry because they want to see a winner, and 
I was coming here to help the team, not let the team down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking everything too hard and trying to do too much and  
getting angry at a lot of things,'' he added. ``That just wasn't 
helping me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras tried to get Navarro to alter his throwing motion so  
his pitches wouldn't be so easy to see but had little success. 
Finally, in the offseason, with rumors swirling that the White Sox 
wanted to trade him, Navarro went to visit his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Julio Navarro, who pitched for the Los Angeles Angels, Detroit  
Tigers and Atlanta Braves during his career, told his son the same 
thing Contreras had: He needed to shorten his throwing motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Navarro also told his son he needed to work on his  
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My Dad said, `I'd see you get angry last year. You'd get mad  
about one pitch and you were struggling. You've got to slow down; 
you've got to relax,''' Navarro said. ``I never lost confidence in 
myself. Never. I've just got to go out there and believe in myself 
that I can go out there and be a good pitcher, like I used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Navarro's 2-3 record and his 5.03 ERA may not be  
impressive at first glance, there's more to the numbers. He has a 
2.71 ERA over his last four starts. It would be even lower if he 
hadn't given up seven runs -- four earned -- and five hits in one 
inning against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really been on a roll lately,'' Manuel said. ``Other than  
that one inning in Baltimore, we are confident that he has arrived 
and is back to the form that made him one of the top pitchers in 
the NL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, Navarro just shrugged off the Baltimore game.  
In his next start, Monday against the AL West-leading Rangers, he 
pitched four-hit ball for eight innings and gave up just one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just taking things easy,'' he said. ``Whether I  
have a good game or a bad game, I control myself, learn about it, 
learn about what were the mistakes, keep working at it and never 
give up.''

<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- International consortium StarHub aims to  
control up to 40 percent of Singapore's corporate and government 
telecommunications markets, an official from the group said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very disappointed if we didn't get 30-40 percent of the  
market over three years,'' Graham Moore, StarHub senior vice 
president said at a news conference.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Judges Fear Vendettas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- They are known as ``faceless judges,''  
magistrates who for nearly a decade have decided Colombia's most 
dangerous criminal cases, their names and faces deliberately kept 
from the public. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, these jurists are losing their anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Their extraordinary protection, granted under a 1991 decree  
after drug cartel hitmen assassinated scores of judges, expires 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	And although Colombia's large drug gangs are now history, its  
faceless judges fear that many of the criminals they've convicted 
know or will soon learn their identities -- and some will be out for 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got reason to be afraid,'' one of the most senior  
magistrates said in an interview. ``We're afraid because we're not 
Bible salesmen. We put mafiosos behind bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Master criminals this 41-year-old judge has interrogated --  
through one-way glass with his voice distorted -- include Gilberto 
and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the jailed capos of the now-defunct 
Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's not so worried about vendettas from drug barons. It's  
the young assassins formerly employed by Colombia's drug gangs or 
right-wing paramilitary groups that he fears -- unscrupulous youths 
he put behind bars for contract killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the most dangerous. They've got nothing to lose and  
are full of rancor for everyone and everything,'' the judge said in 
his small, downtown office overlooking Bogota's eastern hills. The 
offices on his corridor have no nameplates, of course, but no 
bulletproof windows or doors either. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants never set foot here. Nor do their lawyers. Under the  
faceless justice system, entire trials have been conducted on 
paper, the judges signing documents not with a name but with a 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	This separation of accused, accuser and jurist was considered  
the only way to protect members of the judiciary during the heyday 
of the Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1979 and 1991, 278 judges and magistrates were killed.  
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's chief prosecutor, Alfonso Gomez, says the system  
served its purpose. Not a single faceless judge has been murdered 
since 1991, he said, adding that the system was always considered 
temporary. In 1996, Congress decided to let it lapse this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 57 jurists protected by the system will have to work in  
the public spotlight. Though it will not be revealed exactly which 
cases they worked on, the justices suspect it will be easier now 
for the criminals to find out who they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of faceless justice said that as it grew to encompass  
some 30,000 cases, many of the defendants it tried were not the 
ruthless criminals for whom it was created. Faceless judges were 
deciding smaller cases such as simple illegal weapons possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Most likely, the 3,000 or so undecided cases will simply be  
passed on to a new judge, who will work in public, and Congress 
will allow prosecutors and witnesses to maintain their anonymity -- 
a proviso considered crucial by many. Future cases will be decided 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	``If drug trafficking had been done away with, if there weren't  
paramilitary death squads, if there were no criminal organizations 
in Colombia, then there wouldn't be a problem getting rid of 
faceless justice,'' said Carlos Medellin, a former justice minister 
who battled against drug trafficking. ``But the problem is, we're 
the same or worse off than before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a witness in Colombia who would testify against  
Carlos Castano,'' he added, referring to the country's top 
paramilitary leader. ``Who would do that? It's suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castano has been indicted for murder but remains a fugitive. If  
he is ever caught and tried, the witnesses against him would, under 
current plans, be allowed to maintain anonymity. But the judge 
would not. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, none of the magistrates being unmasked has resigned,  
said Gustavo Cuello, president of the High Judicial Council that 
oversees Colombia's judges. He said they will continue to receive 
armed protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The faceless judge interviewed by The Associated Press still  
uses an armor-plated car and takes a different route to the office 
every day. But he has just one bodyguard now -- a far cry from the 
18 who protected him as recently as six years ago -- and no longer 
wears a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
	He earns a modest salary of $2,100 a month and can't remember  
the last time he went to the movies or a bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge worries about how he'll be protected in the future.  
</P>
<P>
	``I sure hope the state remembers the efforts we've made,'' he  
said. ``Let's hope the efforts are remembered before something 
happens, because afterward feeling sorry won't mean a thing.''

<HEADLINE> Reps. Want More Border Patrol Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by the administration's failure to  
hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents this year, as ordered by 
Congress, lawmakers accused President Clinton on Wednesday of 
lacking commitment to border enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Occasionally, in a political speech the president takes credit  
for the progress we've made in expanding the size of the Border 
Patrol,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ``But the plain truth is 
that Bill Clinton has never, ever supported this effort, has fought 
us every step of the way, and seems intent to override a clear 
congressional majority that is committed to the principle that we 
ought to gain control of our borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gramm and five other border lawmakers appeared at a Capitol news  
conference to release a letter to Clinton signed by a bipartisan 
roster of 61 members of Congress, most from Texas, New Mexico, 
Arizona and California. The lawmakers urged Clinton to work with 
Congress to improve Border Patrol hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no indication that your border strategy recognizes  
the emergency situation caused by low Border Patrol recruitment and 
high attrition or is animated by any sense of urgency,'' they wrote 
in a letter organized by Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of 
Judiciary's immigration subcommittee; and Rep. Silvestre Reyes, 
D-Texas. ``The past three months have seen significant 
deterioration, not improvement, in border security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House rejected the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``This administration has been the first to take seriously the  
need to control our borders, and we have devoted enormous resources 
to that effort,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	For months, congressional Republicans have attacked the White  
House for omitting 1,000 agents in its 2000 budget. In 1996, 
Congress directed the administration to add 1,000 agents in each of 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhetoric has become increasingly harsh in recent weeks as it  
has become clear that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
which is the Border Patrol's parent, will fall well short of its 
order to add 1,000 agents this year despite receiving $93 million 
from Congress to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol's chief, Gus de la Vina, told a Senate panel  
recently that only 200 to 400 agents will be hired this year. He 
blamed the recruitment and retention problems on a tight labor 
market and said the agency is taking new steps to improve hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional critics contend the INS has done little to  
widen its pool of applicants and has not availed itself of existing 
authority to provide recruitment bonuses and other incentives.

<HEADLINE> Gene Found That May Cause Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have taken a critical step toward  
a vaccine to prevent childhood diabetes by isolating in mice a gene 
that causes the body to attack and kill tissue that produces 
insulin. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a strain of rodent, called the nonobese diabetic mouse,  
that always gets diabetes, a team led by Dr. Ji-Won Yoon showed 
that the presence of the gene GAD is what causes the body's immune 
system to kill the insulin-producing cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon, of the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, is lead  
author of a study appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that if we suppress GAD expression in the pancreatic  
cells, then we can prevent diabetes,'' said Yoon. ``It is that 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the mouse, when the GAD gene is active, it expresses, or  
causes the cell to make, a protein called glutamic acid 
decarboxylase. When this GAD protein is circulating in the body, 
the immune system detects it and attacks as if it were a foreign 
substance. Killer T-cells from the immune system also attack the 
beta cells that have the GAD gene. 
</P>
<P>
	This attack kills the beta cells, which means the body no longer  
has the insulin needed to process glucose, or sugar, in the blood. 
The result is Type I diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Goldstein, medical director of the Juvenile Diabetes  
Foundation, said Yoon's discovery ``is very important step'' 
toward, perhaps, someday developing a diabetes vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This approach has the promise of modulating the autoimmune  
response and going toward prevention,'' said Goldstein. He 
cautioned, however, that the finding is ``only one brick in the 
house'' and that scientists will need to answer many basic 
questions before a vaccine can be developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Type I diabetes frequently is diagnosed in childhood, forcing  
patients to spend their lives taking up to four insulin shots a day 
and to monitor carefully their blood sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
	About 29,000 new cases of Type I diabetes are diagnosed annually  
in the United States, mostly among children and young adults. The 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation estimates that about one million 
Americans now are being treated for Type I diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another form of the disease, called Type II diabetes, most  
commonly occurs in people over 40. In this disease, the body may 
still make insulin, but cells have lost their sensitivity to the 
hormone. Type II diabetes commonly is treated successfully with 
pills, diet and life style changes. 
</P>
<P>
	When not controlled, either type of diabetes can cause kidney  
failure, blindness, limb amputation, heart disease and death. It is 
estimated that diabetes claims the lives of about 190,000 Americans 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon said his study suggests that it may be possible to prevent  
Type I diabetes with a vaccine that would desensitize the immune 
system to the presence of the GAD gene. He said such a vaccine 
would, in effect, educate the immune system to not attack 
pancreatic cells that have the GAD gene. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you inject GAD then the T-cell will learn to tolerate GAD  
and will not attack the beta cells (which make insulin),'' said 
Yoon. ``The concept is that you inject GAD into young children then 
they would not get diabetes. That is prevention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon said that it will take 10 to 15 years to develop such a  
vaccine because researchers would have to prove that manipulating 
the GAD gene would not cause dangerous side effects. He said the 
gene has no known function in the pancreas, but it is present in 
the brain.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Back Off From Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIELEFELD, Germany (AP) -- Germany's Greens voted Thursday to  
back NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia, rejecting pacifist calls for an 
immediate and permanent cease-fire that would have undermined the 
center-left coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
	After a raucous daylong congress, delegates voted 444-318 for a  
motion backed by the highest ranking Green in the government, 
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, and by the party's national 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion said some military force was needed to bring Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table. In a bow to 
the pacifist sentiment that split the Greens, it also urged a 
temporary suspension of the bombing to see if Milosevic is ready to 
end his campaign against Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Fischer -- who at one point during the congress was spattered  
with blood-red paint by an anti-war protester -- said the motion 
gave him enough leeway to continue his policy within the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The motion averts a political crisis that could have shaken NATO  
unity and forced Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to seek another 
coalition partner after just six months with the Greens. 
</P>
<P>
	A visibly relieved Fischer was congratulated by party leaders on  
the stage. In brief words directed at pacifists who voted for a 
permanent end to airstrikes, he promised to work to represent the 
``entire spectrum'' of the party in his post. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a peace activist himself, Fischer had implored about 800  
delegates before the vote to ``not cut me off at the knees.'' 
Shouting above jeers, whistles and shouts of ``war criminal,'' he 
warned that a pacifist stand would send ``the completely wrong 
signal'' to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before his speech, Fischer was hit on the side of the  
head by a mixture of paint and foul-smelling butyric acid from a 
leftist demonstrator as he sat on the dais, while another protester 
paraded in front of the stage naked. 
</P>
<P>
	Stunned and furious, Fischer wiped himself off with a hastily  
fetched toilet roll as guards expelled the protesters. He later was 
treated for a perforated eardrum at a hospital, party spokeswoman 
Donate Hochstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leftist peace protesters disrupted the meeting from the start.  
Police moved in with nightsticks after some demonstrators threw 
eggs and other objects. Police said 57 demonstrators were arrested; 
five police officers and at least two demonstrators suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder and Fischer have staunchly defended NATO's aim of  
bombing Milosevic into accepting an international force to secure 
the return of Kosovo refugees. But with anti-war sentiment running 
high in the coalition, Fischer has also led diplomatic efforts to 
end the war. Last week, President Clinton visited Germany to 
bolster Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greens were founded in 1980 by peace activists and  
environmentalists. Some, like Fischer, have become more pragmatic 
but many members object to Germany's first combat mission since 
World War II.

<HEADLINE>  China Urges Defiance of US Bullying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- While praising victims of NATO's bombing of the  
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as heroes, China's president accused 
the United States on Thursday of seeking global dominance and urged 
nations worldwide to defy American bullying and create a new just 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	The harsh words showed just how much the embassy bombing in  
Yugoslavia has damaged Chinese political will for smooth U.S. 
relations. The statement marked a turnabout for President Jiang 
Zemin, who last year claimed credit for engineering a rapprochement 
with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang said the United States was using its economic and  
technological superiority to aggressively expand its influence, 
pursue ``power politics and wantonly interfere in the internal 
affairs of other countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accusation came in an emotional ceremony to confer the  
titles of ``revolutionary martyrs'' -- one of the state's highest 
designations -- on the three people killed in the embassy bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time in three years of improving relations that  
Jiang has outright called the United States a term China reserves 
for enemy countries -- hegemonist. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang, who also heads the Communist Party, hinted that public  
protests around the U.S. Embassy that ended Tuesday could renew if 
Chinese demands for redress were not met. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and NATO must make formal apologies,  
thoroughly investigate the bombing and punish those responsible, 
the official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as saying. ``Otherwise 
the Chinese people will never let the matter go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state-sanctioned protests brought tens of thousands of  
Chinese into the streets in 20 cities, saw the U.S., British and 
Albanian embassies stoned and a U.S. consul's residence set on fire 
in the western city of Chengdu. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing's embassy district, police removed road barriers  
Thursday, allowing cars and pedestrians to travel freely for the 
first time since the four-day protests began Saturday. Signs that 
guided the tens of thousands of protesters to the British and U.S. 
embassies were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing further unrest, paramilitary police maintained a cordon  
around a two-block area near the U.S. Embassy, keeping foreign 
reporters and curious onlookers well away. The embassy itself was a 
mess after being pelted with rocks, bottles and paint bombs by the 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after the victims of last Friday's embassy bombing  
returned to Beijing, the communist leadership on Thursday honored 
the three killed, all journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great People's Republic of China can never be bullied,''  
Jiang said, with the rest of the leadership arrayed around him and 
relatives of the dead and wounded in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The war in Yugoslavia and the embassy bombing made more  
countries aware of the United States' quest for dominance, Jiang 
said. He appealed to them to unite to create ``a just and rational 
new international order in the common struggle against hegemonism 
and power politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government support for the protests -- biased media coverage,  
party groups busing students in and police standing by as 
demonstrators rampaged -- have drawn criticism from U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao assailed suggestions of  
government connivance as ``unwarranted'' and called the protests 
acts of understandable outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is natural, justifiable and brooks no questioning,'' Zhu  
told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not condemn or condone those lawbreaking activities. I'm  
sure you have seen what we have done in recent days,'' Zhu said, 
referring to the tighter security imposed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the protests over, U.S. officials were reassessing security  
plans and beginning to repair damage to the embassy and also to the 
consulates in Chengdu and the northeastern city of Shenyang, 
embassy spokesman Tom Cooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	To aid that effort, the embassy and the two consulates will  
remain closed until at least Monday and the issuing of visas for 
work travel or study in the United States will be suspended 
indefinitely at the embassy and all four U.S. consulates in China, 
Cooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. consulates in Guangzhou and Shanghai, which were not badly  
damaged during similar protests there, will reopen Friday.

<HEADLINE> Penguins' Goalie's Dad Has Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Tom Barrasso had more on his mind than  
stopping the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Pittsburgh Penguins goalie 
has learned his father is suffering from brain cancer and the 
outlook is grim. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso said tests have disclosed that his father's cancer is  
in an advanced state of malignancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Barrasso, whose first name also is Tom, is undergoing  
treatment in Boston where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins are playing the Toronto Maple Leafs in their  
conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer was diagnosed after Barrasso's father became ill  
April 23, when the Penguins were in New Jersey for the first round 
of the playoffs. An MRI at St. Barnabas Hospital there revealed a 
mass on the right frontal lobe of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The goalie's Barrasso's daughter also has been seriously ill  
with cancer. In 1989, Ashley was 3 years old when she was diagnosed 
with neuroblastoma. Barrasso missed 29 games of the 1989-90 season 
while she was being treated. She is surviving the cancer and lives 
with her parents in suburban Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Wolverines' Hoop Team Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Federal agents are investigating allegations that  
a now-banned University of Michigan booster made improper payments 
to basketball players, including members of the Fab Five. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Martin, the booster, also is the target of an investigation  
of illegal gambling at Ford Motor Co. plants that has led to the 
seizure of $150,000, according to the Detroit Free Press, which 
broke the story Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was a target in a 1997 investigation of the Ann Arbor  
school's basketball program. It led to minor NCAA sanctions and the 
firing of coach Steve Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result of that investigation, we put in place numerous  
safeguards that we hope have insulated our program from such 
corrupting influences,'' school president Lee Bollinger said 
Thursday in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The current FBI investigation involves possible improper  
payments to players going back ``many years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if this turns out to be true, it is extremely  
embarrassing to the university,'' the president said. ``We have 
been told by the FBI that the investigation to date does not 
implicate or involve our current coaching staff and does not 
suggest any gambling or improper activity related to athletic 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Detroit has issued subpoenas to former  
players and others, the Detroit Free Press reported in Friday 
editions, quoting people familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiretaps on Martin recorded conversations with several former  
Wolverines basketball players, including Chris Webber, Louis 
Bullock, Robert Traylor and Maurice Taylor, the Free Press reported 
an unidentified person close to the investigation as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Those recordings provided the basis for search warrants executed  
last month on Martin and nine other homes and one office, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It involved very large amounts of money, and it may end up  
that a current player or two had taken money,'' an unidentified 
source told the Free Press. ``It started with the Fab Five and 
reaches major proportions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents for the players are saying little.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a grand jury going on,'' said L. Fallasha Erwin, an  
attorney and agent for former Fab Five star Webber, who now plays 
for the NBA's Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Webber had been subpoenaed or interviewed by the  
FBI, Erwin said only that Webber would cooperate with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players who are coming under scrutiny, the Free Press  
sources said, include Taylor, Traylor, Bullock and Jalen Rose. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous interviews, Traylor has denied accepting money from  
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	When reached at his parents' Maryland home, Bullock said of the  
suspected payments to players: ``I didn't have anything to do with 
it.'' He said he had not been interviewed by federal agents or, 
apparently, subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Martin, Bullock said: ``I never accepted anything from  
him. That's all you need to write. My parents are well off. We've 
never taken anything from him; we've never needed anything from 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bollinger said the university ``will follow this investigation  
carefully and will do everything we can to find out what has 
happened and what needs to be done further to ensure that Michigan 
sports meet the highest standards of integrity all Michigan fans 
expect of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Tom Goss, who took over after the 1997 probe,  
said the Wolverines have taken strong steps in the past two years 
to shield athletes from Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials did not say whether the school was  
conducting its own investigation of possible NCAA rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA is aware of the allegations, spokeswoman Jane Jankowski  
said Thursday from its Mission, Kan., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, IRS and federal prosecutors in Detroit also would not  
discuss the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Free Press, FBI and IRS agents investigating a  
possible numbers operation at Detroit-area area Ford plants 
searched Martin's house on April 28. Authorities later searched an 
office and nine other houses, ultimately confiscating more than 
$150,000 cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story Friday, The Detroit News quoted law enforcers,  
eyewitnesses and Ford officials as alleging that Martin has run a 
lottery-style gambling ring at the Ford Rouge Complex's engine 
plant for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the workers or investigators indicated Martin's gambling  
activities involved college sports, the News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's lawyer, Neil Fink, said, ``I am confident that my  
clients will be exonerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Goss fired Fisher after a school investigation  
found three rules violations between September 1994 and Feb. 17, 
1996, all involving Martin and deemed ``minor'' by the school and 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA said Martin was present during a home visit by Fisher  
to then-recruit Traylor and provided Traylor and his grandmother 
with food totaling $80.50. Martin also provided transportation for 
Traylor's grandmother to high school games and, later, Michigan 
games.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Gets 'Reading Wizard' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The ``Reading Wizard,'' an 11-year-old boy  
whose offer to volunteer at a local library was rebuffed by 
librarians, will get to read to younger kids after all. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Willie Brown on Wednesday ordered San Francisco Public  
Library officials to allow John O'Connor to read to preschool 
children to get them interested in books and wean them off 
television and video games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect this kind of attention,'' John said. ``It's  
just shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John had selected his first book, ``The King's Giraffe,'' and  
drafted fliers inviting neighborhood children, ages 3 to 6, to the 
Presidio branch every Wednesday afternoon. He planned to call 
himself the ``Reading Wizard'' and wear a jester's hat, fake 
spectacles and a black cape. 
</P>
<P>
	But his idea was rejected -- on the phone, in person and finally  
with a letter from Toni Bernardi, the chief of the library system's 
children and youth services. Using terms like ``age-appropriate 
material,'' she wrote that only library personnel are allowed to 
read to children. 
</P>
<P>
	John then went to a member of the city board of supervisors, who  
advised him to write letters to the library. When Brown saw a story 
about the boy in the San Francisco Chronicle, he read the riot act 
to the library bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our libraries are supposed to turn kids on, not turn them  
off,'' Brown said. ``We should be rewarding young people with 
creative ideas, not discouraging them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also invited John to hold his first reading for children at  
City Hall, saying he applauded ``the initiative, the sense of civic 
responsibility and the caring for others that John clearly has 
demonstrated.''

<HEADLINE>  New President Elected in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, an  
internationally respected former premier and central banker, was 
elected Italy's president today, winning wide backing from both the 
government and the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 674 votes, cast secretly by senators, deputies and  
regional representatives, were required to become the next head of 
state. When the tally got within a few votes of that number, most 
of hall broke into a standing ovation for Ciampi, who went on to 
win 707 of the 990 ballots cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciampi, 78, a longtime central bank governnor and political  
independent, won wide support at home with a reputation as an 
economic straight arrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's presidency is largely a ceremonial post, but it does  
wield important powers. The president serves as a kind of referee 
in political crises by deciding whether to dissolve parliament and 
call new elections and by designating candidates to form a new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Instrumental to Ciampi's victory was support thrown his way  
Wednesday by the main, center-right opposition, led by media mogul 
and ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the quick victory -- past presidential elections have seen as  
many as 23 rounds -- Berlusconi said, ``For once politicians were 
able to reach an accord over the name, giving the country a strong 
sign of responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ciampi has been treasury and budget minister since 1996, after  
serving as premier in 1993-1994 and governor of Italy's central 
bank from 1979 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He was largely responsible for overseeing Italy's surprising  
qualification for the debut of the common European currency, the 
euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``Diligence, accountability, discretion'' are his main  
qualities, the Corriere della Sera daily said in advance of the 
vote. ``Except for chocolate, he has no known passions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voting and counting took just over four hours. Electors filed  
one by one into a booth where they wrote their choice on paper and 
slipped the ballot into an urn. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 1,010 electors -- senators, deputies and regional  
representatives -- were called to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three rounds of presidential elections require a  
two-thirds majority for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	It took 10 days and 16 ballots in 1992 to elect the current  
president, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, whose seven-year term expires in 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's election by lawmakers might be the nation's last. Both  
Berlusconi's forces and the government have pledged to work 
together for reforms to make Italy more in line with the rest of 
Western Europe, including direct election of the head of state by 
citizens.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo York Wants Suit Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Denise DeBartolo York has asked a federal  
judge in Ohio to dismiss a lawsuit her brother filed against her 
for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
	York and the family-held Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. sued Edward  
DeBartolo Jr. in April, demanding he repay $94 million to the 
company. It also sought to oust DeBartolo from any management role 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings each own a 50 percent stake in the family business,  
a Youngstown, Ohio-based real estate development firm that is also 
the nominal owner of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo responded a week later with a $150 million lawsuit  
alleging that York reneged on a deal to turn the team over to him 
as part of an August 1998 agreement. That deal would have divided 
the assets of their jointly owned business, with DeBartolo gaining 
sole possession of the team in return for $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In her request for dismissal filed Wednesday, York said certain  
conditions of their deal were not met, rendering it null and void. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``spin-off'' deal would have given DeBartolo control of the  
49ers and York control over the remaining assets of the 
corporation. The conditions included the Internal Revenue Service 
declaring the transaction tax-free for both DeBartolo and the 
corporation and the NFL approving DeBartolo's ownership of the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS said it couldn't rule because the NFL suspended  
DeBartolo from managing the 49ers, and the NFL said it doesn't give 
preapproval to anyone, York spokesman Sam Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had no control over the IRS not issuing a ruling, she had  
no control over the NFL not giving preapproval, so she didn't 
breach her contract with Eddie,'' Singer said.

<HEADLINE> `Midsummer' Tests Fans Love of Bard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shakespeare is hotter than ever in Hollywood.  
Now the Bard faces two new celebrity challenges: opening a movie in 
the shadow of ``Star Wars'' -- and selling spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' opens today  
with a big release schedule, big stars, big soundtrack and a big 
marketing campaign that includes a promotional deal with Classico 
Pasta Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	All that isn't big is the movie's budget -- $14 million -- a  
bargain considering the top name talent in Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin 
Kline, Rupert Everett and Calista Flockhart, who all worked cheaply 
for a chance to flex their acting muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, filming one of Shakespeare's plays largely as written is  
far from a sure bet for a studio. The two bigger successes are the 
Kenneth Branagh-directed ``Much Ado About Nothing'' in 1993 and 
``Hamlet,'' starring Mel Gibson, in 1990. And each only barely 
topped $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, Fox Searchlight Pictures is releasing ``Midsummer''  
just days before the opening of the heavily hyped ``Star Wars'' 
prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a risk,'' acknowledges Lindsay Law, president of Fox  
Searchlight Pictures, which is releasing the movie on 1,000 screens 
-- 150 more than its biggest success to date, ``The Full Monty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If no one shows up, I'm in trouble,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But then, this film has some advantages, particularly timing,  
thanks to ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which won seven Oscars and 
grossed more than $94 million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' a fictional portrait of the playwright,  
drew only some scenes and language from his works. But it served as 
a perfect introduction to the power of his writing and helped 
adjust the ear to the high language that so often throws off modern 
movie-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare is no longer some onerous name at the top of a  
curriculum that kids look at and say, 'I've got to read this?''' 
Kline said. ``He's now this attractive young English guy who falls 
madly in love with Gwyneth Paltrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Flockhart for her first big movie role was one of the  
many casting coups for director-writer-co-producer Michael Hoffman. 
It was luck: She was signed to play lovelorn Helena before the 
success of ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the cast -- including Pfeiffer as the fairy queen  
Tatania, Everett as the fairy king Oberon, Stanley Tucci as Puck, 
Anna Friel as Hermia and Christian Bale as Demetrius -- worked for 
low wages to keep the project on budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Shakespeare,'' Hoffman said. ``It ends up being the  
ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward for the actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low budget means that Searchlight doesn't need  
``Shakespeare in Love'' numbers to break even. In addition, the 
studio has hedged its bets by striking promotional deals, a common 
practice for big-studio movies but almost unheard-of for a 
specialty film. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Factor created a line of ``Midsummer'' cosmetics, then  
pushed it with a national advertising campaign. Classico Pasta 
Sauce is sponsoring a sweepstakes promotion and putting out a 
cookbook ``inspired by the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the film's soundtrack, featuring performances by opera  
stars, debuted in the Top 10 on the classical charts. 
</P>
<P>
	All that's left is the movie, which opens on a relatively slow  
weekend as most of Hollywood takes cover before next Wednesday's 
invasion of ``The Phantom Menace,'' being released by Searchlight's 
parent company, 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good date for us,'' Law said. ``There's not  
anything opening over the weekend, and the entire country can't fit 
into 'Star Wars' the first week. Parents can drop their kids off at 
'Star Wars' and come into our theaters.''

<HEADLINE> Man Must Pay $5M for Giving Ex HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORK, S.C. (AP) -- A judge has ordered a man to pay his former  
girlfriend $5 million for infecting her with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Buford Greer awarded $1 million in actual damages and $4  
million in punitive damages to the woman Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, identified in court papers as Jane Doe, received a  
verdict in her favor in November after her former boyfriend failed 
to show up to defend himself. The man, identified only as John Doe, 
did not appear for the damages hearing either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this verdict sends a message to people that you can't  
do this,'' the woman's lawyer, Randall Hood, said Wednesday. ``If 
you are HIV-positive, it is your duty to inform your partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends the man never told the woman he had HIV --  
the virus that causes AIDS -- when they began dating five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hood said the woman had a long-term, monogamous relationship  
with the man, but the man had a grudge against women and decided to 
infect her. 
</P>
<P>
	Hood said there may be other victims, but no one else has  
stepped forward.

<HEADLINE> `Midsummer' Tests Fans Love of Bard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ever since ``Shakespeare in Love'' dominated  
the Oscars, they've been saying the Bard is hotter than ever in 
Hollywood. But now comes a big test -- the wide release of ``A 
Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie opens Friday with big stars, aggressive advertising  
and promotional tie-ins with cosmetics and spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, it also opens just days before the May 19 release of the  
latest ``Star Wars'' installment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a risk,'' said Lindsay Law, president of Fox Searchlight  
Pictures, which is releasing the Shakespeare movie on 1,000 screens 
-- 150 more than the company's biggest success to date, ``The Full 
Monty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If no one shows up, I'm in trouble,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the successes of ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a  
fictionalized account of the Bard's life, filming one of his plays 
largely as written is far from a sure bet for a studio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenneth Branagh-directed ``Much Ado About Nothing'' in 1993  
and ``Hamlet'' starring Mel Gibson in 1990 barely made $20 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Midsummer'' budget was $14 million, a bargain considering  
the cast includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett 
and Calista Flockhart. All worked cheaply for a chance to do 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the cast, ``Midsummer'' may be helped by the  
seven Oscars ``Shakespeare in Love'' won. The movie went on to 
gross more than $94 million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love'' served as an introduction to the power  
of his prose and poetry -- and may have helped adjust the ear to the 
high language that so often throws off modern movie-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare is no longer some onerous name at the top of a  
curriculum that kids look at and say, `I've got to read this?''' 
Kline said. ``He's now this attractive young English guy who falls 
madly in love with Gwyneth Paltrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Midsummer'' the play is already seen as one of the most  
understandable of Shakespeare's works, and ``Midsummer'' the movie 
sticks closely to the text, though it takes some liberties, 
shifting the setting from the forests of Greece to Tuscany and 
moving the time period up to the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Another change is to Kline's character, Nick Bottom, the hammy  
actor who is transformed into a donkey. Though usually played for 
comic relief, Bottom's role is strengthened in the movie to make 
him the emotional center of the production. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Flockhart for her first big movie role since hitting TV  
stardom as Ally McBeal was one of the many casting coups for 
director, writer and co-producer Michael Hoffman, though he 
acknowledged that in Flockhart's case it was just luck. She had not 
reached her white-hot success when hired to play the lovelorn 
Helena. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low budget means that Searchlight doesn't need  
``Shakespeare in Love'' numbers to break even. 
</P>
<P>
	The studio has hedged its bets by striking promotional deals, a  
common practice for big-studio movies but almost unheard-of for a 
specialty film. Max Factor created a line of ``Midsummer'' 
cosmetics and Classico Pasta Sauce sponsored a sweepstakes and put 
out a cookbook of recipes ``inspired by the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film's soundtrack, featuring performances by opera stars,  
debuted in the Top 10 on the classical charts.

<HEADLINE> Cell Used To Make New Liver Tissue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Special bone marrow cells have been shown to  
convert into basic liver tissue, raising the possibility of one day 
using a patient's own marrow to repair failing livers, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	In laboratory rat studies at the University of Pittsburgh  
Medical Center, researchers found in bone marrow a master, or stem, 
cell that under special conditions will convert itself into 
functioning liver tissue cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryon Petersen, lead author of the study to be published Friday  
in the journal Science, said the work is the first step toward 
learning how to rescue failing livers using the body's own stem 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said that in new experiments he already has shown that  
injecting the special marrow cells into rats causes the animals to 
form new liver tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the work only has been demonstrated in laboratory  
animals, Petersen said other studies strongly suggest humans also 
have bone marrow cells that will convert into liver cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have learned from the rat, we should be able to  
extrapolate to the humans,'' said Petersen. But he cautioned that 
perfecting the technique for humans may take a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John M. Vierling, liver specialist at Cedars-Siani Medical  
Center in Los Angeles and chairman of the board of the American 
Liver Foundation, said the research raises ``very exciting'' 
possibilities for reviving dying livers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vierling said that other researchers have been trying with  
little success to find in the liver stem cells that could make new 
tissue. If the cells can be isolated from the bone marrow and 
cultured, he said, it raises the possibility of finding a virtually 
unlimited supply of key liver cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to take something from scratch, so to speak, and  
grow it up in the quantity that you need would be extraordinary,'' 
Vierling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark F. Pittenger, a researcher at Osiris Therapeutics in  
Baltimore who recently found in bone marrow the stem cells for 
bone, cartilage and fat, called Petersen's ``a significant step 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It bodes well for our learning how to regenerate organs,''  
said Pittenger. ``Liver disease is a very serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Liver Foundation says about 26,000 Americans die  
annually from liver disease. About 5 million in the U.S. are 
infected with hepatitis B or C, virus diseases that are a major 
cause of liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said that his research investigated how some people  
with liver failures are able to grow new liver tissue. Some 
patients with failing livers recover after the organ spontaneously 
grows new cells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The liver often can generate new hepatocytes, or a type of  
healthy liver cells, after an injury or disease. But Petersen said 
that some patients who do not make new hepatocytes still end up 
growing new liver tissue and recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how this happens, said Petersen, long has been a mystery.  
Researchers suspected some special cells in the bone marrow somehow 
were prompted to start making new cells for the distressed organ. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said research using the lab rats proves the bone marrow  
is the source of these new liver cells. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Petersen and his colleagues destroyed the bone  
marrow of female rats and replaced it with marrow from male rats. 
This meant that the female rats had bone marrow that carried the 
male Y chromosome, which could be used to identify cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists treated the female rats with a chemical that  
prevented their livers from regenerating and then damaged the 
livers, mimicking an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, the livers were removed and the researchers  
found they contained new liver cells that carried the Y chromosome 
marker. This meant that cells from the bone marrow had gone to the 
failing livers and started the regeneration process. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests that there is a stem cell in the adult bone  
marrow that is capable of becoming anything if you give it the 
right signal,'' said Petersen. ``I have been able to show that 
there is a cell in the bone marrow for the liver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there is preliminary work in his lab that shows the bone  
marrow also has a stem cell that converts into pancreatic cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said that once researchers learn to isolate stem cells  
from the bone marrow, switch them into liver cells, and then grow 
them into large quantities, it may be possible to rescue failing 
livers with simple injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Vierling cautioned, however, that the technique would not  
totally replace the need for liver transplants.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall; Grains Rise a Bit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures fell sharply Thursday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade as soybean oil prices plunged. Grain futures 
edged higher amid signs the export outlook for corn and wheat is 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans fell in step with sharply declining soybean oil values.  
That complex was pressured by a steep drop in competing Malaysian 
palm oil prices, which indicated that demand for vegetable oils on 
the world market is waning. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department reported  
corn exports last week of 1.336 million metric tons, the fifth 
consecutive week that sales have topped 1 million metric tons. The 
unexpectedly strong demand has raised expectations the government 
will boost annual export projections and lower estimates for ending 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn also was supported by continued rains across Midwest  
growing regions, which was delaying fieldwork as time runs out for 
getting crops into the ground. Gains were trimmed late, however, on 
the weakness in the soybean market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures advanced after the USDA reported weekly exports of  
436,400 metric tons for the current and upcoming marketing year. 
The combined total came in above expectations and lent support to 
ideas that Asian demand may be on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also saw continued support from the government projections  
that the winter wheat crop will be far smaller than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery was unchanged at $2.70 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 3/4 cent to $2.24 a bushel; July oats fell 3/4 cent to $1.25 1/4 
a bushel; July soybeans fell 5 1/2 cents to $4.69 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork bellies futures advanced on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. Feeder cattle retreated, while lean hogs 
finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .30 cent to 61.40 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .42 cent to 72.50 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .20 cent to 60.05 cents a pound; July pork bellies rose .07 
cent to 59.02 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Fish Oil May Treat Manic Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The fatty acids in fish oil may help ease  
symptoms of manic depression, according to a new study in this 
month's issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
	In a four-month study of 30 people undergoing treatment for  
manic depression, researchers found that the omega-3 fatty acids in 
fish oil could act as mood stabilizers, providing short-term 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Stoll, the lead author of the study conducted at the  
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the preliminary 
research ``opens the door for more research on omega-3 fatty acid's 
effect on a variety of other psychiatric disorders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects were between the ages of 18 and 65 and were also  
undergoing prescribed treatment for manic depression. Fourteen were 
given pills with the equivalent of 15 cans of tuna a day; 16 were 
given placebo pills made out of olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 14 patients who got the omega-3 fatty acids  
experienced relief of their symptoms; three of the 16 who got the 
placebo described such relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have hypothesized that overactive cell-signaling  
pathways in the brain cause bipolar disorder. The study concluded 
that the ingestion of large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, a type 
of polyunsaturated fat, can dampen these cell-signaling pathways. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingesting the fish oil had no significant side effects other  
than some cases of mild gastrointestinal distress, researchers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers acknowledged that the study involved a small number  
of patients and might have been compromised because some subjects 
reported a distinct ``fishy'' taste that may have tipped them off 
to their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Francisco Fernandez, chairman of the psychiatry department  
at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill., said he also 
had concerns about the study's methods but said they didn't detract 
from the promising results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, all these things will need to be addressed in a  
follow-up study,'' Fernandez said. ``But I think it's very 
encouraging. It's not something that takes a leap of faith.''

<HEADLINE> Univ. of Chicago Courses Go Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The University of Chicago will soon become one of  
the first major universities to offer business courses to corporate 
managers via the Internet, according to a report in today's Chicago 
Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the potential to gain revenue of at least $20 million in  
the next five years, university officials say they will soon sign a 
contract with UNEXT.com, a Deerfield-based online education firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for professors from the university's graduate  
business school and potentially the Graham School of General 
Studies and the university's Little Red Schoolhouse writing 
programs to develop courses that would be sold to companies to use 
for employee training. 
</P>
<P>
	UNEXT also hopes to eventually offer certificates and perhaps  
even degree programs, said Edwin Eisendrath, a former Chicago 
alderman and federal housing official who is UNEXT's deputy chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia University recently became the first to sign with  
UNEXT. Other top-flight universities -- including Stanford, Cornell 
and Harvard -- also are considering offering their courses using 
commercial vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Chicago deal is not without its critics, who  
fear a conflict of interest between the venture and U of C faculty 
and board members. 
</P>
<P>
	UNEXT is headed by Andrew Rosenfield, a university trustee, and  
funded in part by a corporate affiliate of felon financier Michael 
Milken. Rosenfield recently sold the economic consulting firm 
Lexecon Inc. to Milken's education company, Knowledge Universe. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the university's law school dean, Daniel Fischel,  
is an investor in UNEXT and, by coincidence, wrote the book 
``Payback: The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His 
Financial Revolution.'' Gary Becker and Merton Miller, both 
University of Chicago economists, also have financial interests in 
UNEXT. 
</P>
<P>
	Some faculty members say Rosenfield's dual roles, in particular,  
represent a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is that it is unhealthy for members of the board of  
trustees to profit from being board members,'' said Richard 
Shweder, a member of the Council of the University Senate, the 
faculty governing body to which the administration recently 
presented the pending deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the more people there are on the faculty who are involved  
in the deal, the more entangled we become in an arrangement that 
will be very difficult to get out of,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also note that maintaining a Web site would take some  
top faculty members away from students on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials say they would expect full disclosure of  
financial interests from trustees and faculty members to avoid 
conflict-of-interest problems. They also say they simply can't 
ignore the potential for profit, especially if other big 
universities get into the online game. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, this is a defensive measure,'' said Geoffrey Stone, U  
of C provost. ``If we didn't get involved with something that's 
likely to become part of higher education's future, we could be at 
a big disadvantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the question of who has rights to the material  
provided on the Web -- and, thus, the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At Princeton University, a discussion of whether professors  
should have exclusive rights to material they produce on the Web 
has led to a pending written policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some professors are cognizant of the potential to make  
a significant amount of money from these projects,'' said Mary 
Caffrey, a Princeton spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisendrath said Rosenfield would not be available for comment  
about the University of Chicago deal or plans for UNEXT.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Pitcher Regaining Old Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Father really does know best, just ask Jaime  
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after being demoted to the bullpen with a bloated ERA,  
the Chicago White Sox pitcher is starting to show the form that 
made him one of the NL's best pitchers in 1995. And dear old Dad 
deserves some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad used to be a sidethrower. I always saw him pitching  
like that, but I never tried it,'' Navarro said. ``In the 
offseason, I went to Puerto Rico and asked, 'What are you seeing?' 
He said I was maybe way too up to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Once in a while, come from the side like I used to  
throw.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Navarro tinkered with his motion, lowering the angle of his  
arm. Instead of throwing over the top, he sometimes throws from 
around his shoulder. Other times it's lower, and occasionally it's 
even lower than that, almost a sidearm delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deception is there because it's harder for them to see the  
ball,'' said White Sox pitching coach Nardi Contreras. ``It takes 
them a little longer to see the ball, compared to where he was. In 
the past, you were able to see him right away, real easily, which 
gave them a longer look to see what was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that made Navarro easy prey.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Navarro won 14 games for the Chicago Cubs and was one  
of the NL's hottest pitchers with a 3.28 ERA. But when he moved 
across town two years later, he seemed to leave something behind. 
He went 9-14 in 1997, and didn't win a game the final six weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 8-16 last year, tied for the AL lead in losses. He  
didn't win a game after July 15, and manager Jerry Manuel finally 
demoted him to the bullpen. He was even booed by the White Sox 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad,'' Navarro said. ``It was frustrating. The fans  
have their right to be angry because they want to see a winner, and 
I was coming here to help the team, not let the team down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking everything too hard and trying to do too much and  
getting angry at a lot of things. That just wasn't helping me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras tried to get Navarro to alter his motion so his  
pitches wouldn't be so easy to see, but he had little success. 
Finally, in the offseason, with rumors swirling that the White Sox 
wanted to trade him, Navarro went to visit his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Julio Navarro -- who pitched for the old Los Angeles Angels, the  
Detroit Tigers and the Atlanta Braves during his career -- told his 
son the same thing Contreras had: He needed to shorten his throwing 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Navarro also told his son he needed to work on his  
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad said, 'I'd see you get angry last year. You'd get mad  
about one pitch and you were struggling. You've got to slow down; 
you've got to relax,''' Navarro said. ``I never lost confidence in 
myself. Never. I've just got to go out there and believe in myself 
that I can go out there and be a good pitcher, like I used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Navarro's 2-3 record and his 5.03 ERA might not be  
impressive at first glance, there's more to the numbers. He has a 
2.71 ERA over his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be lower if he hadn't given up seven runs -- one earned  
-- and five hits in one inning against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really been on a roll lately,'' Manuel said. ``Other than  
that one inning in Baltimore, we are confident that he has arrived 
and is back to the form that made him one of the top pitchers in 
the NL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, Navarro just shrugged off the Baltimore game.  
In his next start, Monday against the AL West-leading Rangers, he 
pitched four-hit ball for eight innings and gave up just one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just taking things easy,'' he said. ``Whether I  
have a good game or a bad game, I control myself, learn about it, 
learn about what were the mistakes, keep working at it and never 
give up.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins' Westbrook Breaks Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- In his first full news conference since his  
bloody attack on teammate Stephen Davis 19 months ago, Washington 
Redskins receiver Michael Westbrook compared the beating to a 
``hockey fight'' and said he did not need counseling for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey players have fights every day, all day,'' Westbrook  
said Thursday. ``What did I need counseling for? Because I had a 
fight?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook also explained his decision to resume talking to the  
media. Except for an appearance on teammate Brian Mitchell's talk 
show on WTEM-AM last season and an interview on WJLA-TV earlier 
this week, he has virtually ignored reporters since the Aug. 19, 
1997, attack on Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just tired of playing the little childish games that you  
all have been playing with me and I've been playing with you,'' 
Westbrook said. ``It's time for all of us to grow up. It's time to 
be more mature in that aspect of that life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook said he stopped talking to the press because he felt  
the Davis matter was blown out of proportion. The Redskins fined 
Westbrook $50,000 for attack, suspended him for one exhibition 
game, told him to apologize and ordered him to undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more so to please the public,'' Westbrook said of the  
counseling. ``I don't think anything was mentally wrong with me, 
and I'm the still the great friend to my friends and great family 
member to my family members and a respectable human being to people 
that just walk past me every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight itself shouldn't have happened. After it happened, I  
don't think the media should have ran with it the way it did. It 
sold papers, but it made my fans and family miserable, and I 
thought that was a bigger price to pay than the $50,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook would not say what provoked him to hit Davis, who  
threw no punches but took several and was left face down with a 
bloody nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's strictly between me and Stephen,'' Westbrook said. ``We  
had a fight, and it was for a reason. I apologized to him. We sat 
down and talked since, and we're really good friends now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was selected No. 4 overall in the 1995 draft, Westbrook  
has been suspended twice, fined twice and benched three times for 
various infractions on and off the field. He has missed 16 games 
due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was enjoying his best season -- 44 catches, 736  
yards -- before suffering a neck injury Dec. 6 against San Diego. He 
had surgery in January is expected to fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
	When healthy, Westbrook has been criticized by coaches for  
running bad pass routes and for his lax work ethic. Westbrook 
offered other explanations for his disappointing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offensive line hasn't been healthy. I haven't been  
healthy,'' he said. ``The quarterbacks didn't know if they wanted 
to play quarterback or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I've done the best that I can do on the field  
when the opportunity has presented itself. ... If I can just play 
16 games. Judge me on 16 games, 16 healthy games.''

<HEADLINE>  Jacobs Puts Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Owner Richard Jacobs put the Cleveland Indians  
on the market Thursday, hoping to find someone willing to keep the 
team in town and its reputation intact as one of baseball's hottest 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, 'Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the laughingstock team with his late 
brother, David, for $45 million in 1986, said he decided a few 
weeks ago it was the right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved National Football League franchise to Baltimore. Only now 
is the sports-crazed city recovering from that as it welcomes back 
the new Browns, who start play this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians aren't leaving, Jacobs said, seeking to reassure  
fans. ``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. 
We have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to 
move a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cleveland-area candidates were among the bidders for the  
new Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off-guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers for the 99-year-old franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	With the price for major sports teams skyrocketing -- the  
Redskins sale for $800 million is pending -- Jacobs understands that 
now may be the perfect time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock soared $6.31 1/4 to $16.25 in trading on the  
Nasdaq stock market on the strength of the announcement.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the euro and other major  
Western currencies Thursday as a faint possibility of peace in 
Kosovo emerged with the partial withdrawal of Yugoslav troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's lone increase against major currencies occurred  
against the yen as an International Monetary Fund official 
discounted Japan's ability to quickly recover from its recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0660 in late trading in New York, up  
from $1.0653 late Wednesday. Also, the dollar was quoted at 1.5027 
Swiss francs, down from 1.5056, and 1.4583 Canadian dollars, down 
from 1.4592. The British pound rose to $1.6205 from $1.6176. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar rose to 121.85 Japanese yen from 120.95  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders bought major Western currencies and sold the U.S.  
dollar, traditionally seen as a safe haven, as Yugoslav troops 
began leaving Kosovo. The televised withdrawal followed a Yugoslav 
army withdrawal order Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell even though Western authorities said the troop  
movement possibly was a sham to counter disbelief over Sunday's 
withdrawal order. 
</P>
<P>
	But the euro is the currency of 11 European countries that are  
expected to bear the brunt of rebuilding Yugoslavia once the NATO 
airstrikes cease the pounding that started at the end of March. The 
bill increases each time another building is bombed, so the euro 
rises at each whiff of the conflict ceasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The euro's strength against the dollar was in response to  
increasing prospects for a Yugoslavian troop withdrawal,'' said Jim 
Collins, a currency futures analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Inc.'s 
Chicago office. Trading in Europe, however, was light with most of 
the continent closed for Ascension Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the yen began during Asian trading  
when IMF deputy director for research Flemming Larsen warned 
reporters in Tokyo that the worst parts of Japan's recession may 
not be over and it could take years of massive stimulus spending 
for the economy to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	That counters recent reports from Japanese officials that  
Japan's worst recession since World War II had seemed to hit 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the euro countries are no longer traded separately  
and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8349  
German marks, down from 1.8359; 6.1538 French francs, down from 
6.1576; and 1,814.88 Italian lire, down from 1,818.18.

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Vacation in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton are taking a Florida vacation later this month, the 
White House announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the Clintons would  
stay at White Oak Plantation from May 25 to May 30. White Oak is a 
conservation center and retreat in Yulee, Fla., on the state's 
north Atlantic coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea Clinton, a sophomore at Stanford University, was not  
expected to accompany her parents on the trip, according to the 
first lady's office. 
</P>
<P>
	White Oak is near Amelia Island, where Clinton and Vice  
President Al Gore attended a $50,000 per couple fund-raising 
retreat for the Democratic Party in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Miami Commissioner Gets Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former Miami city commissioner serving time in  
prison for voter fraud has been sentenced to four years in federal 
prison and $3.2 million in restitution in a separate mortgage fraud 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Humberto Hernandez, sentenced last year to 364 days in prison on  
the fraud charges, will serve the sentences concurrently, U.S. 
District Judge Joan Lenard said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He would be eligible for parole in three years.  
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was elected to the city commission in 1996. He was  
convicted in August 1998 of a misdemeanor voter fraud charge 
stemming from accusations that he covered up an illegal absentee 
vote by a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after his conviction, Hernandez reached a plea agreement  
on separate charges that he was part of a mortgage fraud ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was among several elected and appointed Miami  
officials charged in wide-ranging public corruption investigations.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- At first glance, the good vs. evil  
struggle depicted in Lifequest comics appears similar to the plot 
of any other fantasy tale. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's something different behind the story of 12-year-old  
Sarah and her quest to defeat the Scarlet Dragon. Creator Matt 
VanderPol says he's inspired by the parables of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great storyteller. He spoke truth, and his philosophy  
came through in his stories,'' says the 26-year-old artist. ``I 
want to be a Christian artist, and I believe this can reach kids 
without being preachy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he adds, ``I didn't want to come across as too  
Christian because it might turn someone off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lifequest does not mention Christianity directly and is not  
being marketed as a religious comic book, but the story begins in 
``End Times,'' the chaotic period that some Christians believe will 
precede Jesus' return, and characters sometimes pray. 
</P>
<P>
	The story follows Sarah and Ridge, an apelike giant who is her  
friend and protector, in their quest to defeat the Scarlet Dragon, 
although the reasons for their efforts have yet to be fully 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice O'Connor of Annapolis, Md., who regularly reads the  
comics to his 18-month-old daughter, says he didn't even realize 
the story was Christian-inspired until he read the author's note at 
the end of one of the books. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody from any particular faith can read these,'' says  
O'Connor, who wrote VanderPol to thank him for the way Lifequest 
avoids violence and portrays girls as capable and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifequest has none of the scantily clad women that populate many  
comic books, and the series' tone diverges from that of many other 
comics. ``So many are so dark and violent,'' VanderPol says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, teen readers of Lifequest find much that's familiar,  
including suspenseful action and occasional bathroom humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Learning how to balance his ideology with mainstream tastes has  
been tricky, VanderPol says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to folks at my church. They said, `Hey don't be so  
uptight, don't worry about it,''' he says. ``My pastor told me not 
to worry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	VanderPol says he turned to God after the painful breakup of a  
college romance. Around the same time, he began drawing Sarah and 
Ridge. Religion, he says, has helped him stay focused. He says he 
hopes his comics bring readers a little pleasure in a world he 
describes as ``gritty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If my book helps someone, an abused kid, feel some hope, that  
would be wonderful,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lifequest series has not been without controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	VanderPol got some complaints for anti-abortion dedication in  
his third issue. An accompanying illustration of moaning babies 
upset some readers, and one woman wrote to complain the imagery was 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
	VanderPol says he does not regret expressing his views.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Pruett, VanderPol's editor at Caliber Comics who approved  
the dedication before the issue was published, said, ``Frankly, 
there are a lot worse things in comic books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett, who also describes himself as a Christian, says there is  
no consensus on just what a Christian comic book should look like. 
About 1,000 copies of each of the four Lifequest books released so 
far have been sold, mainly through secular book stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Pruett expects the market for VanderPol's work to grow,  
especially as more parents conclude that many other comics are 
simply too violent for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	At one store, Grand Rapids' Apparitions Comics and Books,  
manager Dave Pirkola says the series' first issue sold out. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a small press, Lifequest's selling phenomenally well,'' he  
says. ``It's just a well-drawn, fun comic book with an interesting 
story.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Groups Endorse FCC Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Religious organizations endorsed a Federal  
Communications Commission plan Thursday to create a new very local 
radio service that could be used by churches, students and 
community groups. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard has been building grass-roots support  
for his plan, which the broadcasting industry and some key 
Republican telecommunications lawmakers oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would create thousands of licensed low-tech FM  
radio stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts. It would reverse a 
roughly 20-year-old ban against such licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents fear that the low-power service would create  
interference to existing FM radio broadcasts and jeopardize plans 
for the radio industry to switch to higher-quality digital 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But representatives from the National Council of Churches of  
Christ, the United Church of Christ and U.S. Catholic Conference 
said it would be a low-cost way to give churches and minorities a 
voice on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have fought for this for nearly 50 years,'' said Rev.  
Everett Parker of the United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a crying need for people to be able to get accurate,  
unbiased news and information about their localities,'' said Rev. 
Joan Campbell, general secretary to the National Council of 
Churches.

<HEADLINE> RJR Spinoff Pension Plan Augmented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal pension insurance agency announced  
an agreement Wednesday with RJR Nabisco for protecting underfunded 
pensions of its spinoff tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. said the pension plan  
covering both Nabisco and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco employees will be 
split into two plans when the spinoff is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the new RJR Reynolds Tobacco will provide  
more than $400 million of financial protection for the plan 
covering about 21,000 tobacco workers and retirees. The PBGC said 
that plan otherwise would be underfunded by nearly $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco announced in March its intention to spin off its  
U.S. cigarette business from its food interests after selling its 
international tobacco business for nearly $8 billion to Japan 
Tobacco Inc. The international tobacco sale was completed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The spinoff of the domestic tobacco business, which makes  
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes, is expected to be completed by 
June 15. 
</P>
<P>
	PBGC is a federal agency created by Congress in 1974 to  
guarantee payment of basic pension benefits earned by some 42 
million workers and retirees.

<HEADLINE> Carrey Filming New Comedy in R.I. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAMESTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Jim Carrey looks so sharp in a Rhode  
Island State Police uniform that the force is tempted to offer him 
a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrey is in Rhode Island to film a new comedy, ``Me, Myself and  
Irene.'' He plays a state trooper with two personalities, both in 
love with the same woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is by Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the Rhode Island  
brothers who made ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``Dumb and 
Dumber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Farrelly brothers consulted with the state police to make  
sure Carrey looked authentic. They did a good job, said Maj. Harold 
Watson, the No. 2 person on the force. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their main concern was getting the uniform right,'' Watson  
said. 
</P>

<P>
	ARCADIA, La. (AP) -- For almost 30 years, parents have sent their  
teen-agers to a Baptist boarding school ringed by razor-wire-topped 
fences in the rugged hill country of north Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at the New Bethany school spend much of their time  
praying and memorizing Scripture. Their monthly contact with the 
outside world is a single, monitored five-minute call to their 
parents, say former students. They tell of being struck with wooden 
paddles if they swear or talk about running away. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, youths sometimes flee four miles through pine forests  
and brambles to the local sheriff's department, where deputies let 
them call their parents and plead to come home. Some escapees 
allege abuse or neglect by their keepers or beatings by fellow 
students in the name of God. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rev. Mack Ford, a former missionary who founded New  
Bethany in 1971, has repeatedly tried to keep child abuse 
investigators and fire inspectors away, saying state officials 
oppose the school's fundamentalist religious approach and want to 
shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Ford is trying to further insulate the school by seeking a  
federal court order that would make it more difficult for state 
social workers to make unannounced school visits. Ford also is 
seeking at least $250,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge threw out his federal civil rights lawsuit in December,  
but Ford filed an appeal expected to be heard this summer by 5th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``State bureaucrats are poking their noses into matters which  
they have no business asking questions about,'' said Ford's lawyer, 
John Hodge. ``The teachings of New Bethany may be unorthodox to 
many, but we contend that New Bethany has a right to hold and to 
teach these matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the state worry that Ford might win an injunction  
prohibiting visits by social workers and interviews with students 
about child abuse complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not harassing them,'' says Henry Bernstein, an assistant  
attorney general. ``We're just doing what we're supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford didn't respond to repeated requests for an interview and a  
tour of the school in rural Bienville Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a legal dispute with state officials two decades ago over  
licensing, Ford complained that regulators wanted to put the state 
above God: ``Their philosophy and the Bible philosophy won't 
meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 raid at the school is at the heart of Ford's current  
complaint. State workers say they went to the school as part of a 
child abuse investigation, but Hodge contends they really wanted to 
question youths about the school's religious teachings and 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer says one social worker said she considered it a form  
of abuse for Ford to stand in the church pulpit and warn students 
they would go to hell unless they developed a personal relationship 
with Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rev. Ford has a right to present that view without being  
monitored by the state,'' Hodge said. 
</P>
<P>
	But state officials say in court documents that school employees  
have administered ``severe whippings.'' They allege one boy was 
paddled so severely that his buttocks bled. 
</P>
<P>
	When a state social services supervisor, Janet Denise Fair,  
visited the school in 1996, male students hid in nearby woods and 
female students refused to speak with her. Ford refused to say 
whether students Fair sought to interview were still at the school 
and would not provide the names of their parents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Fair says, she opened a closet and found an  
unattended baby. She was told it was the child of people visiting 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Birch, who was at New Bethany from 1994 to 1996 and is  
now a 20-year-old nursing student at Lamar University in Beaumont, 
Texas, said in an interview that she was among students encouraged 
to beat other young women who disobeyed rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``When one girl said she didn't believe in God, we smashed her  
face into a wall,'' Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
	One teen who tried to escape was forced to wear a dog collar and  
was led on a leash by another student, Birch said. She also read 
students' outgoing mail, discarding pages that complained of 
mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were just a lot of girls that we did things to that were  
wrong,'' Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Bethany was billed as a way of redirecting teens whose  
parents believed they were veering toward drugs or other trouble, 
and for years Ford promoted the school at churches around the 
country, traveling with a choir of female students. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would bring people to tears,'' says Becky Wisdom, 24, of  
Denton, Texas. ``He'd tell about how all these girls were desolate 
and out on the street until they came to New Bethany and turned 
their lives around, then we'd sing our little hearts out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisdom, who attended the school in 1991, said she escaped once  
and made her way to the sheriff's offices in Arcadia. Deputies let 
her call her father, but he refused to let her come home. 
</P>
<P>
	Returned to New Bethany, she had to eat alone and wear ``the  
highest heels possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hodge says many complaints from former students are not credible  
because they come from rebellious teens angry at being sent to New 
Bethany. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney says parents agree to keep their children in New  
Bethany for one year, know the school uses corporal punishment and 
sign legal papers transferring power of attorney over the students 
to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has operated so long that neighbors simply accept it  
as a mysterious part of the landscape, off-limits to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	As cars drive along the state highway next to the compound,  
youths in bright red and blue uniforms stare sullenly at motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	They're trained to do that, said Chief Deputy Lucky Raley of the  
Bienville Parish sheriff's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials worry about what could happen if they ever had  
to respond to an emergency at the compound. Ford has refused to 
provide a map of the school buildings and grounds and student 
identities, Raley says, adding, ``He says the Lord will take care 
of them.''

<HEADLINE> Wesleyan Reviews Pornography Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- The president of Wesleyan University  
has ordered a review of a class that he says may be too liberal for 
the liberal arts college. 
</P>
<P>
	The course, ``Pornography: Writing of Prostitutes,'' examines  
pornography as a cultural and political practice. Its reading list 
includes the Marquis de Sade and academic critiques of Hustler 
magazine. As a final project, students must produce their own work 
of pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	One student in Professor Hope Weissman's class submitted a short  
film that focused on a man's eyes while he masturbated. In another, 
a female student acted out a scene of sexual bondage. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Weissman, a self-described feminist who helped develop the  
women's studies program at the school, told The Hartford Courant 
that she puts no constraints on her students' project ideas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I push people over the line, whatever their line is, but only  
when I think they can go there and come back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The projects caught the attention of university President  
Douglas Bennett, who in a memo dated Tuesday and distributed to 
faculty questioned ``the appropriateness of this course in the 
Wesleyan curriculum.'' He ordered a review of the course. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Edwards-Tiekert, a junior majoring in English and American  
studies, complained the review was spurred by media reports -- and 
not complaints from students or alumni. He said the school is 
sacrificing academic freedom for public image. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taken the faculty out of the equation,'' Edwards-Tiekert  
said. ``It just seems like a very dangerous trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Holder, a spokesman for Wesleyan, denied that the  
university is compromising academic standards. He said the class 
went through the traditional approval process when it debuted last 
year, but university officials had no way of knowing every aspect 
of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	``By asserting responsibility for the content of our curriculum,  
we are strengthening it,'' Holder said.

<HEADLINE> NOAA Gets Woman Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first woman to command a U.S. government  
ship is now in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Corps, the nation's seventh uniformed service. 
</P>
<P>
	Rear Adm. Evelyn Fields took command of the 229-member corps  
this week following her confirmation by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	NOAA Corp, part of the Commerce Department, operates research  
ships and aircraft studying the weather, oceans and fish. It traces 
its roots to the Coast and Geodetic Survey founded in 1807. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely pleased that this exceptional, visionary  
officer will serve at the head of the NOAA Corps,'' said Commerce 
Secretary William Daley. ``She was the first African-American woman 
to be commissioned in the NOAA Corps, the first woman to command a 
federal ship,'' he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	She succeeds Rear Adm. William L. Stubblefield, who retired on  
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields began her career with the NOAA in 1972 as a cartographer  
at the Atlantic Marine Center in Norfolk, Va., and in 1973 -- when 
the NOAA began recruiting women into its commissioned service -- was 
the first black woman to join. She is now the most senior woman in 
the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the first woman to serve as commanding officer on a NOAA  
ship, the McArthur, as well as the first woman to command a federal 
ship for an extended period within the nation's uniformed services. 
</P>
<P>
	She also served as the second U.S. exchange hydrographer with  
Canada and attended the Armed Forces Staff College. 
</P>
<P>
	NOAA Corps airplanes fly into the eyes of hurricanes to measure  
their strength and chart their movement. It was the NOAA Corps 
sonar ship Rude that located the wreckage of TWA Flight 800. The 
agency produces the nation's nautical charts for shipping vessels 
and it produced maps of the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert 
Storm in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Sponsor: Public Wary on Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A survey for Olympics sponsor John Hancock  
concluded that public confidence in the sponsors dropped 
dramatically since the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phooey,'' responded Salt Lake Olympics chief Mitt Romney.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hancock survey of 500 people found 20 percent ``have now  
lost faith in not only the Olympics but in the companies that 
sponsor the Olympics and their products,'' company President David 
D'Alessandro said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, meanwhile, cited surveys made for the U.S. Olympic  
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of the 1,000 respondents consistently have said  
their feelings for Olympic sponsors have not changed, and 11 
percent said they were even more supportive of sponsors. The 
Hancock survey found only 3 percent to 4 percent said they were 
more likely to buy an Olympic sponsor's product. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a case of dueling polls,'' Romney said. ``And in my  
view the duel was decided when General Motors voted with their 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, General Motors Corp. said it wasn't letting the  
scandal stand in the way of its $1 billion Olympics marketing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said the figure in the Hancock poll indicating only  
3 percent to 4 percent were more likely to buy a sponsor's product 
was down dramatically from surveys taken after the 1998 Nagano 
Games. Those surveys found 30 percent were more likely to buy a 
company's products because of its Olympic association. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put $40 million into this type of venture, you don't  
expect it to go the other way on you. You're spending money to club 
yourself over the head,'' D'Alessandro said. John Hancock paid $40 
million for a Sydney sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, who recently announced he was resigning as USOC's  
marketing chief, said D'Alessandro ``exaggerated some very narrowly 
focused data that he and only he is privy to. It's inaccurate, and 
it's done to further his position, which has been to chill the 
Olympic sponsorship market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why D'Alessandro would purposely devalue a cause his  
company supports -- Krimsky told The Salt Lake Tribune, ``To get his 
name back on the front page.'' 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro has removed the Olympic symbols from company  
stationery, billboards and its annual report. John Hancock also 
canceled negotiations for $20 million in Olympic television ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney predicted the company's attitude would thaw in the coming  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``My bet is he will end up supporting the athletes and the Salt  
Lake Games when all this is over,'' Romney said. ``He has a beef 
with the IOC, not with Salt Lake and not with the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Gonzalez May Be Put on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Juan Gonzalez's most recent home run  
could land him on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The reigning AL MVP was out of the Texas Rangers' lineup  
Thursday night against Baltimore and could miss several more games 
because of a strained right hamstring suffered while hitting a home 
run Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez left the game in Chicago after the fourth-inning homer  
and got the day off Wednesday because of a rainout. When he arrived 
at The Ballpark on Thursday, Gonzalez still wasn't comfortable 
enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Juan is feeling a little better, but he's a little bit sore,''  
Rangers trainer Danny Wheat said. ``We're looking at three to five 
days (off). Then when Juan tell us he can go, he's going to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas manager Johnny Oates said the team won't consider putting  
Gonzalez on the DL before next Friday's game in Baltimore. Until 
then, the Rangers have four games against Baltimore and three 
against Tampa Bay, all at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we have to go this homestand without him, we do,'' Oates  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ivan Rodriguez moved into Gonzalez's cleanup spot from No. 6 and  
Roberto Kelly started in right field. Second baseman Mark McLemore 
became the team's only reserve outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers don't have the luxury of using Gonzalez as the  
designated hitter because Rafael Palmeiro, who has been there all 
but once this season, is recovering from two knee operations and 
has yet to play in the field. If necessary, Palmeiro could play 
first and Lee Stevens could move to the outfield. Stevens played 
seven games there last year and 22 games in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas isn't anxious to put Gonzalez on the DL because the  
obvious move would be to recall top propect Ruben Mateo. Although 
Mateo is probably ready to hit big-league pitching, the team is 
adamant about wanting him to play a full season at Triple-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Gonzalez have to go on the DL, it might not be for very  
long. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Rangers don't make the move until next Friday and make it  
retroactive to Wednesday, he'd be eligible to return May 28 at home 
against Minnesota after missing only six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who has been on the DL each of the last three seasons,  
had played the first 33 games this year and 77 straight since last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez had been hot lately, going 7-for-11 over his last three  
games to raise his average to .323. Going into Thursday's games, he 
was tied for ninth in the AL with eight homers and fifth with 29 
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Former Richmond Mayor Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Former mayor Leonidas B. Young has been  
sentenced to two years in federal prison for obstruction of 
justice, filing a false tax return and two counts of mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney James B. Comey recommended a light  
sentence because Young is cooperating in a continuing investigation 
of criminal activity in Richmond. Young could have received up to 
23 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``My presence here today is a result of my own personal  
misjudgment and, I shudder to say, stupidity,'' Young said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Baptist pastor who held public office in Richmond for seven  
years, Young was indicted last fall on 19 felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Young peddled influence during his term as  
mayor and defrauded members of his Fourth Baptist Church 
congregation to support extramarital liaisons. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to four counts in a plea agreement Feb. 1.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Safety Out To Prove Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- While most of his buddies were  
talking about old times, learning new plays and seemingly enjoying 
themselves during the New York Giants minicamp this week, safety 
Percy Ellsworth was kicking things. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time he failed to pick off a pass in his zone, dropped one  
or got beat on a play, something got booted -- the ball, a sideline 
marker, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it a product of the NFL marketplace.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth went there in the offseason and it really didn't treat  
him right. Despite sharing the team lead over the last three 
seasons with 12 interceptions, the safety who started nine of 16 
games last season wasn't able to land a big contract for his fourth 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	So he is stuck with the offer extended by the Giants after last  
season -- one-year tender for $429,000, the league minimum. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer gave Ellsworth the right to test free agency, but also  
gave the Giants the right of first refusal on any deal he signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some teams offered a little more money, but no one came through  
with big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really, really upset at first,'' Ellsworth said Thursday  
as the Giants finished a three-day minicamp. ``It was more anger 
than disappointment. But over time, and after talking to different 
teams and hearing what they felt like, I'm not really at peace, but 
close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A generally easygoing guy on the field, Ellsworth seemed more  
intense during the minicamp. Not only is he looking to win one of 
the starting jobs at safety, he also wants to put up big numbers 
this year on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the people interested in me let me know they would  
still be watching all year long,'' said Ellsworth, who earned a 
spot on the Giants as a free agent in 1996. ``I feel better now 
that I've had a chance to talk to some people. It eased my mind. At 
first, I thought: `Nobody wants me. What's wrong?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the teams that expressed an interest in Ellsworth said  
they liked what they saw, but would have been more willing to offer 
him a big contract had he played more. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel can understand Ellsworth's frustration,  
but he said the former Virginia product has worked hard instead of 
sulking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Percy is a competitor. He doesn't take a back (seat) to  
anyone,'' Fassel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsworth's chances of moving into the starting lineup aren't  
bad with Tito Wooten coming off a sub-par season and in danger of 
being a salary-cap victim next month. If that happened, Ellsworth 
and Shaun Williams, the Giants' 1998 first-round draft pick, would 
compete for the starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	After next season, Ellsworth will be an unrestricted free agent  
if the Giants don't re-sign him by Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't want to leave for the sake of leaving,''  
Ellsworth said. ``I have a lot of friends and love the city. I just 
want to do all I can to help the team win and I'll see what 
happens.''

<HEADLINE> Payton Might Leave Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton is unhappy that his Seattle  
SuperSonics are on the outside looking in at the NBA playoffs. But 
he says he's made no trade demand should the team not improve next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't hear me say that. Nobody's heard me say that,''  
Payton said Thursday night from Atlanta, where he was an analyst 
for coverage of NBA playoff games on TNT and TBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was reacting to reports that the Seattle Times quoted him  
as saying he would demand a trade if the Sonics don't improve next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I said was we had to make some changes,'' Payton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really deal with the media anymore. It's all crazy and  
they say what they want to say,'' Payton said. ``If I wanted a 
trade, I would have had a news conference and said I wanted to be 
traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the comments on tape. The quotes are accurate,'' Don  
Shelton, assistant sports editor of The Seattle Times, said. ``We 
don't know how the Times' story was characterized to Payton but 
we're confident that when he sees his comments in context he'll 
realize the Times' story was fair and accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Times story, Payton said he plans to meet soon with team  
president and general manager Wally Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to listen, then get me out of here,'' Payton  
said he would tell Walker. ``If things don't improve, I'm done with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton averaged 21.7 points -- the second-best mark of his  
nine-year NBA career -- this season, but the Sonics missed the 
playoffs with a 25-25 record. He helped the Sonics reach the NBA 
Finals three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had articles written about me, saying I'm a joke for  
this, a joke for that,'' Payton told the newspaper. ``Take me off 
this team and we'll see what the joke is. People are blaming me -- 
as always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, Payton said acting as an analyst while other  
teams play for the NBA title was ``weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen,'' Payton said. ``You can't stop playing  
basketball or stop living. You do everything possible next year to 
make sure it doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be fine (next season). I'm not worried as long as it  
doesn't become a repeat thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was chosen to the NBA All-Defensive team for the sixth  
time Thursday.

<P>
	In the newspaper story, Payton said he wants Walker and Sonics  
owner Barry Ackerley to make major improvements to the Sonics in a 
hurry. He plans to become more vocal in the future. He thinks he's 
earned that right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans know ... I've been good to Seattle, good to my  
teammates,'' Payton said. ``I've never said anything negative. I've 
been keeping quiet, trying to be the good guy, and it's backfired 
on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was upset about the makeup of this season's Seattle team.  
He said the players openly bickered more than any other team he's 
played for with the Sonics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was unfairly pinpointed as the team malcontent after  
a practice blowup with Vin Baker and an outburst in Portland. He 
said both were overblown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only one who doesn't complain,'' he said. ``I just  
come into the locker room, and I don't talk to the media. If I say 
the wrong thing, they'll put it in the papers and say I'm 
complaining about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton met with Walker after last season, but didn't make any  
specific demands. He will be specific this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only going to be around for four or five more years and I  
want to win,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Payton, the Sonics' biggest needs are a backup  
point guard, another shooter and a competent big man. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton wants his friend, Baker, to return. Baker and Payton have  
the same representatives, brothers Aaron and Eric Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, who had a subpar season, averaging 13.8 points, is  
expected to opt to become a free agent. If the Sonics are to keep 
him, they might have to offer him a maximum contract of $87 million 
for seven seasons.

<HEADLINE> Lands' End Profits Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DODGEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Catalog and Internet retailer Lands' End  
reported a 6 percent gain in first-quarter earnings from a year 
ago, boosted by strong sales from the liquidation of its Willis &AMP; 
Geiger outdoor-clothing catalog. 
</P>
<P>
	Lands' End earnings from continuing operations were $5.7  
million, or 18 cents a share, for the quarter ended April 30, 
compared with $5.2 million, or 17 cents a share, in the same period 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates. Lands' End  
stock was up $3.68 3/4 at $42 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $289.6 million, up from $268.6  
million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that sales growth came primarily from increased  
liquidations, about half of which was from the liquidation of the 
Willis &AMP; Geiger catalog. The closing was part of a restructuring 
plan put in place earlier this year to cut costs and boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company's specialty business segment,  
represented by the kids, corporate sales and Coming Home catalogs 
showed strong growth. Internet sales were also solid. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lands' End said that sales at its core catalog, which is  
about 60 percent of its total business, remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first quarter was $6.5 million, or 21 cents a  
share, including a gain of $800,000, or 3 cents, for reversing part 
of a previous charge for Willis &AMP; Geiger's closing. The reversal 
was because liquidation sales at the unit were better than 
expected.

<HEADLINE> Payton Might Leave Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton is unhappy that his Seattle  
SuperSonics are on the outside looking in at the NBA playoffs. But 
he says he's made no trade demand should the team not improve next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't hear me say that. Nobody's heard me say that,''  
Payton said Thursday night from Atlanta, where he was an analyst 
for coverage of NBA playoff games on TNT and TBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was reacting to reports that the Seattle Times quoted him  
as saying he would demand a trade if the Sonics don't improve next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I said was we had to make some changes,'' Payton said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really deal with the media anymore. It's all crazy and  
they say what they want to say,'' Payton said. ``If I wanted a 
trade, I would have had a news conference and said I wanted to be 
traded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Times story, Payton said he plans to meet soon with team  
president and general manager Wally Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to listen, then get me out of here,'' Payton  
said he would tell Walker. ``If things don't improve, I'm done with 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton averaged 21.7 points -- the second-best mark of his  
nine-year NBA career -- this season, but the Sonics missed the 
playoffs with a 25-25 record. He helped the Sonics reach the NBA 
Finals three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had articles written about me, saying I'm a joke for  
this, a joke for that,'' Payton told the newspaper. ``Take me off 
this team and we'll see what the joke is. People are blaming me -- 
as always.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, Payton said acting as an analyst while other  
teams play for the NBA title was ``weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen,'' Payton said. ``You can't stop playing  
basketball or stop living. You do everything possible next year to 
make sure it doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be fine (next season). I'm not worried as long as it  
doesn't become a repeat thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton was chosen to the NBA All-Defensive team for the sixth  
time Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the newspaper story, Payton said he wants Walker and Sonics  
owner Barry Ackerley to make major improvements to the Sonics in a 
hurry. He plans to become more vocal in the future. He thinks he's 
earned that right. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans know ... I've been good to Seattle, good to my

on me.''

<HEADLINE> AMA Says Doctors' Income Declining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The median income for the nation's doctors  
declined for the fourth consecutive year in 1997, in part because 
of managed care, according to a survey released Thursday by the 
American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	However, last year the AMA said doctors' average income was on  
the rise. The group refused to release the average figure this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The median income in 1997 was $164,000, meaning half the  
physicians surveyed earned more than that and half earned less. The 
median income the year before was $166,000, the AMA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA gathered its information in a telephone survey last year  
of 4,000 doctors. It said the numbers show median net income has 
fallen 1.4 percent each year since 1993 when adjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The median income figure is the best representative number,''  
said AMA spokesman Robert Mills. ``The mean figure is artificially 
high because the doctors who make a million dollars a year really 
skew the overall number when you consider that there are many 
doctors who make way less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Joel Shalowitz, director of the health services management  
program at Northwestern University's business school, said earnings 
are suffering because managed care firms are forcing doctors to 
justify services and negotiate fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, the allowable reimbursement for cataract surgery  
went from $1,500 to $1,600 down to $900 over the past decade,'' 
Shalowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Foody, a professor at the University of Chicago  
medical school, said salaries have also decreased at teaching 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't increased starting salaries in internal medicine  
for the last four years,'' Foody said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to another AMA survey done more recently, physicians  
worked a median of 48 hours a week in 1998, down from 56 in 1997.

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars Tickets Go On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Force was kind to those who waited.  
</P>
<P>
	Advance tickets for the first ``Stars Wars'' movie since 1983  
went on sale Wednesday amid a frenzied demand matched only by the 
film's hype. And ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' a 
prequel to the earlier George Lucas trilogy, doesn't even open 
until May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop fans across the country from putting up with  
driving rain, long lines, busy signals and clogged Web sites to 
become the first to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	After waiting a week in line -- and enduring the barbs of passing  
hecklers -- Johnny Shipman's faithfulness paid off: The 25-year-old 
welder was the first to buy tickets at a theater in Augusta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just intense,'' Shipman said. ``Cameras all in front of  
me, news crews and everything ... It was more than I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the film's early mixed reviews, tickets to the debut  
showings sold out within minutes and fans scrambled to get seats 
for later dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years for this,'' said Lee Dahlhauser,  
who bought the first tickets sold in Ames, Iowa, after spending all 
night in line in a driving rain covered with blankets and sheets of 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Director-producer George Lucas initially barred advanced ticket  
sales to prevent scalping, but relented under pressure from theater 
owners. In a compromise, theaters restricted sales to a maximum of 
12 tickets per person. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no early reports of scalping problems -- just  
thousands of fans eager to get tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered in 1977 -- and where fans have been camping 
out for weeks -- the line stretched along Hollywood Boulevard, down 
a side street and to the next block over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important we see it on opening day at Mann's Chinese  
Theatre,'' explained Susanna Modjallal, 30. ``If Lucas thought it 
was good enough to premiere here, it's good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the crowd outside the Senator Theater was three  
blocks long; Pete Levin, 32nd in line, had camped out with his 
sister and friend since 9 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me,'' Levin said of his  
determination to get tickets to the very first showing. ``I want to 
be surprised. I didn't want anyone to tell me the ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought it would be a bit more sane buying tickets by  
phone or over the Internet were in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people called MovieFone for tickets that circuits were  
jammed, even though the ticket service added lines. MovieFone's Web 
site was also swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has been even greater than we expected,'' said  
Christine Fakundiny, director of marketing for MovieFone. ``But 
people are getting through and we are processing them. The advice 
to the war weary is keeping trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Hoffman, 13, of New York said his mother had allowed him to  
skip school and wait in line all day for tickets. He said his 
mother ``knows how important it is to me.'' And his teachers? 
</P>
<P>
	``For all I know my teacher is on line at some other theater,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Eastgate Theatre in Portland, Ore., Gabe Elliot  
complained about people ahead of him who sang music from ``Star 
Wars'' and recited quotes from the ``Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail'' comedy film while he stood in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Elliot: ``I'm surrounded by psychos.''

<HEADLINE> Settlement Sought in Diet Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers representing millions of people who used  
the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national 
settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home 
Products Corp., a lawyer confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are in the earliest stages, but American Home Products  
hopes to reach an out-of-court deal in cases scheduled for trial in 
Texas this spring and summer, said Houston lawyer Graham Hill, 
whose partners, representing plaintiffs, attended two settlement 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the negotiations  
today, said American Home Products would pay billions of dollars 
under such a deal. Hill, however, said it was too early to put a 
price tag on a possible settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been several meetings, and a number of different  
proposals and scenarios have been discussed, but there are some 
difficult issues that are going to have to be agreed upon before 
anything of this magnitude can be concluded,'' Hill added. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products spokesman Lowell Weiner declined comment  
on the report this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company reached a settlement in the first trial  
over heart-valve damage from fen-phen, reportedly agreeing to pay 
$500,000 to one plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people contend they developed heart problems after  
taking the drugs. Some 6 million people in the United States used 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wants ``to avoid letting any of these cases go to  
trial and risk a really huge verdict,'' another Houston lawyer, Don 
Bowen, told the Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	A large jury verdict, he said, would ``considerably inflate'' a  
national settlement's price tag. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home  
Products marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination -- 
and Redux, a similar product. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Madison, N.J.-based drug maker pulled fenfluramine  
and Redux off the market at the Food and Drug Administration's 
request. A Mayo Clinic study had linked the drugs to potentially 
fatal heart valve damage.The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, 
was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still 
on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Settlements in at least nine cases, including those of four  
Texans, have resulted in amounts of up to $4.6 million. The company 
must put between $3 billion and $5 billion into a settlement before 
it is acceptable, some lawyers and Wall Street analysts told the 
Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug maker, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and  
Exchange Commission, stated it was aware of 2,615 lawsuits over 
fen-phen as of March 22. Class-action lawsuits are certified in 
Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West 
Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Wins Again in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal jury handed the tobacco  
industry its second victory in four days Thursday, deciding Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. was not at fault in the case of a smoker 
who died of lung cancer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Steele's family had sued for $26 million, claiming the  
nation's third-largest tobacco company sold him an unreasonably 
dangerous product. The factory worker picked up the habit in his 
late teens or early 20s, smoked 1 1/2 to two packs a day -- mostly 
Kools -- and died at 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Gary White said Steele ``was quite aware of the  
dangers, but the pleasures outweighed the dangers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a jury in Memphis, Tenn., cleared B&AMP;W and two other  
tobacco companies of liability in the deaths of three smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal, while the $51.5 million award in California was halved by a 
judge. Lawyers are preparing an appeal of the Oregon verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Missouri case, B&AMP;W argued that Steele never tried to quit  
smoking and that he was exposed to a host of cancer-causing 
chemicals through jobs at an aluminum foundry and at a brick-making 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict ``reflects recognition by the jury that Brown &AMP;  
Williamson acted responsibly in the processes of researching, 
testing and designing our products,'' said B&AMP;W attorney Steven 
McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury's conclusions are consistent with the majority of  
court decisions, agreeing that smoking is a matter of personal 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, J. Michael Cronan, said there will be no  
appeal.

<HEADLINE>  Netanyahu Losing Some Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's traditional  
support among ex-Soviet Jews is faltering, the former dissident who 
leads a powerful immigrants party said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Natan Sharansky, the industry and trade minister in Netanyahu's  
government, also refused to endorse the prime minister -- who is 
trailing badly in the polls ahead of Monday's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu had been lobbying Sharansky to make a declaration of  
support, reportedly offering his Israel B'Aliya party three 
ministries if he did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharansky steadfastly refused Thursday, saying neutrality was  
crucial for a party seeking the best possible post-election deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that if I change this decision the party will simply  
fall apart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing figures from polls commissioned by Israel B'Aliya,  
Sharansky said Netanyahu had lost support in recent weeks among 
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who make up a crucial 15 
percent of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Netanyahu was dominating on the Russian street for a long  
time,'' Sharansky said. In recent days, however, his support among 
immigrants has dropped from 65 percent to 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu had counted on solid support from former Soviet Jews  
to make up for lost votes in his Likud Party among members 
disillusioned with his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharansky warned that the immigrant vote was ``fluid'' and most  
supporters of his party had not changed the nationalistic views 
that led them to support Netanyahu's hard-line policies in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation will not be clear I think until the last day,''  
Sharansky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Netanyahu's main rival, Labor Party leader Ehud  
Barak, drawing support in the mid-40 percent range. Should he 
garner enough support among Russian immigrants he may win more than 
half the vote Monday even if three other minor party candidates 
stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the  
election goes to a runoff June 1. Netanyahu is seeking a second 
round, hoping to use the grace period to stage a comeback. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Netanyahu Losing Some Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's traditional  
support among ex-Soviet Jews is faltering, the former dissident who 
leads a powerful immigrants party said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Natan Sharansky, the industry and trade minister in Netanyahu's  
government, also refused to endorse the prime minister -- who is 
trailing badly in the polls ahead of Monday's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu had been lobbying Sharansky to make a declaration of  
support, reportedly offering his Israel B'Aliya party three 
ministries if he did so. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharansky steadfastly refused Thursday, saying neutrality was  
crucial for a party seeking the best possible post-election deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that if I change this decision the party will simply  
fall apart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing figures from polls commissioned by Israel B'Aliya,  
Sharansky said Netanyahu had lost support in recent weeks among 
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who make up a crucial 15 
percent of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Netanyahu was dominating on the Russian street for a long  
time,'' Sharansky said. In recent days, however, his support among 
immigrants has dropped from 65 percent to 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu had counted on solid support from former Soviet Jews  
to make up for lost votes in his Likud Party among members 
disillusioned with his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharansky warned that the immigrant vote was ``fluid'' and most  
supporters of his party had not changed the nationalistic views 
that led them to support Netanyahu's hard-line policies in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation will not be clear I think until the last day,''  
Sharansky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Netanyahu's main rival, Labor Party leader Ehud  
Barak, drawing support in the mid-40 percent range. Should he 
garner enough support among Russian immigrants he may win more than 
half the vote Monday even if three other minor party candidates 
stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, the  
election goes to a runoff June 1. Netanyahu is seeking a second 
round, hoping to use the grace period to stage a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	His chances appeared to be bolstered when Centrist party  
candidate Yitzhak Mordechai announced plans to stay in the race 
despite only single-digit support. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Mordechai's Centrist Party colleagues have urged him to  
withdraw since he has no chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever wants to leave, let him get up and go,'' Mordechai was  
quoted as saying by the Yediot Aharonot daily after meeting with 
party leaders. ``My decision won't change.''

minister earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Film Looks at Religion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANNES, France (AP) -- In the opening moments of ``Kadosh,'' an  
Orthodox Jewish man awakes and recites his morning prayers. In one 
traditional prayer he thanks God ``for not making me a woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With that, Amos Gitai, director of the first Israeli film chosen  
for Cannes competition in 25 years, makes his point -- and then he 
keeps on making it. This is a film that starts out bleak and just 
gets bleaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kadosh'' -- the word means ``sacred'' -- is a brutal attack on  
Orthodox Jewish life and its treatment of women, by a filmmaker who 
says it's his way of voting against the religious right in Monday's 
elections in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the acting is often excellent and the film searing and  
painful, many scenes are unnecessarily, agonizingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is, however, fascinating to watch, mainly because it  
was shot in Mea Shearim, the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in 
Jerusalem that is largely closed off to secular Israel and the rest 
of the world. Gitai managed to film the exteriors and some 
interiors there, providing an authentic view of a mysterious, 
shuttered world. 
</P>
<P>
	The story focuses on two sisters, Rivka and Malka, each  
struggling in her own way with the rules of her religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The beautiful Rivka loves her husband, Meir -- the man who prays  
in the film's opening. But after 10 years of trying, she has been 
unable to get pregnant. In the eyes of their community, this makes 
Rivka not a woman at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, Meir tells his passionate wife that sex is now a sin for  
them, because it is not leading to procreation. 
</P>
<P>
	As Rivka's situation becomes more desperate, her younger sister,  
Malka, finds she has been condemned to an arranged marriage with a 
man she hates -- taking her away from the one she loves, Yaacov, who 
has left Mea Shearim. 
</P>
<P>
	Things get worse: Rivka is forced to leave home and live in a  
room somewhere, so Meir can have a child with another wife -- even 
though a secular doctor has told Rivka it may actually be Meir who 
is sterile. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Malka, she endures a loveless wedding and an absolutely  
awful wedding night -- presented graphically here -- and, when she 
slips off for a tryst with her true love, is discovered and beaten 
by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, suffice it to say, things get worse, not better.  
</P>
<P>
	The film is written by Eliette Abecassis, a woman and a  
practicing Jew based in France who spent time living in Mea Shearim 
for her research. 
</P>
<P>
	The director makes no bones about his desire to make a strong  
political statement with the film, which opens in Israel on June 
10. A U.S. distributor has not yet been found. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this election, the choice is radical,'' says Gitai, who  
comes from a family that founded Israel's center-left Labor Party. 
``There has practically been a coup d'etat by the religious 
community. We must decide what kind of country we will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An interesting side story is that of the actress who plays  
Malka, 21-year-old Meital Barda. She grew up in an Orthodox family 
but left that life behind. She has several sexual scenes in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family wasn't happy with the thought of me doing such  
scenes,'' she said. ``But in the end, they supported me. I think 
the hand of God was with us.''

<HEADLINE>  Star Wars Tickets Go On Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Force was kind to those who waited.  
</P>
<P>
	Advance tickets for the first ``Stars Wars'' movie since 1983  
went on sale Wednesday amid a frenzied demand matched only by the 
film's hype. And ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' a 
prequel to the earlier George Lucas trilogy, doesn't even open 
until May 19. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop fans across the country from putting up with  
driving rain, long lines, busy signals and clogged Web sites to 
become the first to buy tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	After waiting a week in line -- and enduring the barbs of passing  
hecklers -- Johnny Shipman's faithfulness paid off: The 25-year-old 
welder was the first to buy tickets at a theater in Augusta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just intense,'' Shipman said. ``Cameras all in front of  
me, news crews and everything ... It was more than I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the film's early mixed reviews, tickets to the debut  
showings sold out within minutes and fans scrambled to get seats 
for later dates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting 16 years for this,'' said Lee Dahlhauser,  
who bought the first tickets sold in Ames, Iowa, after spending all 
night in line in a driving rain covered with blankets and sheets of 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
	Director-producer George Lucas initially barred advanced ticket  
sales to prevent scalping, but relented under pressure from theater 
owners. In a compromise, theaters restricted sales to a maximum of 
12 tickets per person. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no early reports of scalping problems -- just  
thousands of fans eager to get tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, where the original  
``Star Wars'' premiered in 1977 -- and where fans have been camping 
out for weeks -- the line stretched along Hollywood Boulevard, down 
a side street and to the next block over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important we see it on opening day at Mann's Chinese  
Theatre,'' explained Susanna Modjallal, 30. ``If Lucas thought it 
was good enough to premiere here, it's good enough for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, the crowd outside the Senator Theater was three  
blocks long; Pete Levin, 32nd in line, had camped out with his 
sister and friend since 9 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want anyone to spoil it for me,'' Levin said of his  
determination to get tickets to the very first showing. ``I want to 
be surprised. I didn't want anyone to tell me the ending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who thought it would be a bit more sane buying tickets by  
phone or over the Internet were in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	So many people called MovieFone for tickets that circuits were  
jammed, even though the ticket service added lines. MovieFone's Web 
site was also swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demand has been even greater than we expected,'' said  
Christine Fakundiny, director of marketing for MovieFone. ``But 
people are getting through and we are processing them. The advice 
to the war weary is keeping trying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Hoffman, 13, of New York said his mother had allowed him to  
skip school and wait in line all day for tickets. He said his 
mother ``knows how important it is to me.'' And his teachers? 
</P>
<P>
	``For all I know my teacher is on line at some other theater,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the Eastgate Theatre in Portland, Ore., Gabe Elliot  
complained about people ahead of him who sang music from ``Star 
Wars'' and recited quotes from the ``Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail'' comedy film while he stood in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Elliot: ``I'm surrounded by psychos.''

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Scatter Photos to Winds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWEST CITY, Okla. (AP) -- The black-and-white photo of the  
young bride is stained with mud. Debris coats an image of a little 
girl cradling a newborn on her lap. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs, dirty and torn, are among hundreds piling up at  
a lost-and-found site at the First Christian Church. Despite their 
blemishes, the pictures are sought-after treasures, crucial pieces 
of history for residents devastated by last week's tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would mean so much to just get back one if I lost  
everything,'' said Shauna Becker, who started the photo retrieval 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 3 twisters killed 44 people in Oklahoma, including a  
woman, missing since the storm, whose body was found Wednesday and 
identified today. It injured hundreds more and destroyed thousands 
of homes. But the statistics do not account for the sentimental 
treasures and precious keepsakes suddenly swept away. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moore, 73-year-old Thelma Pruegert picked through the heap of  
furniture, lumber and cars tossed where her house once stood. She 
had recovered other people's photographs, but the photos of her 16 
great-grandchildren were nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street, Barbara Sexton, 66, found her mother's wedding  
picture plastered against a wall. The rest of her photographs 
escaped damage inside an antique trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was real happy,'' she said. ``That's our lives in there.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Becker, a new mother at age 28, didn't know what to expect  
when she posted fliers offering the church as a repository. But she 
had to do something after finding a 1971 picture of a man posing 
with his car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, what if that is someone's dad?'' she said. ``What  
if that's the only picture they have of him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Wednesday, hundreds of photographs had arrived at the church.  
It will be open weekly for residents searching for treasured 
keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first night, a man was reunited with his patch from the  
Vietnam War, and a family found a photo of a niece. A couple whose 
grandson died in the tornado recognized his baby photos on a 
television broadcast and picked them up. 
</P>
<P>
	Other photos wait for their stories to be told: A family wearing  
leis poses on a Hawaiian beach. Four bridesmaids in pink dresses 
staring soberly toward an unseen bride. A woman standing in fresh 
snow, wearing a long black coat of another era. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Abbott and her husband, Terry Hardy, came looking for  
scrapbooks that disappeared with most of their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Abbott's tears rolled down her cheeks and onto the floor as  
she described a particular photograph. It was a sonogram image 
taken by doctors who thought it would confirm an enormous ovarian 
cyst. Instead it revealed tiny hands and feet. It was the first 
picture to go in her son's baby book. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the start of us being a family,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's when we decided to be something,'' Hardy added softly  
at her side. 
</P>
<P>
	Their son George, who turns 8 today, is safe. But the  
photographs tracking him from womb to his last birthday could not 
be found in the debris of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	And so, they went to the church, hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
	Has anyone turned in any scrapbooks, they asked? Their eyes fell  
when Ms. Becker told them no. 
</P>
<P>
	``But come back,'' she said. ``I'm sure things will be rolling  
in all week long.''

<HEADLINE> Hail Delays Discovery Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery is headed  
back to the hangar instead of into orbit next week because of hail 
damage to its giant fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery had been scheduled to blast off May 20 with 1 1/2 tons of  
cargo for the new international space station. NASA is now 
targeting liftoff for no earlier than May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take the amount of time it takes to go fix the vehicle  
correctly,'' shuttle processing director Dave King said following 
Thursday's decision. ``We think that's a week to 10 days at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hail gouged about 150 holes into the foam insulation on  
Discovery's 15-story external fuel tank during a severe 
thunderstorm over the weekend. At least 35 of the nicks are in an 
area that cannot be reached from the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest visible hole on the tank is 2 inches wide and  
one-third of an inch deep. Most are much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers are worried that ice could form in the holes when the  
tank is filled with super-cold fuel in the final hours of the 
countdown. If chunks of ice broke off at liftoff, the shuttle could 
be damaged. The cockpit windows are especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we could not rule out the possibility of  
ice in those areas,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttles have been rolled off the pad and back into the Vehicle  
Assembly Building only 12 times before. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Discovery was sent back because of fuel-tank damage  
caused by a pair of woodpeckers that drilled about 200 holes in the 
rust-colored foam insulation, apparently in an attempt to roost and 
build nests. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique that was used to fix the woodpecker damage will  
probably be used again this time, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's 10-day ferry mission will be the year's first  
shuttle flight. The last was in December, when Endeavour carried up 
the first U.S.-built section of the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the longest gap in shuttle launches since flights resumed  
in 1988 following the 1986 Challenger disaster.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Fight Some Baby Bottles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer groups petitioned the government  
Wednesday to remove a chemical from certain plastic baby bottles 
that they say can leach into infants' food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration responded that parents  
shouldn't be alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Environmental Trust, in calling for safer bottles,  
cited studies that show bisphenol-A can leach out of plastic 
bottles when they're heated, particularly if the bottles are old or 
scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	A University of Missouri study suggests male babies of pregnant  
mice exposed to this chemical have slightly enlarged prostates and 
lowered sperm production. 
</P>
<P>
	The only baby bottles at issue are those made of hard, clear,  
shiny plastic called polycarbonate. They have been sold for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Other baby bottles, those that appear more opaque and softer --  
as well as the disposable formula bags that many parents slip into 
bottles -- are made of a different type of plastic that does not 
contain bisphenol-A. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents who are unsure what type of bottle they have can contact  
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Polycarbonate bottles don't appear to leach under everyday  
conditions, just when they're heated to high temperatures or for 
long periods, said the FDA's Dr. George Pauli, who noted that most 
infant formulas require only mild heating. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, they leach at levels considered too low for human harm,  
said Pauli, adding that other scientists who have repeated the 
Missouri animal study have not found evidence of harm. 
</P>
<P>
	So while the FDA will investigate Wednesday's petition,  
``there's no consensus in the scientific community at this stage 
that there's anything of significance here,'' Pauli said.

<HEADLINE> NRA Ordered to Pay $4.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The National Rifle Association has been  
ordered to pay $4.45 million to a former NRA board member and her 
husband who accused the organization of bullying and disparaging 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit by Sally and Kenneth Brodbeck of Des Moines, Iowa,  
was filed after an altercation with a security guard at the NRA's 
national convention in Philadelphia last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury awarded the couple damages for public  
disparagement and battery. Security guard Gordon Russell was 
ordered to pay $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA lawyers said they will appeal Thursday's verdict.  
</P>
<P>
	Brodbeck said he was sitting in a chair videotaping a speech by  
his wife, an NRA board member at the time, when Russell ordered him 
to stop taping and tackled him when he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA lawyers said Mrs. Brodbeck was part of a faction opposing  
the group now in power at the NRA. They said the incident was 
staged to disrupt the convention last June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton Heston, who was elected NRA president the day of the  
altercation, testified that Brodbeck had faked a ``lousy fall'' by 
tumbling out of his chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brodbecks alleged their reputations were tarnished and sued  
after the NRA refused to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel vindicated,'' Brodbeck said after the verdict. ``We  
just wanted our reputation back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, at the NRA's convention in Denver, Mrs.  
Brodbeck was defeated in her bid to keep her seat on the board.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- An officer testified that he saw a colleague  
brandishing a stick allegedly used to torture a black Haitian 
immigrant, but the defense today targeted an inconsistency in his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking the alleged ``blue wall of silence,'' detective Eric  
Turetzky testified Wednesday that Officer Justin Volpe walked 
through a Brooklyn police station waving the stick, which Abner 
Louima claims was rammed into his rectum and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Turetzky said Volpe ``was swinging the stick around like a sword  
and hitting it against the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe and three other officers are charged with taking turns  
beating Louima because they believed -- mistakenly -- that Louima had 
punched Volpe in a melee outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 
1997. A fifth officer is charged with covering up the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima earlier testified that a raging Volpe tortured him with  
the stick while another officer held him down on the bathroom floor 
of the station. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Turetzky testified that he saw only Volpe emerge  
from the bathroom with Louima. But during cross-examination today, 
Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, confronted the detective with 
the transcript of an interview by police department investigators 
in which he indicated he may have seen a second, unidentified 
officer as well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Turetzky said, ``I'm not sure who removed  
(Louima) from the bathroom, but I distinctly remember Officer Volpe 
standing there with a stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed on Louima's behalf alleges  
that rogue police were shielded by the ``blue wall of silence'' -- a 
supposed code among officers never to turn one another in. 
</P>
<P>
	Turetzky, 28, was made a detective for internal police  
department investigations after coming forward to report what he 
saw that night. Taking the witness stand Wednesday, the officer 
recounted helping arrest Louima as police dispersed a 
bottle-throwing crowd outside the nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	When Turetzky returned to the station, he said, he saw Officer  
Charles Schwarz searching a handcuffed Louima in front of a desk 
sergeant. He testified that Schwarz, 33, forced the prisoner onto 
his toes by raising up his arms, then pushed him toward the 
direction of the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Turetzky spotted Volpe, 27, emerging from the bathroom  
with Louima and carrying the stick. He noticed that Volpe's uniform 
was ``a little messed up'' -- no badge, no name tag, his shirttail 
out and gun belt off. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators never found the stick.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Monkeys To Get Paternity Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- There's some real monkey business going on at  
the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The chimpanzees keep getting pregnant, even though all the males  
thought capable of breeding have had vasectomies. 
</P>
<P>
	No one is quite sure why it's happening, but it's created the  
kind of excitement zoos lust for. 
</P>
<P>
	``The zoo has never had this much publicity about anything,''  
zookeeper Vicki Bingaman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three months, two chimps have given birth and a  
third is pregnant. DNA tests to determine the father -- or fathers -- 
cannot be done for months, until the babies are old enough to be 
separated from their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The real mystery is this: Three of the four adult males had  
vasectomies in 1996. And Toto, who is 45, has never shown sexual 
interest in anyone but himself. As for 2-year-old Ripley and 
4-year-old Glenn, they were considered too young to breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bingaman thinks the vasectomies may have failed. Vasectomies  
are known to have a 1 percent failure rate in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chimps are very resilient. It wouldn't surprise me if they  
found some way around'' their vasectomies, Ms. Bingaman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Sedgwick, the zoo's director of animal health sciences,  
thinks she's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vasectomies in chimps are the same as vasectomies in people,  
except that chimps are much more prodigiously endowed,'' Sedgwick 
said. In both humans and chimps, the tubes that carry semen are 
severed, and ``there's not much chance that would spontaneously 
reattach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sedgwick thinks Toto or perhaps the youngsters are the fathers.  
He said there have been rare cases of young chimps impregnating a 
female. 
</P>
<P>
	The chimps at the Los Angeles Zoo have sex every day, Sedgwick  
said. The zoo started trying to curb its chimp population about 
eight years ago because the enclosure was getting too crowded and 
chimps aren't an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	First, zookeepers distributed birth control pills. But the  
females passed them around. Babies ate them. So did males. Then Ms. 
Bingaman tried contraceptive implants. They weren't strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we vasectomized the males and we still had babies,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest, a four-pound girl, was born last week and brings the  
chimp population to 15. The zoo and a radio station are sponsoring 
a name-the-chimp contest, to start Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bingaman thinks the problem is finally under control. A new,  
more naturalistic enclosure gives zookeepers more room to walk 
around and make sure only the adult females are swallowing birth 
control pills. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Susan Taj, a parent volunteer, helped lead a group  
of second-graders on a field trip. She had heard about the chimp 
hanky-panky and called it unbelievable. Would she explain it to the 
children? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to second-graders, I don't think,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Radio Free Asia Fills in Gaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Chinese government had one piece of advice  
when a U.S. government-sponsored broadcast operation for Chinese 
listeners went on the air three years ago: ``Shut up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Free Asia, as the operation is called, ignored the advice  
and in the wake of the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Yugoslavia, feels it has more reason than ever to try to reach the 
Chinese people. 
</P>
<P>
	RFA's charter bars it from broadcasting propaganda. Instead, it  
seeks to fill in the gaps in coverage by the Chinese media, all 
state-controlled, in its reporting on China-related news. 
</P>
<P>
	Seldom have the perceived shortcomings of the Chinese media been  
as evident as they have since last week's bombing in Belgrade. 
China has ignored the U.S. contention that the bombing was a case 
of mistaken targeting and also neglected for four days to report 
President Clinton's apologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Richter, president of RFA, said that within hours of the  
bombing, the station reported the Pentagon's explanation of the 
bombing and, later on, Clinton's formal apology. 
</P>
<P>
	Richter said the station also sought to fill in a gap in China's  
coverage of the Kosovo crisis by reporting that the NATO bombing 
campaign was not responsible for the mass exodus from Kosovo but 
rather the ethnic cleansing policies of Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin says China's coverage  
of the Kosovo issue has been ``extremely unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News accounts have suggested that a large majority of the  
Chinese people seem to accept the Chinese government's account of 
both the Yugoslav war and the Belgrade embassy bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Richter, a veteran of both television and print journalism,  
said in an interview that sentiment is far from universal. One 
admittedly unscientific barometer of opinion is the RFA call-in 
show broadcast each weekday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first day, there were seven callers. Six called about the  
embassy bombing and only one criticized NATO,'' Richter said. ``The 
rest criticized the Chinese government.'' On a subsequent day, of 
the 11 callers to RFA, only three were critical of the United 
States. On yet another day, however, the majority of the callers 
were anti-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Richter acknowledged that Chinese who tune in to RFA are  
probably more favorably disposed toward the United States than 
those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ``great preponderance'' of RFA's broadcasting over the  
past week has been related to the embassy bombing, Richter said 
that in normal times the station tells the Chinese people what they 
don't get from their own media on issues such as unemployment, 
human rights and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	To the extent that the station is biased, it uses prominent  
Chinese exiled dissidents for broadcast commentaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	China sees RFA as an irritant, complaining that it interferes  
with China's sovereignty. For almost two years, it has tried, with 
mixed success, to jam the broadcasts. The station counters by 
changing frequencies or switching transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Radio Free Asia was established in the spring of 1996 to promote  
democracy in Asia's remaining authoritarian countries. Vietnam, 
China and North Korea are among the primary targets. The broadcasts 
in China are in the dominant Mandarin language. 
</P>
<P>
	But is anybody listening?  
</P>
<P>
	Richter took satisfaction from a poll taken in selected areas of  
China showing that RFA ranks third behind the Voice of America and 
the British Broadcasting Corp. It outranked stations operated by 
Taiwan, Japan, Russia and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Safety Work at N.C. Track May Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Officials at Lowe's Motor Speedway believe  
fans watching NASCAR races will be safe despite an accident that 
killed three spectators during an IRL event earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been considering changes since the accident that  
sent debris into the stands on May 1. But track president H.A. 
``Humpy'' Wheeler said no changes will be made in time for this 
month's NASCAR races. 
</P>
<P>
	No NASCAR spectator has been killed in 40 years at the track, he  
said. A final decision on any changes will be made Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indy Racing League cars have open-wheel bodies and are more  
likely to spray debris into the stands during a crash than the 
slower, closed-wheel stock cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The track's parent company, however, is considering raising the  
protective fence at its track in Texas, site of the next IRL event 
at a track it owns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a good feeling about our safety'' for NASCAR races,  
Wheeler said Wednesday. ``We don't want to overreact on anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he doesn't want to do anything that would interfere  
with fans' view of the action during the speedway's biggest week of 
events, capped by the Coca-Cola 600 on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll raise Cain if they can't see,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc., however, is looking at adding as much  
as 4 1/2 feet to the catch fences at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort 
Worth. Fences there are nearly identical to those at Lowe's. 
</P>
<P>
	The work in Texas, which would be done before the Longhorn 500  
on June 12, would make that speedway's fence as high above the 
track as the one at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and among the 
highest of any U.S. speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the lead investigator in the May 1 crash moved the  
inquiry to Indianapolis, where IRL drivers are preparing for the 
Indianapolis 500, also to be contested May 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials confirmed Wednesday that the right rear wheel from  
Stan Wattles' car ended up in the stands. His car crashed into the 
fourth-turn wall, spewing debris as it scraped along. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hope to release a preliminary report on the crash  
investigation Friday.

<HEADLINE> Gap Earnings Up More Than 50 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gap Inc.'s first-quarter earnings climbed  
by more than 50 percent from a year ago, fueled by strong results 
at its Old Navy stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco-based retailer earned $202 million, or 34  
cents a share, in the quarter ended May 1, compared with $136 
million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $2.28 billion, up from $1.72 billion a year ago.  
Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry gauge of 
performance, rose 11 percent, slowing from the previous year's 17 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap's results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates, but its  
stock was off 43 3/4 cents at $61.81 1/4 in early trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap's president and CEO, Millard Dexter, praised his company's  
commitment to growth, ``even against challenging comparisons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fueling the better-than-expected results were strong sales at  
its Old Navy division, which continues to draw shoppers with its 
trendy, yet affordable clothes -- including this spring's must-have 
item -- drawstring pants. 
</P>
<P>
	The company operated 19.5 million square feet of retail space at  
the end of the quarter, up 22 percent from the 16 million square 
feet at the end the quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gap Inc. operated 2,529 stores at the end of the quarter, up  
from the 2,196 at the end of the same period last year. The 1999 
figure included 1,138 Gap, 676 GapKids, 295 Banana Republic, and 
420 Old Navy stores.

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Drug, Infections Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is calling  
for further study of a new rheumatoid arthritis treatment to 
determine whether it increases the risk of infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said Wednesday that 30 of an estimated 25,000 Enbrel  
users have developed serious infections -- including sepsis -- since 
the drug was approved last winter. Six people have died, but it is 
not known exactly what caused the infections and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Carefully controlled studies of Enbrel taken by rheumatoid  
arthritis patients prior to approval had not shown an increased 
infection risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But the drug works by targeting an immune system protein that  
causes painful arthritis inflammation, so scientists had always 
wondered whether inhibiting that protein would suppress the immune 
system enough to render some people vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA told doctors on Wednesday not to give Enbrel to anyone  
who has an active or chronic infection, and to be cautious when 
considering the drug for people with a history of recurring 
infections or other diseases like diabetes that may increase 
infection risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the drug's warnings had only prohibited giving Enbrel  
to people with sepsis, a dangerous bloodstream infection. And 
patients were urged to quit taking it if they became infected. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturer Immunex Corp. wrote thousands of doctors Monday  
informing them that the FDA warning was coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty infections isn't an alarming number in itself. But  
officials became worried about a pattern, explained FDA immunology 
chief Dr. William Schwieterman. The sick patients often appeared 
predisposed to infections; the new infections developed within a 
week or two of starting Enbrel; and some of the fatalities occurred 
after antibiotic treatment failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA stressed that no one knows whether Enbrel actually  
causes any problem, but urged doctors to consider the cases as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the agency asked Immunex to conduct a special, large study  
to settle the issue. The company and government are discussing how 
to do that.

<HEADLINE> Refund Allegedly Used For Hit Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTOONA, Pa. (AP) -- A woman devised a deadly way to spend her  
income tax refund, police say: She paid a hit man to kill her 
husband's lover. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn Burke was enraged when her husband of 14 years left her  
and their two children in January to live with a woman in 
Massachusetts he had met over the Internet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	She waited three months for the family's income tax refund to  
arrive, then paid $2,000 to a friend's 17-year-old stepson to have 
the woman killed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Burke was serious about having her husband's girlfriend  
killed,'' police Detective Anthony Sassano said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager, however, had other plans. Christopher Chaplin  
allegedly spent the money on parties and motel rooms but didn't 
carry out his end of the deal. When he told Mrs. Burke the money 
was gone, she was so upset that she called a mental health hot line 
and confessed the plot, Sassano said. The counselor told police. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burke and the teen's mother, Susan Chaplin, both 31, were  
arraigned Tuesday for criminal solicitation to commit homicide and 
two counts of criminal conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Chaplin had offered to find a hit man for Mrs. Burke and  
persuaded her stepson to take the job, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Chaplin will be charged in juvenile court with  
theft, theft by deception and criminal conspiracy, Sassano said.

<HEADLINE> Man Nabbed For Alleged Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- A man with an array of weapons and bomb  
materials in his car has been arrested for allegedly planning to 
torch the Islamic Center and ``kill Iraqis,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Modig, 39, was arrested early Wednesday following a car  
chase and a fight with police officers in his apartment. In his 
car, authorities said, were 30 gallons of gasoline and other bomb 
components, as well as four guns, two 22-inch machetes and 850 
rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Modig said he was ``an enemy against the Islamic Nation, and I  
was going to take care of business,'' Sgt. Terry Reibling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was there to torch it (the center) ... and to kill  
Iraqis,'' added Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Modig was being held for investigation of possession of  
explosive devices, three counts of attempted vehicular assault, 
eluding, carrying concealed weapons and ethnic intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is scary,'' said Talibbudin Syed, president of the Colorado  
Muslim Society, which owns the mosque. ``A major, major thing was 
prevented because of the efforts of the officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to live as good citizens and friends of everybody. We  
don't do any harm or mean any harm to anybody,'' Syed said. ``All 
we can say is we appreciate the excellent work done by officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modig claimed some connection with the anti-government Common  
Law Court and a militia, but investigators said they do not believe 
anyone else was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Reibling said he spotted Modig's car in front of the mosque, but  
the driver fled as he approached. Police said Modig tried to ram 
police cars during the chase. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of behavior is alarming and intolerable,'' said the  
Rev. Lucia Guzman, director of the Colorado Council of Churches. 
``There seem to be more and more of these incidents that portray 
hate and divisiveness. They are a sign that the various religious 
communities need to do more to combat hate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver has not been a hotbed of racist incidents, though a few  
crimes have drawn national attention. In 1984, Jewish radio talk 
show host Alan Berg was shot to death and two men belonging to a 
neo-Nazi gang were convicted of his murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1997, the city was rocked by a series of hate crimes,  
including the slaying of a West African man at a downtown bus stop 
by an admitted white supremacist.

<HEADLINE> A Look at 21st Century Agriculture / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- When the history of 21st century farming  
is written, one of the milestones noted might be the day the farmer 
himself joined his mule in the march to obsolescence, replaced by a 
robot. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe not.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know whether we'll have robots out there on our  
tractors or not. That's maybe far-fetched,'' Eldon Cole of the 
University of Missouri said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' the livestock specialist continued, ``I think anything  
that can take the labor out of agricultural production, that's what 
we'll be looking at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, he and other experts say to expect more breakthroughs in  
high-tech fields involving satellites and computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellites already can tell farmers exactly how much manure or  
pesticide to use on a field to obtain the best results. And in the 
future, they will probably do a better job of forecasting the 
weather as well, said Dan Cassidy of the Missouri Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area where breakthroughs are expected is in genetics.  
</P>
<P>
	``Research will lead the way with specialized varieties of  
crops,'' Cole said. ``Crops that can withstand different types of 
environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They'll also be able to resist diseases and pests, Cassidy said,  
and thrive on fewer nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy also sees genetics playing a big role in livestock  
production, although Cole is more cautious in trying to guess what 
will happen there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a good bit of debate, and I sure don't know where  
this is headed, but we have the cloning thing in livestock,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While he added that he does expect cloning to be used to at  
least some degree, he suspects it will be done ``with some self 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without it, farmers are already breeding leaner, meatier  
animals, and Cassidy said he expects that to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this, the experts say, should result in a 21st century  
farm that produces more food than its 20th century counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1930, one American farmer was producing enough food to feed  
9.8 people, a figure that had risen to 128 people by 1988. Expect 
that to rise even more in the years ahead, Cole and Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in agriculture feel that in the 21st century we do have  
the potential to keep on producing more food,'' Cole said. ``But we 
want to quickly add that we also want to get paid for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' he continued, ``agriculture is kind of in the  
pits, as far as farmers getting adequate returns for their food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be corrected, he said, if more foreign markets for  
American food open up in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, there are hungry people in this world who need our  
food,'' he said. ``Sometimes we can give it to them, but by and 
large it has to be a financial reward for the person producing 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which brings up one of the biggest questions on the minds of  
those in Missouri agriculture, and that is just who that producer 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
	The last years of the 20th century saw the rise of huge  
corporate hog and poultry farms in Missouri, a trend Cole said has 
many small cattle and dairy farmers worried that they might 
eventually be squeezed out of business by big operators producing 
more food at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
	``One concern that the farmers I run into all seem to have ...  
is who will be a farmer,'' Cole said. ``Agriculture does have a 
very bright future. The question is who is going to control 
agriculture.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Halts Energizer Battery Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHEL, Conn. (AP) -- A judge has ordered Ralston Purina Co. to  
stop running ads based on a national magazine test that claimed 
Energizer alkaline batteries outperform other brands, including 
Gillette Co.'s Duracell Ultra batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in U.S. District Court in New York issued a temporary  
injunction Thursday, after finding that tests published in Popular 
Electronics magazine were not reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bethel-based Duracell division announced Monday that it  
filed a lawsuit against St. Louis-based Ralston Purina, charging a 
campaign for Energizer batteries falsely denigrates the performance 
of Duracell batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also claims that the campaign misleads consumers  
about the comparative performance of alkaline battery brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette is seeking a permanent injunction and monetary damages.  
</P>
<P>
	The Energizer campaign, which first aired on network and cable  
television on April 24, features the Energizer Bunny torching, 
crushing and pummeling competitors' batteries. The batteries are 
identifiable as Duracell, Rayovac and Panasonic brands. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed because we believe our ads are truthful and  
accurate,'' said Energizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. 
Patrick Mulcahy. ``We will continue to find ways to communicate the 
attributes of Energizer Advanced Formula batteries to consumers.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Verdict Still Largest Ever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- A judge on Thursday slashed a $79.5  
million jury verdict against Philip Morris to $32 million, but it 
is still the largest judgment ever against a tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Anna J. Brown said her decision was not a criticism of the  
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Supreme Court said there are limits,'' she said. ``By  
no means is my personal point of view substituted for that of the 
jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The award was granted March 30 to the family of Jesse Williams,  
a former school janitor who died of lung cancer in 1997 at age 67. 
He had smoked Marlboro cigarettes for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors said they were infuriated by documents showing that  
Philip Morris executives had lied for decades about the link 
between smoking and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Williams' family $79.5 million in punitive  
damages and $821,485 in compensatory damages for medical costs and 
pain and suffering. The judge did not cut the compensatory damages 
but sliced the punitive award after reviewing decisions in other 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both the family and the cigarette company declined  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
four other times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal. A judge cut the $51.5 million award in California in half, 
and that case is also being appealed.

<HEADLINE> Japan Recession May Not Be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Despite two years of a shrinking economy, the worst  
of Japan's recession may not be over, an International Monetary 
Fund official warned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy director for research Flemming Larsen said Japan must  
continue with massive stimulus spending until its economy recovers, 
which could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to maintain adequate stimulus for several  
years until the recovery becomes sustainable,'' Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Larsen cautioned that over reliance on government  
spending may also be a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Japan needs to strike a ``delicate balance between  
adequate stimulus but not too much stimulus as to crowd out the 
private sector,'' Larsen told reporters in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF recently cut its forecast for Japan's gross domestic  
product, predicting it would shrink 1.4 percent this year. It had 
previously forecast a contraction of 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Suspect May Have Killed More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOCORRO, N.M. (AP) -- A man already accused of kidnapping and  
sexually torturing three women admitted he killed as many as 14 
other people and disposed of the bodies, his girlfriend told 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	David Parker Ray, 59, and his girlfriend, Cynthia Lea Hendy, 39,  
were arrested March 22 after an Albuquerque woman said she escaped 
and ran away from Ray's mobile home, naked except for a padlocked 
collar. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendy told police after her arrest that Ray disposed of bodies --  
both men and women -- in ravines and in Elephant Butte Lake in 
south-central New Mexico, according to information released 
Wednesday by prosecutor Jim Yontz. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the arrests, authorities have followed leads in 10 states,  
using ground-penetrating radar and dogs trained to locate human 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents have combed gullies in Sierra County and searched the  
lake for bodies and other evidence. No bodies have been found. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, two women testified that they were abducted,  
sodomized, shocked with electricity, sexually tortured and kept 
captive in padlocked collars in separate incidents in February and 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray faces 25 charges involving the two women. He waived a  
preliminary hearing on 12 additional charges related to a third 
woman who says she was kidnapped by Ray and his daughter in July 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ray and his daughter, Glenda Ray, 32, have said they are  
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's attorney, Jeff Rein, said Hendy made the allegations after  
she had worked out a deal with prosecutors to reduce both the 
number of charges she faced and her potential prison sentence -- 
from 198 years to as few as 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told them what they wanted to hear,'' Rein said. ``I think  
if they would have found any bodies after 45 days, we would have 
seen some charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hendy, initially charged with 25 counts, plans to plead  
guilty to five counts, including accessory and conspiracy charges, 
her lawyer has said. The agreement still needs a judge's approval.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Retreats on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans retreated under pressure  
Thursday on the politically volatile issue of gun control, calling 
for fresh restrictions on sales at gun shows less than 24 hours 
after rejecting them. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, joined by the White House, swiftly denounced the  
offer, saying it contained numerous loopholes that would leave guns 
too readily accessible to criminals and others who shouldn't 
possess them. ``It's the most Swiss-cheesy bill I've ever seen,'' 
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the development underscored the change in the gun control  
debate in the wake of last month's shootings at a Colorado high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	And gun control advocates claimed one long-sought victory during  
the day, when the Senate agreed to prohibit the importation of 
high-capacity ammunition clips that were omitted from a 1994 
assault weapons ban. An effort to kill the measure was rejected, 
59-39, with almost all votes in opposition cast by Republicans. 
``The NRA said no and it passed anyway,'' said Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also agreed to a proposal by Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., to ban juvenile possession of semi-automatic weapons and 
high-capacity ammunition clips. That vote was 96-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came as some Republicans expressed concern about  
the outcome of a series of votes Wednesday relating to so-called 
private sales at gun shows. ``There was a realization that there 
was a loophole that had to be closed,'' said Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, President Clinton charged that a ``a narrow  
majority of the Senate (had) voted to preserve the dangerous gun 
show loophole'' less than a month after the shooting spree at the 
Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Those votes established a voluntary system of background checks  
for so-called private sales at gun shows, rather than the mandatory 
checks required of licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the revised GOP proposal, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said  
all sales at gun shows would be subjected to the instant background 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	After several hours of reviewing the draft amendment,  
administration officials said Thursday night he was wrong, and that 
some sales would continue to be exempt. These officials spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig, a member of the National Rifle Association board of  
directors, said the organization had ``grudgingly'' agreed to the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig described the changes as a ``clarification'' and an  
attempt to build on ``the accomplishments we had made'' on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats offered a different description.  
</P>
<P>
	``He got caught weakening the gun laws. A lot of people here got  
sucked in and got upset,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., 
referring to Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said of the GOP: ``It's clear  
that they're scared to death to stand up to the gun lobby because 
what they're proposing doesn't address the need to require 
background checks at gun shows while it adds additional 
loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, for example, said a sale would be automatically  
approved if the background check was not completed in 24 hours, 
rather than the three days in current law. They also said the 
proposal would continue to allow an individual to pawn a gun and 
reclaim it without undergoing a background check. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans including Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon and McCain -- a  
contender for the GOP presidential nomination -- said they had been 
unhappy with the outcome of Wednesday's votes, even though they had 
supported Craig's position at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, in particular, underscored the shifting political  
dynamic on gun control after last month's fatal shootings at 
Columbine High School in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
private polling in recent weeks has shown very strong support for 
gun control, even among potential voters in Republican presidential 
primaries. That is a marked shift from the past, when base 
Republican voters were less supportive of gun control than the 
nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and other Democrats made it clear they intend to use the  
issue in the elections in 2000. Republicans countered that gun 
control policy had hurt Democrats in 1994, when it last was a key 
issue. But at the same time, GOP lawmakers worked to revise their 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the Senate continued deliberations on  
legislation to stiffen prosecution of juvenile offenders. 
Provisions of the measure would provide additional funding for 
prosecutors, make it easier to try suspects as young as 14 as 
adults and impose tougher penalties on those convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Colorado shootings, in which 12 students and one teacher  
were fired on by two heavily armed students who later killed 
themselves, made the legislation a focus for debate over gun 
control and efforts to address violence in modern-day culture. 
</P>
<P>
	In other votes during the day, the Senate rejected a proposal by  
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., to forbid the broadcast of violent 
programming during periods when children are likely to form a 
substantial portion of the viewing audience. The proposal failed, 
60-39, as critics expressed concern that it would violate the First 
Amendment's guarantee of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also ordered software providers to make computer  
programs that screen out violent or offensive Web sites more 
cheaply available to parents.

<HEADLINE> Stocks in Record Area; Dow Up 113.98 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved into record high territory today as  
IBM soared and new government economic data assuaged investors' 
fears of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 113.98 at 11,114.35, topping its previous closing record last 
Friday of 11,031.59. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were higher as well, with the Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 index up 10.63 at 1,374.63 and topping Wednesday's 
record closing high of 1,364.00. The Nasdaq composite index was up 
21.93 at 2,628.47. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM led the Dow higher after chairman Louis Gerstner told  
analysts late Wednesday the Internet would play a large part in Big 
Blue's future, and that a quarter of the company's 1998 revenues 
came from electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bull beat goes on, led by Big Blue,'' said Alfred E.  
Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. IBM shares soared 16 1/16 to a record 241 9/16, accounting 
for more than 73 1/2 points on the Dow, and boosting the shares of 
other personal computer makers. Hewlett-Packard was up 4 5/8 at 87 7/8 on 
the New York Stock Exchange, and Dell was up 3/8 at 44 1/8 in Nasdaq 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks bowed to profit-taking after a strong morning.  
America Online slid 1 15/16 to 135 1/2 and was the most active issue 
on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow transportation average was down 39.15, or 1.03 percent,  
at 3,744.35, as shares of trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport 
Services dropped 3 17/32 to 19 3/8 in Nasdaq trading. Hunt said 
competition had cut into its shipping traffic and that April 
revenues, which did not meet expectations, will hurt second-quarter 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks got a boost from a Labor Department report that wholesale  
prices rose 0.5 percent in April as the price of gasoline jumped 
significantly. But the core rate of the producer price index, which 
strips away volatile food and energy costs, was up a mere 0.1 
percent. Both numbers were in line with economists' expectations 
and showed that inflation remains tame. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said first-time claims for  
unemployment benefits held steady at a moderate 303,000 last week. 
A more reliable four-week moving average of jobless claims dropped 
by 4,000 to 304,250, suggesting that unemployment will remain at 
4.3 percent this month, near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report, the Commerce Department said retail sales  
rose 0.1 percent in April, as consumers reacted to higher energy 
costs by pulling in their purse strings. That was a smaller 
increase than many analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are now turning their attention to Friday's expected  
release of consumer price data. Taken together, the producer- and 
consumer-price data could give them clues about the Federal 
Reserve's policy meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates next  
week in a bid to slow the economy and head off inflation, said 
Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``Most 
people think (central bankers) are more inclined to raise rates in 
August, after they get more indication of recovering global 
economies,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 538.69 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE>  Relief Efforts Hampered in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- A lack of coordination among NATO, aid  
groups and the Albanian government has bedeviled efforts to move 
100,000 Kosovo refugees out of this dusty, overcrowded border 
region, a U.N. official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. relief agency launched a tent-to-tent information  
campaign this week to convince refugees to leave the camps in the 
northern town of Kukes for safer, less congested regions further 
south. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the refugees want to stay close to the border,  
clinging to the hope that NATO troops will soon be inside Kosovo to 
guarantee their safety from the Yugoslav security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information campaign has met with underwhelmingly modest  
success,'' said Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the United Nations 
High Commissioner of Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	A successful day is when refugees departing Kukes outnumber  
those arriving across the nearby frontier with Kosovo. The 
scorecard Wednesday: 5,475 left, 3,900 arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	In theory, UNHCR is the overall coordinator for the refugee  
efforts. But in reality, the numerous aid groups, the militaries 
from NATO countries and the Albanian government often seem to be 
operating independently, with no one in charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a lot of coordinated information,'' Wilkinson  
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO trucks have been bringing food to Kukes, but at times the  
aid groups aren't aware of the deliveries in advance. The trucks 
may sit overnight before the aid groups learn of the deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Multiply that by 200 examples and you have a much less  
efficient operation than you would like,'' said Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
	While welcoming aid from all quarters, the independent  
arrangements have resulted in widely varying standards at the 
camps. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp established by the army of the United Arab Emirates has  
facilities that are nearly on a par with a military operation and 
it is widely regarded as the best-run camp in Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	But newly arrived refugees can spend days milling around the  
streets of Kukes and sleeping in the wagons hitched to their 
tractors before they can find decent shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a lot more clear information for the  
refugees,'' said Samantha Bolton, spokeswoman for the aid group 
Doctors Without Borders. ``The refugees don't really know where 
they are going if they leave Kukes, and that's one reason that they 
are reluctant to move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, aid workers say the operation has been able to meet the  
basic needs of the refugees. More than 780,000 ethnic Albanians 
have fled Kosovo in the past seven weeks, with more than 400,000 
coming to Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100,000 refugees in Kukes represent by far the largest  
concentration in any one area.

tractors before they can find decent shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a lot more clear information for the  
refugees,'' said Samantha Bolton, spokeswoman for the aid group 
Doctors Without Borders. ``The refugees don't really know where 
they are going if they leave Kukes, and that's one reason that they 
are reluctant to move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, aid workers say the operation has been able to meet the  
basic needs of the refugees. More than 780,000 ethnic Albanians 
have fled Kosovo in the past seven weeks, with more than 400,000 
coming to Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100,000 refugees in Kukes represent by far the largest  
concentration in any one area.

<HEADLINE> SEC Targets Online Investment Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has  
been called ``The Eagle on the Street'' for its supervision of Wall 
Street. These days, though, as it fights growing investment fraud 
on the Internet, the agency has sometimes appeared more like a 
tiger missing a few teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bid to bolster its ability to fight online fraud, the SEC  
has turned to Congress for help, asking for an increase in its 
budget and greater leeway in the kind of enforcement actions it can 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	In a fairly unusual development, two Republican senators are  
very willing to assist. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it gets the help the lawmakers are offering, however,  
the SEC's crime-fighting powers will continue to be hampered in 
several ways, including the fact that it can only file civil 
lawsuits against suspected violators. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Justice Department, it cannot put anyone in jail, and  
unlike state securities regulators, SEC fraud-fighters don't have 
the legal authority to go undercover online, although they can and 
do conduct Internet surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other limits: The SEC can bar brokers who have  
violated the law from the brokerage industry, but not from other 
financial activities such as promoting stocks. And while it has 
aggressively gone after people and companies engaging in Internet 
fraud with civil fines and court orders compelling them to refrain 
from such activity, it doesn't have authority to shut down Web 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, enforcement attorneys and auditors have been  
leaving the agency at a worrisome pace for lucrative jobs in 
private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this background, the SEC and state regulators are  
battling a new form of fraud that is proliferating in Internet junk 
mail, online newsletters, electronic ``chat rooms'' and World Wide 
Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters  
anywhere in the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure 
investors across the country, who have lost millions in such 
schemes in recent years. No longer do promoters have to give 
customers the hard sell over the telephone in unsolicited calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the new possibilities for deceiving investors offered by  
the Internet, securities regulators still operate under the old 
rule book. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain breed of bottom-feeders who are simply not  
deterred by the prospect of civil injunctions or even stiff 
monetary penalties,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said 
recently. ``There is no other ... deterrence for them than the 
threat of a life behind bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To create that deterrent, the SEC has been working closely with  
criminal prosecutors from the Justice Department and the offices of 
state attorneys general and local district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The market watchdog agency has nearly doubled the size of its  
``Cyberforce'' team, which prowls the Internet on the lookout for 
fraud, to 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of a Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee, recently proposed increasing the SEC's budget, now at 
$337.4 million, by $5.5 million next year to fight Internet fraud. 
That would bring the agency's funding to the level requested by the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond manpower and money, the SEC is also looking to expand its  
enforcement reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and other officials laid out the scope of Internet  
investment fraud at recent hearings by a Senate investigative 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker acknowledged that with 850 attorneys and other  
enforcement employees nationwide to pursue all types of financial 
fraud, including the online variety, ``We are certainly challenged, 
if not strained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the hearings, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the  
subcommittee's chairwoman, proposed legislation that would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Give the SEC legal authority to ban brokers who violate the law  
not just from the brokerage industry but also from promoting 
stocks. A significant amount of Internet fraud has come from 
promoters touting high-risk, small-company stocks without 
disclosing that they were paid to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow the SEC to bring ``follow-up'' cases based on enforcement  
actions by state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are ``tools that would be very valuable for the  
SEC to have,'' said Bradley Skolnik, Indiana's securities 
commissioner and president-elect of the North American Securities 
Administrators Association. ``They are long overdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its third nationwide ``sweep'' against Internet fraud, the  
SEC on Wednesday announced it had charged 18 people and eight 
companies with using the Web to sell bogus securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investment fraud also can take the form of stock-price  
manipulation schemes, deceptive stock touting, investment pyramid 
schemes, insider trading and unlicensed brokering or advising on 
investments.

<HEADLINE> Ga, Ark. Rivals in Poultry Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- Visitors are often puzzled at first.  
Then they begin cackling at the notion -- a park dedicated to 
chickens. 
</P>
<P>
	Many take the short stroll from a local motel to the green space  
featuring a monument topped by a bronze rooster. They can read 
about the history of poultry and about the park, established in 
1977 by industry and city officials and believed to be the only one 
of its kind in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Folks can pause on benches to ponder poultry or watch traffic go  
by on Jesse Jewell Parkway, named for a Depression-era farmer who 
was a Georgia poultry industry pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	And, for good measure, the park and several city signs declare  
Gainesville ``the poultry capital of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gainesville has really built up around the poultry business,''  
said Doug Carnes, vice president for poultry operations at Mar-Jac 
Poultry Inc., which grows, processes and sells chickens by the 
hundreds of thousands each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides jobs on the farms and in the processing plants, the  
industry is tied to numerous related equipment, food-service, 
transportation and other companies in the state in which poultry is 
the No. 1 revenue-producing agricultural product. 
</P>
<P>
	However, amid all the poultry pride, farmers and officials here  
often hop over one fact -- that Arkansas has also claimed to rule 
the industry roost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We readily admit that for many, many years, we were No. 1. We  
have to also admit that for a small time, we settled back into 
second,'' said Tommy Irvin, Georgia's agriculture commissioner for 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, our expertise has gotten us back to No. 1, solidly, and  
we will remain there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a back-and-forth situation; pretty much a  
good-natured bantering that goes on,'' explained Randall Smallwood, 
publisher of the Poultry &AMP; Eggs News in Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas industry officials downplay the competition.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not running a race with them,'' said Randy Wyatt,  
executive vice president of the Arkansas Poultry Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	He explained that a more important concern for industry farmers  
and officials both there and in Georgia is working together on 
environmental issues, safety and disease control. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an industry, the companies all seem to lay aside their  
competitive differences and focus on the issues that affect us 
all,'' Wyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the chicken-or-the-egg, the question of which state's  
poultry industry ranks first has been a matter of long debate. 
There are various measures of the industry; statistics include 
eggs, laying hens and turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
	The major segment, though, is broilers -- the young chickens  
ticketed for quick trips to dinner tables or fast-food bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Messer, deputy state agricultural statistician for  
Georgia, said for broilers, Georgia led the nation from the 1940s 
through the 1960s, with Arkansas taking the lead in the '70s and 
holding it until recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Complicating the rankings is the fact that even the broiler  
segment is cut up -- by number, by weight, and by dollar value. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show Arkansas led in all  
three categories in 1994; in 1995, Georgia led in pounds and value; 
in '96, Arkansas led in number and pounds produced. But in 1997, 
Georgia took the lead in all three broiler categories. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest federal figures showed Georgia retained its  
leadership in all three broiler categories, producing 1.2 billion 
birds in the 16th consecutive year of growth, with total weight of 
5.9 billion pounds and value of $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia poultry officials were elated on April 29, when 1998  
figures showed the state No. 1 in all three categories again. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas, however, has other things going for it, said Wyatt,  
who called attention to Arkansas being the home base of chicken 
giant Tyson Foods and of the world-class agricultural research 
carried out at the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anyone in Arkansas that calls themselves that  
(the poultry capital of the world),'' Wyatt said, then paused. 
``That's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Arkansas response is to simply talk turkey. Georgia  
produced only 175,000 turkeys statewide in 1997 while Arkansas 
production is nearly 30 million birds a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Jones, a poultry official in the University of Arkansas  
cooperative extension service, noted recently that while Arkansas 
ranks third nationally in turkeys (behind North Carolina and 
Minnesota), ``Georgia is not even on the map.''

<HEADLINE> Zimmer Calls Yankees Team Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Zimmer has two rules as a manager: Don't be  
late and run hard on every play. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently there now is a third: Don't call players-only  
meetings. Because after breaking up one of those Wednesday night, 
the New York Yankees interim manager called a meeting of his own 
before Thursday's game against the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to have a meeting, they can rent a ballroom when  
we get to Boston,'' Zimmer said. ``I don't believe in team meetings 
without coaches or managers unless its about playoff shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I think it's time to have a meeting, I'll have one.  
Today, it's time. It's not anything big. I just want to get their 
attention. It won't take more than three or four minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players didn't appear fazed about Zimmer breaking up their  
meeting and calling one of his own a day later. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the same meeting. He just wanted to postpone it,''  
Shane Spencer said. ``The message was to get back to basics and 
have fun. Show up on time and play hard. That was pretty much it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What has bothered Zimmer most is a failure by a few players to  
run out grounders consistently. Two weeks ago he heard a television 
analyst praise the Yankees for always hustling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, maybe because of frustration caused by hitting slumps,  
some players have slacked off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once in a while I'll overlook it. But after three or four  
times, that's the end of overlooking,'' Zimmer said. ``It's a hell 
of a thing to be talking about, because that's what players are 
supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But according to Zimmer they haven't. After losing their second  
straight game to the Angels on Wednesday, the Yankees slipped to 
7-7 in their last 14 games. In last year's record-setting season, 
the Yankees didn't have that kind of slump until mid-August when 
they were 18 1/2 games in front. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer reiterated that it is unfair to expect this year's team  
to keep up the pace of the 1998 bunch, but he has noticed some 
disturbing signs the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way we could win 126 games this season. We want to  
win the Eastern Division and I don't care if it is by one game, 18 
games or 19 games,'' Zimmer said. ``We have to start playing 
better. This is a better team than the way we have been playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees players, reportedly led by Joe Girardi, called a meeting  
after Wednesday night's 1-0 loss to the Angels. Zimmer, already in 
the middle of his postgame news conference, got wind of it, kicked 
out reporters and addressed the team quickly before breaking up the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimmer chose not to address the team in more depth Wednesday  
because he learned early on in his managing career it is sometimes 
better to deliver a message not in the heat of battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in San Diego, I'd come in after a game, close the  
clubhouse and rant and rave,'' he said. ``Now I'd rather calm down, 
come back the next day and say what I want to say to the team.''

<HEADLINE> Torture Suspect Accused Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELEPHANT BUTTE, N.M. (AP) -- The daughter of a man accused of  
sexually torturing three women told police 13 years ago that her 
father abducted, tortured and sold women in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI Agent Doug Beldon said Thursday that investigators could not  
substantiate the allegations of Glenda Jean Ray, now 32. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allegations were nonspecific,'' Beldon said. ``No victims  
were identified, and none came forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ray is a co-defendant with her father, David Parker Ray, 59,  
in a sex-torture case that was opened in March when a naked woman 
fled Mr. Ray's mobile home wearing only a metal collar with a 
padlocked chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other alleged victims have since been located, and the three  
are the basis of 37 charges against Ray. Ms. Ray is charged with 12 
counts involving kidnapping and sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	A third suspect, Cynthia Lee Hendy, 39, initially was charged  
with 25 counts related to the case. Ms. Hendy, Ray's girlfriend, 
will plead guilty to five counts, including accessory and 
conspiracy charges, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents released Wednesday, Ms. Hendy told investigators  
that Ray had admitted involvement in as many as 14 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	No bodies have been found. Ray denies the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Golf Great Gene Sarazen Dies at 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen, one of only four men to win  
all four of golf's major professional championships, died today at 
age 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen died at Naples Community Hospital shortly after 9 a.m.  
from complications of pneumonia, said his lawyer, John Cardillo. 
Sarazen had been hospitalized for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	A perennial highlight of the Masters was Sarazen, Byron Nelson  
and Sam Snead hitting the ceremonial first ball to start the 
tournament. Sarazen remained part of the special moment through 
this year's Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen was just another promising young golfer when he won the  
1922 U.S. Open at the age of 20, shooting a final-round 68 to 
defeat Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won the PGA Championship that year and in 1923, won his  
second consecutive PGA by defeating Hagen in the finals, giving 
Sarazen three major championship before he was 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, Ben 
Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player won all four majors at least 
once in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	His best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with a  
then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. Jones called Sarazen's late charge, ``the finest 
competitive round ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet it was a shot that he made in 1935 in a then-obscure event  
that was to become known as the Masters that earned Sarazen his 
greatest acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes with just four holes  
remaining, Sarazen holed a 235-yard 4-wood shot on the 15th hole 
for a double-eagle 2 -- the rarest shot in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen then went on to tie Wood in regulation and won in a  
playoff. The shot also helped put Augusta National Golf Club on the 
map in only the second Masters played. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about, but  
I take my greatest pride in having won the U.S. and British Opens 
in the same year, 1932,'' Sarazen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, `That's the man who got  
the double eagle,''' Sarazen said. ``Actually, it was just a piece 
of luck. They forget the championships I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open at the Prince's course in  
England was made possible in part by a new club he invented -- the 
sand wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invented it in 1931 and I showed it at the British Open in  
1932,'' Sarazen said in a 1997 interview with The Associated Press. 
``I had it hidden because I was afraid they were going to ban it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the 1954 PGA Seniors title and in 1973, at age 71,  
made a hole-in-one during the first round of the British Open on 
the famous Postage Stamp hole at Royal Troon. Fittingly, it was his 
last tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``The Squire'' for his elegant style and fashionable  
knickers, Sarazen spanned the sport from Harry Vardon, who 
developed the most common grip used in golf, to Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only man alive who can say he played with all the  
greats, from James Braid, Vardon, Hagen and Jones down to 
Nicklaus,'' Sarazen told the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest player of all time was Nicklaus,'' he said,  
``then Jones, Harry Vardon and Ben Hogan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked where he fit in among golf's greats, he said: ``Sarazen  
just came in accidentally from the caddie ranks. When (Francis) 
Ouimet, an ex-caddie won the Open (in 1913) I said if he can win it 
I can win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed at least five majors because I made stupid shots --  
mental errors,'' Sarazen said. ``Bob Jones was college-educated. 
When he stood over a ball you could almost see the sparks going on 
inside his brain. He made very few judgment mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, born Feb. 27, 1902, in Mamaroneck, N.Y., near New York  
City, was one of the game's most outspoken players. 
</P>
<P>
	He often said that golf courses were too big and that too much  
emphasis was placed on power. He also criticized some players, such 
as Hogan and Nicklaus, for what he considered slow play. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also critical of the replacement of caddies by riding  
carts at most courses, saying the disappearance of caddies denied 
poorer kids access to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the reason players are coming from outside of the  
United States, because they don't have carts,'' Sarazen said. ``We 
used to get our great players from the caddie ranks. Now, most 
courses couldn't survive without the money they get from carts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said there was an easy explanation for why he remained a  
good player for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots  
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years 
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, who witnessed the emergence of Tiger Woods, said that  
Nicklaus' record of 18 major professional championships and two 
U.S. Amateurs would never be broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nicklaus record? Forget it,'' Sarazen said. ``Nobody will  
ever come close to his 20 major championships. It's the safest 
record in sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said he made $700 for winning his first U.S. Open and  
$500 for the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today a good, young golfer -- he doesn't have to be a champion  
-- gets $150,000 for wearing a logo on his cap or his sleeve,'' 
Sarazen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen lived the last year's of his life in Marco Island, Fla.  
He lost his wife of 62 years -- Mary Catherine -- in the mid 1980s.

<HEADLINE> WWII Slave Labor Reparations Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expressed  
satisfaction with an initial effort to set up a reparations program 
for tens of thousands of workers subjected to a forced labor 
campaign sponsored by Nazi Germany during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were employed by large German companies, 15 of which have  
pledged to set up a fund by September to pay the reparations. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department played host for two days of talks by  
government officials from eight countries, as well as business and 
private groups. The meeting ended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agreement was reached to set up two working groups, one to set  
eligibility rules for payments from the fund and the other to deal 
with ways to ensure legal closure for the German companies, said 
Stuart Eizenstat, U.S. undersecretary of state for economic 
affairs. He presided at the conference with Bodo Hombach, chief of 
staff for German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said participants are committed to meeting in working  
groups in Washington and in Bonn and to making recommendations 
within the next 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed hope processes can be agreed to by Sept. 1. That  
date, he noted, is the 60th anniversary of the start of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the issues to be settled, he said, are ways to achieve  
legal closure, who should be the beneficiaries and how the fund 
would be operated. 
</P>
<P>
	The process will deal with the 70,000 to 90,000 people from a  
number of countries who are classified as slave laborers, mostly 
Jewish concentration camp or ghetto survivors, and so-called forced 
laborers, a much larger category that consists mostly of 
agricultural workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Eizenstat said the goal is to provide victims with payments  
through a ``cooperative, fair and non-bureaucratic arrangement 
without regard to nationality or religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States and Germany, delegations from  
Belarus, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Israel, Poland and Russia 
were present. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending were delegates from reconciliation foundations  
from Central and Eastern Europe, and officers from key German 
companies and their lawyers. The Conference on Jewish Material 
Claims Against Germany and attorneys representing Holocaust 
survivors in class-action suits also were represented. 
</P>
<P>
	``The participation of all those who attended is a significant  
accomplishment in moving the process toward closure,'' Eizenstat 
said after the second and final day of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the Jewish claims  
conference, said, ``For this effort to succeed we need to make very 
rapid progress. We also hope that more companies will join the 
process very soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The German Embassy hosted a dinner for the visiting delegations.

	Clinton, Jiang Agree to Talk  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang  
Zemin agreed today to talk, as tensions with China over NATO's 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade appeared to be easing. 
Jiang had avoided talking to Clinton since the bombing Saturday, 
which killed three people. His readiness to talk was conveyed by 
Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing, who took a condolence book to the 
White House for Clinton to sign. ``He indicated a willingness to 
talk, and we're setting up the call,'' said National Security 
Council spokesman David Leavy. It was unclear whether the call

	Apaches Combat Ready, But Unused  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Apache attack helicopters that have been  
in Albania for more than three weeks are now ready for combat 
against Serb forces in Kosovo, but NATO's top commander has yet to 
ask President Clinton for the go-ahead, a senior Pentagon official 
said today. The question of when -- and even if -- the Apaches will 
go into action against Serb forces in Kosovo has been a topic of 
speculation for weeks, in large part because the low-flying 
helicopters are vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire and their use 
would raise considerably the risk of American battlefield 
casualties.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans retreated under pressure  
today on gun control, calling for fresh restrictions on sales at 
gun shows less than 24 hours after rejecting them. Democrats 
swiftly denounced the offer, saying it contained numerous loopholes 
despite the public outrage over last month's high school shootings 
in Colorado. ``It's the most Swiss-cheesy bill I've ever seen,'' 
said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. The developments came as some 
Republicans expressed concern about the outcome of a series of

Space and Communications Ltd. of New York said today it could be 
forced to cut transmissions into Yugoslavia from one of its 
satellites, which serves at least two of the country's major 
Internet providers.''To put it bluntly, we somehow got used to 
air-raid sirens, bombings and threats of invasion, but we don't 
know how we're going to survive without the Internet,'' said Alex

its St. Louis plant. The company announced the moves today, saying 
it will consolidate factories that make three planes, including the 
F-15. The company said it expects the cuts to come from management

<HEADLINE> House GOP Sets Social Security Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to gain ground in the Social Security  
debate, House Republicans are rushing a floor vote on legislation 
intended to prevent raids on $1.8 trillion in surplus money until 
the program is fixed for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, the Social Security surplus can't be used  
for new spending programs, nor can it be used to offset tax cuts,'' 
said Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders on Wednesday ordered that the bill bypass the  
Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee and head directly to 
the floor next week to avoid any snags or chances for Democrats to 
push for changes. Democrats in the Senate have blocked a similar 
Social Security ``lockbox'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. E. Clay Shaw, chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee  
on Social Security, told reporters Wednesday that House passage was 
assured and should serve notice that Republicans are serious about 
working with President Clinton and congressional Democrats to 
ensure the program's future solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has got to be a bipartisan effort,'' said Shaw, R-Fla.  
``One party cannot do it alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``lockbox'' proposal would create new legislative hurdles  
for any attempt to use $1.8 trillion in projected surpluses -- out 
of about $2.6 trillion total over the next decade -- for anything 
other than Social Security or Medicare. Both are in jeopardy of 
financial insolvency as the baby boom generation retires. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats heaped scorn on the proposal, which they said  
allows Congress too many loopholes to get at the money. They also 
said that skipping the committees demonstrates that the GOP isn't 
truly interested in Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	``They appear more interested in political stunts than actually  
saving Social Security,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top 
Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel and his fellow Ways and Means Democrats were scheduled to  
meet later today with Clinton at the White House to map out a 
coordinated strategy for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has outlined a detailed plan to restore the  
program, as have Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer of Texas and 
Shaw, but some GOP leaders say it's doubtful any deal can be 
reached. And House Democrats fear that Clinton might be tempted to 
negotiate with Republicans and leave them on the sidelines, as he 
has done on other high-profile issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to compare notes,'' said Rep. Sander Levin,  
D-Mich. ``We would prefer action if it is positive and appropriate, 
not action for its own sake. We're going to assess where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said  
House passage of the Social Security ``lockbox'' would increase 
pressure on Democrats to drop their filibuster and that he hoped to 
try to revive the measure in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's being blocked by the Democrats. ... They're going to have  
to explain why,'' Lott told reporters.

<HEADLINE>  White Sox Pitcher Regaining Old Form </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Father really does know best, just ask Jaime  
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after being demoted to the bullpen with a bloated ERA,  
the Chicago White Sox pitcher is starting to show the form that 
made him one of the NL's best pitchers in 1995. And dear old Dad 
deserves some of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad used to be a sidethrower. I always saw him pitching  
like that, but I never tried it,'' Navarro said. ``In the 
offseason, I went to Puerto Rico and asked, 'What are you seeing?' 
He said I was maybe way too up to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'Once in a while, come from the side like I used to  
throw.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Navarro tinkered with his motion, lowering the angle of his  
arm. Instead of throwing over the top, he sometimes throws from 
around his shoulder. Other times it's lower, and occasionally it's 
even lower than that, almost a sidearm delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deception is there because it's harder for them to see the  
ball,'' said White Sox pitching coach Nardi Contreras. ``It takes 
them a little longer to see the ball, compared to where he was. In 
the past, you were able to see him right away, real easily, which 
gave them a longer look to see what was coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that made Navarro easy prey.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Navarro won 14 games for the Chicago Cubs and was one  
of the NL's hottest pitchers with a 3.28 ERA. But when he moved 
across town two years later, he seemed to leave something behind. 
He went 9-14 in 1997, and didn't win a game the final six weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished 8-16 last year, tied for the AL lead in losses. He  
didn't win a game after July 15, and manager Jerry Manuel finally 
demoted him to the bullpen. He was even booed by the White Sox 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad,'' Navarro said. ``It was frustrating. The fans  
have their right to be angry because they want to see a winner, and 
I was coming here to help the team, not let the team down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taking everything too hard and trying to do too much and  
getting angry at a lot of things. That just wasn't helping me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contreras tried to get Navarro to alter his motion so his  
pitches wouldn't be so easy to see, but he had little success. 
Finally, in the offseason, with rumors swirling that the White Sox 
wanted to trade him, Navarro went to visit his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Julio Navarro -- who pitched for the old Los Angeles Angels, the  
Detroit Tigers and the Atlanta Braves during his career -- told his 
son the same thing Contreras had: He needed to shorten his throwing 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Navarro also told his son he needed to work on his  
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad said, 'I'd see you get angry last year. You'd get mad  
about one pitch and you were struggling. You've got to slow down; 
you've got to relax,''' Navarro said. ``I never lost confidence in 
myself. Never. I've just got to go out there and believe in myself 
that I can go out there and be a good pitcher, like I used to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Navarro's 2-3 record and his 5.03 ERA might not be  
impressive at first glance, there's more to the numbers. He has a 
2.71 ERA over his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be lower if he hadn't given up seven runs -- one earned  
-- and five hits in one inning against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really been on a roll lately,'' Manuel said. ``Other than  
that one inning in Baltimore, we are confident that he has arrived 
and is back to the form that made him one of the top pitchers in 
the NL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike last year, Navarro just shrugged off the Baltimore game.  
In his next start, Monday against the AL West-leading Rangers, he 
pitched four-hit ball for eight innings and gave up just one run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just taking things easy,'' he said. ``Whether I  
have a good game or a bad game, I control myself, learn about it, 
learn about what were the mistakes, keep working at it and never 
give up.''

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday To Skip Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Silverbulletday will stick with the fillies,  
taking some sizzle out of the Preakness Saturday at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're out,'' owner Mike Pegram said. ``Silverbulletday will  
run Friday in the Black-Eyed Susan.'' She will be the odds-on 
favorite to beat seven other fillies for her 11th win in 12 career 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational filly's debut against males, including Kentucky  
Derby winner Charismatic, was highly anticipated, and, Pegram said, 
``We came up here (from Churchill Downs) thinking we were going to 
run in the Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That changed when the Kentucky Oaks winner drew the outside post  
in a field of 14 3-year-olds on Wednesday. That field could be 
further reduced if Vicar is scratched, and trainer Carl Nafzger 
indicated strongly that the colt would be declared from the 124th 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert felt that the outside post reduced the  
filly's victory chances to an unacceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take care of her,'' Baffert said. ``With the good  
ones you got to be so careful. This was a hard decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a reporter told Baffert early Thursday that he hoped  
Silverbulletday would run in the Preakness, the trainer replied, 
``You guys just want something to write about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bob will be well represented by Excellent Meeting,''  
Pegram said. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, fifth in the 19-horse Kentucky Derby after  
all kinds of traffic problems, will be the 52nd filly to start in 
the Preakness and the first since 1988 Kentucky Derby winner 
Winning Colors, who finished third. Four fillies have won, but none 
since Nellie Morse in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, owned by John and Betty Mabee and ridden by  
Kent Desormeaux, will break from the No. 7 post in quest of her 
eighth win in 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Stevens, who would have ridden Silverbulletday, now will  
ride Stephen Got Even, the Gallery Furniture.com winner and 14th in 
the Derby. He replaces Chris McCarron, who sustained a hairline 
fracture near the left heel when he was unseated while working a 
horse Monday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Nafzger said Vicar's won't run from post 13. He, however, said  
he wouldn't scratch the colt until Saturday in the unlikely event 
of three or four other scratches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely not scratching until the parties are over,''  
Nafzger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Interestingly, Charismatic, who will start from the No. 6 post,  
won the 1 1/4-mile Derby from No. 16, and Menifee, who will start from 
No. 4, finished second from the No. 18 post. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he runs that race back, he'll be very hard to beat,'' said  
Menifee's trainer, Elliott Walden. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden also trained Victory Gallop, second in the Derby and  
Preakness and winner of the Belmont Stakes last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was the 5-2 early favorite. Silverbulletday had been the  
7-2 second choice. The morning line will not be changed because the 
program already had been printed with those odds. Pimlico oddsmaker 
Clem Florio, however, said he would have made some changes. 
</P>
<P>
	He would have changed Excellent Meeting from 5-1 to 9-2 and  
Charismatic from 6-1 to 5-1. Other changes would have been Cat 
Thief, Charismatic's D. Wayne Lukas-trained stablemate, 8-1 to 6-1; 
Stephen Got Even, 10-1 to 8-1; Worldly Manner, 12-1 to 10-1, and 
Vicar, 30-1 to 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good about this horse; I think he's peaked at the right  
time,'' Lukas said of Charismatic, who paid a winning mutuel of 
$64.60, third-highest in the 125-year history of the Derby. The 
last Derby winner to be favored in the Preakness was Go for Gin, 
second in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief finished third in the Derby, and Worldly Manner was  
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Derby starters in the field are Kimberlite Pipe, the  
Louisiana Derby winner, sixth in the Derby; Valhol, the 
controversial Arkansas Derby winner, 15th at Kentucky, and Adonis, 
the Nick Zito-trained stablemate of Stephen Got Even, who won the 
Wood Memorial and was 17th in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Making their debuts in Triple Crown competition will be Patience  
Game, winner of the Derby Trial; Torrid Sand, third in the Arkansas 
Derby, and Badge, fourth in the Wood Memorial.

<HEADLINE> Coke Wants Lawsuit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola Co. denied discriminating against black  
employees and asked a federal court Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit 
alleging the company treats them differently from whites. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents filed with the U.S. District Court, Coke's lawyers  
answered the lawsuit by four former and current employees who said 
the soft-drink giant discriminates against blacks by paying them 
lower wages, and providing them with tougher job reviews and fewer 
job advancement opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	In lieu of dismissal of the suit, Coca-Cola asked for a jury  
trial on the claims. The company also sought to prevent the suit 
from being made a class action. 
</P>
<P>
	The papers said that if any of the personnel policies or  
practices, or actions by the company, contained in the lawsuit 
``exist or took place, they were in no way motivated by race or any 
other protected characteristic but instead were based solely on 
legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Richard Story scheduled a hearing Thursday  
on an issue raised last week by the plaintiffs. They have asked the 
judge to bar Coca-Cola from e-mailing its black employees, who are 
seen as potential plaintiffs if the suit gains class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke Chairman M. Douglas Ivester sent two e-mails to the  
company's 10,000 U.S. employees, saying the lawsuit's claims were 
untrue. 
</P>
<P>
	The company maintains that excluding black employees from the  
communications would be as discriminatory as the suit alleges the 
company is.

<HEADLINE>  Banker Elected As Italy's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, an internationally respected  
banker-politician, won Italy's presidency Thursday with broad 
support from both left and right, leaving politicians themselves 
marveling at their rare show of unity. 
</P>

	ROME (AP) -- Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, an internationally respected

<HEADLINE> Y2K Lawsuit Issue Back at Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House passage of legislation to limit year  
2000 computer lawsuits puts pressure back on the Senate to agree on 
a companion bill that, unlike the House version, can escape a 
promised White House veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 236-190 Wednesday for legislation that would put  
caps on punitive damage awards, make potential plaintiffs wait 90 
days before filing suits, encourage mediation and limit class 
action lawsuits arising out of computer breakdowns that could occur 
with the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called it  
``the most significant piece of pro-business legislation to pass 
the House this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, while agreeing steps need to be taken to  
stop frivolous Y2K lawsuits, says the House bill would merit a 
presidential veto because it goes too far in restricting legal 
rights to redress wrongs. It ``would be perhaps the most sweeping 
litigation measure ever enacted,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer and attorney groups have urged the White House to  
oppose the legislation while another key Democratic support group, 
the high tech industry, has pushed equally hard for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday two senior White House officials, presidential aide  
Bruce Lindsey and economic adviser Gene Sperling, wrote House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., saying they wanted to find common 
ground and spelling out possible areas of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said the final bill should cover only commercial  
claims, and not restrict consumers from seeking damages for 
computer problems, but did show flexibility on ``proportionate 
liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's sponsors want to stop attorneys from going after big,  
rich companies by limiting damages to a defendant's proportionate 
responsibility for a problem. Consumer groups say this would hurt 
lower income claimants, but the administration said it would accept 
some changes ``given the unique -- once in a millennium -- nature of 
the Y2K problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the House showed little inclination to accept White House  
ideas, defeating on a mainly partisan vote a Democratic version 
that the administration supported. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should protect the problem-solvers, not those that are  
sitting on the sidelines now licking their chops hoping the problem 
won't be solved so they can move in like a bunch of buzzards and 
vultures and feed off the carcasses,'' said House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey, R-Texas, in favor of the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Joan Mulhern of Public Citizen, which opposes the bill, said it  
was ``reckless and extreme'' to be passing a far-reaching bill when 
no one knows how much disruption will be caused by computers that 
cannot read the 2000 date. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have warned of the worst spate of lawsuits in  
American history if companies lose business because they can't get 
supplies or process credit cards, or if consumers have problems 
with medical equipment or filling drug prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was close to a deal on Y2K litigation two weeks ago  
but the bill was pulled from the floor as the Democratic and 
Republican leadership battled over other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of  
Manufacturers, said the House vote Wednesday and the 
Lindsey-Sperling letter ``greatly increases the chances of breaking 
the logjam and passing this bill in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, press secretary for Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott,R-Miss., said Lott might try to bring the bill up again 
next week. ``We've got to try again because the window is 
closing.''

	LITTLE FALLS, N.J. (AP) -- The Northern League's New Jersey  
Jackals re-signed outfielder Pete Rose Jr. today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old son of baseball's career hits leader played in

<HEADLINE> No New Bombing in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO has not returned to bomb any targets in  
downtown Belgrade since Friday night's mistaken hit on the Chinese 
Embassy, but a U.S. military planner said the alliance has not 
sworn off the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a moratorium on any target that I know of,'' Maj.  
Gen. Charles Wald said at a briefing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald, a strategic planner at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said  
NATO hit a few targets outlying Belgrade in recent days, and took 
advantage of the clear sky to concentrate on hitting airfields, 
bridges and other targets in the disputed Serbian province of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any order whatsoever from any place that I've  
heard of to stop,'' Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force general who is running the air war wants to target  
Belgrade and the leadership around Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	While carrying out the top military priority -- ``killing the  
army in Kosovo -- I also need to strike at the leadership and the 
people around Milosevic to compel them to change their behavior in 
Kosovo and accept the terms NATO has on the table,'' said Lt. Gen. 
Michael C. Short. 
</P>
<P>
	In a New York Times interview, Short noted it took weeks for  
NATO leaders to approve bombing of leadership targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Airmen would have liked to have gone after that target set on  
the first night and sent a clear signal that we were taking the 
gloves off from the very beginning, that we were not going to 
incrementalize, that we're not going to try a little bit of this 
and see how you like it and try a little bit of that and see how 
you like it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Short, whose son is an A-10 pilot flying in the conflict, said  
NATO fliers' work is complicated by the lack of troops on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question it affects me,'' the  
general said. ``I'd like to have that company commander down there 
on the ground saying to my son, the A-10 driver, 'OK, they are dug 
in 500 meters in front of me. I can see tanks. I can see troops 
massed on the other side of that village.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, U.S. officials say military planners are double- and  
triple-checking maps and target lists in Belgrade, the Serbian 
capital and Milosevic's base. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on the Chinese Embassy killed three, strained  
U.S.-Chinese relations and embarrassed NATO and the United States. 
Defense Secretary William Cohen and other officials blamed faulty 
maps and communications miscues for the error. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, NATO said the bombing came during the heaviest  
onslaught on downtown Belgrade to date -- including bombing runs on 
government buildings and a hotel NATO identified as the 
headquarters of the alleged war criminal nicknamed Arkan. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO planes have flown close to 20,000 missions since the  
bombing began seven weeks ago, of which more than 5,000 were 
``strike,'' or actual bombing sorties, Wald said. The alliance has 
dropped or fired about 10,000 bombs or missiles, taken out 11 of 
Milosevic's 14 MiG-29s and dozens of tanks, Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of allied air strikes are carried out by U.S.  
planes and pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday represented NATO's most successful day yet, Defense  
Secretary William Cohen said at the same briefing, noting the 
allies flew more than 600 missions and struck nearly 70 targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also  
was upbeat, but predicted Serb military and police forces could 
withstand NATO bombing for ``quite some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton noted that bombing has little effect on the sidearms and  
rifles carried by individual Serb troops. Those weapons are the 
main instruments used to evict Kosovo's ethnic Albanians from their 
homes in a two-month campaign of ethnic terror, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO began bombing in March to force Milosevic to accept a peace  
deal for Kosovo and allow refugees to return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 750,000 refugees crowd camps in bordering nations, while  
others are on the move inside Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that a force like the one Milosevic is using  
for ethnic cleansing and terror in Kosovo could hold out for quite 
some time,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not be more specific, and insisted the alliance is  
prepared to continue its intensified bombing for as long as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the Air Force and Navy activated another 2,173  
reservists and 35 more aircraft for the Kosovo conflict. That 
brought to 4,409 the number of reservists ordered to active duty so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said last week that a total of 5,035 reservists would be  
activated in the current round, but the services have yet to pick 
some of the units to be included, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has authorized the Pentagon to activate as many as  
33,102 reservists.

<HEADLINE> EPA Says Pollution Up After Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The amount of toxic chemicals released into  
the environment by industrial plants increased by 2.2 percent in 
1997, ending years of steady decline, the Environmental Protection 
Agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in total releases of 644 toxic chemicals by 21,490  
facilities was attributed largely to plants sending more metal 
wastes to landfills and other disposal sites, instead of to 
recycling centers. That was because in 1997, the year the latest 
data covered, metal recycling prices increased, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The industries covered by the annual reporting requirement said  
that in 1997 they put 2.58 billion pounds of toxic waste into the 
air and water and onto land, including wastes injected deep into 
the earth. That compares with 2.52 billion pounds in 1996, 
according to revised figures reported for that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before 1997, releases had been trending down each year since the  
reporting began for the year 1988, although companies are 
generating more waste during production. Still, toxic emissions 
have dropped by almost 43 percent since the reporting requirement 
began, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we believe it will continue to decline in the long term,''  
said EPA Administrator Carol Browner. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of chemicals on which releases must be reported has  
doubled to 644 chemicals since the Toxic Inventory Released data 
were first collected. Next year, seven additional industrial 
sectors, including utilities, will have to report releases. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA said air pollution accounted for nearly 52 percent of  
the waste releases, or 1.3 billion pounds, a decline of 127 million 
pounds from 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 percent of the total, or 785 million pounds, was  
disposed of on land, including landfills, on-site disposal and 
transfers to waste brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 218 million pounds, or 8.5 percent, was released  
into lakes and streams, an increase of 41 million pounds. Nearly 
233 million pounds, or 9 percent, was injected deep into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas had the largest amount of releases, 268 million pounds;  
followed by Ohio, 213 million pounds; Louisiana, 188 million 
pounds; Illinois, 134 million pounds; and Pennsylvania, 133 million 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemical industry accounts for the largest volume of toxic  
releases, followed by primary metals, and the pulp and paper 
industries.

	China Urges Defiance of US Bullying  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's president accused the United States today  
of seeking global dominance and urged nations worldwide to defy 
American bullying and create a new just order. The harsh words 
showed just how much the embassy bombing in Yugoslavia has damaged 
Chinese political will for smooth U.S. relations. The statement 
marked a turnabout for President Jiang Zemin, who last year claimed 
credit for engineering a rapprochement with Washington. It was the 
first time in three years of improving relations that Jiang has 
outright called the United States a term China reserves for enemy 
countries -- hegemonist.

	Serb Pullout Called Insignificant  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Western authorities today called the  
departure of 120 Yugoslav troops from Kosovo an insignificant move 
and possibly a sham. The troops broke into grins and waved for 
reporters who had been invited to watch. It was evidently an 
attempt to counter widespread disbelief of a Yugoslav army 
withdrawal order last Sunday. NATO and U.S. officials say a partial 
pullout from Kosovo won't stop their seven-week-old air campaign 
and doesn't satisfy their demands for a full troop withdrawal from 
the southern Serb province.

	Senate GOP Backpedal on Gun Vote  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate GOP leaders today considered reversing  
yesterday's vote and requiring background checks for all private 
firearm sales at gun shows. ``For the life of me,'' President 
Clinton said on the no-vote, ``I can't figure out how they did 
it.'' He said there was ``simply no excuse for letting criminals 
get arms at gun shows they can't get at gun stores.'' An aide to 
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a board member of the National Rifle 
Association, said today that because of the uproar among GOP 
senators, Craig will offer an amendment requiring background checks 
on all sales at gun shows.

	Impeachment of Yeltsin Begins  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers began impeachment hearings today  
to remove Boris Yeltsin, claiming the president is guilty of 
treason, first-degree murder and plotting to sell Russia out to the 
West. Political leaders say the chances of impeaching Yeltsin 
soared after the president outraged lawmakers yesterday by sacking 
the country's popular prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov. A vote on 
impeachment in the lower chamber of parliament could be held as 
early as tomorrow. The charge that he launched the botched 1994-96 
war in Chechnya is the one most likely to attract enough votes for 
impeachment.

	American Airlines Hit With Suit

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Airlines, the nation's second-largest  
air carrier, was charged today with monopolizing airline passenger 
service to and from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The 
Justice Department charged American with repeatedly trying to drive 
small, startup airlines out of the DFW airport, the nation's third 
largest, by saturating their routes with flights of its own and 
cutting fares. This is the first predatory-practices case brought 
since airlines were deregulated in 1978.

	Tobacco Industry Wins Again in Court

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal jury handed the tobacco  
industry its second victory in four days today, deciding Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. was not at fault in the case of a man who 
died of lung cancer in 1995 after smoking Kools. Charles Steele's 
family had sued for $26 million, claiming the nation's 
third-largest tobacco company sold him an unreasonably dangerous 
product. Jury foreman Gary White said Steele ``was quite aware of 
the dangers, but the pleasures outweighed the dangers.''

	Cellular Phones To Add 911 Routing  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to concerns that cellular calls to  
911 do not always go through, federal regulators took action today 
to eventually increase the chances such calls reach emergency 
dispatchers. The Federal Communications Commission is requiring new 
-- not existing -- analog cellular phones to have software routing a 
911 call to another carrier when the customer's own company or one 
designated to handle ``roaming'' calls cannot complete the call. 
Fast-growing digital phones -- 18.8 million now in use -- are not 
covered by the rules.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento Guards Smoking Utah  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- They came into the playoff series with  
a huge edge in experience. The past two games, though, that has 
meant little. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's venerable backcourt of John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek,  
which has led the Jazz to two straight NBA Finals, is looking just 
plain old against Sacramento's young tandem of Jason Williams and 
Tariq Abdul-Wahad. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Abdul-Wahad, appearing in their first playoff  
series, outplayed and outscored their counterparts as the Kings 
defeated the Jazz 84-81 in overtime Wednesday night to take a 2-1 
lead in the best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a great job defensively on our backcourt,'' Utah  
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``They are bigger, stronger and, obviously, 
younger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, who won a home playoff game for the first time since  
moving to Sacramento in 1985, can wrap up the first-round series 
with a victory at home Friday night. After losing by 30 points in 
Game 1, the Kings have won two straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had 12 points, six assists and matched his career high  
with eight rebounds Wednesday night, while Abdul-Wahad had six 
points and helped hold Hornacek to four points on 1-of-6 shooting. 
Stockton scored five points, going 1-for-9 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, when we started losing games, we knew it (age)  
was going to become an issue,'' Hornacek said before practice 
Thursday. ``Right now, they're freewheeling it. We had the 
opportunity in Game 2 to knock their confidence down, and we didn't 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton has 2,082 points in 150 playoff games and Hornacek has  
1,871 points in 122. Williams and Abdul-Wahad each has played in 
three playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't deny facts. We are older than them,'' Stockton said.  
``But is it a factor in the game? I don't think so. I certainly 
don't feel that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, not surprisingly, tried to avoid playing the age card  
Thursday and instead focused on the ability of veterans such as 
Stockton, Hornacek and Karl Malone to find ways to rebound from 
playoff deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never count out Stockton, Malone and Hornacek. They  
scare me to death for tomorrow night,'' Sacramento coach Rick 
Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sloan said Stockton has not fully recovered from a flagrant foul  
in the opening seconds of Game 2 by Chris Webber, who lowered his 
shoulder and dropped Stockton to the court. Stockton said he's 
feeling fine, but the coach has his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Stockton's not the same person after he got hit.  
Physically,'' said Sloan, who added he was more concerned with the 
play of his big men than that of his starting backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of soft players. Soft play at this time of the  
year sends you home,'' Sloan said. ``I think the fire's still there 
with a lot of our guys. But I don't know if that's true for all of 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he sees no difference in Stockton's play.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the same Stockton to me, he's still a great  
player,'' the rookie point guard said. ``Maybe he's different 
toward Web, but he's the same toward me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Adelman said the only difference is that Stockton has missed  
some shots in the past two games that he normally makes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it (Webber's flagrant foul) bothered him, he's  
too tough,'' the Kings coach said. ``Whenever he gets knocked down, 
he gets up. I think he's going to get up tomorrow night.''

<HEADLINE> Cellular Phones To Add 911 Routing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to concerns that cellular calls to  
911 do not always go through, federal regulators took action 
Thursday to eventually increase the chances such calls reach 
emergency dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission is requiring new -- not  
existing -- analog cellular phones to have software routing a 911 
call to another carrier when the customer's own company or one 
designated to handle ``roaming'' calls cannot complete the call. 
Phones usually are not programmed to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers selling phones in the United States need to make  
changes to new analog cellular phones and new ``dual mode'' phones 
(only for operating in the analog mode) within nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast-growing digital phones -- 18.8 million now in use -- are not  
covered by the rules. Digital phones are more complex and 
technology does not exist to deal with the call completion problem, 
FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules do not require the roughly 50.4 million analog  
cellular phones now in use to be retrofitted. But they do not 
prevent a carrier from retrofitting existing phones, although 
neither regulators nor industry officials are aware of any company 
planning to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also do not prevent a cellular carrier from swapping  
out existing phones with new ones containing the switching the FCC 
requires. 
</P>
<P>
	People buy a new cell phone every two to three years, a FCC  
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are some areas where no carrier has an antenna to  
pick up a call, the rules cannot guarantee a 911 call will be 
completed. Still, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the action 
``increases the number of these type of critical calls that are 
completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association and the  
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, whose 
members include 911 dispatchers, hailed the FCC's action. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 98,000 calls to 911 are made each day on cell phones.  
Most are completed. But some -- neither the FCC nor the cellular 
industry has estimates on the number -- do not go through. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a number of reasons why that happens: A company has a  
``dead zone,'' meaning it does not have an antenna in a particular 
area to pick up the call; there is congestion on the cellular 
network; or interference from buildings, mountains or other objects 
can block the call. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC identified three technologies that should accomplish the  
switching it requires. But the agency did not dictate a specific 
one for companies to use. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the FCC exempted analog cable TV boxes from rules  
giving customers the option of buying them in stores. Customers 
usually lease the boxes through their local cable company. Digital 
boxes eventually will be sold in stores.

<HEADLINE> Markets Take Rubin News in Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a few nervous moments Wednesday, Wall  
Street took the news of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's 
long-rumored resignation in stride. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers had wondered whether a change in the ranks of  
U.S. policy makers would be the pin that popped the nation's 
economic balloon. 
</P>
<P>
	And at first, reports of Rubin's resignation did hit the market  
hard. The Dow plummeted 213 points and bonds also tumbled. But the 
markets soon recovered. The Dow ended 27.21 points lower at 
10,998.94. Bond prices were only slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reasons for the muted response: the economy is going  
strong, and Rubin has a well-regarded successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue for the market is: Are we changing a person or  
changing a policy?'' said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment 
strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ``At the end of the day, 
this move does not seem to indicate a change in policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin will be succeeded by his deputy, Lawrence Summers, who has  
had a strong background in academia and a gradually expanding role 
in the Clinton administration. Last year, he was a key player in 
the administration's efforts to stem the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Eizenstat, an undersecretary at the State Department,  
will replace Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most market watchers expect the new team to extend the policies  
that made Rubin a hero among business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry Summers will bring great experience, skill and  
continuity to this critical role,'' David H. Komansky, chairman and 
chief executive at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment banks and management professionals have lionized  
Rubin, who earned millions as a banker and co-chairman of Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co. before joining the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The policies of Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan produced a stellar investment climate. Strong growth, low 
inflation and low unemployment have combined in an unprecedented 
period of economic expansion. Since Rubin became treasury secretary 
in 1995, the Dow Jones industrial average has soared from just 
under 4,000 to more than 11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street has taken this in stride because he's leaving in  
very good stead,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment 
strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also noted that Greenspan, whose third term ends in  
June 2000, is expected to stay for a fourth four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Co. Settles Weight Loss Claim Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government has barred a fitness company  
from making claims about how much weight customers can lose using 
its equipment without credible evidence to back up those 
assertions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitness Quest Inc. had claimed in its advertisements that  
consumers could shed 1,000 calories an hour on its exercise gliders 
and lose significant weight in a month by using its abdominal 
machine for three minutes daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission said the company could not  
substantiate the claims and on Wednesday announced a settlement 
that would prevent the company from making them without supporting 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitness Quest had said its Gazelle Glider, SkyTrek and Airofit  
could burn three times more calories than are burned while walking 
and nearly twice the calories burned while cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the gliders, the Canton, Ohio-based company also  
marketed two abdominal devices -- Abs Only Machine and Ab Isolator, 
which it said were twice as effective as regular sit-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertisements included testimonials from owners of the  
equipment who spoke about their weight-loss and weight-maintenance 
experience. But the FTC charged that the company had no basis to 
claim that these experiences were typical for most users. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitness Quest made no admission of liability and stressed that  
it stopped running the advertisements in question in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make a concerted effort to ensure we are able to stand  
behind any statement made about our products,'' said the company's 
president, Robert Schnabel Jr. ``Our goal is to make and market 
top-quality, affordable health equipment to help customers meet 
their fitness objectives. We rely on our customers' trust to 
establish that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, the company is specifically prohibited  
from making claims about weight loss, calorie burning or spot 
reduction from its products without adequate substantiation. 
</P>
<P>
	The company must also include in its endorsements a statement  
about what the typical experience of users should be or a 
disclosure indicating that consumers should not expect results 
similar to those in the testimonials.

<HEADLINE> Japan Bank Lending Drops in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Lending by Japanese banks plummeted 5.2 percent in  
April compared to a year earlier in the steepest plummet on record, 
the Bank of Japan said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank lending, a key measure of economic activity, fell 3.9  
percent in March. Outstanding loans by Japanese banks as of April 
were worth $4.04 trillion, the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank noted that the lending by banks, when adjusted  
for seasonal and special factors, was down 0.8 percent in April, 
compared with a fall of 1.1 percent in March. These factors 
included currency fluctuations and write-offs of non-performing 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan report covered lending by the nation's nine  
city, or major commercial, banks -- plus three long-term credit 
banks, seven trust banks, and 124 regional and second-tier regional 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is battling its deepest recession since the end of World  
War II. Unemployment is at a record high of 4.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Shaun Cassidy To Produce TV Drama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former teen idol and ``Hardy Boy'' Shaun  
Cassidy has landed a deal to produce a television drama. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year pact with Barry Diller's Studios USA is  
reportedly worth $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we have the level of conviction and confidence we do in  
Shaun, it's worth the price we're paying,'' Studios USA programming 
president David Kissinger told Wednesday's Daily Variety. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy, who created the defunct CBS-TV drama ``American  
Gothic,'' already has a 13-episode drama commitment from cable's 
USA Network and a project could be ready for broadcast by January. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is really emblematic of the kind of producer we want to be  
in business with. He has a lot of experience, but he still behaves 
like a young writer,'' Kissinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassidy, a teen heartthrob when he starred in the ABC-TV series  
``The Hardy Boys Mysteries'' from 1977 to 1979, also co-created the

<HEADLINE> GOP Backs Bill To Aid Foster Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Each year, some 20,000 foster children are  
abruptly dropped from state care simply because they turn 18 -- 
sometimes they are ready to make it on their own; usually they are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisan legislation being introduced into the House today  
aims to help these young people. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which would cost about $500 million over five years,  
would double funding for a program that helps foster children make 
the transition to independence. It would also allow states to 
extend Medicaid to them through age 21. The package is similar to 
one proposed by President Clinton in his budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids really have been woefully neglected,'' said Rep.  
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. ``The money's never been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who chairs the Ways and Means human resources  
subcommittee, said GOP leaders have promised a vote in June. The 
legislation is expected to clear the Ways and Means Committee by 
the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
	Abused and neglected children who are removed from their  
parents' care are supported with government money until they turn 
18. Federal and state dollars pay for their expenses in foster 
homes, treatments in group facilities and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	But that support ends at age 18 -- even when they have not  
finished high school and no matter how prepared they are to enter 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Research by Mark Courtney at the University of Wisconsin found  
that these children often faced dire straits 12 to 18 months after 
leaving foster care. Just 60 percent were working, and one-third 
were on welfare. One in five girls had given birth and more than 
one in four boys had been imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtney, along with two foster children and other experts, were  
scheduled to testify at a subcommittee hearing today. Also 
testifying was Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the GOP whip and a foster 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans are generally hostile to new social  
spending -- particularly spending measured in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars. But this measure appears to have bipartisan 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even those who have had the most conservative views on the use  
of government feel this is an exception,'' said Rep. Ben Cardin, 
D-Md., who is co-sponsoring the bill with Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Double funding for the Independent Living Program, which  
teaches foster kids life skills such as how to plan a budget or 
look for an apartment. The $70 million program would grow to $140 
million a year, and states could, for the first time, use some of 
this money to help the young adults pay for housing. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow states to extend Medicaid to these young people. The  
administration proposed mandatory Medicaid for them, but House 
experts said that would be too expensive -- about $400 million over 
five years. Instead, the House bill would allow states to extend 
the coverage if they want to, which could cost $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tighten rules in the Supplemental Security Income program,  
which serves poor Americans with disabilities. This is expected to 
save money that could be used for the foster child program. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make minor changes in reimbursement rates to state child  
support programs, saving additional dollars.

<HEADLINE> Bus Driver Had Been Fired for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of a charter bus that crashed and  
killed 22 people was fired from bus companies in 1996 and 1989 
after testing positive for marijuana four times, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal investigator also confirmed a report that Frank  
Bedell, 46, tested positive for marijuana when he was hospitalized 
Sunday after the bus veered off a highway and plunged into an 
embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long before the crash Bedell might have  
smoked marijuana or whether the presence of the drug in his system 
contributed to the accident, said Ken Suydam, the lead National 
Transportation Safety Board investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another piece of the puzzle we have to put together,''  
Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash has yet to be determined. Bedell remains  
in a hospital and is unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are looking into reports that a car may have cut  
in front of the bus just before it crashed. They have found no 
evidence that the bus had any mechanical problems that might have 
contributed to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's medical history, which includes kidney and heart  
problems, has not been linked to the accident by investigators. 
Investigators say the case shows gaps in the system to make sure 
bus drivers are medically sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's history of testing positive for marijuana happened  
while employed as a municipal bus driver in New Orleans and in 
suburban Jefferson Parish. Authorities previously said he tested 
positive for cocaine in 1997 after applying for a job with 
Greyhound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime after being hired in New Orleans in 1976, Bedell was  
given a drug test because he had been absent for work for eight 
days, Suydam said. After testing positive for marijuana, Bedell 
spent several months attending classes in an employee assistance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	But he later tested positive again for the drug and was fired in  
March 1989, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Bedell was hired as a driver for suburban buses. He  
failed a marijuana drug test the next year, Suydam said. Bedell 
spent two months in a drug rehabilitation program, but tested 
positive again for the drug in 1996 and was terminated a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Bedell passed at least three drug tests while  
working for Custom Bus Charters, the company that provided the bus 
for the Mother's Day gambling excursion to a Mississippi casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Custom president Donna Begovich said in a statement Thursday she  
was shocked to learn Bedell tested positive for marijuana after the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, Custom had no way of knowing Frank's drug usage at  
any time,'' Begovich said. ``Frank Bedell passed his pre-employment 
drug test, the city's drug test, a police background check and 
three subsequent random drug tests within an 18-month period. What 
else could we have done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Custom officials have also said companies Bedell worked for  
previously never told them that he had failed drug tests.

<HEADLINE> Young Entrepreneurs Going High-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A tiny teddy bear dangling from her backpack,  
Jasmine Jordan chatted easily about business plans and corporate 
sponsorship for the magazine she runs -- at age 15. 
</P>
<P>
	She's a child of the inner city, the kind of person who  
President Clinton says deserves more attention from Americans 
during these boom times. 
</P>
<P>
	But she's already a success story -- a graduate of a pioneering  
program that teaches low-income youths to run their own businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Jasmine watched Wednesday as the 10-year-old National Foundation  
for Teaching Entrepreneurship unveiled its biggest project -- an 
educational software program developed by Microsoft Corp. that the 
foundation hopes to distribute to 1 million youths by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can get a community that's technologically savvy and  
knows how to generate wealth, you can turn around a generation,'' 
said Steve Mariotti, president of the New York-based foundation, 
which has 23,000 graduates. ``It's the ultimate policy weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a lifetime of such work, Mariotti doesn't place much hope  
in political promises such as Clinton's proposed ``new markets 
initiative,'' announced Tuesday, to drum up corporate investment in 
neglected areas. 
</P>
<P>
	What works, said Mariotti, are specifics. The foundation, for  
instance, develops entrepreneurship in schools and in after-school 
programs. It funds teen-age businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, its new software program will teach even more youths about  
the stock market, how to raise capital and write a balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Simmonds uses foundation materials to teach a class in  
entrepreneurship at Frederick Douglass Academy, a revered public 
school in Harlem. And he's seen what it can do. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmonds recalled one student, who used to do his homework, not  
much more, and sometimes not even that. After taking the class, 
he's eager to be at school, and asks lots of questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most important aspects of the course has been to  
teach them they can control their destiny,'' said Simmonds. 
</P>
<P>
	For teen-agers, entrepreneurship also happens to be hot. A 1996  
Gallup poll found that nearly seven out of 10 high school students 
want to start and run their own business, mainly so that they can 
be their own boss. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet at a time when ideas are the most important capital, 85  
percent of teen-agers said they were taught little to practically 
nothing on entrepreneurship in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Given a few minutes Wednesday with Microsoft executive Jeff  
Raikes at the company's New York offices, Jasmine and others chosen 
as the foundation's ``Entrepreneurs of the Year'' got down to 
business quickly. They peppered him with questions about the 
Internet and their ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can having a Web site help my business on a local level?''  
asked Harold Deloach, a 1989 graduate, now 26, who said he wanted 
to keep his Philadelphia electrical repair business small for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Raikes answered that even if Deloach doesn't want to advertise  
on-line, he can use a Web site to find suppliers or better business 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has contributed $2 million in cash or software to the  
foundation in the last three years. It's good public relations, of 
course, and a key way to invest in the highly entrepreneurial 
high-tech field. 
</P>
<P>
	But Raikes suggested that the foundation draws Microsoft  
volunteers in 13 cities because it provides a tangible way to help 
very intangible problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This provides the tools for these kids to pursue their  
dreams,'' said Raikes, a group vice president at Microsoft. 
``That's so different from the way society addresses these 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Jasmine, a New Yorker whose father died recently and whose  
mother suffers from medical problems, the program has allowed her 
to reap much more than extra money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through my magazine, I've been introduced to an entire new  
world,'' she said as she showed off ``Tools for Living,'' her 
bi-monthly for young entrepreneurs that now has a circulation of 
16,000. ``I plan to run it into my twenties and thirties.''

<HEADLINE> Brewery Plans To Hire New Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Miller Brewing Co. plans to add more than 100  
workers this summer, in part because of expected production 
increases now that it has acquired four new brands from other 
breweries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brewery plans to hire 112 new employees for its Milwaukee  
facility starting in June, spokesman Michael Brophy said Wednesday. 
It is the first time in 20 years the company has hired new 
employees at that facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The company currently has 830 employees at its Milwaukee  
brewery. It could add about 100 union employees and 12 supervisors, 
a 13.5 percent increase, Brophy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The brewery needs more workers because it is making more beer as  
a result of the sale in April of Stroh Brewery Co. to Miller and 
Pabst Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal, Miller acquired two brands from Stroh and two from  
Pabst. Miller also got Pabst's brewery in Tumwater, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the new hires, Miller plans to spend $11 million to add  
a new canning line to the brewery and will expand its brewing 
operation to weekends.

<HEADLINE> Pedro Martinez Keeps Strikes Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- He has the most wins and strikeouts in the major  
leagues, and Boston's Pedro Martinez doesn't appear to be slowing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez (7-1) is off to one of best starts of his career, and  
his 91 strikeouts leads the majors. Randy Johnson is second with 78 
in 61 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best I've seen in all my years,'' Seattle's  
designated hitter Edgar Martinez said. ``I faced (Roger) Clemens in 
his early years and (Hall of Famer) Nolan (Ryan). They were tough, 
but Pedro is better. He's very tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his 15-strikeout, 9-2 win over the Mariners Wednesday  
night, Martinez tied a record for the most strikeouts in three 
consecutive nine inning games with 43. He struck out every Seattle 
starter -- including Ken Griffey, Jr. and Jay Buhner three times 
each -- except John Mabry. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez also struck out 15 May 7 against Oakland and 13 May 1  
against Anaheim. Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets had 43 
strikeouts on Sept. 7, 12, 17 of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a strong performance,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams  
said. ``They have an outstanding club with a lot of power. When you 
talk about being overpowering and striking out a lot of people -- at 
this level -- it's hard to do. I've seen some other teams, but I 
haven't seen the kind of power this man has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez had nine strikeouts in each of his first two games and  
reached double figures for the sixth straight start -- a feat only 
he and Johnson have accomplished since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 National League Cy Young Award winner also had six  
straight games with 10 or more strikeouts with Montreal in June of 
that year. Johnson did it with Seattle last June 19-July 16. 
Martinez also had his best start in 1997, when he went 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he allowed two runs, four hits and one walk in  
eight innings. Martinez, whose ERA is 1.81, didn't allow a hit in 
the first four innings, striking out nine with a nasty changeup and 
an overpowering fastball before David Segui's leadoff double in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 59 2-3 innings he has pitched since April 7, Martinez has  
yielded only 11 walks. The most he has walked in a game is three. 
</P>
<P>
	When was the last time the Mariners' Martinez had seen a pitcher  
so dominant? 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we played him,'' Martinez said. ``He has three  
quality pitches with great control. Nobody intimidates him. He 
feels like he is running the show -- and he did (Wednesday) night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So far this year, I've been healthy,'' Pedro Martinez said.  
``I've been making my pitches and I happen to get away with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's good for the Red Sox, whose other starters have  
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez hopes to continue to please the Fenway Park crowd,  
which booed when Williams made his first trip to the mound after 
Martinez had thrown 125 pitches, 83 for strikes. The fans, many of 
whom wave Dominican Republic flags in the stands when Martinez 
pitches, hoped to see the ace surpass his career high 15 strikeouts 
before being lifted from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But that will have to come another day.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just pray that I can keep it going, that I can give them  
that strikeout whenever they root for it,'' Martinez said. ``I know 
it's not always going to be like that. But I'm always going to try 
to please them whenever they ask for it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Consults on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met with a group of  
Democratic lawmakers at the White House on Thursday to discuss ways 
he might help revive chances for congressional action to shore up 
Social Security this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wanted to get their views on what the most  
productive strategy would be for moving forward,'' said Gene 
Sperling, Clinton's top economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats who met with Clinton -- all members of the House  
Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the nation's retirement 
program -- said they recommended fleshing out the Social Security 
rescue plan Clinton outlined in his State of the Union speech, and 
they offered to present it officially as legislation. That is 
something the White House has not yet done. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has a proposal and we can't legislate with  
proposals,'' said Rep. Charlie Rangel, R-N.Y., the senior Democrat 
on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear whether more specifics and formal language can  
help move Clinton's plan forward. Republicans have criticized some 
of its basic premises, including government-managed investment of 
some of Social Security's cash reserves in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is just warming up again the same plan, I don't see that  
as the answer to the problem,'' said the committee chairman, Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer, who has come up with a rival proposal that would let  
individual Americans invest Social Security's current surpluses in 
personal accounts, said it will take a show of willingness by 
Clinton to compromise to prompt Republican action. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and Republicans both say they want to take steps to  
avert a cash shortage expected to threaten Social Security once 
baby boomers, now in middle age, retire. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several weeks ago, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
R-Miss, said he did not think anything can be accomplished this 
year because he and others in his party felt Clinton had failed to 
take a strong enough lead on the sensitive political issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans leaders instead are pushing a fallback plan that  
would at least put legislative hurdles in the way of lawmakers who 
might seek to spend any government surpluses that come from Social 
Security taxes -- as opposed to income taxes -- on other programs or 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton's top advisers on Social Security have held a  
series of meetings to discuss the administration's next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with the meetings say that among options still  
being discussed within the administration is the possibility that 
Clinton could offer some adjustments to his plan in answer to 
criticisms that have been raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is looking for something to indicate he's  
willing to negotiate with Congress,'' said John Rother, a lobbyist 
for the AARP, the nation's largest organization of older adults. 
``But just as importantly, he is looking for something that would 
make it clear to the public that he is continuing to make an effort 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets Mixed in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian markets ended mixed Thursday, hurt by  
apprehension over the resignation of U.S. Treasury Security Robert 
Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo, the region's largest market, fell as Rubin's resignation  
and the dismissal of Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov 
dragged down market sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 96.11 points,  
or 0.57 percent, ending the day at 16,851.25. On Wednesday, the 
average rose 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials reacted quickly to word of Rubin's departure,  
downplaying the possible impact on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect U.S. policy to change,'' Finance Minister  
Kiichi Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors also sat on the sidelines amid expectations of  
poor corporate earnings reports, traders said. Most Japanese 
companies will release profit results later this month for the 
fiscal year ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese  
yen. In late trading, the dollar bought 121.58 yen, up 0.72 yen 
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New York 
level of 120.95 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares rose slightly, led by banking giant HSBC  
Holdings, whose recent share placement boosted market confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 40.7 points, or 0.31  
percent, at 13,053.67. On Wednesday, the index rose 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC on Tuesday completed Asia's largest equity fund raising so  
far this year, offering 88 million new shares valued at U.S. $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The share placement was to cover part of the U.S. $10.3 billion  
cost of buying Republic New York Corp. and soaked up much of the 
market's liquidity Thursday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, share prices dived, with the key index plunging 4  
percent on higher interest rates and worries over massive rights 
offering plans by local companies next month, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kospi index fell 30.76 points to 742.37.

<HEADLINE> 2 Ex-Prosecutors Acquitted in Ill. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A judge dismissed charges Thursday against  
two of seven law enforcement veterans accused of railroading a man 
for the 1983 murder of a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Kelly said there was insufficient evidence to  
prove that ex-DuPage County prosecutors Robert Kilander and Patrick 
King were part of a conspiracy to send the man to death row. 
Kilander is now a county judge and King a federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge rejected motions to acquit the other five  
defendants -- an ex-prosecutor and four sheriff's deputies, who will 
begin presenting their case next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are charged with conspiring to frame Rolando Cruz by lying,  
creating evidence and withholding information that could have 
helped his defense. Cruz was twice convicted and spent nearly a 
decade on death row before being acquitted at his third trial in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts say they cannot recall another trial in which  
prosecutors were charged with crimes for how they handled a case.

<HEADLINE> Retailer Unveils Appliance Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Forget the softer side. Sears is now hoping  
customers will come see its cyber side. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest department store chain today began selling  
2,000 major brands and models of appliances over the Internet, 
becoming the first brick-and-mortar retailer seeking to cash in on 
the big-ticket items over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers are jazzed about the amount of control the Internet  
affords them -- for both research and buying,'' said Alice M. 
Peterson, vice president and general manager of Sears Online. ``In 
essence, they're time-starved and want us to make life simpler for 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The site -- www.Sears.com -- can walk a user through the various  
options, including the ability to narrow the search to a particular 
color, brand or size, check within a price range and determine if a 
pictured item is on sale. It also provides links to sales of Sears' 
Craftsman tool line and Part Direct store. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside, however, is that the site does not provide  
independent ranking of products, relying instead on side-by-side 
comparisons. Customers who buy online also must pay the applicable 
state sales tax, a federal requirement other online sites do not 
have because the retailer operates in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears' site is four times the size of the next largest  
competitor, ValueAmerica.com, and the retailer hopes to use its 
national presence to offer delivery within 24 to 48 hours of an 
online sale, although in some cases it may take three to seven 
days, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential for profit is enormous. Forrester Research Inc. of  
Cambridge, Mass., estimates that by the year 2003, 6 percent of all 
appliances will be sold online. And the market for such big-ticket 
items will be $38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have expressed skepticism that Sears will see a  
large increase in incremental sales from Internet shopping for 
big-ticket items because many consumers like to examine the product 
in person. 
</P>
<P>
	But Peterson said focus group studies and other research of its  
earlier offerings found many consumers want to do preliminary 
fact-finding on a big-ticket item before going into the store to be 
bothered by sales staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that many more purchases currently are influenced by  
the Internet than are actually consummated,'' she said. ``But this 
gives consumers the choices they want and helps bring them into our 
stores to open the doors and turn the knobs on their final 
selections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An in-house study also found that Sears customers who did buy  
off the Internet made 27 percent more purchases in-store over the 
ensuing six-month period than customers who did not, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That could prove beneficial to the Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based  
company. Sears sales have been bolstered recently by continued 
strong sales of big-ticket items and interest income from its 
store-owned credit card, while sales of clothing have lagged in the 
face of stiff competition from specialty retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears is hoping to revitalize sluggish sales at its department  
stores with new lines of clothing and in-store displays aimed at 
younger audiences, price cuts of up to 15 percent on certain 
clothes, the introduction of dinnerware, flatware, gardening and 
other housewares and new credit card promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer also hopes to begin offering online electronics and  
other items in coming months, executives said.

<HEADLINE> UCSD Athletics Director Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Judy Sweet, the first woman president of the  
NCAA, resigned Wednesday as athletics director at the University of 
California, San Diego after 24 years to return to a full-time 
faculty position. 
</P>
<P>
	A trailblazer in college athletics, Sweet was one of the first  
women to direct a combined men's and women's program when she 
became athletic director at California-San Diego in 1975. UCSD won 
24 national championships, 31 runner-up trophies and had 30 
third-place finishes in the Division III. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly grateful for the privilege to have served as UCSD  
director of athletics for 24 years, and the opportunity to be a 
part of the tremendous growth and success that the athletics 
program has experienced,'' Sweet said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweet's resignation will be effective June 30, when she will  
return to full-time teaching at the La Jolla campus. The university 
planned to launch a national search for an athletics director 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweets is a 1969 graduate of Wisconsin who earned a master's  
degree from Arizona in 1972. In 1973, she joined UCSD, where she 
was women's badminton coach and assistant athletic director before 
getting the top job. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1983, just three years after the bitterly divided NCAA  
membership voted to make room for women's sports and women 
administrators, she was named to the policy-making NCAA Council. 
She was in line by 1988 for the post of secretary-treasurer, the 
highest NCAA office any woman had attained. 
</P>
<P>
	She completed her two-year term as NCAA president in 1993. A  
year later, she was one of four finalists for the post of executive 
director of the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a part of the most eventful era of change in college  
sports history. During her tenure as NCAA president, NCAA schools 
tightened academic requirements and loosened time demands for 
athletes, reduced coaching staffs and trimmed back scholarships 
limits.

<HEADLINE> Reps. Seek Backing for Kosovo Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan group of 11 House members sought  
congressional support today for a separate Kosovo peace plan they 
negotiated with Russian legislators. The administration denounced 
the effort as ``uncoordinated free-lance'' diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't take this opportunity, we're going to continue to  
drive the Russians away from us,'' Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., leader 
of the group that met with Russian Duma members, told the House 
International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel is considering a nonbinding resolution to support the  
group's blueprint for peace -- one that parallels most NATO demands 
but also would give Russia and China a say in the composition of a 
peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, senior Democrat on the  
committee, denounced the initiative as bad policy, one that would 
put Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ``in a straitjacket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiating is ``an executive function,'' Gejdenson said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Democrats and Republicans had done this during the Gulf  
War, there would have been charges of treason,'' Gejdenson said. 
Federal law prohibits private citizens from negotiating with 
foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Gejdenson's ``treason'' remarks brought angry responses from  
committee Republicans and one Democratic member of the delegation 
that met with the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a `gentlewoman.' If anyone thinks I was involved in  
treason, I would ask them to step outside,'' said Rep. Corrine 
Brown, D-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department voiced opposition to congressional  
consideration of the resolution, even a nonbinding one. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared remarks, Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering  
called the initiative ``uncoordinated free-lance efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hearing came as the rift in U.S.-Russian relations  
caused by the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, now complicated by 
political turmoil in Moscow, raising fresh questions about 
long-term cooperation between Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious that all is not well in the U.S.-Russian  
relationship -- or American foreign policy towards Russia,'' Rep. 
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the committee, said earlier 
after Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed yet another prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Roscoe Bartlett, R-Md., one of the 11 House members trying  
to broker a separate peace deal on Kosovo, said the administration 
was wrong in ``tying its planning only to Yeltsin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are making a big mistake, because Yeltsin is not Russia's  
future. He'll be lucky if he holds on to the next election,'' said 
Bartlett. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal contains many features sought by NATO, including  
withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and an armed international 
peacekeeping presence. But a main difference is that it leaves the 
composition of the peacekeeping force up to the five permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council -- on which Russia and China 
sit and hold a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Both nations have insisted on a first-step end to the bombing.  
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin named a close ally, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin,  
as acting prime minister. The upheaval sharpened Yeltsin's 
collision course with the parliament and threatened to disrupt the 
Kosovo peace process, political stability and efforts at economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior State Department adviser Steven R. Sestanovich said  
Wednesday that he did not anticipate the upheaval would affect the 
status of Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy to Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sestanovich said it was still ``rather hard to tell'' the  
consequences of the sacking of Primakov. If Yeltsin's choice is 
approved, that could strengthen Yeltsin's mandate, Sestanovich 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Stepashin was someone the United States could work with.  
However, his appointment as Primakov's permanent replacement 
appeared to have little chance of approval in the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	Sestanovich suggested the move was a ploy by Yeltsin to detract  
attention from next week's impeachment vote by the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright met the Weldon delegation Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our agreement was not meant to constrain a negotiation but to  
permit an agreement,'' Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee, called it ``far-fetched to think that 
members of our House are trying to negotiate peace for Kosovo with 
the Duma while the Duma is trying to impeach Yeltsin.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Agrees on $11.7B for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-Senate negotiators want to give  
President Clinton nearly twice the money he wants for the 
bombardment of Yugoslavia, but the package has grown into a 
hodgepodge of provisions dealing with tobacco, steel and other 
issues that is raising doubts about its immediate fate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargainers from the two chambers expected to meet again today  
amid fading hopes of striking a compromise bill, whipping it 
through Congress and shipping it to Clinton for his signature by 
week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers agreed to spend $11.7 billion for  
the fighting over Kosovo, the refugees and Balkan states that have 
accepted them, and to strengthen a slew of Pentagon programs, 
dwarfing the $6 billion Clinton requested. That is the biggest 
chunk of the bill, and the item with the strongest political 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also contains nearly $1 billion he sought to help  
Honduras and other Central American countries rebuild from last 
fall's Hurricane Mitch, plus $566 million to aid U.S. farmers 
struggling from low commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the time an often surly bargaining session ended just  
before 1 a.m., the bill's price tag had surged toward $15 billion 
and confusion reigned. Lawmakers added tobacco language opposed by 
the administration, a new loan program for smaller steel companies 
unpopular with conservatives, and still faced questions about how 
parts of the package would be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,  
said he did not know what would happen next beyond a meeting of GOP 
leaders ``to figure out what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sure it's in trouble,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, top  
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ``It's a mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an earlier veto threat from White House officials, the  
bargainers approved a provision by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
R-Texas, that would bar the federal government from laying claim to 
any of the $246 billion from settlements that states have reached 
with the tobacco industry. Clinton planned to billions of those 
funds for federal programs, but governors -- backed by many members 
of Congress -- want to keep it for the states. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't veto,'' predicted Hutchison in an interview, saying  
it would jeopardize ``money for troops in Kosovo doing his 
mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci chided  
Congress for ``trying to take advantage of emergency needs in 
Kosovo and Central America by loading up this bill with everybody's 
pet projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added, ``We've warned them not to load up this legislation''  
with unnecessary provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Another complication was the bargainers' acceptance of a  
provision by Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, top Democrat from 
the Senate appropriations panel, for $140 million that would back 
$1 billion in loans for small steel producers hurt by low-price 
imports. The provision is sure to prove unpopular with 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators rejected a similar proposal by Sen. Pete Domenici,  
R-N.M., for $125 million to create a $500 million loan program for 
oil and gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also has $100 million for Jordan and $900 million  
for the costs of recent tornadoes in the Midwest and for a cushion 
for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	In other decisions,  
</P>
<P>
	--Kansas GOP Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam Brownback lost an effort  
to forgive more than $200 million in interest and penalties owed by 
the state's natural gas producers ruled to have overcharged 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stevens and Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, accepted a  
compromise involving fishing restrictions in parts of their state's 
Glacier Bay National Park and a $26 million buyout for fish 
processors and others. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bargainers dropped a provision by Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., for  
up to $40 million for families of the victims of a 1998 accident in 
which a Marine jet sent an Italian ski gondola crashing down a 
mountainside, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	To Clinton's $6 billion defense request, funds lawmakers added  
included $1.8 billion for a troop pay raise that would begin in 
January; $819 million to help Kosovo's refugees and Baltic states 
bordering Yugoslavia; $475 million to modernize overseas military 
bases to $475 million; and $200 million for the Coast Guard.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Matthews Agrees to Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- At 37, Bruce Matthews isn't thinking  
about retirement. Neither are the Tennessee Titans, who signed the 
16-year veteran offensive lineman to a four-year contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I finish this contract, I'd be very impressed,'' Matthews  
said. ``I guess the natural thing is to think about retirement, 
because obviously it's going to happen. But I still enjoy it. I get 
excited for the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews has spent his entire career with the franchise and has  
never missed a game due to injury. He became an unrestricted free 
agent at the end of last season, but indicated a desire to stay 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted him badly to finish his career here,'' Titans  
general manager Floyd Reese said. ``In this world of unrestricted 
free agency, it may never happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, who doesn't have an agent, negotiated directly with  
the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce has been in the league long enough to understand what  
the numbers are, and where he fits,'' Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews ranks 11th on the NFL's career games list with 248 and  
can pass Jackie Slater this season for the most games played by an 
offensive lineman (259). He has started 244 games playing all five 
offensive line positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Durability is in the Matthews family genes. His brother, Clay,  
played 19 seasons and 278 games with the Cleveland Browns and 
Atlanta Falcons. His father, Clay Sr., played four seasons with the 
San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 305-pound Matthews played left guard last season,  
but will move to center because of the loss of Mark Stepnoski, who 
signed with Dallas in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it,'' Matthews said. ``You eliminate  
a lot of the collisions, 'cause you're not pulling and doing some 
of the things you have to do at guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans are coming off a third straight 8-8 season, but  
Matthews believes the team is close to being a championship 
contender. He noted that Atlanta went to the Super Bowl last year, 
one season after his brother retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to hang around long enough that this thing will have  
to go to the Super Bowl,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuser Passed Lie Detector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kathleen Willey says she's prepared to testify  
again if her one-time friend Julie Hiatt Steele is retried for 
obstructing the investigation of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly unsealed results of two FBI polygraph examinations of Mrs.  
Willey show she failed a question on the first test regarding 
whether she provided details of an alleged sexual advance by 
Clinton to her friend Ms. Steele. She passed a later test in which 
she alleged that advance took place. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey explained to the polygraph examiner last year that  
at first she couldn't recall when she told Ms. Steele of the 
alleged 1993 incident with Clinton, but was reminded of it later by 
Ms. Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second lie detector test six days after the first one, Mrs.  
Willey was found to be truthful after answering ``yes'' to two 
questions: ``Before 1997 did you tell Julie Steele that the 
president came on to you?'' and ``In 1993 did you tell Julie Steele 
about an encounter with the president in his office?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele says the first time she'd heard of an alleged  
Clinton-Willey encounter was when Mrs. Willey asked her to lie 
about it to Newsweek magazine in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey was the chief prosecution witness for Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr's office in last week's obstruction trial of 
Ms. Steele for allegedly lying to two grand juries and the FBI in 
Starr's investigation of Clinton, who denies any sexual encounter 
with Mrs. Willey. The jury deadlocked in Ms. Steele's trial in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr is considering whether to seek a new trial and has filed a  
court motion asking for permission to approach jurors who are 
willing to be interviewed by prosecutors about how they reached 
their views on Ms. Steele's guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see (the case) retried,'' Mrs. Willey said  
Wednesday night on CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' Of her testimony last 
week, Mrs. Willey said, ``I've done it once. I guess I could do it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Ms. Steele, Mrs. Willey said, ``I think she did try to  
obstruct justice'' by telling Starr's investigators a story that 
contradicted part of Mrs. Willey's account. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton unsealed the 1998 lie detector  
results this week after a federal appeals court directed him to 
reconsider an earlier denial. News organizations, including The 
Associated Press, went to court to challenge the secrecy 
surrounding the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	On another part of the polygraph examinations in which she said  
Clinton made a sexual advance, Mrs. Willey initially tested 
``inconclusive'' but in the second test was found to be truthful. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second test last Sept. 15 in the FBI's Washington field  
office, Mrs. Willey was asked, ``In November 1993 did the president 
place his hand on your breast?'' and ``Did President Clinton place 
your hand on his groin?'' Both times, Mrs. Willey answered ``yes,'' 
a three-page FBI summary of the test results stated. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the opinion of this examiner that Ms. Willey was  
truthful'' when responding to those two questions, the summary 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The polygraph questions did not address whether Clinton's  
alleged advance against Mrs. Willey was unwanted. Mrs. Willey says 
she rebuffed him.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Help Bells Onto Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local phone companies would be freed from some  
regulations as an incentive to offer high-speed Internet services 
more widely under a Senate bill offered Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would help local phone  
providers such as the Baby Bells and GTE better compete against 
AT&AMP;T, which is positioned to be a major provider of high-speed 
Internet services via cable TV lines and cable modems. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, local phone companies wouldn't be required to  
provide deep discounts to other companies that lease a big volume 
of high-speed telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T can roll out cable modem service in a virtually  
regulation-free environment; federal regulation impedes the ability 
of telephone companies to do the same thing,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Navajos Claim Sweeping Jurisdiction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In a case that could test the legitimacy of  
tribal courts throughout the country, the Navajo Supreme Court 
ruled it has criminal jurisdiction over all Indians on the 
reservation regardless of whether they are Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has drawn national attention for the legal questions it  
raises about tribal sovereignty and because it involves Russell 
Means, the former leader of the American Indian Movement who led a 
1973 uprising at Wounded Knee, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every tribe is going to take a careful look at this,'' said  
Robert Williams, professor of law and American Indian studies at 
the University of Arizona. ``The stakes are very big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means was charged in a Navajo court in December 1997 with  
beating his father-in-law. Means, an Oglala Sioux, said he should 
not be prosecuted by another tribe and challenged the 1991 federal 
law passed authorizing tribal courts to try Indians from other 
tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the Navajo Supreme Court cited a 1977  
U.S. Supreme Court decision that defined ``Indian'' as a political 
rather than a racial category. 
</P>
<P>
	The court also pointed out that Means married a Navajo woman,  
lived on the reservation and conducted business there -- all 
evidence, it said, that he should be subject to the Navajo judicial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Means contended that the 1991 law is discriminatory because it  
says non-Indian defendants are not subject to tribal courts, but 
does not make a distinction for Indians who aren't members of the 
ruling tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't any rights on any reservation in America except my  
own, so I want to be treated like any other American,'' Means said 
Thursday from his home in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Means, 59, who has appeared in such films as ``Natural Born  
Killers'' and ``The Last of the Mohicans,'' plans to appeal the 
Navajo court's decision in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Navajo prosecutor Donovan D. Brown was traveling on Thursday and  
didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE>  Bill Walton a Broadcaster in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	During his playing days, Bill Walton rarely spoke to reporters,  
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Just try to stop him now.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer and NBC analyst, who missed more than nine of  
his 14 NBA seasons due to countless injuries, seems to be making up 
for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton worked two games for NBC last weekend and will do two  
more this weekend. In between, there are speaking engagements, 
charity events, a couple of hours a day with MSNBC's online site, 
and a temporary playoff gig with Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the best things about broadcasting is that I'm able to  
work every day,'' Walton said. ``My legs weren't durable enough to 
play every day, but hopefully my voice will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when the 7-foot redhead avoided talking because  
of a severe stuttering problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at age 29, he was taught how to speak properly by New York  
broadcaster Marty Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tried to have a good working relationship with the  
media, but I was just so painfully shy and unable to speak,'' 
Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Walton accepted Turner's offer to do playoff games  
was the possibility that he'd be able to work with Marv Albert 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert and Walton were two-thirds of the NBC team that called  
the NBA Finals for three consecutive seasons from 1995-97, along 
with Matt Goukas. Thanks to the teamwork of NBC and Turner, they 
were reunited this week for the Bucks-Pacers series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really glad that NBC let Bill work at Turner,'' Albert  
said. ``It's very unusual that things like this happen, but the 
whole climate of TV has changed with people working for different 
networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton had his 30th operation nine years ago. He can't run -- and  
isn't even able to play his sons in a pickup game. But when he was 
doing the Indiana game last week, Pacers coach and former teammate 
Larry Bird somehow got the big man in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was still trying to block his shot,'' Walton said. ``I never  
could even when I was healthy. I'm a very slow learner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton has realized that you can't change the past and he's  
happy being able to stay around the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having the time of my life and I'm doing all these games  
because this is a dream for me,'' he said. ``I am so amazed at how 
much broadcasting is like playing. The only difference is that I 
don't need an operation after every game.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC has rubbed out the critically acclaimed but  
low-rated ``Homicide: Life on the Street.'' It won't be on NBC's 
fall schedule, the network announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Homicide's'' seventh-season finale, airing May 21, will be its  
last new episode. 
</P>
<P>
	From its premiere in January 1993, the series, about a squad of  
Baltimore homicide detectives, was never a ratings winner and 
fought for its life year after year. Airing Friday at 10 p.m. EDT, 
it has clung in recent seasons to third place behind ABC's 
``20/20'' and CBS' cop drama ``Nash Bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won numerous honors, including three Peabody Awards, the most  
recent of them last year for an episode about a commuter pushed 
beneath a subway train. 
</P>
<P>
	Its evolving cast has featured Ned Beatty, Andre Braugher and  
Daniel Baldwin and currently includes Richard Belzer, Clark Johnson 
and Kyle Secor. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmed on location in Baltimore, the series wrapped for the  
season in March with cast and crew uncertain about their future. 
</P>
<P>
	Official word of the cancellation is expected Monday, when NBC  
announces its fall schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, NBC Entertainment president Garth Ancier thanked  
``Homicide'' executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana and 
``their extremely talented cast and crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cast member Yaphet Kotto, who lives in Baltimore, said he was  
saddened but not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been literally emotional, crying in the streets  
and in the stores,'' he told WBAL-TV in Baltimore. ``This is a very 
emotional thing with people who are fans of `Homicide.'''

<HEADLINE>  Bill Walton a Broadcaster in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	During his playing days, Bill Walton rarely spoke to reporters,  
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Just try to stop him now.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer and NBC analyst, who missed more than nine of  
his 14 NBA seasons due to countless injuries, seems to be making up 
for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton worked two games for NBC last weekend and will do two  
more this weekend. In between, there are speaking engagements, 
charity events, a couple of hours a day with MSNBC's online site, 
and a temporary playoff gig with Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the best things about broadcasting is that I'm able to  
work every day,'' Walton said. ``My legs weren't durable enough to 
play every day, but hopefully my voice will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when the 7-foot redhead avoided talking because  
of a severe stuttering problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at age 29, he was taught how to speak properly by New York  
broadcaster Marty Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tried to have a good working relationship with the  
media, but I was just so painfully shy and unable to speak,'' 
Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Walton accepted Turner's offer to do playoff games  
was the possibility that he'd be able to work with Marv Albert 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert and Walton were two-thirds of the NBC team that called  
the NBA Finals for three consecutive seasons from 1995-97, along 
with Matt Goukas. Thanks to the teamwork of NBC and Turner, they 
were reunited this week for the Bucks-Pacers series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really glad that NBC let Bill work at Turner,'' Albert  
said. ``It's very unusual that things like this happen, but the 
whole climate of TV has changed with people working for different 
networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton had his 30th operation nine years ago. He can't run -- and  
isn't even able to play his sons in a pickup game. But when he was 
doing the Indiana game last week, Pacers coach and former teammate 
Larry Bird somehow got the big man in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was still trying to block his shot,'' Walton said. ``I never  
could even when I was healthy. I'm a very slow learner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton has realized that you can't change the past and he's  
happy being able to stay around the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having the time of my life and I'm doing all these games  
because this is a dream for me,'' he said. ``I am so amazed at how 
much broadcasting is like playing. The only difference is that I 
don't need an operation after every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE BIG SHOW:* Finally, ``Sports Night'' creator Aaron Sorkin

<HEADLINE> Flyers Defenseman Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Eric  
Desjardins had surgery Thursday to repair a knee injury, and 
doctors say he should recover in time to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Art Batolozzi said ``everything went smoothly'' in the  
surgery at Pennsylvania Hospital to repair a partial tear of the 
anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee. Desjardins suffered 
the ACL injury and a bone bruise after hyperextending his knee 
during the Flyers' victory over the Detroit Red Wings on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect he'll have a rapid recovery, certainly in time for --  
hopefully in time for -- the season this coming year,'' Batolozzi 
said. ``We expect he'll be back in three to four months ready to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Desjardins said the injured knee was ``painful right now, but  
you know it's good to know -- it's always good to know -- that it's 
fixed and I'll be 100 percent next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Desjardins returned to play in April and had a team-high four  
points in a first-round playoff series with Toronto. Overall last 
season, he played in 68 games and scored 15 goals, including two 
game-winners and six on power plays.

<HEADLINE>  Golf Great Gene Sarazen Dies at 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Like the sand wedge he invented, the major championships he won  
and the elegant sportsmanship he displayed, Gene Sarazen was the 
very essence of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you discuss or research the history of golf, the name  
Gene Sarazen is unavoidable,'' Jack Nicklaus said. ``He was the 
cornerstone of the game we all enjoy today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen died Thursday at age 97 from complications of pneumonia  
at Naples (Fla.) Community Hospital, said his lawyer, John 
Cardillo. He had been hospitalized for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was Sarazen the first to win all four major  
championships, he put the Masters on the map with his ``shot heard 
'round the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered for as long as golf is played,'' Byron  
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	With his signature knickers and quick wit, the ``Squire'' played  
everyone from Harry Vardon to Bobby Jones to Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	A former caddie, Sarazen was inspired by watching Francis Ouimet  
win the 1913 U.S. Open. Nine years later, Sarazen won the U.S. Open 
with a final-round 68 to defeat Jones and Walter Hagen, then won 
the PGA Championship later that season at Oakmont. He beat Hagen in 
the PGA in 1923 and won seven major championships in all. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sarazen's career was defined in 1935 at a new course in  
Georgia where Jones invited his friends to compete in the Augusta 
National Invitation Tournament -- later known as the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes with four holes remaining,  
Sarazen holed a 235-yarder with a 4-wood on No. 15 for a 
double-eagle 2, the rarest shot in golf. He tied Wood in regulation 
and beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made Sarazen the first of only four players to win  
the career Grand Slam. And with one shot, he made the Masters 
perhaps the most famous tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about, but  
I take my greatest pride in having won the U.S. and British Opens 
in the same year, 1932,'' Sarazen once said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, `That's the man who got  
the double eagle.' Actually, it was just a piece of luck. They 
forget the championships I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought about Tiger Woods winning the Masters at  
age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped playing golf in 1973, but went out in fashion with a  
hole-in-one at the famous Postage Stamp hole at Royal Troon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has lost one of its great heroes,'' PGA Tour  
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``Gene Sarazen dedicated his life to 
golf and became one of the game's legendary figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1981, Sarazen has joined Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a  
ceremonial tee shot to officially start the Masters. He hit his 
drive this year about 140 yards down the left side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene was a pioneer participant in the Masters tournament and  
held a special relationship with Augusta National,'' club chairman 
Hootie Johnson said. ``We will miss him very much next year on the 
first tee. He was a great champion and ambassador for golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mark O'Meara returned to Augusta National this spring as  
the defending champion, he saw his name on the same locker with 
Sarazen in the Champions Room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was the greatest thing,'' O'Meara said. ``He  
was class personified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, Ben 
Hogan, Nicklaus and Gary Player won all four majors at least once 
in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. Jones called Sarazen's late charge, ``the finest 
competitive round ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open at the Prince's course in  
England was made possible by another Sarazen legacy -- the sand 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invented it in 1931 and I showed it at the British Open in  
1932,'' Sarazen said in a 1997 interview. ``I had it hidden because 
I was afraid they were going to ban it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's found in every player's bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``It probably should have been called the Sarazen wedge,''  
Arnold Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenio Saraceni was born Feb. 27, 1902, in Harrison, N.Y., near  
New York City, the son of an Italian immigrant carpenter who never 
understood golf and saw his son play only once -- at the PGA 
Championship in Pelham, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said his father watched from a highway while he played  
the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a 40-foot putt and missed it,'' Sarazen recalled in an  
interview last year. ``That night he said, `You mean to say they 
pay you fellows to play that game and you couldn't put that thing 
in the hole?' I said, `Did you ever try it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen starting caddying as an 8-year-old, walking four miles  
to the nearest club and playing whenever he could. He set his 
sights on becoming a professional, against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, only brokers and bankers played golf,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first tournament and $20. He made a hole-in-one, and  
the next day his name was in the papers. He hated it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked too much like a violin player. I changed it to Gene  
Sarazen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen nearly died during a flu epidemic in 1918. After  
recovering, he bought a $15 steamship ticket from New York to 
Florida and settled in Sebring, where he unloaded brick in a 
freight yard while polishing his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said there was an easy explanation for why he remained a  
good player for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots  
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years 
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the PGA Tour established its Lifetime Achievement Award in  
1996, Sarazen was its first recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen lived the last years of his life on Marco Island, Fla.  
His wife of 62 years -- Mary Catherine -- died in 1986. He is 
survived by two children, Mary Ann, of Marco Island, and Gene Jr., 
of Delray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral Mass will be held at the San Marco Roman Catholic  
Church in Marco Island at 10 a.m. Monday.

	Yeltsin Impeachment Hearings Begin  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Parliament began impeachment hearings today  
against President Boris Yeltsin, a day after he plunged the nation 
into a political crisis by dismissing Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's 
popular prime minister and his Cabinet. The hearings began with 
lawmakers reading out reports on the five impeachment charges 
Yeltsin is facing: instigating the 1991 Soviet collapse, improperly 
using force against hard-line lawmakers in 1993, launching the 
botched 1994-96 war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's military and 
waging genocide against Russians with economic policies that 
impoverished the country.

	TOKYO (AP) -- U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is  
optimistic that China can enter the World Trade Organization this 
year, depite the furor in Beijing over NATO's bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia. Barshefsky said bringing China into 
the world's leading trade organizations would be an important step 
in moving the country toward international norms, including the 
rule of law. ``We must continue to engage China (despite) whatever 
difficulties, whatever setbacks there are, and bring it toward the 
global community,'' Barshefsky said today in a speech at the Tokyo 
American Center.

	British Agents Named on Web Site  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Britain was trying today to shut down a U.S.-based  
Internet site that has published information about alleged British 
spies. Britain's Foreign Office asked newspaper editors Wednesday 
not to publish details from a World Wide Web site that claimed to 
reveal the names of British Secret Intelligence Service officers. 
Publishing such details ``could put lives at risk,'' said Rear Adm. 
David Pulvertaft, secretary of the Defense, Press and Broadcasting 
Advisory Committee, which advises media on issues of national 
security. The information about as many as 115 officers from the 
Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, has sparked fears 
about their safety.

	Folic Acid Deficiency Improves  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Folic acid deficiency has practically disappeared  
in the United States since the government last year ordered food 
manufacturers to add the vitamin to flour, rice and other grain 
products, researchers reported today. Folic acid is found naturally 
in green leafy vegetables and some other foods. If women eat too 
little of it when they become pregnant, they risk having babies 
with spina bifida and other neural tube defects. The latest study, 
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the first major 
effort to see what effect the government's requirement that 
manufacturers fortify foods with folic acid.

inning that lifted the Dodgers to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago 
Cubs last night. The Cubs took a 2-1 lead into the ninth, but Todd 
Hundley led off with his fifth homer, hitting a pitch from Beck 
into the right-field seats. Beck blew a save opportunity for the 
fourth time in 11 chances. Rookie Jamie Arnold, who blanked the 
Cubs in the top of the ninth, earned the victory.

everyone from Harry Vardon to Bobby Jones to Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	A former caddie, Sarazen was inspired by watching Francis Ouimet  
win the 1913 U.S. Open. Nine years later, Sarazen won the U.S. Open 
with a final-round 68 to defeat Jones and Walter Hagen, then won 
the PGA Championship later that season at Oakmont. He beat Hagen in 
the PGA in 1923 and won seven major championships in all. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sarazen's career was defined in 1935 at a new course in  
Georgia where Jones invited his friends to compete in the Augusta 
National Invitation Tournament -- later known as the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes with four holes remaining,  
Sarazen holed a 235-yarder with a 4-wood on No. 15 for a 
double-eagle 2, the rarest shot in golf. He tied Wood in regulation 
and beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made Sarazen the first of only four players to win  
the career Grand Slam. And with one shot, he made the Masters 
perhaps the most famous tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about, but  
I take my greatest pride in having won the U.S. and British Opens 
in the same year, 1932,'' Sarazen once said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, `That's the man who got  
the double eagle.' Actually, it was just a piece of luck. They 
forget the championships I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought about Tiger Woods winning the Masters at  
age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped playing golf in 1973, but went out in fashion with a  
hole-in-one at the famous Postage Stamp hole at Royal Troon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has lost one of its great heroes,'' PGA Tour  
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``Gene Sarazen dedicated his life to 
golf and became one of the game's legendary figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1981, Sarazen has joined Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a  
ceremonial tee shot to officially start the Masters. He hit his 
drive this year about 140 yards down the left side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene was a pioneer participant in the Masters tournament and  
held a special relationship with Augusta National,'' club chairman 
Hootie Johnson said. ``We will miss him very much next year on the 
first tee. He was a great champion and ambassador for golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mark O'Meara returned to Augusta National this spring as  
the defending champion, he saw his name on the same locker with 
Sarazen in the Champions Room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was the greatest thing,'' O'Meara said. ``He  
was class personified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, Ben 
Hogan, Nicklaus and Gary Player won all four majors at least once 
in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. Jones called Sarazen's late charge, ``the finest 
competitive round ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open at the Prince's course in  
England was made possible by another Sarazen legacy -- the sand 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invented it in 1931 and I showed it at the British Open in  
1932,'' Sarazen said in a 1997 interview. ``I had it hidden because 
I was afraid they were going to ban it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's found in every player's bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``It probably should have been called the Sarazen wedge,''  
Arnold Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenio Saraceni was born Feb. 27, 1902, in Harrison, N.Y., near  
New York City, the son of an Italian immigrant carpenter who never 
understood golf and saw his son play only once -- at the PGA 
Championship in Pelham, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said his father watched from a highway while he played  
the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a 40-foot putt and missed it,'' Sarazen recalled in an  
interview last year. ``That night he said, `You mean to say they 
pay you fellows to play that game and you couldn't put that thing 
in the hole?' I said, `Did you ever try it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen starting caddying as an 8-year-old, walking four miles  
to the nearest club and playing whenever he could. He set his 
sights on becoming a professional, against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, only brokers and bankers played golf,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first tournament and $20. He made a hole-in-one, and  
the next day his name was in the papers. He hated it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked too much like a violin player. I changed it to Gene  
Sarazen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen nearly died during a flu epidemic in 1918. After  
recovering, he bought a $15 steamship ticket from New York to 
Florida and settled in Sebring, where he unloaded brick in a 
freight yard while polishing his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said there was an easy explanation for why he remained a  
good player for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots  
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years 
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the PGA Tour established its Lifetime Achievement Award in  
1996, Sarazen was its first recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen lived the last years of his life on Marco Island, Fla.  
His wife of 62 years -- Mary Catherine -- died in 1986. He is 
survived by two children, Mary Ann, of Marco Island, and Gene Jr., 
of Delray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral Mass will be held at the San Marco Roman Catholic  
Church in Marco Island at 10 a.m. Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Jacobs Puts Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- For sale: The best team in baseball. Makes  
profit. Comes with friendly confines, pennant flags. Quality of 
buyer as important as price. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned the city, Richard Jacobs put his  
Cleveland Indians on the market Thursday, hoping to find someone 
willing to keep the team in town and its reputation intact as one 
of baseball's hottest properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, 'Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the laughingstock team with his late 
brother, David, for $45 million in 1986, said he decided a few 
weeks ago it was the right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved NFL franchise to Baltimore. Only now is the sports-crazed 
city recovering from that as it welcomes back the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his news conference at the ballpark that bears his  
name, Jacobs sought to reassure Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. We  
have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to move 
a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said he would explain the situation to the  
players before they left Thursday night on a road trip. He did not 
think the announcement would distract the team from its goal of 
trying to win its first World Series title since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will keep going on because that is our jobs,'' Hargrove  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is in first place in the AL Central by 6 1/2 games with  
the best record in baseball at 24-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, we still have a job to do on the field,'' Indians  
first baseman Jim Thome said Thursday night, as the players 
prepared to travel to a weekend series in Detroit. ``I don't see 
this as some big thing, as, `How are the Indians going to play now 
that Dick Jacobs is leaving?' We still have to go get the job 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cleveland-area candidates were among the bidders for the  
new Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off-guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother, Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was certainly very interested to learn about his  
decision, it is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective 
buyer,'' Larry Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturer Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with Jacobs  
in a Browns bid, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were eventually purchased for $530 million by  
billionaire suburban Cleveland banker Al Lerner. The Browns 
organization issued a statement that the NFL team's officials 
``will continue to be strong supporters of the Indians. We have 
great respect for Dick Jacobs and his judgment and we are sure that 
he will make the right decision for the Cleveland community and the 
Indians fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York developer Howard Milstein, another would-be Browns and  
Redskins buyer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers for the 99-year-old franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said his decision was not prompted by any health or  
financial problems. But before his health becomes a concern, Jacobs 
wants to be assured his beloved Indians would be in the right 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the price for major sports teams skyrocketing -- the  
Redskins' price tag, pending NFL approval, is $800 million -- Jacobs 
understands that now may be the perfect time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers sold last year to Rupert Murdoch's Fox  
Group for $350 million. That deal included real estate in Los 
Angeles, Vero Beach, Fla., and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock closed Wednesday at $9.94 but soared to $16.25  
by the end of Thursday on the strength of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who made his fortune in real estate, has kept a  
low-profile as owner, deferring to general manager John Hart. Like 
everyone else, Hart was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised, and I think the first feeling I had was a  
little sad about it,'' he said. ``It took me a little time to come 
to grips with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before their recent prosperity, which includes four straight AL  
Central titles and two trips to the World Series since 1995, the 
Indians had seven straight losing seasons (1987-93) with Jacobs as 
their owner. 
</P>
<P>
	In those years, the Indians played in decrepit Cleveland  
Stadium, sometimes drawing just a few hundred fans. Jacobs moved 
the team into state-of-the-art Jacobs Field in 1994 -- the high 
point of his ownership, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if this is his last season, Jacobs, who has missed just  
five home games in his tenure, said he would still come to the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could sit in the bleachers, maybe,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fortier Appeals Okla. Bomb Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Michael Fortier's lawyer told a federal appeals  
court Thursday that Fortier's 12-year prison sentence should be 
reduced because there is no evidence that money he raised helped 
pay for the Oklahoma City bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities to  
the 1995 bomb plot, which killed 168 people and injured 500 others. 
He testified against Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and admitted 
helping McVeigh sell stolen weapons and lying to FBI agents after 
the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Michael McGuire told the 10th U.S. Circuit  
Court of Appeals that McVeigh and Nichols never told Fortier how 
they planned to use the money raised from selling the weapons at 
gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no agreement or condition or anything,'' he told the  
three-judge panel, noting that the bombing occurred five months 
after Fortier gave McVeigh and Nichols thousands of dollars. ``It 
all happened too far after the fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Sean Connelly said Fortier still bears some  
responsibility for the bombing. He said Fortier's cooperation with 
investigators and his lesser role have already earned him a less 
severe sentence than McVeigh and Nichols. McVeigh received the 
death penalty, Nichols a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Connelly said McVeigh drove Fortier past the federal building on  
a trip to pick up stolen guns and told him: ``That's my target.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge John Porfilio suggested the drive-by was warning  
enough about the conspiracy. ``That doesn't sound innocent to me,'' 
Porfilio said. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling is not expected for several months.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Conyers Raise Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton continued thanking his  
impeachment defenders Thursday at an appearance at a fund-raiser in 
honor of Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the 
House Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the fact that in standing up for me last year, he  
stood up for the Constitution of the United States,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, celebrating Conyers' 70th birthday, raised $225,000  
for the ``Conyers for Congress'' committee. Clinton also thanked 
Conyers for supporting his economic policies, fighting for human 
rights abroad and civil rights at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was careful to express contrition and avoid gloating  
after his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. But he began 
to publicly show his gratitude to his defenders in March, when he 
appeared at events honoring Democratic Rep. Max Sandlin of Texas 
and former Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas.

</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Eqbal Ahmad, an anti-war scholar once  
accused of plotting to kidnap former U.S. Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger, died Tuesday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	A professor and founding member of the Institute for Policy  
Studies in Washington D.C., Ahmad returned to his home in Pakistan 
after retiring two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A fierce opponent of U.S. Involvement in the Vietnam War, Ahmad  
was among seven people accused of plotting to kidnap Kissinger and 
to blow up underground heating tunnels to federal offices in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the Harrisburg Seven, their 1971 trial ended in a hung  
jury when prosecutors withdrew some charges and the rest were 
thrown out on appeal. 
</P>

	Ahmad later helped found the Institute for Policy Studies and  
the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam. He retired two years ago 
from teaching at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass.

<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Writer Herbert M. Baus, campaign  
manager and adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and other 
California politicians, died of Parkinson's disease May 6. He was 
85. 
</P>
<P>
	Baus' Los Angeles campaigning firm, Baus &AMP; Ross, was formed  
after World War II and used then-pioneering techniques of voter 
polling and direct mail advertising. He was a proponent of several 
California ballot initiatives including establishing daylight 
savings time in California. 
</P>
<P>
	His roster of California political heavyweights included Los  
Angeles County Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess and Gov. Edmund G. ``Pat'' 
Brown Sr. Although Baus retired from Baus &AMP; Ross in 1968, he 
continued as a consultant and a campaign supporter for Nixon in 
U.S. Senate, vice presidential and presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1974, Baus told Nixon: ``The time has come for you  
to bow out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baus also took his pleas for resignation to newspaper opinion  
pages, writing to Nixon in the Los Angeles Times: ``The paramount 
issue has become whether the country will be ripped apart by your 
impeachment for a colony of crimes that have become linked to your 
office -- or whether you will go away, quietly. Given the sorry 
circumstances, my advice -- and I speak as an old ally -- is that you 
should resign, for the good of yourself, your party and your 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also an author, Baus' books included ``Politics Battle Plan,''  
written with business partner William B. Ross; ``Wine Your Way to 
Health'' (1973); and the ``Master Crossword Puzzle Dictionary'' in 
(1981).

<P>
	He was business editor of Chicago Today when it folded in 1974

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert Keane, a longtime newspaper union  
organizer who began his career as a payroll clerk at the Daily 
News, died Tuesday of pneumonia. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Keane was a Newspaper Guild negotiator for a decade and a half,  
and represented the union in talks with the Daily News, the New 
York Post, the New York Amsterdam News and Scientific American, 
among other publications. 
</P>
<P>
	Keane became involved in the Daily News Guild unit around 1960,  
and later became its chairman. He soon went to work full-time as a 
Guild organizer, helping to negotiate job security provisions at 
the Daily News in the late 1960s that became a model for workers at 
other newspapers and magazines, said Barry Lipton, president of the 
New York Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	Keane left the Guild in the 1970s to become administrator of the  
Guild-News pension fund, from which he retired in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his late wife, Norine, had eight sons and a daughter,  
four of whom entered the news business. One son, Kevin, is 
administrator of the Wire Service Guild in New York; another, Paul, 
is an entertainment editor at the Daily News; and daughter Lillian

House social office to hand letter everything from inaugural 
invitations to historic documents, died of cancer May 6 in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie mastered the art of engrossing -- a form of lettering  
commonly used in the Middle Ages -- at a young age and moved here in 
1933 to be secretary to then-Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie moved to the White House two years later, where he served  
during the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and 
Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	His work varied from the proclamation of German surrender in  
World War II to place cards for state dinners. Leslie, who served 
as assistant chief of the White House's social office, was 
sometimes called upon by the Secret Service as a handwriting 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie continued engrossing independently for 20 years after  
leaving the White House.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saul Steinberg, a cartoonist whose work was  
compared to Pablo Picasso and is perhaps best known for his drawing 
showing New York City as the center of the world, has died. He was 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who drew cartoons for The New Yorker magazine for  
more than 50 years, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. His 
brooding doodles were considered a fine art and drew comparisons to 
legendary painters such as Picasso and Duchamp. Art critic Harold 
Rosenberg described Steinberg as ``a writer of pictures, an 
architect of speech and sounds, a draftsman of political 
reflections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Steinberg's most famous cartoons is ``View of the World  
from 9th Avenue (1975),'' which first appeared on the magazine's 
cover the following year. The drawing shows a bird's-eye view of 
the world looking west from Manhattan, with the great detail of New 
York streets fading into ill-defined clumps for the rest of the 
nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
	This perspective -- as seen in the cartoon from the standpoint of  
a chauvinistic Manhattanite -- spawned similar drawings for numerous 
cities, including London, Paris, Rome and Venice.

<P>
	Born in Romania in 1914, Steinberg studied at the University of  
Bucharest before moving to Italy, where he received a doctoral 
degree in architecture in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steinberg began drawing in 1934, quickly discovering his  
skill as a cartoonist. The New Yorker published its first Steinberg 
cartoon in 1941, a sketch of a reverse centaur. Steinberg arrived 
in the United States a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg is survived by Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, whom he  
married in 1943. They were separated in the 1970s but never 
divorced.

<P>
	WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- John M. Tubergen Jr., a deaf man who  
helped pioneer bringing television news to the hearing impaired, 
died May 4 of pneumonia. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting by an anchorman for Chicago station WNBQ, Tubergen used  
sign language to report the news for the five-minute television 
program ``World News for the Hard of Hearing,'' which was broadcast 
in 1958 for 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His entry into the field was prompted in the 1950s when, working  
as a newspaper proofreader, Tubergen missed a tornado warning 
because he couldn't hear a newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	He sent an angry letter to the news director for NBC's central  
division, telling him the station wasn't serving its 100,000 
hearing impaired viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The response was an offer to provide the ``talking hands'' for  
what was considered the first sustained news program for the deaf, 
the Chicago American reported in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	The show and other live broadcasts were canceled when there was  
an electrician's strike, author Jack R. Gannon wrote in the book 
``Deaf Heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tubergen later tutored deaf students at Harper College in  
Palatine, where his students included actress Marlee Matlin.

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rosemary Valaire, a former soloist with  
Britain's Royal Ballet and influential teacher at the Westside 
School of Ballet for three decades, died Friday of a brain tumor. 
She was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Valaire was born as Rosemary Feuerheerd in London and adopted  
her stage name from the character Valerius in William Shakespeare's 
play ``The Two Noble Kinsmen.'' Valaire was a soloist with the 
Royal Ballet from 1946 until 1954 and held the prestigious Solo 
Seal. 
</P>
<P>
	She later reconstructed the Royal Ballet's version of ``Sleeping  
Beauty'' for several companies, including the American Ballet 
Theater in 1976, when she coached Natalia Makarova and Mikhail 
Baryshnikov for the lead roles. Valaire was widely known for her 
adherence to classical ballet. 
</P>
<P>
	She began teaching in 1967 at the Westside School of Ballet in  
Santa Monica, where she teamed up with Mounsey, a former New York 
City Ballet dancer, and worked through three decades.

<HEADLINE> Board OKs Tax Break for GM Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A state board has approved a $73 million  
tax credit for General Motors Corp. for a proposed new luxury car 
plant to be built in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax credit granted by the Michigan Economic Growth Authority  
on Wednesday is the centerpiece of a $98.9 million state incentive 
package for the world's biggest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Lansing Mayor David Hollister noted that the proposed Cadillac  
plant would be the first domestic assembly plant built by GM in 
over a decade. The plant will build the Cadillac Catera, now 
produced in Germany, and possibly other models. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to overcoming every obstacle'' to make sure  
the plant comes to Lansing, Hollister said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Kyle Johnson warned that a few more pieces still  
must fall in place before the plant can become a reality. The 
contract reached with UAW Local 652 remains unratified, and the 
company also has to reach an agreement on incentives with city 
officials and obtain a state air-quality permit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been a wonderful, ongoing effort to get to this  
point,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollister said he expected the City Council to approve a tax  
abatement package by June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials estimate the new plant would provide more than  
$2 billion in revenue for the state, even after deducting the tax 
credit and other incentives. The new plant would employ at least 
1,500 people. If it gets the final go-ahead, groundbreaking could 
take place in the fall, with the plant opening in late 2001 and 
production starting early in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which would require at least a $500 million  
investment, eventually could make up to 211,000 vehicles annually. 
Lansing also hopes to get a new small-car factory set to open in 
2004 to replace its aging Pontiac Grand Am and Oldsmobile Alero 
plants.

<HEADLINE> Bad Mistake Costs Stars / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Sergei Zubov might as well strap on the goat's  
horns. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of strong, reliable play throughout the playoffs, the  
Dallas defenseman's giveaway pass up the middle of the ice in 
overtime cost the Stars the game Wednesday night. That and the 
Stars' lead in the best-of-7 playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavily favored Stars are now tied 2-2 in their best-of-7  
series with the St. Louis Blues. Game 5 is Saturday in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Zubov's pass landed right on the stick of Pierre Turgeon, who  
broke in on Ed Belfour and scored his second overtime game-winner 
of the playoffs from 25 feet out. The goal, Turgeon's fourth and 
12th point of the playoffs, gave the Blues a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad giveaway. You can't have that. He knows it. We all know  
it,'' said Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock. ``There was nobody there. 
The lane was up the wall. It was wide open. As a matter of fact, if 
we get it up the wall, it would have been a 3-on-2.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as Zubov's poor puck decision earned the scorn of his  
coach, his teammates backed him and chalked the goal up to a night 
of bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Geoff Courtnall's goal at the 7:41 mark, which bounced  
off Mike Modano's stick and right past Belfour to give the Blues a 
2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many times you hear people say it's a game of  
inches and bounces, but tonight was a perfect example,'' said Stars 
captain Derian Hatcher. ``If you look at the second goal, there's a 
pass out of the corner, and it hits Modano) and goes in. There's 
nothing you can do about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such was the case with Pat Verbeek's apparent game-winning goal  
with 5:36 left to play. It was disallowed because half of Jamie 
Langenbrunner's skate was in the crease. It was 2-2 and off to 
overtime, advantage Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a huge play and we got a little bit of an adrenaline  
boost from that,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said of the 
disallowed goal. ``We wouldn't have had much time to get back into 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series has been surprisingly even, with the fifth-seeded  
Blues showing themselves to be on par with top-seeded Dallas -- in 
the good and bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams won both games at home. Both power plays have been  
abominable, with Dallas going 1-for-21 and St. Louis 2-for-21. Both 
Belfour and Grant Fuhr have given up some poor goals, and both have 
been spectacular at other times. 
</P>
<P>
	But going into Game 5, St. Louis has the momentum, courtesy of a  
2-1 edge in overtime victories this series. The Blues are now 4-2 
in overtimes through 11 playoff games. Nonetheless, St. Louis is 
not exactly begging to head into the extra period again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, it's on our side but it can always go back,''  
center Craig Conroy said. ``So, hopefully we'll stay away from OT 
the rest of the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having the chance to continue the series after falling into a  
2-0 hole is just what the Blues wanted after a two-game homestand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like starting over again,'' Conroy said. ``Best of three,  
it's anybody's ballgame.''

<HEADLINE> Britain Moves Against Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The names of more than 100 purported British spies  
have been removed from a U.S.-based World Wide Web site, but the 
British government is concerned copies of the list may be posted 
elsewhere on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Thursday that the list had  
been released by Richard Tomlinson, a former British agent now 
living in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an e-mail to the British Broadcasting Corp., Tomlinson  
denied he had posted such a list and said any names on his site 
were already in the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are jumping to the wrong conclusion. My Web site  
doesn't contain any names,'' Tomlinson said, according to the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Office on Wednesday asked newspaper editors not to  
publish details from the list, which it described as ``fact and 
fantasy.'' It gave no further details about the site or its 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishing such details ``could put lives at risk,'' said Rear  
Adm. David Pulvertaft, secretary of the Defense, Press and 
Broadcasting Advisory Committee, which advises media on issues of 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said ``not all the names'' on the list were connected with  
the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, the release of any such list, however inaccurate  
it may be, is a deeply irresponsible and dangerous act,'' Cook told 
reporters. He also said it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook said Tomlinson nursed a ``deep-seated and irrational  
grievance'' against his previous employers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlinson, 35, was dismissed from the security service in 1995.  
He was jailed for six months in Britain in late 1997 after he 
showed the synopsis of a book on his career to an Australian 
publisher. During his four-year career as a British agent, he 
served in Moscow and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the offending list had been deleted from the  
Web, but that it was concerned copies may have been made that now 
are circulating on other Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a page has appeared on the Internet, it is easy for another  
user to copy it and re-post the contents, known as ``mirroring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Foreign Office spokesman said Thursday night that ``No  
injunction has been served, so we have to assume it has been 
removed voluntarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman added that no copies of the page had thus far been  
identified, although careful checks were being made. 
</P>
<P>
	British government lawyers previously obtained an injunction to  
shut down a Swiss-based Web site set up by Tomlinson, alleging he 
threatened to publish the location of MI6 offices around the world 
and a detailed list of serving officers, along with other 
information.

<HEADLINE>  Jacobs Puts Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- For sale: The best team in baseball. Makes  
profit. Comes with friendly confines, pennant flags. Quality of 
buyer as important as price. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned the city, Richard Jacobs put his  
Cleveland Indians on the market Thursday, hoping to find someone 
willing to keep the team in town and its reputation intact as one 
of baseball's hottest properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, 'Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the laughingstock team with his late 
brother, David, for $45 million in 1986, said he decided a few 
weeks ago it was the right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved NFL franchise to Baltimore. Only now is the sports-crazed 
city recovering from that as it welcomes back the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his news conference at the ballpark that bears his  
name, Jacobs sought to reassure Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. We  
have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to move 
a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said he would explain the situation to the  
players before they left Thursday night on a road trip. He did not 
think the announcement would distract the team from its goal of 
trying to win its first World Series title since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will keep going on because that is our jobs,'' Hargrove  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is in first place in the AL Central by 6 1/2 games with  
the best record in baseball at 24-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, we still have a job to do on the field,'' Indians  
first baseman Jim Thome said Thursday night, as the players 
prepared to travel to a weekend series in Detroit. ``I don't see 
this as some big thing, as, `How are the Indians going to play now 
that Dick Jacobs is leaving?' We still have to go get the job 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cleveland-area candidates were among the bidders for the  
new Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off-guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother, Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was certainly very interested to learn about his  
decision, it is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective 
buyer,'' Larry Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturer Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with Jacobs  
in a Browns bid, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were eventually purchased for $530 million by  
billionaire suburban Cleveland banker Al Lerner. The Browns 
organization issued a statement that the NFL team's officials 
``will continue to be strong supporters of the Indians. We have 
great respect for Dick Jacobs and his judgment and we are sure that 
he will make the right decision for the Cleveland community and the 
Indians fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York developer Howard Milstein, another would-be Browns and  
Redskins buyer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers for the 99-year-old franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said his decision was not prompted by any health or  
financial problems. But before his health becomes a concern, Jacobs 
wants to be assured his beloved Indians would be in the right 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	With the price for major sports teams skyrocketing -- the  
Redskins' price tag, pending NFL approval, is $800 million -- Jacobs 
understands that now may be the perfect time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers sold last year to Rupert Murdoch's Fox  
Group for $350 million. That deal included real estate in Los 
Angeles, Vero Beach, Fla., and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock closed Wednesday at $9.94 but soared to $16.25  
by the end of Thursday on the strength of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who made his fortune in real estate, has kept a  
low-profile as owner, deferring to general manager John Hart. Like 
everyone else, Hart was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised, and I think the first feeling I had was a  
little sad about it,'' he said. ``It took me a little time to come 
to grips with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before their recent prosperity, which includes four straight AL  
Central titles and two trips to the World Series since 1995, the 
Indians had seven straight losing seasons (1987-93) with Jacobs as 
their owner. 
</P>
<P>
	In those years, the Indians played in decrepit Cleveland  
Stadium, sometimes drawing just a few hundred fans. Jacobs moved 
the team into state-of-the-art Jacobs Field in 1994 -- the high 
point of his ownership, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if this is his last season, Jacobs, who has missed just  
five home games in his tenure, said he would still come to the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could sit in the bleachers, maybe,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Suns Season Was Star-Crossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- From the beginning, the Phoenix Suns' season  
seemed cursed. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the new collective bargaining agreement ruined the Suns'  
grand plan for a free-agent spending spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Antonio McDyess, counted on as Jason Kidd's perfect partner  
in the coming years, decided after one season to go back to Denver, 
even if it meant less money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns tried to regroup by signing Tom Gugliotta and trading  
for Luc Longley. But the mix just wasn't there. The team was soft 
and inconsistent, traits that led to Phoenix being swept from the 
first round of the playoffs for the first time since 1985. It was 
the fourth straight first-round exit for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Now general manager Bryan Colangelo said the challenge is to do  
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest needs we have are athleticism and interior  
toughness, and generally overall toughness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sentiment echoed by the players.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need a few more big bodies,'' forward-center Cliff Robinson  
said, ``maybe a few more athletic, big bodies. I just think we need 
a little more toughness around the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team could also use a consistent shooting threat at the  
off-guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Chapman was supposed to fill that role, but he was injured  
early in the season and never displayed the sharpshooting form 
expected of him. When Chapman was hitting from the outside, the 
Suns were a much more dangerous team. When he wasn't hitting, he 
was a definite defensive liability, especially against bigger, 
stronger guards such as Portland's Isaiah Rider. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said he expects Chapman to spend the offseason getting  
healthy and into the right frame of mind in time for training camp 
next October. 
</P>
<P>
	The bright spot, of course, was Kidd. He led the league in  
assists and had seven triple doubles. But he was surrounded by 
players not suited for his up-tempo, intense style. One writer in 
Portland wrote that ``Having Jason Kidd play for the Suns was like 
having Julia Child cook at Burger King.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason Kidd had a spectacular season, a phenomenal season,''  
coach Danny Ainge said. ``If there is one element to his game that 
took him to the superstar level it was making big shots down the 
stretch consistently. He made a lot of big shots for us this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have him do it by himself every night, obviously,''  
Ainge said. ``We need some help in the low post to take a little 
bit of heat off of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ainge never hid his frustration at the Suns' meek demeanor.  
Ainge was as nasty a player as could be found in the NBA, but his 
team showed little of his toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a player, I wasn't afraid to get booed on the road. I  
wasn't afraid to take a hard foul when we needed it,'' Ainge said. 
``I get very frustrated when they're laying us out on the ground, 
and we're not doing it on the other end. I get frustrated that 
we're not doing it first -- the first play of the first game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix has Dallas' No. 1 pick in the coming draft, thanks to  
the trade that sent Steve Nash to the Mavericks. That is a lottery 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo expects to use that pick, which will be no worse than  
No. 8, to address the team's need for some inside muscle. He also 
plans to use the new $2 million exception to the salary cap to sign 
a free agent to bolster the team's toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix also has its own first-round pick, No. 16 overall, but  
might send it to Chicago as part of the Longley deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Most players on the Suns roster aren't exactly attractive trade  
material. Kidd, of course, is virtually untouchable. Chapman has a 
big new contract and is coming off an awful season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, who admits he didn't have the season he wanted,  
likewise has a new contract and is expected to stay in Phoenix. 
Gugliotta is a different player than the departed McDyess, whose 
sheer strength and jumping ability was a trait totally absent from 
the Suns after he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo thinks Gugliotta will fit in better after more time  
with Phoenix and a slightly different mix of teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Longley was inconsistent in his first season away from Chicago,  
and had a horrible playoff series, but his large contract would 
make him unattractive to other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	George McCloud is on a one-year contract.  
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who had a standout season, probably will be re-signed  
since he was Phoenix's lone consistent inside defender. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make every effort to re-sign him,'' Colangelo  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Suns, always the most successful franchise in the  
Valley of the Sun, are creating mostly yawns among fans. The team's 
string of playoff home sellouts ended at 50 with the Wednesday 
night loss to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo said years of success have made the franchise a bit  
complacent, a bit too comfortable, both on the basketball side and 
business side. 
</P>
<P>
	``With increased competition and the heightened expectations  
that come with our success, it's time to reevaluate it,'' he said. 
``We've been to the playoffs 11 straight years. People expect us to 
advance past the first round. I feel like we've been operating this 
business for several years in a very efficient, suitable way, but 
it's time to step it up, both on the court and on the basketball 
side.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules for Microsoft Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ruled that thousands  
of former temporary workers for Microsoft Corp. should have been 
allowed to participate in the company's employee stock-purchase 
program -- a decision that could cost the software company millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled  
late Wednesday that at least 10,000 former temporary workers since 
1986 should have been allowed to participate in the stock-purchase 
plan, which offers discounts on Microsoft stock. It said they must 
be compensated for appreciation of shares they never got to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was reviewing the ruling ``and we will have to  
consider all of our options,'' spokesman Dan Leach said. The 
company could ask for a rehearing by the three-judge panel that 
ruled Wednesday, ask for review by the entire 9th Circuit court, or 
seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a significant ruling because it cuts across the industry  
and cuts across business,'' said Rob Enderle, a computer-industry 
analyst with Giga Group of Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated the direct cost to Microsoft could be $15 million  
to $20 million. The ruling was released after the stock market 
closed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practical matter, Microsoft will have a hard time saying  
people who are employees for the purpose of stock-plan eligibility 
... are not employees for other purposes,'' said Stephen Strong, a 
Seattle attorney who helped bring the class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The class of workers involved includes temporary workers and  
independent contractors who worked 20 hours or more per week for at 
least five months over a year, any time after 1986, said another 
attorney in the case, David Stobaugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft currently has 5,500 to 6,500 temporary workers.  
</P>
<P>
	The company recently told agencies through which it hires  
temporary workers to improve their compensation packages. They are 
still not eligible for the discounted stock-purchase program, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court in Seattle is still considering another  
issue in the case: whether Microsoft must give the same 401(k) 
benefits to temporary workers as it does to its regular employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A second class-action lawsuit asks the courts to determine  
whether temporary workers must have the same access to personnel 
files and health insurance benefits that Microsoft employees 
receive.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices closed lower today as market  
sentiment was hurt by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's 
announcement that he will resign. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 96.11 points,  
or 0.57 percent, ending the day at 16,851.25. On Wednesday, the 
average rose 204.18 points, or 1.22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.58 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.72  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New 
York level of 120.95 yen overnight. The currency ranged from 120.87 
yen to 121.70 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock market confidence was weighed down following U.S. Treasury  
Secretary Rubin's decision Wednesday to step down, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would nominate Deputy  
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to succeed Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	The market also reacted negatively to reports Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin had dismissed the country's prime minister, Yevgeny 
Primakov, traders said. In addition, many players sat on the 
sidelines amid expectations for poor corporate earnings reports, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Japanese companies will release profit results later this  
month for the fiscal year ended in March. 
</P>
<P>
	But today's declines were limited. Japanese officials reacted  
quickly to word of Rubin's departure, downplaying the possible 
impact on financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said, ``I don't expect U.S.  
policy to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 9.18 points, or 0.67 percent, to 1,351.97. The 
TOPIX closed up 5.33 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 579.44 million  
shares, down from 648.77 million shares Wednesday. Retreating 
issues outnumbered advancers 812 to 394, with 110 others closing 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was stable against the yen  
after gaining ground on dollar-buying prompted by a belief that 
Rubin's successor may maintain a strong dollar policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 129.36 yen in midafternoon  
trading, up from 129.15 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.275 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.340 
percent, driving its price up to 102.01 yen from 101.42 yen.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Allegedly Stripped in Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A substitute teacher was arrested Thursday  
for allegedly taking off his pants in front of a class of fourth 
graders and asking children to touch his genitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendell Smith appeared dazed and was possibly hyperventilating  
after Wednesday's alleged incident at the El Sereno Elementary 
School, another teacher told police. 
</P>
<P>
	He was evaluated at a hospital and found to be healthy.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 46, of Los Angeles, had worked for the Los Angeles  
Unified School District as a substitute for two years without 
incident. He was arrested for investigation of sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told a girl to come here ... if she wanted to touch him,''  
said pupil Stephanie Lewandowski. ``Then he got another girl and he 
touched her bottom, he was trying to put his hand in her pants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith grabbed a boy, but the boy kicked him, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``And another got a ball and hit him in the face with it so he  
would stop and he didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Stacy Vallejo said classmates were scared.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Come here, come here ... to his privates. But we  
said `No,''' Stacy said.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Outline Education Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore plans to deliver an  
education address Sunday in Iowa, the first in a series of speeches 
designed to outline his agenda for the 2000 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	He is delivering the commencement address at Graceland College  
in Lamoni, Iowa, as part of a weekend of campaigning in the state 
that conducts the first caucuses of the 2000 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say the topic will be education.  
</P>
<P>
	In the next few months, Gore will deliver about six speeches on  
issues that will be cornerstone of his campaign to succeed 
President Clinton. One adviser compared the strategy to Clinton's 
in 1992, when he delivered a series of policy address early in his 
presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Lycos To Take On AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lycos Inc. is close to a deal with a software  
company that would move it one step closer to competing directly 
with America Online Inc., the nation's largest online service, 
people involved in the discussions said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership, which is expected to be announced Monday, would  
give customers software to enable them to access the Internet from 
desktop computers and go directly to Lycos' news, research, chat 
groups and retail sites. The sources, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, declined to name the software company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be just one in a string Lycos will  
announce in the wake of its failed merger with USA Networks and 
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things we've been looking at in terms of  
acquisitions,'' said Bob Davis, chairman and chief executive of 
Lycos. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment on any specific deals but said, ``You can  
look to us to continue to be aggressive on that front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over Lycos' plans to merge with USA Networks,  
which owns the Home Shopping Network, had a silver lining, creating 
a swirl of publicity that helped propel Lycos to the No. 1 site on 
the World Wide Web, surpassing Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	The companies called off their agreement Wednesday after it  
became clear they would not get the support of more than 50 percent 
of Lycos shareholders. Lycos investors wanted the company to focus 
on the Internet, and not to be encumbered by traditional retail 
problems like inventory control and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos emerged from the failed merger as a stronger company and  
in a better position to negotiate with other suitors or acquisition 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Bob Davis' phone was ringing off the hook with other  
companies that want to get in there,'' said Melissa Bane, director 
of Internet market strategies for the Yankee Group, a Boston 
consulting firm. ``Lycos is probably well positioned to go for 
another media company,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was bullish on the breakup of the deal and Lycos'  
prospects, sending its stock up $8.75 to $107 a share on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	To beat America Online, Lycos needs to raise its brand image  
with current online consumers, and with the 70 percent of U.S. 
households that are not yet connected to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Davisalso said, ``I wouldn't rule out ownership, investment or  
partnership in companies in the commerce arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One piece in his strategy is the direct telephone or cable  
connection to the Internet. Lycos currently has partnerships with 
MindSpring and EarthLink, and Davis said he will continue to forge 
more alliances. 
</P>
<P>
	And while the company's deal with USA Networks and Ticketmaster  
fell apart, the companies agreed to increase marketing one another. 
Lycos' name, for example, will be promoted on the Home Shopping 
Network and SciFi channel and on the envelopes of Tickemaster, 
which sells tickets to concerts and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he was disappointed the merger agreement collapsed.  
He was hoping to join forces with USA Networks because it had 
superior assets, cash flow, and distribution systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw at the time the potential, and I still do,'' he said. He  
explained, ``When we put the transaction together, a lot of people 
misjudged how difficult it would be to value that kind of 
transaction, myself included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos may still be a takeover target for another company, but if  
Lycos accepts an offer before July 15, the Waltham, Mass.-based 
company will pay $35 million to USA Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	After that date, the company is fair game.  
</P>
<P>
	Lycos' largest shareholder, David Wetherell, chairman of CMG  
Information Services, resigned from Lycos board of directors in 
March and hired an investment bank to look for a suitor to bust up 
the deal with USA Networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are gratified that Lycos shareholders will now have new  
avenues to realize appropriate value for their shares,'' Wetherell 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to his office was not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Wetherell, who owns about 20 percent of the company,  
would not be rejoining the board.

<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- William R. Burleigh, president of The E.W.  
Scripps Co., has been named chairman of the media company. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh, 63, a board member since 1990, will continue as  
president and chief executive officer. He took on those jobs in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman, he succeeds Lawrence A. Leser, who decided not to  
seek re-election. Leser was chairman for nearly five years, and 
president and chief executive from 1985 to 1994. He had been a 
board member since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Burleigh, whose new position was announced Thursday, is a former  
vice chairman of The Associated Press board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nackey E. Scagliotti, president and publisher of Neighborhood  
Publications Inc., was elected to the Scripps board during the

the executive committee of the Scripps board. She is also board 
chairman for the Manchester, N.H.-based Union Leader Corp., which 
publishes daily and Sunday newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Scripps company's holdings are 19 daily newspapers,

	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Eqbal Ahmad, an anti-war scholar once  
accused of plotting to kidnap former U.S. Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger, died Tuesday. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	A professor and founding member of the Institute for Policy  
Studies in Washington D.C., Ahmad returned to his home in Pakistan 
after retiring two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A fierce opponent of U.S. Involvement in the Vietnam War, Ahmad  
was among seven people accused of plotting to kidnap Kissinger and 
to blow up underground heating tunnels to federal offices in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed the Harrisburg Seven, their 1971 trial ended in a hung  
jury when prosecutors withdrew some charges and the rest were 
thrown out on appeal.

	Ahmad later helped found the Institute for Policy Studies and

<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Writer Herbert M. Baus, campaign  
manager and adviser to President Richard M. Nixon and other 
California politicians, died May 6 of Parkinson's disease. He was 
85. 
</P>
<P>
	Baus' Los Angeles campaigning firm, Baus &AMP; Ross, was formed  
after World War II and used then-pioneering techniques of voter 
polling and direct mail advertising. He was a proponent of several 
California ballot initiatives including establishing daylight 
savings time in California. 
</P>
<P>
	His roster of California political heavyweights included Los  
Angeles County Sheriff Peter J. Pitchess and Gov. Edmund G. ``Pat'' 
Brown Sr. Although Baus retired from Baus &AMP; Ross in 1968, he 
continued as a consultant and a campaign supporter for Nixon in 
U.S. Senate, vice presidential and presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1974, Baus told Nixon: ``The time has come for you  
to bow out.'' He also took his pleas for resignation to newspaper 
opinion pages, writing to Nixon in the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Also an author, Baus' books included ``Politics Battle Plan,''  
written with business partner William B. Ross; ``Wine Your Way to 
Health'' (1973); and the ``Master Crossword Puzzle Dictionary'' in 
(1981).

rulings ranged from sanctioning Viagra for Muslim men to banning 
short veils for women, died Thursday of cancer. He was in his 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Baz, head of the Council of Senior Islamic Scholars, was a  
highly influential scholar whose pronouncements reflected the 
official point of view and often carried the weight of law. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago on Bin Baz's advice, the government banned the  
import and production of veils that failed to completely cover a 
woman's face. Women in Saudi Arabia generally don't appear in 
public without a black cloak and a head scarf. 
</P>
<P>
	He also ruled that consulting fortune tellers and practicing  
witchcraft was forbidden in Islam, and equated death by reckless 
driving tantamount to committing suicide. Islam condemns suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Bin Baz ruled that Muslim men may use the  
anti-impotence drug Viagra if it does not contain any intoxicating 
substances.

using penicillin to treat battle wounds during World War II, died 
Tuesday at age 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser was serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps in West  
Africa in 1942 when he was sent to Algiers to take charge of a 
research team testing a new drug, penicillin. He carried out his 
research in a hospital but soon took it to the battlefield where 
the drug could be tested as soon as casualties occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser followed British troops ashore on the invasion of  
Sicily's beaches and operated aboard a ship continuously for 48 
hours, saving many lives. He served until 1946, when he returned to 
Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a senior consulting surgeon at the Royal Victoria  
Hospital, Belfast, and the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick

</P>
<P>
	She was also a columnist for Newsweek magazine since 1974.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield voiced opinions on the great turmoils and scandals of  
her time, up through Clinton's impeachment. She said she tried not 
to lose sight of the humanity of the fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Post, for all its groundbreaking coverage of  
Watergate, editorialized in favor of President Nixon's pardon -- 
``to the disgust of most of our friends,'' she said -- when she was 
deputy editor of the editorial page, a position she held from 1970 
to 1979. She became editor of the page in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield joined the Post in 1968 as an editorial writer after  
11 years with Reporter magazine.

a series of 1940s Westerns with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry before 
becoming an illustrator for children's books, died Saturday. She 
was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally known as the ``Sunshine Girl'' of artists' models,  
Sally Payne came to Hollywood under contract to appear in Republic

</P>
<P>
	She made her debut in a bit part as a tourist in the 1934 film  
``Hollywood Hobbies.'' By 1940, before moving into a series of 
westerns, she had appeared as a maid in ``No, No, Nanette'' and as 
Lucy Endover in ``La Conga Nights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She married Western Airlines executive Arthur F. Kelly in 1942  
and turned to art. She painted oils for her home and those of

House social office to hand letter everything from inaugural 
invitations to historic documents, died May 6 of cancer. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie mastered the art of engrossing -- a form of lettering  
commonly used in the Middle Ages -- at a young age and moved here in 
1933 to be secretary to then-Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie moved to the White House two years later, where he served  
during the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and 
Dwight Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	His work varied from the proclamation of German surrender in  
World War II to place cards for state dinners. Leslie, who served 
as assistant chief of the White House's social office, was 
sometimes called upon by the Secret Service as a handwriting 
expert. 
</P>

leaving the White House.

<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen, the elegant, knickers-wearing  
``Squire'' of golf in the 1920s and '30s who invented the sand 
wedge club and was one of only four men to win all four of the 
sport's major championships, died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, 
Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Gary Player won all four majors at least 
once in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open was made possible in part  
by his invention of the sand wedge, the wide-angled club 
particularly useful in smashing balls out of sand traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's greatest acclaim came from a 235-yard 4-wood shot he  
made at the Masters in 1935. Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes 
with just four holes remaining, Sarazen holed the shot for a 
double-eagle 2 -- the rarest score in golf. The shot tied Wood in 
regulation and Sarazen won in a playoff. It also elevated the 
status of the previously obscure Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, born Eugenio Saraceni, won the 1954 PGA Seniors title  
and in 1973, at age 71, made a hole-in-one during the first round 
of the British Open. It was his last tournament.

                          *Saul Steinberg    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Satirical cartoonist Saul Steinberg, who created  
hundreds of drawings for The New Yorker, including the famous image 
of what the world looks like to the egocentric Manhattanite, died 
Wednesday at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings were full of thin, sharp lines and populated with  
cats, dogs and crocodiles -- his symbols for primitive political 
society. His art was sometimes compared to that of Pablo Picasso 
and Joan Miro. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg drew 85 covers and 642 other drawings for the magazine  
over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his most famous cartoons was ``View of the World from 9th  
Avenue,'' which appeared on the magazine's March 29, 1976, cover. 
The drawing is a bird's-eye view of the world looking west from 
Manhattan, with the detailed streets of New York fading into 
ill-defined clumps for the world beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg sold his first drawing while living in Italy in 1935.  
The New Yorker published its first Steinberg cartoon in 1941, a 
sketch of a reverse centaur. He arrived in the United States a year 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg is survived by Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, whom he  
married in 1943. They were separated in the 1970s but never 
divorced.

</P>
<P>
	WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- John M. Tubergen Jr., a deaf man who  
helped bring television news to the hearing impaired, died May 4 of 
pneumonia. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting by an anchorman for Chicago station WNBQ, Tubergen used  
sign language to report the news for the five-minute television 
program ``World News for the Hard of Hearing,'' which was broadcast 
in 1958 for 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	His entry into the field was prompted in the 1950s when, working  
as a newspaper proofreader, Tubergen missed a tornado warning 
because he couldn't hear a newscast. 
</P>
<P>
	He sent an angry letter to the news director for NBC's central  
division, telling him the station wasn't serving its 100,000 
hearing impaired viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The response was an offer to provide the ``talking hands'' for  
what was considered the first sustained news program for the deaf, 
the Chicago American reported in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	The show and other live broadcasts were canceled when there was  
an electrician's strike, author Jack R. Gannon wrote in the book 
``Deaf Heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tubergen later tutored deaf students at Harper College in  
Palatine, where his students included actress Marlee Matlin.

<HEADLINE> Cell Used To Make New Liver Tissue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers say bone marrow may hold master  
cells that could some day be used to repair failing livers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study published today in the journal Science, scientists at  
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center report that experiments 
show that stem cells in the bone will, under special conditions, 
convert themselves into functioning liver tissue cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryon Petersen, lead author of the study, said the work was the  
first step toward learning how to rescue failing livers using the 
body's own stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said that in new experiments he already has shown that  
injecting the special marrow cells into rats causes the animals to 
form new liver tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the work only has been demonstrated in laboratory  
animals, Petersen said other studies strongly suggest humans also 
have bone marrow cells that will convert into liver cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have learned from the rat, we should be able to  
extrapolate to the humans,'' said Petersen. But he cautioned that 
perfecting the technique for humans may take a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John M. Vierling, liver specialist at Cedars-Sinai Medical  
Center in Los Angeles and chairman of the board of the American 
Liver Foundation, said the research raises ``very exciting'' 
possibilities for reviving dying livers. 
</P>
<P>
	Vierling said other researchers have been trying with little  
success to find stem cells in the liver that could make new tissue. 
If the cells can be isolated from the bone marrow and cultured, he 
said, it raises the possibility of finding a virtually unlimited 
supply of key liver cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to take something from scratch, so to speak, and  
grow it up in the quantity that you need would be extraordinary,'' 
Vierling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark F. Pittenger, a researcher at Osiris Therapeutics in  
Baltimore who recently found in bone marrow the stem cells for 
bone, cartilage and fat, called Petersen's finding ``a significant 
step forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It bodes well for our learning how to regenerate organs,''  
said Pittenger. ``Liver disease is a very serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Liver Foundation says about 26,000 Americans die  
annually from liver disease. About 5 million in the U.S. are 
infected with hepatitis B or C, virus diseases that are a major 
cause of liver failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said his research investigated how some people with  
liver failures are able to grow new liver tissue. Some patients 
with failing livers recover after the organ spontaneously grows new 
cells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The liver often can generate new hepatocytes, or a type of  
healthy liver cells, after an injury or disease. But Petersen said 
some patients who do not make new hepatocytes still end up growing 
new liver tissue and recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how this happens, said Petersen, long has been a mystery.  
He said research using the lab rats proves the bone marrow is the 
source of these new liver cells. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, Petersen and his colleagues destroyed the bone  
marrow of female rats and replaced it with marrow from male rats. 
This meant that the female rats had bone marrow that carried the 
male Y chromosome, which could be used to identify cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists treated the female rats with a chemical that  
prevented their livers from regenerating and then damaged the 
livers, mimicking an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, the livers were removed and the researchers  
found they contained new liver cells that carried the Y chromosome 
marker. This meant that cells from the bone marrow had gone to the 
failing livers and started the regeneration process. 
</P>
<P>
	``This suggests that there is a stem cell in the adult bone  
marrow that is capable of becoming anything if you give it the 
right signal,'' said Petersen. ``I have been able to show that 
there is a cell in the bone marrow for the liver.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petersen said that once researchers learn to isolate stem cells  
from the bone marrow, switch them into liver cells and then grow 
them into large quantities, it may be possible to rescue failing 
livers with simple injections.

<HEADLINE> NASA Delays Discovery Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery's flight to  
the new space station will be delayed at least a week so 
technicians can patch holes carved into the fuel tank by hail. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery was supposed to blast off May 20 with 1 1/2 tons of gear  
for the space station. Instead, it is headed back to the hangar 
this weekend for repairs, with liftoff targeted for no earlier than 
May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take the amount of time it takes to go fix the vehicle  
correctly,'' shuttle processing director Dave King said following 
Thursday's decision. ``We think that's a week to 10 days at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hail gouged about 150 holes into the foam insulation on  
Discovery's 15-story external fuel tank during a severe 
thunderstorm over the weekend. At least 35 of the nicks are in an 
area that can't be reached from the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest visible hole on the tank is 2 inches wide and  
one-third of an inch deep. Most are much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers are worried that ice could form in the holes when the  
tank is filled with super-cold fuel in the final hours of the 
countdown. If chunks of ice broke off at liftoff, the shuttle could 
be damaged. The cockpit windows are especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttles have been rolled off the pad and back into the Vehicle  
Assembly Building only 12 times before. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Discovery was sent back because of fuel-tank damage  
caused by a pair of woodpeckers that drilled about 200 holes in the 
rust-colored foam insulation, apparently in an attempt to roost and 
build nests. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's 10-day ferry mission will be the year's first  
shuttle flight. The last was in December, when Endeavour carried up 
the first U.S.-built section of the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the longest gap in shuttle launches since flights resumed  
in 1988 following the 1986 Challenger disaster.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Rapist Caught in Mass. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- A shuttle van driver accused of raping an  
out-of-town businesswoman he had picked up at the airport was 
arrested early today, ending a three-day manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Joseph Foley was caught at Plymouth South High School at  
about 1 a.m. after officers responded to an alarm, police said. He 
was found in the school cafeteria, where he'd apparently been 
trying to get some food. 
</P>
<P>
	Plymouth County District Attorney Michael Sullivan said the  
arrest ended ``72 hours of fear'' for local residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley, 30, is accused of attacking the woman Monday after  
picking her up in his U.S. Shuttle van at Logan International 
Airport around 1 a.m. He dropped off other passengers, police said, 
then drove the woman to Myles Standish State Forest in Plymouth, 
where he robbed and repeatedly raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was found in the state park after a bird watcher spotted the  
van there at around 8 a.m. and notified police. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley was arrested earlier this year for allegedly threatening  
another woman with scissors and attempting to drag her into a 
restroom when he was a patient at Massachusetts General Hospital in 
Boston. The case was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Wall, general manager for the Chelsea-based U.S. Shuttle,  
said the company had not checked Foley's criminal record because 
officials mistakenly believed such checks were not allowed. Foley 
had been a regular driver only since last month.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Compares Holocaust, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today compared Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing with 
the Holocaust and argued for a major U.S. commitment to rebuilding 
the Balkans after the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southeastern Europe after the Cold War was free but poor,''  
Clinton said. ``As long as they are poor, they will offer a less 
compelling counterweight to the kind of ethnic exclusivity and 
oppression that Mr. Milosevic preaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 200 Veterans of Foreign Wars members at the  
National Defense University at Fort McNair, Clinton called the Serb 
campaign in Kosovo ``an attack ... on the dignity of all people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic  
extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related -- both vicious, 
premeditated, systematic oppression, fueled by religious and ethnic 
hatred,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acknowledged the sacrifices U.S. veterans have made to  
preserve freedom, as he reiterated the NATO demands that Milosevic 
must meet before the airstrikes end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovars must be able to return home and live in safety,''  
he said. ``For this to happen, the Serb forces must leave. Partial 
withdrawals can only mean continued civil war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He again expressed remorse for NATO's mistaken bombing of the  
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, but said such ``inadvertent tragedies 
of conflict'' shouldn't distract from the purpose of the NATO 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of people that have been killed,  
systematically by the Serb forces,'' he said. ``We must remember 
who the real victims are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States would work with the World Bank  
and its European allies to invest in the Balkans as a way to 
promote stable and peaceful regimes. He offered no specifics on how 
much money or manpower Americans would commit, but likened the 
endeavor to the plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believed the Marshall Plan worked,'' Clinton said.  
``Then we have to work with our European allies to rebuild 
Southeastern Europe and give them an economic future that will pull 
them together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton wanted to  
acknowledge that the veterans ``know something about standing up 
for the right thing'' and assure them that he intended to persevere 
against Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World War II veterans here fought in Europe and the  
Pacific to prevent the world from being dominated by a tyrant,'' 
Clinton said. ``The sacrifice of Americans and allied troops helped 
to end a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO pressed on through force and diplomacy to try to bring  
Milosevic to heel, Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, said the air campaign ``is exacting a significant toll'' 
but suggested the end was not in sight, from a military standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that a force like the one Milosevic is using  
for ethnic cleansing and terror in Kosovo could hold out for quite 
some time,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton would not say how long he thought the Serbs could keep  
NATO at bay, but he insisted the alliance was ready and able to 
continue its intensified bombing for as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force and Navy called up 2,173 more reservists.  
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin's special envoy for Kosovo, ex-premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, met in Moscow to discuss diplomatic alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Talbott, who is seeking Moscow's support for  
a peace deal, Chernomyrdin said, ``We have moved closer to a 
solution.'' He and Talbott were talking again today. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott sounded similarly upbeat and praised Chernomyrdin's  
diplomatic efforts. But he said NATO's strategy on Kosovo had not 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart characterized the meeting as productive, saying working  
groups were decided upon to project what the situation in Kosovo 
will be like after the fighting ends and to sketch a timetable for 
an eventual withdrawal of troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't report to you any breakthrough, but I think it's  
important that the two sides continue to talk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, public relations specialist Leslie Dach was  
recruited by the White House to help the National Security Council 
shape its communication strategy about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Dach, active in Democratic causes and head of the Washington  
office of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, was an outside 
adviser to Clinton during the impeachment battle. Dach planned to 
lend his services for 30 days.

<HEADLINE>  Golf Great Gene Sarazen Dies at 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gene Sarazen, who put the Masters on the map with his ``shot  
heard 'round the world'' and became the first player to win golf's 
four major championships, died Thursday at age 97. 
</P>
<P>
	With his signature knickers, elegant style and quick wit, the  
``Squire'' played everyone from Harry Vardon to Bobby Jones to Jack 
Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered for as long as golf is played,'' Byron  
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen died at Naples (Fla.) Community Hospital shortly after 9  
a.m. from complications of pneumonia, said his lawyer, John 
Cardillo. He had been hospitalized for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	A former caddie, Sarazen was inspired by watching Francis Ouimet  
win the 1913 U.S. Open. Nine years later, Sarazen won the U.S. Open 
with a final-round 68 to defeat Jones and Walter Hagen, then won 
the PGA Championship later that season at Oakmont. He beat Hagen in 
the PGA in 1923 and won seven major championships in all. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sarazen's career was defined in 1935 at a new course in  
Georgia where Jones invited his friends to compete in the Augusta 
National Invitational Tournament -- later known as the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes with four holes remaining,  
Sarazen holed a 235-yarder with a 4-wood on No. 15 for a 
double-eagle 2, the rarest shot in golf. He tied Wood in regulation 
and beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made Sarazen the first of only four players to win  
the career Grand Slam. And with one shot, he made the Masters 
perhaps the most famous tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about, but  
I take my greatest pride in having won the U.S. and British Opens 
in the same year, 1932,'' Sarazen once said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, `That's the man who got  
the double eagle.' Actually, it was just a piece of luck. They 
forget the championships I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought about Tiger Woods winning the Masters at  
age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped playing golf in 1973, but went out in fashion with a  
hole-in-one at the famous Postage Stamp hole at Royal Troon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has lost one of its great heroes,'' PGA Tour  
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``Gene Sarazen dedicated his life to 
golf and became one of the game's legendary figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1981, Sarazen has joined Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a  
ceremonial tee shot to officially start the Masters. He hit his 
drive this year about 140 yards down the left side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene was a pioneer participant in the Masters tournament and  
held a special relationship with Augusta National,'' club chairman 
Hootie Johnson said. ``We will miss him very much next year on the 
first tee. He was a great champion and ambassador for golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mark O'Meara returned to Augusta National this spring as  
the defending champion, he saw his name on the same locker with 
Sarazen in the Champions Room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was the greatest thing,'' O'Meara said. ``He  
was class personified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, Ben 
Hogan, Nicklaus and Gary Player won all four majors at least once 
in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you discuss or research the history of golf, the name  
Gene Sarazen is unavoidable, and deservedly so,'' Nicklaus said. 
``He was the cornerstone of the game we all enjoy today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. Jones called Sarazen's late charge, ``the finest 
competitive round ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open at the Prince's course in  
England was made possible by another Sarazen legacy -- the sand 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invented it in 1931 and I showed it at the British Open in  
1932,'' Sarazen said in a 1997 interview. ``I had it hidden because 
I was afraid they were going to ban it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's found in every player's bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``It probably should have been called the Sarazen wedge,''  
Arnold Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenio Saraceni was born Feb. 27, 1902, in Mamaroneck, N.Y.,  
near New York City, the son of an Italian immigrant carpenter who 
never understood golf and saw his son play only once -- at the PGA 
Championship in Pelham, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said his father watched from a highway while he played  
the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a 40-foot putt and missed it,'' Sarazen recalled in an  
interview last year. ``That night he said, `You mean to say they 
pay you fellows to play that game and you couldn't put that thing 
in the hole?' I said, `Did you ever try it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen starting caddying as an 8-year-old, walking four miles  
to the nearest club and playing whenever he could. He set his 
sights on becoming a professional, against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, only brokers and bankers played golf,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first tournament and $20. He made a hole-in-one, and  
the next day his name was in the papers. He hated it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked too much like a violin player. I changed it to Gene  
Sarazen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen nearly died during a flu epidemic in 1918. After  
recovering, he bought a $15 steamship ticket from New York to 
Florida and settled in Sebring, where he unloaded brick in a 
freight yard while polishing his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said there was an easy explanation for why he remained a  
good player for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots  
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years 
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the PGA Tour established its Lifetime Achievement Award in  
1996, Sarazen was its first recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen lived the last years of his life on Marco Island, Fla.  
His wife of 62 years -- Mary Catherine -- died in 1986. He is 
survived by two children, Mary Ann, of Marco Island, and Gene Jr., 
of Delray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral Mass will be held at the San Marco Roman Catholic  
Church in Marco Island at 10 a.m. Monday.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Compares Holocaust, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today compared Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing with 
the Holocaust and argued for a major U.S. commitment to rebuilding 
the Balkans after the conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southeastern Europe after the Cold War was free but poor,''  
Clinton said. ``As long as they are poor, they will offer a less 
compelling counterweight to the kind of ethnic exclusivity and 
oppression that Mr. Milosevic preaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 200 Veterans of Foreign Wars members at the  
National Defense University at Fort McNair, Clinton called the Serb 
campaign in Kosovo ``an attack ... on the dignity of all people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic  
extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related -- both vicious, 
premeditated, systematic oppression, fueled by religious and ethnic 
hatred,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton acknowledged the sacrifices U.S. veterans have made to  
preserve freedom, as he reiterated the NATO demands that Milosevic 
must meet before the airstrikes end. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovars must be able to return home and live in safety,''  
he said. ``For this to happen, the Serb forces must leave. Partial 
withdrawals can only mean continued civil war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He again expressed remorse for NATO's mistaken bombing of the  
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, but said such ``inadvertent tragedies 
of conflict'' shouldn't distract from the purpose of the NATO 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are thousands of people that have been killed,  
systematically by the Serb forces,'' he said. ``We must remember 
who the real victims are here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the United States would work with the World Bank  
and its European allies to invest in the Balkans as a way to 
promote stable and peaceful regimes. He offered no specifics on how 
much money or manpower Americans would commit, but likened the 
endeavor to the plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you believed the Marshall Plan worked,'' Clinton said.  
``Then we have to work with our European allies to rebuild 
Southeastern Europe and give them an economic future that will pull 
them together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton wanted to  
acknowledge that the veterans ``know something about standing up 
for the right thing'' and assure them that he intended to persevere 
against Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The World War II veterans here fought in Europe and the  
Pacific to prevent the world from being dominated by a tyrant,'' 
Clinton said. ``The sacrifice of Americans and allied troops helped 
to end a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As NATO pressed on through force and diplomacy to try to bring  
Milosevic to heel, Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, said the air campaign ``is exacting a significant toll'' 
but suggested the end was not in sight, from a military standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible that a force like the one Milosevic is using  
for ethnic cleansing and terror in Kosovo could hold out for quite 
some time,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton would not say how long he thought the Serbs could keep  
NATO at bay, but he insisted the alliance was ready and able to 
continue its intensified bombing for as long as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force and Navy called up 2,173 more reservists.  
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russian President  
Boris Yeltsin's special envoy for Kosovo, ex-premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, met in Moscow to discuss diplomatic alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with Talbott, who is seeking Moscow's support for  
a peace deal, Chernomyrdin said, ``We have moved closer to a 
solution.'' He and Talbott were talking again today. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbott sounded similarly upbeat and praised Chernomyrdin's  
diplomatic efforts. But he said NATO's strategy on Kosovo had not 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart characterized the meeting as productive, saying working  
groups were decided upon to project what the situation in Kosovo 
will be like after the fighting ends and to sketch a timetable for 
an eventual withdrawal of troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't report to you any breakthrough, but I think it's  
important that the two sides continue to talk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, public relations specialist Leslie Dach was  
recruited by the White House to help the National Security Council 
shape its communication strategy about Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Dach, active in Democratic causes and head of the Washington  
office of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, was an outside 
adviser to Clinton during the impeachment battle. Dach planned to 
lend his services for 30 days.

<HEADLINE> Wordly Manner: Preakness Contender? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Beware of Worldly Manner in Saturday's  
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant trainer Tom Albertrani said the Dubai-based colt has  
thrived at Churchill Downs since his seventh-place finish in the 
Kentucky Derby May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the Derby in great shape, and we're  
confident,'' Albertrani said Thursday at Pimlico, a day after the 
colt shipped in from Kentucky. ``The Derby tuned him up a little. 
He's put on weight and he's more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race served as a prep race of sorts for Worldly Manner, who  
did not race officially as a 3-year-old leading up to the Kentucky 
Derby. His only race was a private trial in Dubai, United Arab 
Emirates, where he finished first. 
</P>
<P>
	But his strong effort in the 1 1/4-mile Derby -- he was contending  
for the lead with Cat Thief entering the stretch -- was received 
well by owners Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and Sheikh Maktoum al 
Maktoum. Charismatic, a 31-1 shot, won the Derby by a neck over 
Menifee in a 19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worldly Manner ran a very credible race, and we were pleased  
with it,'' Albertrani said, adding that Sheikh Mohammed will attend 
the Preakness. ``We were excited at the quarter pole, but the last 
100 yards he got a little weary. You can say he will improve off 
that race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness distance is 1 3-16 miles, 1-16th of a mile shorter  
than the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, who will be ridden again by Jerry Bailey, leaves  
from the No. 10 post and was 12-1 in the morning line. In his final 
workout Tuesday, he went 5 furlongs in 1:01 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was trained by Bob Baffert as a 2-year-old, but  
John Mabee sold the colt for a reported $5 million. Before the 
Derby, Worldly Manner's last official race was a victory in the Del 
Mar Futurity last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Saeed bin Suroor might consider changing training  
methods and send the sheikh's horses to run in traditional Derby 
preps, Albertrani said: ``Maybe in the future we'll try a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he needed a race mentally more than physically,'' he  
added. ``Jerry asked him to come out running and he didn't realize 
he was going to take the bit and keep it.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Cutting Up to 7,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Boeing will eliminate 6,500 to 7,000 jobs in  
St. Louis by 2001 because of a decline in orders for the F-15 
fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced the moves Thursday and said it will  
consolidate factories that make three planes, including the F-15. 
The company said it expects the cuts to come from management and 
union members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be layoffs, but not of this magnitude,''  
said Rick Smith, president of District 837 of the International 
Association of Machinists &AMP; Aerospace Workers. ``When they lost the 
sales, we all expected something to happen, but not this quickly 
and not this big. These are all good, relatively high-paying 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs of 800 to 900 St. Louis workers were announced earlier.  
Jerry Daniels, a Boeing vice president, said 300 to 400 workers 
would be let go every month until the reduction is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Greek government signed a $3.5 billion contract  
to buy Lockheed Martin's F-16s instead of the Boeing jets. That 
order alone could have kept the Boeing line open two more years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, the Israeli government postponed a $2.5 billion  
purchase of F-15s.

<HEADLINE> Daly, Geiger Get Into Tussle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Magic and 76ers didn't waste any time  
before starting the rough stuff Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Sixers leading early in Game 3 of their playoff series,  
Philadelphia's Matt Geiger got into a tussle for the ball with 
Orlando coach Chuck Daly. The Sixers had promised to retaliate for 
hard fouls on Allen Iverson in Game 2, and they took the Magic's 
physical play to another level right from the opening tip. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Sixers leading 11-2, Orlando point guard Darrell  
Armstrong lost the ball out of bounds as he dribbled in front of 
the Magic bench. Daly wanted a timeout, but the ball was out of 
bounds before Armstrong could ask for one. 
</P>
<P>
	So Daly grabbed the ball and wouldn't give it up. Geiger  
wrestled it away from him in a surreal confrontation between a 
68-year-old coach and a 7-foot-1, 248-pound center. No technical 
fouls were called. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments earlier, Geiger got into a confrontation with Armstrong  
after Geiger hit Orlando's Isaac Austin after the whistle on a 
traveling call. Austin walked up to Geiger and bumped him. Geiger 
started screaming, and Armstrong ran up to him and pointed right in 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Geiger raised his arms and shouted, ``That's right! That's  
right!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technicals were called on Geiger and Armstrong. The Sixers, at  
home for the first playoff game since 1991, led 23-15 after the 
first quarter.

	Yugoslavia Shows Signs of Pullout  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- About 120 Yugoslav troops, in a  
convoy of trucks and buses, left Kosovo today, in the first sign of 
a military pullout from the stricken Serb province. Foreign 
reporters taken to a border post at Merdara saw the convoy leave, 
and an army officer there blamed constant NATO bombing for the 
``slow pace'' of withdrawals since the Yugoslav high command 
announced a partial pullout from the stricken province had been 
ordered from last Sunday. 

</P>

	NATO Attacks Serbian TV Headquarters  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Flames and heavy smoke billowed up  
from Serbian television headquarters in Novi Sad today after a NATO 
attack, and President Slobodan Milosevic acknowledged suffering 
heavy casualties in NATO's 51-day bombing campaign.Without giving 
specific figures, Milosevic said yesterday that ``during this 
struggle, many members of the police and security forces died 
courageously.'' Alliance warplanes hit airports, television 
transmitters, a coal mine and a railway station late yesterday and 
early today in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. 

</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav Peace Talks Resume  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian and Western envoys pushed ahead with  
mediation efforts for Kosovo today, under new pressure for a 
breakthrough after Boris Yeltsin threatened to pull Russia out of 
negotiations. Yeltsin welcomed French President Jacques Chirac 
today for talks on the conflict in Yugoslavia. Yeltsin did not 
refer to his warning yesterday that Russia might halt its mediation 
efforts, an unexpected blow to the peace process just when the West 
was hoping a solution was near.

	Yeltsin Impeachment Hearings Start  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Impeachment hearings began today against President  
Boris Yeltsin, a day after he plunged the nation into a political 
crisis by dismissing Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's popular prime 
minister and his Cabinet. The hearings began with lawmakers reading 
out reports on the five impeachment charges Yeltsin is facing: 
instigating the 1991 Soviet collapse, improperly using force 
against hard-line lawmakers in 1993, launching the botched 1994-96 
war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's military and waging genocide 
against Russians with economic policies that impoverished the 
country.

	New President Elected in Italy

<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi was elected  
president of Italy today, winning wide backing from both the 
government and the opposition. At least 674 votes, cast secretly by 
senators, deputies and regional representatives, were required to 
become the next head of state. When the tally came within a few 
votes of that number, most of hall broke into a standing ovation 
for Ciampi -- applause that continued as he passed the mark. No 
final tally of votes was yet available.

	Hillary Clinton Urges Ireland Peace

<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham  
Clinton called on Northern Ireland's women today to make the 
killing earlier this year of a Roman Catholic lawyer ``a final 
rebuke'' to anyone trying to derail the peace process. Mrs. Clinton 
said the people who planted a bomb in the car of lawyer Rosemary 
Nelson, who represented many Catholic clients, must not be allowed 
to quiet the voices of those pursuing peace. ``Women will not be 
deterred,'' Mrs. Clinton told about 400 female activists, community 
workers and politicians at a conference called ``Vital Voices: 
Women in Democracy.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Knicks have a 2-1 lead in their  
best-of-5 series against the Miami Heat, leaving the division 
champion Heat one game from elimination. The Knicks unleashed one 
of the most dominant flurries imaginable, using an incredible 32-2 
run to take control of the game -- and their first-round series -- in 
defeating the Miami Heat 97-73. It was a multi-pronged offense that 
boosted the Knicks as Latrell Sprewell scored 20 off the bench, 
Allan Houston had 18, Patrick Ewing 15 and Marcus Camby 13.

<HEADLINE> Gun Lobbyists Scramble To Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Colorado school shootings instantly  
changed the dynamics of the gun control debate, leaving lobbyists 
on both sides scrambling to influence lawmakers' responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and their aides leaving the floor during a Senate  
debate on gun provisions were quickly approached by either James 
Baker, the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, or 
Bob Walker, president of Handgun Control Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker asked them not to add gun control provisions to the  
juvenile crime bill as a knee-jerk reaction to the Littleton high 
school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker argued the time was right for new protections.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sense of outrage that people have expressed in nonstop  
phone calls since the Littleton tragedy is transmuting itself into 
the political process,'' Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those on both sides of the gun issue have had just three weeks  
to react since juvenile crime legislation now before the Senate was 
transformed into a vehicle for gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
	So they're relying heavily on the oldest form of influence  
peddling in the business -- walking the halls of the Capitol to make 
personal pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA also took out full-page ads in major national  
newspapers, sent mailings to the states where senators are wavering 
and activated its grass-roots lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because Bill Clinton and his anti-gun cronies in the Senate  
are trying to exploit the recent school shootings, we urgently need 
you to call your two U.S. senators immediately and urge them to 
oppose the Clinton gun control package,'' an NRA alert to members 
said, urging each member to also call five other supporters of gun 
owners' rights and encourage them to follow suit. The NRA also 
plans to send a letter later this month to all of its millions of 
members, urging them to call their senators and representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker also previewed another argument the gun lobby is making  
all over Capitol Hill -- that lawmakers don't need new laws, they 
just need to enforce the current ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're not going to enforce the laws we currently have, what  
sense does it make to pass another one?'' Baker argued. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the NRA won the first round Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first vote on gun control since the Littleton shooting on  
April 20, the Senate rejected fresh restrictions on sales at gun 
shows. But some Senate Republicans were already pushing for a new 
vote on the gun show issue Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRA finds itself in the unaccustomed position of being alone  
in opposition to some of the provisions being proposed for the 
juvenile crime bill. That's because the Colorado tragedy caused a 
split in the usually united pro-gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group that represents gun manufacturers, distributors  
and dealers has endorsed such measures as increasing the minimum 
age for buying a gun to 21 and banning violent young people from 
ever owning guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Ricker, executive director of the American Shooting  
Sports Council, admits getting some double takes when he tells 
lawmakers or their aides that he favors some restrictions on gun 
owners' rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to re-examine our positions so we can concentrate on  
the areas where we can help prevent more tragedies,'' Ricker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Ricker and Baker said the two gun groups still agree 95  
percent of the time, just not on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, NRA supporters in Congress acknowledge that emotions are  
running against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever there is a disaster, there are always people who will  
be more prone to pass something as a knee-jerk response than under 
normal circumstances,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.

<HEADLINE>  Golf Great Gene Sarazen Dies at 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gene Sarazen, who put the Masters on the map with his ``shot  
heard 'round the world'' and became the first player to win golf's 
four major championships, died Thursday at age 97. 
</P>
<P>
	With his signature knickers, elegant style and quick wit, the  
``Squire'' played everyone from Harry Vardon to Bobby Jones to Jack 
Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered for as long as golf is played,'' Byron  
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen died at Naples (Fla.) Community Hospital shortly after 9  
a.m. from complications of pneumonia, said his lawyer, John 
Cardillo. He had been hospitalized for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	A former caddie, Sarazen was inspired by watching Francis Ouimet  
win the 1913 U.S. Open. Nine years later, Sarazen won the U.S. Open 
with a final-round 68 to defeat Jones and Walter Hagen, then won 
the PGA Championship later that season at Oakmont. He beat Hagen in 
the PGA in 1923 and won seven major championships in all. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sarazen's career was defined in 1935 at a new course in  
Georgia where Jones invited his friends to compete in the Augusta 
National Invitational Tournament -- later known as the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes with four holes remaining,  
Sarazen holed a 235-yarder with a 4-wood on No. 15 for a 
double-eagle 2, the rarest shot in golf. He tied Wood in regulation 
and beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory made Sarazen the first of only four players to win  
the career Grand Slam. And with one shot, he made the Masters 
perhaps the most famous tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about, but  
I take my greatest pride in having won the U.S. and British Opens 
in the same year, 1932,'' Sarazen once said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, `That's the man who got  
the double eagle.' Actually, it was just a piece of luck. They 
forget the championships I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought about Tiger Woods winning the Masters at  
age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped playing golf in 1973, but went out in fashion with a  
hole-in-one at the famous Postage Stamp hole at Royal Troon. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has lost one of its great heroes,'' PGA Tour  
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``Gene Sarazen dedicated his life to 
golf and became one of the game's legendary figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1981, Sarazen has joined Nelson and Sam Snead in hitting a  
ceremonial tee shot to officially start the Masters. He hit his 
drive this year about 140 yards down the left side of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene was a pioneer participant in the Masters tournament and  
held a special relationship with Augusta National,'' club chairman 
Hootie Johnson said. ``We will miss him very much next year on the 
first tee. He was a great champion and ambassador for golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mark O'Meara returned to Augusta National this spring as  
the defending champion, he saw his name on the same locker with 
Sarazen in the Champions Room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was the greatest thing,'' O'Meara said. ``He  
was class personified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, Ben 
Hogan, Nicklaus and Gary Player won all four majors at least once 
in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you discuss or research the history of golf, the name  
Gene Sarazen is unavoidable, and deservedly so,'' Nicklaus said. 
``He was the cornerstone of the game we all enjoy today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. Jones called Sarazen's late charge, ``the finest 
competitive round ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open at the Prince's course in  
England was made possible by another Sarazen legacy -- the sand 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invented it in 1931 and I showed it at the British Open in  
1932,'' Sarazen said in a 1997 interview. ``I had it hidden because 
I was afraid they were going to ban it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's found in every player's bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``It probably should have been called the Sarazen wedge,''  
Arnold Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenio Saraceni was born Feb. 27, 1902, in Mamaroneck, N.Y.,  
near New York City, the son of an Italian immigrant carpenter who 
never understood golf and saw his son play only once -- at the PGA 
Championship in Pelham, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said his father watched from a highway while he played  
the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a 40-foot putt and missed it,'' Sarazen recalled in an  
interview last year. ``That night he said, `You mean to say they 
pay you fellows to play that game and you couldn't put that thing 
in the hole?' I said, `Did you ever try it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen starting caddying as an 8-year-old, walking four miles  
to the nearest club and playing whenever he could. He set his 
sights on becoming a professional, against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, only brokers and bankers played golf,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first tournament and $20. He made a hole-in-one, and  
the next day his name was in the papers. He hated it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked too much like a violin player. I changed it to Gene  
Sarazen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen nearly died during a flu epidemic in 1918. After  
recovering, he bought a $15 steamship ticket from New York to 
Florida and settled in Sebring, where he unloaded brick in a 
freight yard while polishing his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said there was an easy explanation for why he remained a  
good player for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots  
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years 
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the PGA Tour established its Lifetime Achievement Award in  
1996, Sarazen was its first recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen lived the last years of his life on Marco Island, Fla.  
His wife of 62 years -- Mary Catherine -- died in 1986. He is 
survived by two children, Mary Ann, of Marco Island, and Gene Jr., 
of Delray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral Mass will be held at the San Marco Roman Catholic  
Church in Marco Island at 10 a.m. Monday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deports Man for Nazi Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Another member of a notorious Nazi-sponsored  
killing battalion, blamed for the murder of 19,000 Jewish men, 
women and children during World War II, has been expelled 
permanently from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazys Ciurinskas, 81, who lived in Crown Point, Ind., left the  
country Wednesday afternoon by plane from Chicago on his way to 
Lithuania, the Justice Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 15, U.S. Immigration Judge Anthony Petrone in Chicago  
had ordered Ciurinskas removed from this country after he admitted 
participating in Nazi-sponsored persecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli M. Rosenbaum, director of the department's Nazi-hunting  
Office of Special Investigations, said the removal order was part 
of a settlement agreement in which Ciurinskas admitted he was an 
armed member of the 2nd Lithuanian Schutzmannschaft (Protective 
Detachment) Battalion and concealed that service when he applied 
for a visa to enter the United States in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciurinskas also conceded he was subject to removal under a  
provision of U.S. law that requires removal of any alien who 
assisted Nazi persecution, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a trial, a federal judge in Indiana revoked Ciurinskas'  
naturalized U.S. citizenship in 1997 because of his service in the 
2nd Battalion. 
</P>
<P>
	The court noted the battalion assisted the Nazis in 10 killing  
actions in Lithuania and Byelorussia, now Belarus, that murdered 
more than 19,000 Jewish men, women and children in the fall of 
1941. The court concluded that Ciurinskas participated in at least 
one such action. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciurinskas is one of several members of the 2nd Battalion that  
the special investigations office has ousted from this country. Two 
other members of the 2nd Battalion have been ordered deported to 
Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	Juozas Naujalis was ordered deported to Lithuania by the  
immigration court in Chicago in 1997, but is appealing his case to 
the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 2nd Battalion member, Antanas Mineikis of Gulfport,  
Fla., was deported to Lithuania in 1992 after admitting he drove 
multiple truckloads of civilian victims to mass shooting sites and 
observed their murders. ``I saw women and children shot,'' Mineikis 
admitted in a sworn statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Rosenbaum criticized Lithuania for dragging  
its feet in prosecuting two other major Nazi-collaborators that his 
office pursued in this country. Rosenbaum said then that the U.S. 
government has evidence that 91-year-old Aleksandras Lileikis had 
been feigning illness to avoid trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lileikis, who lived for 40 years in Norwood, Mass., outside  
Boston, is accused of executing Jews for the Nazis while serving as 
head of security police in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius during 
the German occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbaum's office got a U.S. District Court to revoke Lileikis'  
naturalized U.S. citizenship in 1996 and was moving to deport him 
when he returned to Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lithuanian medical panel also has said that 91-year-old Kazys  
Gimzauskas, who was Lileikis' wartime deputy, is too ill to stand 
trial. Gimzauskas fled to Lithuania from his home in St. 
Petersburg, Fla., in 1993. He, too, was stripped of his naturalized 
U.S. citizenship in a proceeding begun by Rosenbaum's office. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said Wednesday that the Lithuanian trials of  
Lileikis and Gimzauskas remain stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd battalion's killings in Lithuania and Byelorussia were  
``calculated and unspeakably brutal,'' Rosenbaum said. Captured 
wartime documents show the fall 1941 killing spree ``repulsed even 
the Nazis,'' Rosenbaum added.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Soar on Economic Reports / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices skyrocketed Thursday, helped by two  
economic reports that allayed investor fears about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 point,  
or $10 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.75  
percent from Wednesday's 5.82 percent. The yield is a key benchmark 
for interest rates on many types of loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were cheered by two economic reports that indicated  
the U.S. economy was still chugging along with no signs inflation 
is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the government's Producer Price Index  
for finished goods rose 0.5 percent in April. That followed a 
smaller 0.2 percent increase in March and brought the annual rate 
of inflation in prices wholesalers pay to 1.1 percent so far in 
1999, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The April rise was largely due to a 5.1 percent jump in energy  
prices -- the largest in nearly nine years -- which economists had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding gasoline prices, which are frequently volatile, the  
report ``indicates continued price stability for the U.S. 
economy,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales  
rose a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in April to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of $239.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals driving consumer spending remain positive,''  
said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. ``However, 
higher gasoline prices have put a crimp in consumers' 
pocketbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
rose between 1/8 and 7/32 point, while intermediate maturities rose 
between 11/32 and 3/4 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills was unchanged from late  
Wednesday at 4.58 percent, while the discount was unchanged at 4.46 
percent. Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.68 percent, while the 
discount fell 0.01 percentage point to 4.50 percent. One-year 
yields edged down to 4.72 percent as the discount fell 0.03 
percentage point to 4.50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from Wednesday's 4.69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 14/32 to 122 31/32. The average yield 
to maturity fell to 5.32 percent from late Wednesday's 5.34 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Deal Spares NYC Gardens From Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For two decades, 78-year-old Olean For has  
toiled in a vacant lot in her neighborhood, turning the once 
garbage-strewn area into a lush garden in the midst of New York 
City's concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	For's little lot became one of 115 community gardens located in  
mostly low-income neighborhoods, former eyesores that had become 
eye-catchers with explosions of pansies, roses and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	The gardens faced possible extinction when the city decided to  
sell the plots to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the gardens were indeed sold. But instead of going  
to developers hungry for precious real estate, they were sold to 
entertainer Bette Midler and conservancy groups, who vowed to keep 
the gardens blooming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled. This is a joyous occasion and means that these  
gardens will stay in perpetuity,'' Ms. Midler said in a statement. 
``I'm grateful to everyone who has helped us save these important 
neighborhood gardens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Midler contributed $250,000 of her own money and got others  
to put up $4 million more to buy all the gardens, said Roberta 
Greene, a spokeswoman for the New York Restoration Project. 
</P>
<P>
	For said her phone rang all evening with the news. She was too  
tired to attend impromptu parties celebrating the sale. She has 
spent the last several months trying to save her endangered green 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you think they did it pretty good?'' she asked of the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said the sale was a victory for all  
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is right in the area where we expected to be if this went  
to public auction,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Reconsider Gun Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from the White House and some  
wavering Republicans, Senate GOP leaders today moved to reverse an 
earlier vote and require background checks for all private firearm 
sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, the author of the original legislation that  
rejected mandatory checks for certain sales, told reporters today 
that he decided to ``correct'' that legislation after a half-dozen 
Republicans complained to him Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am back making those corrections now,'' said Craig, R-Idaho,  
a member of the National Rifle Association's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were making the change as part of a package of  
amendments to Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch's juvenile 
violence bill in its third day of debate on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposal ``requires 24-hour background checks for all  
transfers of firearms at gun shows,'' according to a summary 
distributed by Hatch's aides. Craig's amendment, passed on 
Wednesday, made background checks voluntary for private gun sales. 
Craig told reporters that the NRA ``grudgingly'' supported the new 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	The change brings Hatch's bill more in line with what President  
Clinton has demanded. Earlier today, Clinton told reporters that by 
accepting Craig's original language, the Senate had ``passed up 
this chance to save lives'' in the aftermath of the Colorado school 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the life of me,'' Clinton said, ``I can't figure out how  
they did it.'' He said there was ``simply no excuse for letting 
criminals get arms at gun shows they can't get at gun stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Immediately after Wednesday's vote, a group of Republican  
senators who had supported the gun lobby on the issue, complained 
to Craig that his amendment ``didn't go far enough in requiring 
background checks,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the discontent among Republicans, Sen. Gordon Smith  
of Oregon said today he will try to change his vote unless GOP 
leaders allow another vote on background checks at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., are drafting a  
provision instructing Attorney General Janet Reno to write 
regulations calling for such background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a gun is transacted at a gun show, there should be a  
background check -- that is not a huge imposition on the Second 
Amendment,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate voted 60-39 against an amendment by Sen.  
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., that would have directed a commission to 
limit broadcasts of violent programming to hours when children are 
not expected to be watching television. Earlier, senators 
unanimously approved an amendment that would require software 
providers to make computer programs that screen out violent or 
offensive Web sites more cheaply available to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged the Senate to reconsider on gun control a few  
minutes after Reno blasted Wednesday's vote in some of the 
strongest language she has ever used about congressional actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun-control advocates believed the April 20 shootings in  
suburban Denver would help their efforts. But the Senate on 
Wednesday rejected, 51-47, a measure by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, 
D-N.J., that would have imposed mandatory background checks on 
private sales of guns at gun shows. The law already requires checks 
on dealer sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators instead voted 53-45 for Craig's voluntary background  
checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Senate learned very little from Littleton,'' Sen.  
Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told reporters after the votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno told her weekly news conference: ``I am stunned that less  
than one month after the worst school shooting in our nation's 
history, the Senate has decided to make it easier for felons, 
fugitives and other prohibited purchasers to buy guns,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	And she said Craig's amendment ``actually weakened one of the  
most effective gun laws we have ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that amendment ``may be disguised as gun-show  
legislation, but make no mistake: It will not prevent criminals and 
children from buying deadly weapons at gun shows. Instead, it will 
jeopardize our ability to continue the background checks that we 
currently do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides explained that the Craig amendment would repeal the  
requirement that pawnshops conduct background checks on people 
redeeming their own guns. Such pawnshop checks have been required 
only since last Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said the part of the NRA that fears any gun regulation will  
lead to federal control needs ``to relax for a while.'' She 
maintained that a majority of citizens supports guns checks and 
that the Brady Act that provides for them has not inconvenienced 
law-abiding gun users. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor of voluntary checks on gun sales said his measure  
struck a better balance between caution and the rights of gun 
owners and sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said the Democratic bill, sponsored by Lautenberg, would  
have unfairly cracked down on ``private citizens who come to gun 
shows and engage in discussion with other private citizens and 
decide to exchange or sell their guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that a loophole?'' asked Craig.  
</P>
<P>
	The votes came as the Senate considered whether a $5 billion  
juvenile violence bill, sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, also 
should significantly toughen the nation's gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The underlying bill by Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary  
Committee, would toughen prosecution laws governing juvenile crime. 
Prosecutors would get more funds and would find it easier to try 
suspects as young as 14 as adults.

<HEADLINE> FCC Airwaves Auction Fetches $45.1M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government licenses to provide telephone,  
television and Internet services via relatively new wireless 
technology fetched $45.1 million in an auction that ended 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	All 161 licenses on the block were sold to 40 companies at the  
Federal Communications Commission in bidding that closed after 43 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The licenses are for a technology called local multipoint  
distribution service, or LMDS, envisioned to provide services to 
compete with local phone and cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service's delivery is akin to cellular phone service,  
although it is not mobile. To receive telephone, television or data 
service, the customer needs a small receiver dish in or near a 
window. 
</P>
<P>
	TLA Spectrum LLC was the biggest winner -- in terms of money  
pledged on licenses -- offering $7.04 million for 13 licenses. 
McLeodUSA Inc., was the second-largest pledging $4.96 million on 13 
licenses, and Cloudnine Communications was the third highest 
offering $4.15 million on 31 licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	At a FCC auction last year 864 of the same kind of licenses  
fetched $578.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Snubs U.N. Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic refused  
Thursday to meet with the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Robinson came to Belgrade to demand an end to what she  
called ``a campaign of ethnic cleansing carried out with 
cold-blooded determination by the government military and security 
forces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be part of ensuring that it could not be said that  
it was not known what was being done,'' Robinson told reporters. 
``I do regret not having that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On her return to her headquarters in Geneva, she said Milosevic  
perhaps was unwilling to see her because ``he would have been 
uncomfortable with what I would have been saying to him.'' The 
Yugoslav government made no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Her message was deeply unwelcome for a government intent upon  
portraying Serbs as the victims of NATO bombs, not the villains of 
Kosovo. She also dismissed Yugoslav contentions that it was NATO's 
airstrikes that have caused the massive numbers of ethnic Albanians 
to flee from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, a former Irish president, was able to meet Foreign  
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic to deliver her message. 
</P>
<P>
	She said Jovanovic countered by saying more than 1,200 civilians  
have been killed by NATO bombs and more than 2,000 injured -- 
figures dramatically higher than the last government estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson told reporters that the civilian deaths were worrying  
and questioned NATO's policy of bombing nonmilitary targets. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said ``my main concern is the gross, deliberate campaign  
of ethnic cleansing which has driven now approximately a million 
Kosovar Albanians out of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who has been on a tour taking her to Bosnia, Croatia,  
Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania, said not a single refugee told 
her they were fleeing NATO bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she'd spoken with scores of ethnic Albanian refugees  
who gave her first-hand accounts of being driven out of Kosovo by 
Serbian forces, and that she had heard accounts collected by human 
rights workers and others working with refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard direct witness myself of the human rights  
violations suffered by a large number of Kosovar Albanians driven 
from their homes directly, and it was people in uniform army 
uniform, police uniform, paramilitary uniform,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been very brutal and very direct, in some cases  
separating menfolk from their families. Many of them saw their 
houses being burned immediately behind them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson was also taken by the army to the central Serbian city  
of Nis, where NATO cluster bombs have killed several people. She 
arrived in Nis on Wednesday shortly after an attack and saw the 
damage as well as unexploded cluster bombs.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- You can't tell what Ahmed Best looks like from  
watching the computer-generated character he plays in the latest 
``Star Wars'' movie. But you'll get to know him just the same.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Returns From First DL Stint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Baseball's iron man is back.  
</P>
<P>
	Cal Ripken Jr. came off the first disabled list stint of his  
19-year career Thursday and proclaimed himself in better shape 
physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a strange experience being away,'' Ripken said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ripken went 1-for-4 with an RBI single and a run scored but it  
wasn't nearly enough as the Baltimore Orioles lost to the Texas 
Rangers 15-7. In the field, he failed a stop a hard-hit grounder 
between his legs for his sixth error this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, 38, said before the game that there's no trace of the  
nerve irritation in his lower back that sidelined him April 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was eligible to return May 3, but he needed an extra 10  
days. He spent the first part of this week on a rehabilitation 
assignment at the team's extended spring training camp in Sarasota, 
Fla., getting the rust off and proving to himself that the pain was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not in my mind,'' Ripken said. ``I think about it when I  
take a plane trip, but that's because I have to sit in one 
position. When I'm actually going through reactions, doing 
something fast speed -- sliding into a base, backhand a ball or dive 
for a ball -- I don't think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Ripken has been thinking a lot about his father, who  
died late in spring training. Ripken said he intentionally stayed 
away from the team and the stadium to dwell on his loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed time and space,'' he said. ``I didn't have the  
benefit at the time. Maybe the injury was a blessing in disguise. 
It gave me an opportunity, actually, to think about things, to 
grieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also gave him a chance to better appreciate his amazing  
streak of 2,632 consecutive games from May 1982, his rookie year, 
through last September, when he voluntarily sat down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I took for granted the ability to go out there and  
play all the time,'' Ripken said. ``Now, having had to take some 
time off, I certainly appreciate how lucky I was and how much I 
really do enjoy being out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken said being in the locker room again felt like the first  
day of spring training. He called the game ``a second opening 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys are a kind of acting a little goofy and running around,''  
he said. ``There's a whole bunch more energy than you normally 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken said he noticed that Wayne Gretzky and John Elway retired  
while he was out, but he shot down any talk that he's considering 
joining them -- at least, not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I haven't thought about retirement, necessarily. I haven't  
gotten to that point yet,'' Ripken said. ``I'd love to talk to all 
those guys (about) how they came upon reaching their decision. I 
only know my own situation and how I feel about myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the injury, it does cast some uncertainty on my  
future. That could be a consideration. But, simply, I have to go 
out there with a good body and a good mind and see how it all works 
out and I'll know one way or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Ripken's recent absence, Rafael Palmeiro surpassed him in  
games played this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmerio, Ripken's teammate the last five seasons, appeared in  
his 1,401st game of the 1990s on Thursday. It was Ripken's 1,398th. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until I saw that on TV the other day, I had no idea,''  
Palmeiro said. ``I'm glad he's back. To me, it doesn't seem right 
for him to be on the DL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Calvin Pickering, who didn't have a hit in seven  
at-bats over seven games, was sent down to Triple-A Rochester to 
make room for Ripken.

<HEADLINE> Farm State Democrats Criticize GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Farm state Democrats criticized Republicans on  
Thursday for rejecting $5.3 billion in emergency aid for farmers 
and pledged to continue to push the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., tried to  
get the money included in a supplemental spending bill being worked 
out by House and Senate budget negotiators. But when put to a vote 
late Wednesday night, the farm aid proposal, which started as a 
$4.3 billion deal but increased as lawmakers added riders, got a 
14-14 tie vote. One Republican, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., voted 
with all the Democrats in favor of the package. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the committee agreed to $566 million for farmers, which  
includes money to replenish the shrinking coffers that supply farm 
loans. The proposal will still have to get past both floors of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the money isn't nearly enough, particularly when  
budget planners agreed to $11.6 billion for the air assault on 
Yugoslavia and to boost defense spending. President Clinton had 
only requested $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is telling farmers ``you better get down and paint your  
tractors in camouflage,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. ``What does 
it take to get the attention of the Republican leadership around 
here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For them, on defense, the sky is the limit,'' said Dorgan.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the agreement helped farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are grandstanding,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran,  
R-Miss., chairman of the Agriculture Committee's appropriations 
panel, adding that the GOP leaders are open to passing more money 
later this year if the administration requests it. ``We gave the 
administration everything they asked for and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selma Sierra, spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., said  
Clinton's request to replenish the farm loan funds was $152 
million, so Republicans increased it fivefold. ``If they think we 
don't care about farmers, then Democrats must be heartless,'' 
Sierra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year passed a $6 billion emergency package for  
farmers as prices plummeted. With low prices expected to continue 
much of this year, many lawmakers have pushed for early emergency 
funds to ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm money includes the money for loans as well as $20  
million in farmworker aid; $70 million in livestock assistance and 
$145 million to help pork producers, who have been suffering from 
their lowest prices in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	One more Republican vote ``would have made all the difference in  
the world,'' Harkin said. ``We helped everybody but farmers.''

<HEADLINE> Producer Prices Rise 0.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most prices charged by factories, farmers and  
other producers remained tame in April, but soaring energy prices -- 
including a record jump for gasoline -- may be starting to affect 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Producer Price Index for finished goods rose  
0.5 percent in April, the Labor Department said Thursday. That 
followed a smaller 0.2 percent increase in March and brought the 
annual rate of inflation in prices wholesalers pay to 1.1 percent 
so far in 1999, compared with a 0.1 percent decline for all of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The April rise was largely due to a 5.1 percent jump in energy  
prices -- the largest in nearly nine years -- which economists had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	After global economic turmoil pulled energy prices down sharply  
last year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed 
this spring to limit production. Analysts said military fuel 
demands for the conflict in Yugoslavia also may be tightening 
energy markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices posted the largest price gain, an unparalleled  
29.1 percent, breaking the record set in January 1990 during the 
Persian Gulf crisis. Fuel oil prices rose 14.3 percent, the most in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, prices paid by wholesalers for many other products,  
including food, computers and children's clothing dropped in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding gasoline prices, which are frequently volatile, the  
report ``indicates continued price stability for the U.S. 
economy,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving out food and energy, core producer prices -- which  
economists watch most closely -- climbed a mild 0.1 percent in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors, sensitive that signs of inflation could  
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, chose to focus 
on that positive aspect of the report. The Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks closed up 107 points on Thursday at 11,107. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe the spike in energy prices is likely to  
be temporary, but warn it could lead to more widespread, mild 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oil is a very pervasive commodity, I would expect to see  
(higher prices) work their way a little through the rest of the 
economy,'' said economist Clifford Waldman of Waldman Associates in 
Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers may already feel pinched.  
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Thursday, the Commerce Department said  
retail sales rose a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in April to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $239.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A 0.3 percent drop in demand for durable goods -- big-ticket  
items expected to last three or more years -- was led by an 0.8 
percent decline in sales at auto dealers, which analysts attributed 
mainly to the end of new year's discounts. Sales of nondurables, 
such as food and fuel, rose 0.4 percent, however, and excluding the 
jumpy autos category, overall retail sales also climbed 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with April last year, sales were up 7.5 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fundamentals driving consumer spending remain positive,''  
said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist for Merrill Lynch. ``However, 
higher gasoline prices have put a crimp in consumers' 
pocketbooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a third report released Thursday, the Labor Department said  
first-time claims for unemployment benefits held steady at a 
moderate 303,000 last week. A more reliable four-week moving 
average of jobless claims dropped by 4,000 to 304,250. 
</P>
<P>
	That suggests little change ahead in the nation's unemployment  
rate, which edged up to 4.3 percent in April but remains near a 
29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists worry that inflation could become a danger if  
Americans, feeling secure in their jobs, continue to spend briskly, 
and price-containing pressures caused by recent low demand for U.S. 
products overseas begin to wane. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, however, competition from low-priced imports flooding  
into the United States from economically distressed countries is 
keeping most prices here low. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, for example, the cost of computers fell 3.9 percent,  
the price of children's clothing fell 0.8 percent and the price of 
home electronic equipment fell 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of passenger cars and light trucks rose 0.2 percent  
and 0.3 percent -- another effect of expiring sales incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Food costs fell 0.9 percent in April. Fish prices dropped 7.1  
percent, the most in five years, after rising sharply in March. 
Dairy, egg and pork prices also fell, offsetting increases for 
fruit and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	At the earliest stages of production, prices rose 0.6 percent  
for intermediate goods and 1.3 percent for crude goods, including 
petroleum. An example of the three stages of production is bread 
for finished, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Stewart Signs $27M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kordell Stewart has had one very good season  
as an NFL starting quarterback and one not-so-good season. That 
didn't prevent the Pittsburgh Steelers from giving him one very 
good contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart on Thursday officially signed a $27 million contract  
that runs through 2003. He agreed to terms nearly two weeks ago, 
but the announcement was delayed so agent Leigh Steinberg could 
return from a European vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 26, gets an $8.1 million signing bonus that is only  
about half the $15 million that two-year starter Jake Plummer got 
from Arizona. Because Stewart agreed to cut his salary this season 
from $2.05 million to $400,000, his signing bonus essentially is 
$6.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He will make $2.5 million in 2000 before his salary escalates to  
$4.4 million in 2001, the Steelers' first season in their new 
stadium; $5.3 million in 2002; and $6.3 million in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing bonus will count $1.62 million a year against the  
Steelers' salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is not guaranteed, which protects the Steelers in  
case Stewart has another season like last year, when he threw for 
only 11 touchdowns and ran for only two. In 1997, he passed for 21 
touchdowns and ran for 11 more as the Steelers reached the AFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Last season) made me understand the responsibilities that I  
have to uphold,'' Stewart said. ``It caused me to mature quickly as 
a young man as well as a player, and understand that being a 
quarterback, things just aren't going to happen well all the 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's previous contract ran through the 2000 season.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're really happy to have Kordell with us, and he's going to  
be with us for some time,'' team president Dan Rooney said. ``As we 
have said, he's our guy. Everyone in the organization has been 
very, very much for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bill Cowher said the Steelers' collapse from an AFC  
finalist in 1997 to a 7-9 record in 1998 can't be blamed just on 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year, he took us within a drive of the Super Bowl.  
The second year, our football team did not meet the expectations or 
the standards that we've all come to accept,'' Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think when you look around the league, there's no question  
that stability at that position is so critical to have. ... Players 
have come and gone, but we have a young man who wants to be here 
and is driven by all the right things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said, ``There were some good things that happened and  
some not so good things that happened. And the only thing I can say 
is that, like anything else in life, you learn from your 
experiences. And that was just an experience for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has spent most of the offseason in Pittsburgh working  
out and getting to know new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, 
the former San Diego Chargers head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Stewart was criticized by backup quarterback Mike  
Tomczak for not working hard enough during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, you're going to have some adverse situations,''  
Stewart said. ``It just matters how you come out of that and how 
you handle it. Last year was one that not too many people around 
here were excited about. But it was one that I can appreciate based 
on the season I had the year before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart should get a boost from the addition of first-round  
draft pick Troy Edwards, a playmaking wide receiver from Louisiana 
Tech who had more than 400 yards receiving against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only get better,'' said Stewart, who spent his first two  
seasons with the Steelers as a receiver and part-time quarterback. 
``I have all the confidence in the world in myself.''

<HEADLINE> Blazers Await Winner of Jazz-Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers have come a  
long way in a week, even if they didn't do much growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last Friday, the Blazers were in a sour mood after losing  
four of their last five regular-season games, including a 
momentum-crushing 28-point blowout against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, on the eve of Game 1 of their first-round series  
against Phoenix, the Blazers impatiently answered questions about 
whether they could regain their stride against the surging Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers emphatically erased those doubts with a 3-0 sweep,  
completed with Wednesday night's 103-93 comeback victory in 
Phoenix. Portland ended a six-year string of first-round exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really good feeling,'' said forward Brian Grant, who  
like other Blazers played in his first winning playoff series. 
``Walt Williams and I may have been jumping around extra hard on 
the sidelines because we were in Sacramento together. We've both 
been down some rough roads. Now, to make it to the second round -- 
we're not saying it's like a championship or anything, but it's 
just a big relief to make it to the second round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a physical, emotionally draining Game 3, the Blazers  
arrived back in Portland on Thursday afternoon and took the rest of 
the day off. They have the luxury of a few days to recuperate while 
watching the Utah-Sacramento series. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's improbable 84-81 overtime loss in Sacramento on Wednesday  
night gave the Blazers even more encouragement. Should the Jazz 
lose, Portland would have homecourt advantage against the Kings, 
who were 0-4 against the Blazers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Isaiah Rider was listed as day to day on Thursday  
after spraining his right knee in the third quarter Wednesday. 
Rider was said to be walking fine, however, and indicated he would 
be ready for the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was hurt when he dove for a loose ball and the Suns' Tom  
Gugliotta fell into his right knee. Rider came back and, although 
he contributed little on the court, urged his teammates on loudly 
and waved a towel from the bench. After the game, he even compared 
himself to Willis Reed and his famed hobbling entrance for the New 
York Knicks in the 1970 finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers came very close to losing their cool several times  
during the game. When Rider was fouled hard by Danny Manning late 
in the second quarter, he briefly confronted Manning, but then 
walked away. Williams, however, left the bench area to defend 
Rider, an act that usually carries an automatic one-game 
suspension. Williams was not suspended Thursday, and a league 
official said the incident was still ``under investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portland has gotten into trouble all season for outbursts and  
tantrums directed at officials, and Wednesday night was no 
different. Rasheed Wallace, whose protests have been characterized 
by wide-eyed, open-jawed looks and flailing arms, was particularly 
animated after one call. There also was a brief altercation behind 
the Blazers bench involving seldom-used and injured rookie guard 
Bonzi Wells and a Phoenix security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys have to understand that you can't react to everything  
that happens,'' point guard Damon Stoudamire told The Oregonian. 
``It just magnifies everything. It just makes it worse. Wherever we 
play in the second round, it's going to be the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Portland's emotion and energy carried it through  
with a 24-10 run to end the game and the series. And that kind of 
intensity -- in measured doses -- will be needed if the Blazers are 
to advance to the Western Conference finals and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come here to get into the second round. I came here  
because I felt this team had the best opportunity to win a world 
championship,'' said Greg Anthony, who signed as a free agent 
following the lockout. ``So far, I feel real happy about my 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Accused of Causing Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin faced accusations Thursday  
of carrying out policies that claimed the lives of millions of 
Russians as lawmakers opened impeachment hearings that could test 
the strength of Russia's fragile democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an atmosphere of anger and foreboding, the lower house of  
parliament, the State Duma, accused Yeltsin of destroying the 
Soviet Union, selling out Russia to the West, starting war in the 
breakaway province of Chechnya, illegally dissolving parliament in 
1993 and waging genocide against the Russian nation with policies 
that wrecked the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin himself ``didn't kill anybody, of course,'' said Vadim  
Filimonov, the Communist head of the impeachment commission. ``But 
he gave orders to kill people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings began one day after Yeltsin propelled the country  
into political turmoil by firing popular Prime Minister Yevgeny 
Primakov and his Cabinet. The shake-up, the third in little more 
than a year, gave added impetus to the hearings, which had already 
been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it seems less likely that the upper house of parliament  
would vote to remove Yeltsin from office, in what would be Russia's 
first presidential impeachment. Yeltsin's ouster would also require 
two-thirds majorities of the supreme and constitutional courts -- 
which is considered unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	And the whole matter could be moot if Yeltsin dissolves  
parliament and calls for new elections, as many observers think he 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
		   With 443 deputies in the Communist-dominated Duma, it will  
require 300 to impeach Yeltsin. So far, at least 125 have indicated 
that they oppose impeachment, suggesting the vote could be close. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those opposing impeachment and urging Yeltsin to dissolve  
parliament was flamboyant nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
There were reports Thursday that Zhirinovsky was being considered 
for a top Kremlin post. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the parliamentary hearing, the impeachment commission  
read out its case on the five charges against Yeltsin in a lengthy 
report that put some deputies to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin was accused of destroying the Soviet Union to enable  
NATO to dominate the world. ``It was exactly because of the 
collapse of the USSR that NATO was able to advance to our borders 
and bomb Iraq and Yugoslavia,'' Filimonov said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin was also accused of ruining the military and causing the  
deaths of millions by destroying the country's economy, ruining the 
health system and lowering life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's Duma envoy, Alexander Kotenkov, responded for the  
president, saying the impeachment charges were groundless. He gave 
a long, often emotional rebuttal of each of the five charges, and 
urged the deputies to allow Yeltsin to complete his term, which 
ends next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a choice: either fight for power or hold the next  
election as scheduled and legally carry out the transfer of power 
in our state. The choice is yours, esteemed deputies,'' Kotenkov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500 Communists demonstrated outside the parliament  
building near Red Square, waving red flags demanding Yeltsin's 
removal. A smaller group of pro-Yeltsin supporters rallied across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	While Yeltsin's sacking of Primakov on Wednesday provided a  
backdrop of high drama and tension to the proceedings, lawmakers 
were typically irreverent and laconic, often looking bored and 
jeering Kotenkov when he asked for more time to speak. The catcalls 
and whistles increased during the afternoon session, when Kotenkov 
faced more than a dozen hostile questions. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no signs of tension in the streets of the capital,  
and no indication of any increased police presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov confidently predicted success  
of the impeachment inquiry, which he has been pressing for months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spoken to faction leaders, and even those who were  
wavering are now saying that Yeltsin must go,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies across the spectrum said they did not expect the Duma  
to approve Yeltsin's choice of former Interior Minister Sergei 
Stepashin to replace Primakov. Stepashin was named acting prime 
minister while the Duma considers his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma will hold its first confirmation vote on Stepashin on  
Wednesday, speaker Gennady Seleznyov said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Duma votes down Yeltsin's choice for prime minister three  
times, the president is bound by the constitution to dissolve 
parliament and call new elections. Yeltsin has no plans to dissolve 
the Duma and still hopes to work with the chamber on forming a new 
government, his aides said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duma elections, scheduled for December, could be held early, but  
the Russian Constitution is confusing on the issue. While the 
constitution mandates dissolution after the third rejection of a 
prime ministerial candidate, it also says the Duma can't be 
dissolved if it votes for impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The political turmoil also is taking its toll on the Russian  
economy. Shares on Moscow's tiny stock exchange slid after opening 
Thursday, adding to a 16 percent drop the day before. The ruble 
also fell against the dollar and euro, trading at 24.69 to the 
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Columnist Meg Greenfield Dies at 68 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A believer in Washington's humanity but a  
sharp critic of its poison and puffery, Meg Greenfield shaped The 
Washington Post's editorial voice for three decades. She died 
Thursday of cancer at age 68. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pulitzer Prize-winning editor, editorial writer and Newsweek  
columnist, Greenfield provided commentary on the great turmoil and 
scandals of her time, all the while mindful that the fallen, or the 
larger than life, were flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am, to this day, even given the uncountable number of scuzzy  
public betrayals and lies, much more comfortable when a scoundrel 
eludes us or we miss the scent, than when we are pursuing someone 
who shouldn't be charged,'' she wrote in a Newsweek column last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	Much earlier, she had advanced the view that Washington,  
contrary to widespread belief, ``does not exclude everything 
human.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield, who had lung cancer, died at her Washington home.  
</P>
<P>
	``She shaped the editorial page of the Post in a highly personal  
way -- independent and strong but respectful of others' opinions,'' 
said publisher Donald E. Graham. ``On the ethics of our business 
she was the Supreme Court, as far as I was concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Seattle, she joined the Post in 1968 after 11 years  
with the old Reporter magazine and became deputy editor of the 
editorial page two years later. In 1979 she became editor of the 
page, a position she held until her death. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote columns for Newsweek since 1974 in a recognizably  
textured, sometimes elaborate style that reflected a distrust of 
easy answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She called on those of us who work in government to pursue  
far-sighted public policy and bipartisan solutions,'' President 
Clinton. ``Her voice of eloquence and reason will be sorely 
missed.'' He said she ``perfected the art of the newspaper 
column.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Post, for all its groundbreaking coverage of Watergate,  
editorialized in favor of President Nixon's pardon -- ``to the 
disgust of most of our friends,'' she said -- when she was deputy 
chief of the page. 
</P>
<P>
	She won a 1978 Pulitzer for writing editorials, some of which  
spoke out in defense of outgoing President Ford and renounced some 
of the paper's earlier criticisms of him. ``How odd that so few of 
us have been willing to acknowledge that decency in the White House 
can be regarded as a luxury or a bonus or a fringe benefit only at 
our peril,'' she wrote. ``It is central.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she could be tough on ``the media, the social twits, the  
congressmen and their multitudinous hatcheries of assistants, the 
lawyers and (let us never forget) the principals'' -- as she 
described the cast of characters involved in some of the ``pathetic 
little squalors'' of the Clinton impeachment affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield was ``uninfluenced by trends or molds,'' said  
Katharine Graham, former publisher of the paper and a longtime 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	A slight but commanding woman at 5-foot-1, she saw a ``little  
Mussolini in every editorial writer.'' But she questioned how 
powerful that role really was. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we tend to notice here is the great number of wise  
suggestions we make that are rejected at the polls, and in the 
agencies, and in the U.S. Congress, and in the District school 
board, and if there's someplace I've left out, remind me,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post said that in 1982, fed up with Washington's vast public  
relations industry, she tried to stop the editorial staff from 
accepting any manuscript or interview request that came from a 
``flack firm,'' but the rule proved impractical and lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield's father ran an antiques business and her mother died  
when she was 12. She graduated from Smith College in 1952, spent a 
year at Cambridge University studying poet William Blake on a 
Fulbright scholarship and worked in the 1956 presidential election 
as New York research director for Democratic candidate Adlai 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Cut Up to 7,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Flagging sales of Boeing Co.'s premier F-15  
fighter have forced the elimination of up to 7,000 jobs at the 
company's massive manufacturing plant here and triggered a 
reorganization meant to strengthen the aerospace company in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the layoffs represent roughly 35 percent of the  
plant's work force. Most of the cuts, expected to be completed by 
mid-2001, will come from the ranks of management, but labor 
officials say 1,600 to 1,800 union members will also lose their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has previously announced that it planned to eliminate  
anywhere from 43,000 to 53,000 jobs in coming years. The company 
said that Thursday's announcement pushes its estimate to the higher 
end of that range. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in July of 1998, Boeing predicted that its total work force  
of 238,000 would be reduced to roughly 185,000 to 195,000. Boeing 
currently employs 219,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has blamed most of its job cuts up until now on reduced  
demand from Asian customers who were suffering from that region's 
prolonged recession. Most of the previous cuts came in the Puget 
Sound area in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing suffered another blow last month when the Greek  
government signed a contract to buy Lockheed Martin's F-16. The 
F-15 costs about $55 million each, while the F-16, an advanced 
fighter, goes for about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after Boeing lost the $3.5 billion sale to Greece, the  
Israeli government postponed a $2.5 billion F-15 purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek order alone could have kept the Boeing line open two  
more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we completed an assessment of our business environment  
based on the April 30 decision by the government of Greece, we 
decided to let our team and the community know as soon as possible 
what to expect for the foreseeable future,'' said Jerry Daniels, 
Boeing vice president, general manager and St. Louis site director. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain committed to St. Louis and are taking these steps to  
ensure our competitiveness on our existing work, including a 
multiyear contract on C-17 and a proposed multiyear buy of the 
FA-18EF and on future programs, such as the joint strike fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Employees gathered at a nearby restaurant to celebrate the  
retirement of three Boeing managers seemed to accept the layoffs as 
inevitable in light of the recent sales losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``After losing the (Greek) contract, that would be the amount I  
think you'd expect,'' said Stacey Ward, who has worked in the 
company's training department for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the key to this whole thing is that we have to change the  
way we do business. We have to become leaner and better streamline 
our operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs of between 800 and 900 St. Louis workers were announced  
earlier. About 300 of those already have been given notice, 
officials said. About 300 to 400 workers are to be let go every 
month until the reduction is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said displaced St. Louis employees may find work at  
other Boeing sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders said that when anticipated sales to Greece and  
Israel fell through recently, they expected layoffs. But they were 
shocked by the size of the reduction in force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be layoffs, but not of this magnitude,''  
said Rick Smith, president of District 837 of the International 
Association of Machinists &AMP; Aerospace Workers. ``When they lost the 
sales, we all expected something to happen, but not this quickly 
and not this big. These are all good, relatively high-paying jobs. 
It's not going to be pretty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri lawmakers said loss of the F-15, first built here in  
1972, jeopardizes U.S. national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The F-15 is the very best fighter airplane in the world,''  
said Sen. John Ashcroft. ``If we allow the line to go down where we 
don't have the next generation available to us, we put U.S. 
security at risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 F-15s have been delivered to the U.S. Air Force,  
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Japan. Current orders for the F-15 will be 
completed by early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jacobs, a Boeing analyst at Ragen Mackenzie Inc. in  
Seattle, said the production declines in St. Louis will hurt 
Boeing's revenue in 2000 and 2001, but the company may also face a 
longer term problem rehiring skilled workers after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing will need these workers as it ramps up production of the  
F-18 Super Hornet, a new carrier-based fighter which is being built 
in St. Louis, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the challenges Boeing will now face is getting the  
skilled work force to come back when they're needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs added that the F-15s are at the tail end of their  
delivery cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if Boeing would have won the order from Greece and got  
the full order from Israel, it would probably have still resulted 
in job reductions in St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a bit of good news for Boeing Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said it agreed to protect more than 3,000 Puget Sound  
area maintenance and facilities jobs that had been scheduled for 
elimination. The company said it saved those jobs after union 
workers agreed to productivity improvements.

<HEADLINE> Children Must Be Careful in Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Roger Ceilley sighed as he watched  
children at a Des Moines day-care center frolic under the noon sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Noon is not a very safe time to be outdoors. Worse, ``there's  
not a speck of shade in the entire area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A child born this year has a one in five chance of developing  
skin cancer later in life, mostly from sun exposure, according to 
the American Academy of Dermatology. 
</P>
<P>
	Children get 80 percent of their lifetime sun by age 18, and  
even a few bad sunburns during childhood can increase their risk of 
melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ceilley, a University of Iowa dermatologist, is not a grump who  
thinks children should stay indoors. ``I lived outdoors when I was 
a kid,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But consider when American children play most outside: during  
recess at school, anywhere from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. -- the hours when 
the sun's ultraviolet rays are strongest. In fact, experts 
recommend seeking shade until after 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	How many kids don protective hats, sunscreen or sunglasses  
before racing out to the jungle gym? And how many playgrounds have 
lots of shady trees? 
</P>
<P>
	So the academy's National Coalition on Sun Safety teamed up with  
the safer-playground group KaBoom to open the nation's first 
specially designed ``sun-safe playground'' on New York's Staten 
Island last month. 
</P>
<P>
	A massive tarpaulin-like structure shields two-thirds of the  
play area from ultraviolet rays. Benches for parents or 
baby-sitters have little roofs, too. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of the coalition's effort to teach Americans to better  
protect their kids, and themselves, when they're in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The snazzy-looking playground is generating interest from  
neighboring communities. Coalition co-chairman Ceilley hopes it 
will become a nationwide model, illustrating that small steps like 
utilizing shade could help save lives. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1 million Americans will be diagnosed with some form  
of skin cancer this year. Someone dies of it every hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Most skin cancers are basal cell or squamous cell types, which  
often appear as pale, waxlike, pearly nodules or red, scaly 
patches. The deadliest form, melanoma, often starts as a small 
mole-like growth that grows larger, has ragged or irregular edges, 
and has mixed shadings of brown or black. Melanoma cases are 
increasing by 3 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught early, most skin cancer is curable. But melanoma spreads  
quickly, and even basal and squamous cell cancer can dramatically 
disfigure the skin if the malignancies grow large before removal. 
So doctors urge adults to check their skin monthly, and have a 
dermatologist check any suspicious spot promptly. 
</P>
<P>
	But prevention is best, and that explains the focus on children.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sun safety is just like car safety,'' Ceilley says. ``It's  
something you need to think about every day,'' not just when the 
family is headed for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
	For both children and adults, choose a sunscreen that has at  
least a sun protection factor, or SPF, of 15. Make sure it protects 
against both types of ultraviolet rays, UVB and UVA. Not all 
sunscreens do. 
</P>
<P>
	If children are reluctant, new kid-friendly color-changing  
brands may entice them. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't think that wearing sunscreen means you can bake in the  
noon sun. Recent studies have confused the public by finding that 
skin cancer has risen even as sunscreen use has. Many scientists 
believe the problem is that too many people think slathering on 
lotion means they can stay in intense sun longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunscreens do reduce the risk of sunburn, which is important and  
means everyone should use them, experts say. Tanning, they note, is 
a sign of sun damage. But don't rely on sunscreen exclusively -- you 
must still avoid midday exposure and wear protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Find a fun hat with a brim for children and adults, advises  
Ceilley. He notes that Australia, where skin cancer is so epidemic 
that sun safety is a major government effort, requires hats and 
sunscreen for school recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Wear sunglasses, because the sun also causes cataracts.  
</P>
<P>
	As for adults, ``it's never too late'' to start being sun-savvy.  
``The skin does have an amazing ability to recover.'' 
</P>

	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A judge has thrown out charges against two  
of the seven law enforcement veterans accused of railroading a man 
for the 1983 murder of a 10-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge William Kelly said Thursday that there was insufficient

<HEADLINE> Gene That May Cause Diabetes Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A gene that causes the body to kill  
insulin-producing cells has been identified by researchers who say 
the finding is a key step toward a vaccine to prevent childhood 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a strain of rodent that always gets diabetes, called the  
nonobese diabetic mouse, a team led by Dr. Ji-Won Yoon showed that 
the presence of the gene GAD is what causes the body's immune 
system to kill the insulin-producing cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon, of the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, is lead  
author of a study appearing today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found that if we suppress GAD expression in the pancreatic  
cells, then we can prevent diabetes,'' said Yoon. ``It is that 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the mouse, when the GAD gene is active, it expresses, or  
causes the cell to make, a protein called glutamic acid 
decarboxylase. When this GAD protein is circulating in the body, 
the immune system detects it and attacks as if it were a foreign 
substance. Killer T-cells from the immune system also attack the 
beta cells that have the GAD gene. 
</P>
<P>
	This attack kills the beta cells, which means the body no longer  
has the insulin needed to process glucose, or sugar, in the blood. 
The result is Type I diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Goldstein, medical director of the Juvenile Diabetes  
Foundation, said Yoon's discovery is a ``very important step'' 
toward, perhaps, some day developing a diabetes vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``This approach has the promise of modulating the autoimmune  
response and going toward prevention,'' said Goldstein. He 
cautioned, however, that the finding is ``only one brick in the 
house'' and that scientists will need to answer many basic 
questions before a vaccine can be developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Type I diabetes frequently is diagnosed in childhood, forcing  
patients to spend their lives taking up to four insulin shots a day 
and to carefully monitor their blood sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
	About 29,000 new cases of Type I diabetes are diagnosed annually  
in the United States, mostly among children and young adults. The 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation estimates that about 1 million 
Americans are being treated for Type I diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Another form of the disease, called Type II diabetes, most  
commonly occurs in people over 40. In this disease, the body may 
still make insulin, but cells have lost their sensitivity to the 
hormone. Type II diabetes commonly is treated successfully with 
pills, diet and lifestyle changes. 
</P>
<P>
	When not controlled, either type of diabetes can cause kidney  
failure, blindness, limb amputation, heart disease and death. It is 
estimated that diabetes claims the lives of about 190,000 Americans 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon said his study suggests it may be possible to prevent Type  
I diabetes with a vaccine that would desensitize the immune system 
to the presence of the GAD gene. He said such a vaccine would, in 
effect, educate the immune system not to attack pancreatic cells 
that have the GAD gene. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you inject GAD then the T-cell will learn to tolerate GAD  
and will not attack the beta cells (which make insulin),'' said 
Yoon. ``The concept is that you inject GAD into young children; 
then they would not get diabetes. That is prevention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yoon said it will take 10 to 15 years to develop such a vaccine  
because researchers would have to prove that manipulating the GAD 
gene would not cause dangerous side effects. He said the gene has 
no known function in the pancreas, but it is present in the brain.

</P>
<P>
	``She didn't have a lot of room to find me, and she did, and I  
missed it a little bit, but because the ball was hit so hard, all I 
had to do was kind of redirect it,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States dominated the first half, holding the  
Netherlands without a shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dominance, the lead was only 1-0 at halftime on  
Milbrett's first goal. Julie Foudy made a run to the end line and 
centered the ball, and Milbrett knocked it home for her 56th career 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Marleen Wissink kept the Netherlands in the game in  
the opening half, stopping Brandi Chastain's penalty kick in the 
fourth minute and making a diving save on Chastain in the 18th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States missed two other chances when Chastain put  
Hamm's corner kick over the crossbar, and again when Hamm hit the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second half, Milbrett took a pass from Chastain in the  
60th minute, made a move on a defender and came in on a breakaway. 
She faked Wissink to the ground and passed to a wide-open Cindy 
Parlow, who tapped it in. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett then set up Kristine Lilly six minutes later and capped  
off her night by setting up Shannon MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go out there and play every game and do what I  
can,'' Milbrett said. ``If that means goals and assists, great. If 
that means helping out my team however else I can, that's how it 
goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams are touring in advance of the World Cup, to be held in  
the United States from June 19-July 10. The United States, 5-1 on 
its tour, plays the Netherlands again Sunday in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Wins Again in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A federal jury handed the tobacco  
industry its second victory in four days Thursday, deciding Brown &AMP; 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. was not at fault in the case of a smoker 
who died of lung cancer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Steele's family had sued for $26 million, claiming the  
nation's third-largest tobacco company sold him an unreasonably 
dangerous product. The factory worker picked up the habit in his 
late teens or early 20s, smoked 1 1/2 to two packs a day -- mostly 
Kools -- and died at 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Gary White said Steele ``was quite aware of the  
dangers, but the pleasures outweighed the dangers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a jury in Memphis, Tenn., cleared B&AMP;W and two other  
tobacco companies of liability in the deaths of three smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal, while the $51.5 million award in California was halved by a 
judge. On Thursday, the judge in the Oregon case slashed that 
damage award from $79.5 million to $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Missouri case, B&AMP;W argued that Steele never tried to quit  
smoking and that he was exposed to a host of cancer-causing 
chemicals through jobs at an aluminum foundry and at a brick-making 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict ``reflects recognition by the jury that Brown &AMP;  
Williamson acted responsibly in the processes of researching, 
testing and designing our products,'' said B&AMP;W attorney Steven 
McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury's conclusions are consistent with the majority of  
court decisions, agreeing that smoking is a matter of personal 
choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family's attorney, J. Michael Cronan, said there will be no  
appeal.

	China, U.S. Agree To Talk  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang  
Zemin have agreed to talk, a sign that the tensions may be easing 
with China over NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
Jiang had avoided talking to Clinton since the bombing Saturday, 
which killed three people. His readiness to talk was conveyed by 
Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing, who took a condolence book to the 
White House for Clinton to sign. ``He indicated a willingness to 
talk, and we're setting up the call,'' said National Security 
Council spokesman David Leavy. It was unclear whether the call 
could be arranged before tomorrow.

	Apaches Ready For Combat  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Apache helicopters are ready for  
combat in Yugoslavia, but NATO has yet to ask President Clinton for 
the official go-ahead to use them. The question of when -- and even 
if -- the Apaches will go into action against Serb forces in Kosovo 
has been a topic of speculation for weeks, in large part because 
the low-flying helicopters are vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. 
Their use would raise the risk of American battlefield casualties.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure, Senate Republicans retreated  
today on gun control. They called for fresh restrictions on sales 
at gun shows less than 24 hours after rejecting them despite public 
outrage over last month's high school shootings in Colorado. But 
Democrats denounced the new offer, saying it contained numerous 
loopholes. ``It's the most Swiss-cheesy bill I've ever seen,'' said 
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of a charter bus that crashed and  
killed 22 people was fired from bus companies in 1996 and 1989 
after testing positive for marijuana four times, authorities said 
today. A federal investigator also confirmed a report that Frank 
Bedell, 46, tested positive for marijuana when he was hospitalized 
Sunday after the bus veered off a highway and plunged into an

	Rwanda Says Congo Is Backing Hutus  
</P>
<P>
	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda insisted today that its troops will  
remain in Congo, accusing the central African country of preparing 
rebels to overthrow the Rwandan government. Rwanda has troops in 
neighboring Congo to support rebels fighting against the government 
of Congolese President Laurent Kabila. After nine months of 
fighting, the rebels have swept through the eastern half of Congo. 
The Hutu militiamen fled Rwanda into neighboring Congo in July 1994 
after the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front won power and ended the 
state-sponsored massacres of at least 500,000 minority Tutsis and 
politically moderate Hutus, earlier that year.

	EPA Says Pollution Up After Decline  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The amount of toxic chemicals released into  
the environment by industrial plants increased by 2.2 percent in 
1997, ending years of steady decline, the Environmental Protection 
Agency said today. The increase in total releases of 644 toxic 
chemicals by 21,490 facilities was attributed largely to plants 
sending more metal wastes to landfills and other disposal sites, 
instead of to recycling centers. That was because in 1997, the year 
the latest data covered, metal recycling prices increased, 
officials said. Before 1997, releases had been trending down each 
year since the reporting began in 1988, although companies are 
generating more waste during production.

Published by Random House/Villard, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed:

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- One of two men charged in a scheme that bilked  
investors out of $20 million pleaded guilty Thursday to charges of 
racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Holmberg, 34, faces five years and one month in federal  
prison under a plea deal with prosecutors that also requires him to 
testify against alleged coconspirator, Slobodan Lunic. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say that from August 1995 through September 1998 the  
two men used a sophisticated national marketing campaign to sell 
pay telephones to about 2,000 would-be investors. The investors 
were promised handsome monthly profits as a result of calls made 
from their telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Holmberg used the money to buy expensive cars  
and gold coins.

	Lunic has pleaded innocent. His trial is scheduled to start June

<HEADLINE> Judge Awards $5M in HIV Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YORK, S.C. (AP) -- A judge has ordered a man to pay his former  
girlfriend $5 million for infecting her with the AIDS virus -- part 
of what her attorney described as a grudge against women. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Buford Greer awarded $1 million in actual damages and $4  
million in punitive damages to the woman Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, identified in court papers as Jane Doe, received a  
verdict in her favor in November after her former boyfriend failed 
to show up to defend himself. The man, identified only as John Doe, 
did not appear for the damages hearing either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this verdict sends a message to people that you can't  
do this,'' said the woman's lawyer, Randall Hood. ``If you are 
HIV-positive, it is your duty to inform your partner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends the man never told the woman he had HIV --  
the virus that causes AIDS -- when they began dating five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hood said the woman had a long-term, monogamous relationship  
with the man, but the man had a grudge against women and decided to 
infect her.

<HEADLINE> Admiral Tapped As China Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retired Adm. Joseph W. Prueher, who led all  
U.S. forces in the Pacific during a particularly tense period in 
U.S.-Chinese relations, has been picked to be America's ambassador 
to Beijing, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher, 56, would succeed James Sasser, who has wanted to leave  
for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection of Prueher comes at another moment of rocky  
relations with China, after NATO warplanes mistakenly bombed the 
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, triggering angry protests across 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	The nomination is expected to be announced soon by President  
Clinton. It is subject to confirmation by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher, who left as Pacific commander in March, formerly  
commanded the Navy's 6th Fleet and was U.S. Naval Academy 
commandant from 1989 to 1991. He retired May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has been unusual in modern times for career military  
leaders to be named ambassador, it is not unprecedented. One of 
Prueher's predecessors at the Pacific Command, Adm. William Crowe, 
went on to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then 
ambassador to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Prueher, Navy Cmdr. Brian Cullen, said Prueher  
would not comment publicly until his nomination is announced by the 
president. ``He's honored to be considered,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher's selection ends a months-long search in which a handful  
of officials declined the post. ``It's a tough assignment, no 
matter who's in the job,'' said National Security Council spokesman 
Michael Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're looking for is a qualified person who has the  
president's ear and can speak authoritatively in China,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher was commander of the unified Pacific Command until  
March. While improving military ties with China, he also sent 
American warships into the Straits of Taiwan in 1996 to warn China 
not to use war games to disrupt elections in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this spring, Prueher was selected by Defense Secretary  
William Cohen to head the U.S. side of a joint American-Italian 
review of flight safety procedures for American aircraft operating 
from Italian bases. Those procedures came under scrutiny after a 
low-flying Marine flew into a ski gondola in the Italian Alps, 
killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Prueher succeeded in satisfying Italian demands for more Italian  
control of air operations there. 
</P>
<P>
	At his change-of-command ceremony in Hawaii in February, Prueher  
was described by Cohen as a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe Prueher is exactly what he appears to be; a man of  
principle, free of self-doubt. A man of wisdom, free of narrow 
thoughts. A man of courage, free of fear,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said Prueher's stewardship of U.S. military forces in the  
Pacific would leave an enduring legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, the footprints of his leadership stretch from  
Washington to Beijing, from Anchorage to Australia,'' Cohen said. 
``So long as Joe Prueher has been on the watch, there has never 
been a doubt about America's resolve and commitment to the Pacific 
region.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Targets Online Investment Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The catchy staccato strains of the ``Mission  
Impossible'' theme fill the darkened ballroom of the Capital 
Hilton. Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission are 
showing a flashy video on Internet topics at a conference, and 
they've gotten to the part dealing with the agency's enforcement 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Is policing the Internet against burgeoning investment fraud an  
impossible mission for the SEC? No, the regulators say, but it's 
getting very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	As it seeks to bolster its ability to fight online fraud, the  
SEC could be getting help from Congress, where two Republican 
senators are proposing an increase in its budget and greater leeway 
in the kind of enforcement actions it can take. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the SEC gets the help the lawmakers are offering,  
however, the agency's crime-fighting powers will continue to be 
hampered in several ways. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC, an independent federal agency, can file only civil  
lawsuits against suspected violators. Unlike the Justice 
Department, it cannot put anyone in jail. And unlike state 
securities regulators, SEC fraud-fighters don't have the legal 
authority to go undercover online, although they can and do conduct 
Internet surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other limits: The market watchdog agency can bar  
brokers who have violated the law from the brokerage industry, but 
not from other financial activities such as promoting stocks. And 
while it has aggressively gone after people and companies engaging 
in Internet fraud with civil fines and court orders compelling them 
to refrain from such activity, it doesn't have authority to shut 
down Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, enforcement attorneys and auditors have been  
leaving the SEC at a worrisome pace for lucrative jobs in private 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Against this background, the SEC and state regulators are  
battling a new form of fraud that is proliferating in Internet junk 
mail, online newsletters, electronic ``chat rooms'' and Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Internet is everywhere, unscrupulous stock promoters  
anywhere in the world can cloak themselves in anonymity and lure 
investors across the country, who have lost millions in such 
schemes in recent years. No longer do promoters have to give 
customers the hard sell over the telephone in unsolicited calls. 
</P>
<P>
	But securities regulators still operate under the old rule book.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a certain breed of bottom-feeders who are simply not  
deterred by the prospect of civil injunctions or even stiff 
monetary penalties,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said 
recently. ``There is no other ... deterrence for them than the 
threat of a life behind bars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To create that deterrent, the SEC has been working closely with  
criminal prosecutors from the Justice Department and the offices of 
state attorneys general and local district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency has nearly doubled the size of its ``Cyberforce''  
team, which prowls the Internet on the lookout for fraud, to 200 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., chairman of a Senate Appropriations  
subcommittee, recently proposed increasing the SEC's budget, now at 
$337.4 million, by $5.5 million next year to fight Internet fraud. 
That would bring the agency's funding to the level requested by the 
Clinton administration and the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond manpower and money, the SEC is also looking to expand its  
enforcement reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker and other officials laid out the scope of Internet  
investment fraud at recent hearings by a Senate investigative 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker acknowledged that with 850 attorneys and other  
enforcement employees nationwide to pursue all types of financial 
fraud, including the online variety, ``We are certainly challenged, 
if not strained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after the hearings, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the  
subcommittee's chairwoman, proposed legislation that would: 
</P>
<P>
	--Give the SEC legal authority to ban brokers who violate the law  
not just from the brokerage industry but also from promoting 
stocks. A significant amount of Internet fraud has come from 
promoters touting high-risk, small-company stocks without 
disclosing that they were paid to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow the SEC to bring ``follow-up'' cases based on enforcement  
actions by state securities regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are ``tools that would be very valuable for the  
SEC to have,'' said Bradley Skolnik, Indiana's securities 
commissioner and president-elect of the North American Securities 
Administrators Association. ``They are long overdue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its third nationwide ``sweep'' against Internet fraud, the  
SEC on Wednesday announced it had charged 18 people and eight 
companies with using the Web to sell bogus securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Online investment fraud also can take the form of stock-price  
manipulation schemes, deceptive stock touting, investment pyramid 
schemes and unlicensed brokering or advising on investments.

<HEADLINE>  Wordly Manner: Preakness Contender? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Beware of Worldly Manner in Saturday's  
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant trainer Tom Albertrani said the Dubai-based colt has  
thrived at Churchill Downs since his seventh-place finish in the 
Kentucky Derby May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the Derby in great shape, and we're  
confident,'' Albertrani said Thursday at Pimlico, a day after the 
colt shipped in from Kentucky. ``The Derby tuned him up a little. 
He's put on weight and he's more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race served as a prep race of sorts for Worldly Manner, who  
did not race officially as a 3-year-old leading up to the Kentucky 
Derby. His only race was a private trial in Dubai, United Arab 
Emirates, where he finished first. 
</P>

	But his strong effort in the 1 1/4-mile Derby -- he was contending  
for the lead with Cat Thief entering the stretch -- was received 
well by owners Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and Sheikh Maktoum al 
Maktoum. Charismatic, a 31-1 shot, won the Derby by a neck over 
Menifee in a 19-horse field.

with it,'' Albertrani said, adding that Sheikh Mohammed will attend 
the Preakness. ``We were excited at the quarter pole, but the last 
100 yards he got a little weary. You can say he will improve off 
that race.''

	The Preakness distance is 1 3-16 miles, 1-16th of a mile shorter  
than the Derby.

	Worldly Manner, who will be ridden again by Jerry Bailey, leaves  
from the No. 10 post and was 12-1 in the morning line. In his final 
workout Tuesday, he went 5 furlongs in 1:01 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was trained by Bob Baffert as a 2-year-old, but  
John Mabee sold the colt for a reported $5 million. Before the 
Derby, Worldly Manner's last official race was a victory in the Del 
Mar Futurity last September.

	Asked if Saeed bin Suroor might consider changing training  
methods and send the sheikh's horses to run in traditional Derby 
preps, Albertrani said: ``Maybe in the future we'll try a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he needed a race mentally more than physically,'' he  
added. ``Jerry asked him to come out running and he didn't realize 
he was going to take the bit and keep it.''

<HEADLINE>  Wordly Manner: Preakness Contender? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Beware of Worldly Manner in Saturday's  
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant trainer Tom Albertrani said the Dubai-based colt has  
thrived at Churchill Downs since his seventh-place finish in the 
Kentucky Derby May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the Derby in great shape, and we're  
confident,'' Albertrani said Thursday at Pimlico, a day after the 
colt shipped in from Kentucky. ``The Derby tuned him up a little. 
He's put on weight and he's more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race served as a prep race of sorts for Worldly Manner, who  
did not race officially as a 3-year-old leading up to the Kentucky 
Derby. His only race was a private trial in Dubai, United Arab 
Emirates, where he finished first. 
</P>
<P>
	But his strong effort in the 1 1/4-mile Derby -- he was contending  
for the lead with Cat Thief entering the stretch -- was received

<HEADLINE> 15 Hurt in Calif. Tour Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNIGHTS FERRY, Calif. (AP) -- A tour bus returning from Yosemite  
National Park may have been speeding when it plunged 70 feet off a 
highway and into a ravine, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen of the 31 people aboard were hurt Wednesday, most with  
broken bones, cuts and bruises. None of the injuries was considered 
life threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, filled with Japanese tourists, was headed for San  
Francisco when it veered off the westbound lane of Highway 120 in 
Tuolumne County and dropped 70 feet down an embankment, officials 
said. The bus landed upright. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy feet is a long way, so it could have been a lot  
worse,'' said California Highway Patrol Office Matthew Radke. 
</P>
<P>
	One witness told investigators the bus was traveling 75 mph and  
passing traffic prior to the wreck. The speed limit in the area for 
buses and big rigs is 55 mph, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was operated by Visit USA Tours of San Francisco. The  
company, reached by phone early this morning, declined to comment 
on the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident occurred just three days after 22 people were  
killed when a charter bus on its way to a Mississippi casino 
careened off a New Orleans interstate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, authorities said the driver of that bus, Frank  
Bedell, was rushed by ambulance to a hospital less than 12 hours 
before he reported for work. He was treated for severe dehydration 
and low blood pressure -- a condition that made him nearly pass out 
-- and released, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, the luxury bus filled with 42 mostly elderly  
passengers hurtled off Interstate 610 and slammed into an 
embankment in New Orleans' City Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, who has become the focus of the federal probe into the  
nation's most deadly crash in a decade, remains on a ventilator in 
critical condition and has been unable to speak with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	National Transportation Safety Board investigators said Bedell's  
health is a key component of their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, 46, suffers from congestive heart failure and undergoes  
dialysis three times a week, conditions that state officials have 
said would be grounds for removing his commercial driver's license 
had they known about them.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards $4.45M Against NRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The National Rifle Association on Thursday  
was ordered to pay $4.45 million in damages to a former NRA board 
member and her husband who accused the organization of bullying and 
disparaging them. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit by Sally and Kenneth Brodbeck of Des Moines, Iowa,  
stems from an altercation with a security guard at the NRA's 
national convention in Philadelphia last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury awarded the couple damages for public  
disparagement and battery. Security guard Gordon Russell was 
ordered to pay $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA lawyers said they will appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Brodbeck said he was sitting in a chair videotaping a speech by  
his wife, an NRA board member at the time, when Russell ordered him 
to stop taping and tackled him when he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA lawyers said Mrs. Brodbeck was part of a faction opposing  
the group now in power at the NRA. They said the incident was 
staged to disrupt the convention last June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlton Heston, who was elected NRA president later on the day  
of the altercation, testified last week that Brodbeck had faked a 
``lousy fall'' by tumbling out of his chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brodbecks alleged their reputations were tarnished and sued  
after the NRA refused to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel vindicated,'' Brodbeck said after the verdict. ``We  
just wanted our reputation back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, at the NRA's convention in Denver, Mrs.  
Brodbeck was defeated in her bid to keep her seat on the board.

<HEADLINE> Slain Police Officers Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --Wearing buttons and T-shirts bearing the names  
of their loved ones, thousands of friends and families paid tribute 
Thursday night to the police officers who have died in the line of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowds assembled within the walls of the marble National Law  
Enforcement Officers Memorial, where the names of 312 police 
officers were added to the 15,000 already engraved there. Among 
those commemorated were the two U.S. Capitol police officers slain 
by a gunman in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno called the deaths of those two  
officers -- Jacob J. Chestnut and John Gibson -- a powerful wake-up 
call for the nation to the kinds of dangers officers at every level 
and all across the country face daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lives led by the individuals of our law enforcement  
community are not easy,'' Reno said. She said most people in other 
professions cannot imagine what it is like to go to work with the 
fear of being killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the crime rate has fallen, Reno said the nation cannot  
forget the lives lost in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``America tends to be complacent when crime goes down,'' she  
said. But to honor the memory of the officers, she promised, ``We 
will continue our efforts and together ultimately eliminate the 
culture of violence in our nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Reno called for steps such as background checks for  
gun buyers to limit the weapons that end up in the hands of 
criminals. She also urged families and communities to reach out to 
children, teaching them the difference between television and 
reality. Police especially can be powerful mentors for young 
adults, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends, families and colleagues holding candles for the vigil  
illuminated the memorial as the outside lights dimmed. Many wore 
T-shirts and badges honoring loved ones. The slate-colored memorial 
-- just blocks from Washington's district and federal courthouses -- 
was adorned with roses, wreaths and pictures beside the names of 
the slain officers. 
</P>
<P>
	For Evette Wimberly, the event was a reminder of the many people  
who have shared her tragedy. Her husband, Kenneth Lee Wimberly Sr., 
32, a deputy sheriff in Gwinnett County, Ga., was working security 
at an apartment complex in late September when a man took 
Wimberly's gun and shot him dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank God it's not all in vain,'' said Mrs. Wimberly,  
accompanied by her children and wearing a button with her husband's 
image on it. ``It's helping me because I realize I am not alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1991, the memorial bears the names of nearly 15,000  
federal, state and local officers who have died in the line of 
duty. The 312 newly added names include 156 officers who died in 
1998 plus 156 officers whose names were discovered by memorial 
researchers over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Cut Up to 7,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Boeing Co.'s recovery from two years of  
financial troubles suffered a setback Thursday as the aerospace 
company announced that a decline in orders for its F-15 fighter 
plane will force the elimination of 6,500 to 7,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts will all take place at the company's massive St.  
Louis manufacturing operation and will represent roughly 35 percent 
of the work force there. The cuts will come from the ranks of 
management and union members and are expected to be completed by 
mid-2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has previously announced that it planned to eliminate  
anywhere from 43,000 to 53,000 jobs in coming years. The company 
said that Thursday's announcement pushes its estimate to the higher 
end of that range. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in July of 1998, Boeing predicted that its total work force  
of 238,000 would be reduced to roughly 185,000 to 195,000. Boeing 
currently employs 219,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing has blamed most of its job cuts up until now on reduced  
demand from Asian customers who were suffering from that region's 
prolonged recession. Most of the previous cuts came in the Puget 
Sound area in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing suffered another blow last month when the Greek  
government signed a contract to buy Lockheed Martin's F-16. The 
F-15 costs about $55 million each, while the F-16, an advanced 
fighter, goes for about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks after Boeing lost the $3.5 billion sale to Greece, the  
Israeli government postponed a $2.5 billion F-15 purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek order alone could have kept the Boeing line open two  
more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we completed an assessment of our business environment  
based on the April 30 decision by the government of Greece, we 
decided to let our team and the community know as soon as possible 
what to expect for the foreseeable future,'' said Jerry Daniels, 
Boeing vice president, general manager and St. Louis site director. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain committed to St. Louis and are taking these steps to  
ensure our competitiveness on our existing work, including a 
multiyear contract on C-17 and a proposed multiyear buy of the 
FA-18EF and on future programs, such as the joint strike fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs of between 800 and 900 St. Louis workers were announced  
earlier. About 300 of those already have been given notice, 
officials said. About 300 to 400 workers are to be let go every 
month until the reduction is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-15, first manufactured in 1972, is one of the old and  
best-known fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniels said displaced St. Louis employees may find work at  
other Boeing sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders said they were shocked by the size of the layoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	``We knew there would be layoffs, but not of this magnitude,''  
said Rick Smith, president of District 837 of the International 
Association of Machinists &AMP; Aerospace Workers. ``When they lost the 
sales, we all expected something to happen, but not this quickly 
and not this big. These are all good, relatively high-paying jobs. 
It's not going to be pretty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri lawmakers said loss of the F-15 jeopardizes U.S.  
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``The F-15 is the very best fighter airplane in the world,''  
said Sen. John Ashcroft. ``If we allow the line to go down where we 
don't have the next generation available to us, we put U.S. 
security at risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 F-15s have been delivered to the U.S. Air Force,  
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Japan. Current orders for the F-15 will be 
completed by early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jacobs, a Boeing analyst at Ragen Mackenzie Inc. in  
Seattle, said the production declines in St. Louis will hurt 
Boeing's revenue in 2000 and 2001, but the company may also face a 
longer term problem rehiring skilled workers after that. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing will need these workers as it ramps up production of the  
F-18 Super Hornet, a new carrier-based fighter which is being built 
in St. Louis, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the challenges Boeing will now face is getting the  
skilled work force to come back when they're needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs added that the F-15s are at the tail end of their  
delivery cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if Boeing would have won the order from Greece and got  
the full order from Israel, it would probably have still resulted 
in job reductions in St. Louis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a bit of good news for Boeing Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Boeing said it agreed to protect more than 3,000 Puget Sound  
area maintenance and facilities jobs that had been scheduled for 
elimination. The company said it saved those jobs after union 
workers agreed to productivity improvements.

<HEADLINE> Cartoonist Saul Steinberg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Satirical cartoonist Saul Steinberg, who created  
hundreds of drawings for The New Yorker, including the famous image 
of what the world looks like to the egocentric Manhattanite, has 
died at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who died Wednesday, turned out angular and often  
brooding art that was sometimes compared to that of Pablo Picasso 
and Joan Miro. 
</P>
<P>
	His drawings were full of thin, sharp lines and populated with  
cats, dogs and crocodiles -- his symbols for primitive political 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saul Steinberg was our Picasso, our great original,'' said New  
Yorker editor David Remnick. ``We'll miss his eye, his line, his 
language, his wit and his friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg drew 85 covers and 642 other drawings for the magazine  
over 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his most famous cartoons was ``View of the World from 9th  
Avenue,'' which appeared on the magazine's March 29, 1976, cover. 
The drawing is a bird's-eye view of the world looking west from 
Manhattan, with the detailed streets of New York fading into 
ill-defined clumps for the world beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The drawing pokes fun at New Yorkers' purported tendency to see  
the city as the center of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Saul Steinberg showing New Yorkers how to position  
themselves in the broader world,'' said Francoise Mouly, cover 
editor for the magazine and a close friend. ``He was making fun of 
New Yorkers, but he was including himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Romania in 1914, Steinberg studied at the University of  
Bucharest. He later moved to Italy, where he earned a doctorate in 
architecture in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked in architecture for only a matter of months. But the  
precision he learned as an architect was apparent in his drawings 
through what he called ``reasoned lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't quite belong to the art, cartoon or magazine world, so  
the art world doesn't quite know where to place me,'' Steinberg 
once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg sold his first drawing while living in Italy in 1935.  
A Jew, he fled the country as World War II heated up, using a phony 
passport he made with his own rubber stamp. He was turned away at 
Ellis Island and sent to Santo Domingo, where he sent drawings to 
The New Yorker in the hopes they would bring him to America. He 
arrived in 1942 and had his first gallery show a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming a U.S. citizen, Steinberg joined the Navy, where  
he was assigned to teach Chinese guerrillas how to blow up bridges. 
Unable to find a common language, Steinberg instructed them through 
drawings. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg is survived by Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, whom he  
married in 1943. They were separated in the 1970s but never 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
	No funeral plans were made public.

<HEADLINE> Aged Storm Victims Face Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE, Okla. (AP) -- Kathryn Ceyler, a widow in her 70s, hid in a  
closet when twisters shattered the home where she had lived for 29 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhurt but shaken, she wanted no part of the crisis centers and  
food kitchens that sprang up around the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm an independent woman,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	A week later, however, she walked into the First Baptist Church  
in Moore for a hot meal and some groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never asked for any help in my life,'' she said, then  
admitted she needed some. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ceyler is among the many elderly victims of last week's  
tornadoes who have been forced to start over at a time of life when 
they may be least prepared to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	While many can draw on past experience overcoming hardships,  
others in fragile health or on fixed incomes will struggle to 
recover from their losses, Red Cross clinical psychologist Joyce 
Libethe said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're 70 or 80 years old you think, `How can I rebuild at  
this age?''' said Ms. Libethe, who has been counseling Oklahoma 
tornado survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	With support networks weakened as friends and relatives die and  
children move away, senior citizens often have only strangers to 
turn to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they've gone 70 years taking care of themselves and now  
have to go out and ask for help and that's not easy for them,'' Ms. 
Libethe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The anger, shock and depression that usually follow such  
devastation can be overwhelming for anyone, but even more so for 
some elderly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see a lot of withdrawal,'' she said. ``You might find  
people thinking, `I've lived a long life, now this has happened. Do 
I have the energy to cope?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlene Robb, 63, of Moore has asked herself that question.  
Breathing problems, a ruptured disk and an illness that causes 
chronic pain already had sapped some of the joy from her retirement 
from hospital work. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the storm destroyed her 23-year-old home.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's too much work ahead of me to even think of relaxing,''  
she said Thursday as she ate lunch at a church food kitchen. ``I 
just keep pushing ahead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.D. Billings, 66, retired from landscaping work four years ago  
and spent much of his free time fishing until he was diagnosed with 
lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife, Christine, drove out of their neighborhood 15  
minutes before the funnel clouds mowed through, chewing up the back 
of the Moore home where they had lived for 27 years. They had 
dropped their homeowner insurance just before the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just hopeful,'' Billings said as he talked with  
neighbors whose house was demolished. ``We'll try to rebuild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doris McLeod, 84, a widow for 17 years, was found between her  
toilet and bathtub, buried beneath 4 feet of debris and screaming 
for help after the twister moved through her Oklahoma City 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	She lost her wedding ring, a watch her husband had given her and  
all her clothes except one dress. Her son has helped her find 
another home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just keep your faith in the Lord,'' she said, as she  
filled a cart with groceries at First Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 44 people killed in the May 3 tornadoes, nine were 70 or  
older. The senior citizens who survived are being given special 
care at First Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to find the people who are too proud to get  
help,'' said Bud Parrish, First Baptist missions director. ``That's 
always their phrase: `I don't want to bother anyone.'''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Second in Winston Cup Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Although Dale Jarrett has gone 14 straight  
races without winning, the number that matters most to him is 55 -- 
the amount of points by which he trails Jeff Burton in the Winston 
Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
	And rather than fret about his lack of success, Jarrett views  
the Pontiac 400 on Saturday night at Richmond International Raceway 
as the next chance to prove he's ready to unseat two-time defending 
series champion Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a long time to go,'' Jarrett said. ``Jeff Gordon is  
still the man to beat, and that's not to take anything away from 
Mark Martin or Jeff Burton or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of the guys that are up there in the top five, he's the  
only one to win a Winston Cup championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett has spent the last three seasons as a contender. He  
finished second to Gordon in 1997, third behind Terry Labonte and 
runner-up Gordon in 1996 and third last year behind Gordon and 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	And Jarrett has been around long enough to know May is as  
important as November in the championship battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something you have to concentrate on from the very  
beginning,'' he said of the title that rewards consistency more 
even than victories. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend figures to challenge Jarrett and his Robert Yates  
Racing team as much as any because their luck hasn't been good at 
RIR of late. Last year in this race, he started fourth and finished 
second, nudged off the lead by eventual winner Labonte with two 
laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, Jarrett started seventh in the Exide 400, but went  
backward. He limping home to a 16th-place finish that cost him 60 
points when Gordon and Martin ran second and third to Burton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last race was one of the worst we've had at Richmond,''  
said Jarrett, who won at the track in the fall of 1997. ``We know 
what went wrong then, and we want to get back to those 
opportunities of having a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, right behind Jarrett in the points race, also  
hasn't won this season. But as one of three Pontiac drivers in the 
top nine in points, Labonte says he can't blame his manufacturer. 
Many have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte's teammate with Joe Gibbs Racing, rookie Tony Stewart,  
is sixth in the points race, also without a victory. Ward Burton is 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people can argue that we don't win races because  
we're running a Pontiac,'' Labonte said. ``I feel like everything 
is pretty good between the makes right now ... probably the best 
it's been in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti, 14th in points, posted the only Pontiac victory  
in the first 10 races, surging from far back to win last month in 
Martinsville. But Labonte thinks several others are capable of 
matching that feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can count out many Pontiac teams now,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Bill Walton a Broadcaster in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	During his playing days, Bill Walton rarely spoke to reporters,  
or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Just try to stop him now.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Famer and NBC analyst, who missed more than nine of  
his 14 NBA seasons due to countless injuries, seems to be making up 
for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
	Walton worked two games for NBC last weekend and will do two  
more this weekend. In between, there are speaking engagements, 
charity events, a couple of hours a day with MSNBC's online site, 
and a temporary playoff gig with Turner Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the best things about broadcasting is that I'm able to  
work every day,'' Walton said. ``My legs weren't durable enough to 
play every day, but hopefully my voice will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when the 7-foot redhead avoided talking because  
of a severe stuttering problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, at age 29, he was taught how to speak properly by New York  
broadcaster Marty Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always tried to have a good working relationship with the  
media, but I was just so painfully shy and unable to speak,'' 
Walton said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Walton accepted Turner's offer to do playoff games  
was the possibility that he'd be able to work with Marv Albert 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert and Walton were two-thirds of the NBC team that called  
the NBA Finals for three consecutive seasons from 1995-97, along 
with Matt Goukas. Thanks to the teamwork of NBC and Turner, they 
were reunited this week for the Bucks-Pacers series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really glad that NBC let Bill work at Turner,'' Albert  
said. ``It's very unusual that things like this happen, but the 
whole climate of TV has changed with people working for different 
networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton had his 30th operation nine years ago. He can't run -- and  
isn't even able to play his sons in a pickup game. But when he was 
doing the Indiana game last week, Pacers coach and former teammate 
Larry Bird somehow got the big man in motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was still trying to block his shot,'' Walton said. ``I never  
could even when I was healthy. I'm a very slow learner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walton has realized that you can't change the past and he's  
happy being able to stay around the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having the time of my life and I'm doing all these games  
because this is a dream for me,'' he said. ``I am so amazed at how 
much broadcasting is like playing. The only difference is that I 
don't need an operation after every game.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE BIG SHOW:* Finally, ``Sports Night'' creator Aaron Sorkin  
admitted the inspiration for his show: Keith Olbermann. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorkin, who also writes the episodes, just completed his first  
season of the show last week. Despite disappointing ratings, 
``Sports Night'' has been renewed by ABC for a second season. 
</P>
<P>
	Olbermann, the former ESPN ``SportsCenter'' host, interviewed  
Sorkin in the current issue of Esquire and was invited to be on the 
show -- even though he now works at Fox, rival of the Disney-owned 
ABC and ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the offer came only after Olbermann, who is always in  
search of more air time, pushed for an appearance on the series 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* USA's French Open coverage will include live West  
Coast coverage and will show both women's semifinals for the first 
time. ... NBC has signed an extension that will keep the Breeders' 
Cup through 2001. ... The Houston Rockets have lost their last 14 
games on NBC. ... Former Brave and Dodger Brett Butler called his 
first of about 10 Atlanta games on Fox Sports Net this season. ... 
NBC's regular-season NBA ratings dropped 7 percent while Turner's 
improved 3 percent from last season. ... James Worthy made his 
Turner NBA playoff debut last week. ... Albert said there have been 
ongoing talks with Fox about joining its NFL team, but nothing has 
been finalized yet.

<HEADLINE> New Bus Service Helps Amish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMERVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- To travel from this small village to the  
center of local government, members of this Amish community have to 
drive their horse-drawn buggies along a busy roadway as cars and 
trucks speed ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
	For a buggy driver traveling 10 mph, the 30-mile trip can be  
hazardous and stressful. But now, officials in Medina County are 
offering people of the religious sect a new mode of transportation 
with a once-a-week bus route. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the roads are busier than they were,'' said Annie  
Keim, who thinks her Amish community in Homerville will appreciate 
the new county-run bus service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish are known for shunning modern conveniences and taught  
to live apart from the world and abstain from worldly goods. Some 
150,000 Amish live in 22 states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most don't own motor vehicles, they can ride in  
vehicles driven by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Medina County is not the only government concerned about traffic  
in Amish communities. In Lower Oxford, Pa. last fall, county 
officials began offering bus rides for children walking to school 
out of concern that one of could be struck in busy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	In Medina County, the bus service, called the Homerville  
Community Circulator, debuted last Friday. It runs one round trip 
between Homerville, located about 45 miles southwest of Cleveland, 
and Medina, which is home to county government offices and courts, 
a hospital and numerous stores. 
</P>
<P>
	John Jones, director of the Medina County Transportation  
Department, said Wednesday that only two people rode the first day, 
but four or five Amish stopped the bus to ask about the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	He expects ridership to grow as the 250-family Amish community  
in Homerville and adjacent Homer Township learns about the service. 
</P>
<P>
	The round trip costs $12.10, which Jones estimated is about half  
what a taxicab would charge. Riders can leave the bus and get back 
on three times on the same fare. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus service replaced a system like a taxicab service in  
which people phoned to request a ride. Most Amish don't have 
telephones and their mail requests sometimes were received too 
late, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least 14 deaths and 809 injuries in more than  
1,000 buggy accidents in Ohio since 1990. The state has begun 
building special lanes for buggies, but there are no buggy lanes in 
the Homerville area. 
</P>
<P>
	There are an estimated 45,000 Amish in Ohio, most living in  
Holmes County, 30 miles southwest of Akron.

<HEADLINE> Cartoonist Saul Steinberg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Saul Steinberg, a cartoonist whose work was  
compared to Pablo Picasso and is perhaps best known for his drawing 
showing New York City as the center of the world, has died. He was 
84. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who drew cartoons for The New Yorker magazine for  
more than 50 years, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. His 
brooding doodles were considered a fine art and drew comparisons to 
legendary painters such as Picasso and Duchamp. Art critic Harold 
Rosenberg described Steinberg as ``a writer of pictures, an 
architect of speech and sounds, a draftsman of political 
reflections.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Steinberg's most famous cartoons is ``View of the World  
from 9th Avenue (1975),'' which first appeared on the magazine's 
cover the following year. The drawing shows a bird's-eye view of 
the world looking west from Manhattan, with the great detail of New 
York streets fading into ill-defined clumps for the rest of the 
nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
	This perspective -- as seen in the cartoon from the standpoint of  
a chauvinistic Manhattanite -- spawned similar drawings for numerous 
cities, including London, Paris, Rome and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Romania in 1914, Steinberg studied at the University of  
Bucharest before moving to Italy, where he received a doctoral 
degree in architecture in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
	But Steinberg began drawing in 1934, quickly discovering his  
skill as a cartoonist. The New Yorker published its first Steinberg 
cartoon in 1941, a sketch of a reverse centaur. Steinberg arrived 
in the United States a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II he served in the U.S. Navy, and had tasks  
ranging from teaching Chinese guerrillas to blow up bridges, to 
producing counter-propaganda drawings meant to stir anti-Nazi 
sentiment within Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, his works included architectural fantasies, watercolor  
landscapes and vicious pictures of New York street life that 
indicated a pessimism about urban life. Among his images were 
depictions of Mickey Mouse as a terrorist clad in combat boots, 
doormen saluting as soldiers and building facades as frightening 
mazes. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg is survived by Hedda Lindenberg Sterne, whom he  
married in 1943. They were separated in the 1970s but never 
divorced.

<HEADLINE> Folic Acid Deficiency Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Folic acid deficiency has all but vanished in the  
United States since the government ordered food manufacturers to 
add the vitamin to flour, rice and other grain products, 
researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Folic acid is found naturally in green leafy vegetables and some  
other foods. If women eat too little of it when they become 
pregnant, they risk having babies with spina bifida and other 
neural tube defects. 
</P>
<P>
	To help protect against these birth defects, the Food and Drug  
Administration ordered manufacturers to begin fortifying foods with 
folic acid in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study, reported in the New England Journal of  
Medicine, is the first major effort to see what effect this has 
had. The researchers studied a group of mostly white, middle-aged 
residents of one Massachusetts town and looked at their blood 
levels of folic acid before and after the food fortification began. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that average blood levels of folic acid doubled. Just  
under 2 percent still had folic acid deficiency, compared with 22 
percent before the vitamin was added to food. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this shows is that there's really been quite a dramatic  
impact in this middle-aged population,'' said a co-author of the 
study, Dr. Irwin Rosenberg of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on 1,106 volunteers in the Framingham Heart  
Study, which has followed the cardiovascular health of residents of 
a Boston suburb for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The study hints that the extra folic acid could do more than  
reduce birth defects. Folic acid lowers levels of homocysteine, an 
amino acid that results naturally from the breakdown of protein. 
The study found average homocysteine levels fell about 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have found that people with high homocysteine  
levels have an elevated risk of heart trouble. However, there is no 
evidence that bringing down homocysteine will keep the heart 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Rosenberg said the latest findings could be good news for  
the heart if lowering homocysteine does turn out to be beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
	The prevalence of unusually high homocysteine levels fell from  
19 percent to 10 percent of the volunteers. Rosenberg said this 
large a drop could ``have a substantial effect on the calculated 
risk of heart disease and stroke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The March of Dimes and some other health organizations had urged  
the FDA to require higher levels of folic acid in food. Dr. Donald 
Mattison, the group's medical director, said the latest study 
``suggests to us that we should see some health benefits'' from the 
additive. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenberg said he believes the data mean that folic acid levels  
have increased substantially for everyone, not just middle-aged 
whites, but Mattison said this remains to be proved.

<HEADLINE> Summers Expected To Succeed Rubin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Larry Summers, the man President Clinton will  
nominate later today be the nation's next treasury secretary, has 
lately acted as the administration's fireman, assigned to contain 
economic brushfires as they've erupted around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, he worked behind the scenes to coordinate rescue  
efforts with the International Monetary Fund when Brazil 
unexpectedly moved to devalue its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A year earlier, when Indonesia balked at austerity measures  
imposed as part of an international bailout, Summers conducted a 
whirlwind six-day, seven-stop diplomatic mission through Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, with the plummeting yen threatening to trigger  
another round of financial turmoil, he jetted to Tokyo to press for 
bolder countermeasures to Japan's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	As deputy secretary of the treasury, Summers, 44, also has put  
his stamp on a wide range of high-profile economic issues, from 
tobacco taxes to global warming to Social Security reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a person of extraordinary talent and judgment,'' said  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Summers is poised to succeed his boss, Robert Rubin, and  
become the nation's 71st treasury secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to announce the long-rumored change at a Rose Garden  
ceremony later today, the White House said. Rubin, a former Wall 
Street investment banker, has told the president he plans to return 
to private life, leaving Treasury at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
	The outgoing secretary and his heir apparent, Summers, are a  
study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, former head of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., is suave and slim  
and wears impeccably tailored suits. The portly Summers, who was a 
full professor at Harvard University at the tender age of 28, 
sometimes gives the impression of a preoccupied professor who has 
trouble keeping his shirttail tucked in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin appears relaxed and amiable. Summers, who almost always  
works with an open can of Diet Coke at hand, is intense and seldom 
smiles. Aides and colleagues remark on his propensity to call them 
at home after 11 p.m. and have complained of feeling belittled by 
his cutting remarks. Still, even his critics concede the acuity of 
his analysis -- his ability to ``think outside the box'' and ``add 
value'' to deliberations on almost any topic. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers was an also-ran in the Cabinet selection sweepstakes of  
1993, when Clinton chose the more personable Laura Tyson to head 
his Council of Economic Advisers. But he has learned to wait in the 
wings with good grace, to poke fun at his own image and permit 
glimpses of his less stodgy side. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin and other top administration officials have worked  
assiduously to build Summers' public image, an important 
consideration for one of the few jobs in Washington where the wrong 
choice can throw financial markets into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, who once delighted in gently ribbing Summers in public,  
has lately shown more deference, asking ``Dr. Summers'' for his 
views. And Vice President Al Gore, has referred to Rubin and 
Summers as ``by far the best team our country has ever had at the 
Treasury Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, early Republican reaction to Summers' expected  
nomination, which the Senate must approve, was guarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people like Larry Summers. He's a likable fellow.  
But ... there's a lot of questions he'll have to answer to,'' said 
Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Summers would face any problems being confirmed,  
Nickles said, ``I'm not going to say. Let's wait and see if he's 
nominated and we'll have to consider his nomination seriously.''
