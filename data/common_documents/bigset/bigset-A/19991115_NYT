 &HT;    The incredible shrinking Florida Legislature
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Does Florida have too many legislators?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Feeney suspects so and since he is likely to be speaker
of the House in two years, he might do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Feeney believes a smaller Legislature would be more efficient,
more manageable, more Republican ... an altogether better place.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker designate won't venture a specific optimal size.
Perhaps the House, which now has 120 members, could be slimmed by
just a few seats or cut more dramatically to 100. Feeney also would
like to see the Senate reduced from 40 to about 30 senators.
Coincidentally about the average size of an elementary school
class.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many people distrust government, the idea of fewer
politicians in Tallahassee is an easy sell. Pushed out of
lawmaking, former officeholders would be forced to take up
productive work, get real jobs and pay for their own lunches. In
philosophy, this is not too different from welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to assume, too, that fewer dumb ideas would come out
of the Legislature if fewer people were around to hatch them and
nurture them.
</P>
<P>
   This hope, however, is based on the assumption that politicians
carry more or less the same number of dumb ideas per capita. And
that nobody would pick up the slack if there were a lull in the
production of dumb ideas.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure. In fact, I suspect the opposite is true. We would
get more dumb ideas in a smaller Legislature because there would be
fewer folks who might pause and say, ``Hey, that's a dumb idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving lots of people the chance to wonder aloud about dumb
ideas is what makes democracy work.
</P>
<P>
   That's my theory, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This is, I admit, a theory tainted with bias. Perhaps as a
columnist I have a vested interest in maintaining the number of
politicians roaming the state. Maybe I enjoy the spectacle of a
troublesome and inefficient Legislature. Could it be I just want
more trouble in Tallahassee? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I stand adamantly opposed to efficiency in
legislating. I want wasteful debate and second-guessing by people
who aren't with the program. I want passage of bills slowed. I want
marching orders to be disregarded, misinterpreted and willfully
opposed for no good reason. I'm for the uncertainty and
unmanageability of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Florida already has a small House for its size. We have only one
person representing every 124,000 Floridians. Up from one for every
53,000 in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Florida has a hugely mixed population _ retirees who
think of themselves as New Yorkers, dogs-in-the-pickup truck
Panhandle types, Bikers for Christ, Santeria priests, beach dudes,
old guys in guayaberas ... very often people who check ``other'' on
every form shoved their way _ and 120 legislators are supposed to
reflect and speak for the wishes of this big slice of humanity? It
isn't happening.
</P>
<P>
   Compare this to the state that is in many ways our opposite
among low-tax havens, New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire voters seem a lot alike by Florida standards,
especially in winter when they must all wear goofy hats, yet they
have one representative for every 3,000 parka wearers. Their House
of Representatives has 400 members. Party leaders must take to the
streets to grab enough people to keep the seats full.
</P>
<P>
   This arrangement might be chalked up to the long winters. New
Hampshire is a state full of people who are starved for
entertainment and they designed their state government and a
national presidential primary accordingly. But I envy them.
</P>
<P>
   Every hamlet has some voice in Concord. Every state road,
bridge, park and high school has an impassioned advocate.
</P>
<P>
   These are matters that get lost in Florida-style mega-districts.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the district, the more television-oriented the
campaign. The more television-oriented the campaigning, the more
important it is to raise money. The more important it is to raise
money, the bigger the influence of big-money donors.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for mega-districting? A bigger Legislature, not a
smaller one.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm going to say it: Florida needs more politicians.

 &HT;    I'm putty in my kitty's paws
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Picture this. Sharon (we're sisters-in-law
twice removed _ divorced from brothers) wanders in the back door
and hollers, ``Hallooo!'' as she climbs the stairs to my
second-floor office. She rounds the corner and stops. ``Why are you
doing that?'' she asks. I ask her ``Doing what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you sitting on the floor writing?'' I tell her to take
a look in my
</P>
<P>
   desk chair. She does and discovers Biddy the Siamese cat curled
up on the
</P>
<P>
   cushion. ``You could move the cat,'' she says like I should
already have known
</P>
<P>
   that. I try to explain that if I disturb her sunny nap she'll
ruin my afternoon. She'll begin by wiping out my desk, bumping file
baskets onto the floor and knocking over the picture of Amy and
Kristofor in their wedding finery. And if that doesn't work, she'll
rip leaves off the hibiscus plant.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon shakes her head. She doesn't understand. Her cat is an
owner-friendly
</P>
<P>
   calico whose only demand is for someone to be there to open the
door when she
</P>
<P>
   wants to sniff out the neighbor's mint bed. So I can't blame her
for not getting it.
</P>
<P>
   With Biddy and me it's different. We have an understanding; when
she talks, I
</P>
<P>
   listen. Like last night when she jumped on my chest, looked me
square in the
</P>
<P>
   eyeballs and let out a howl Steven Spielberg would kill for. I
know it's
</P>
<P>
   pointless to argue because she always outlasts me, so I roll out
of bed grumbling, shrug into my robe, and follow her down the
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   First, I check on Stella, our mild-mannered, milk-white lady
cat. She's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Fast asleep in her basket under the window seat _ next to the
radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Biddy has split for the kitchen and is howling like
she's down to her last bite of tuna. The problem is easy to spot.
The red catnip mouse (her favorite) is belly-up in the water dish.
This is what couldn't wait until morning and how I came to be
sitting on the kitchen floor at
</P>
<P>
   2 a.m. squeezing a wet mouse in paper towels. I put it on the
radiator under the kitchen sink to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy enjoys summer when the doors to the screened porches are
open. She loves to sit on the rail ``yikking'' at the birds. Often,
a squirrel who has long since learned that Biddy's on the inside
and he's not, will perch on the other half of the rail, just
outside the screen, and go nose-to-nose with her. They ``cluck''
and ``yikk'' until one or the other loses interest and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Biddy's nocturnal buddy, the ring-eyed raccoon who
uses our porch
</P>
<P>
   roof for his outhouse, will thump down from a nearby tree limb
for a peek
</P>
<P>
   through my office window to catch Biddy napping on the sill.
When he does, she
</P>
<P>
   shrieks for back-up. ``Sissy kitty,'' I say, reminding her she's
supposed to be fearless considering she's descended from a long and
distinguished line of cats that guarded the ancient temples.
</P>
<P>
   And when I sometimes doubt her intelligence, she brings me up
short. Like
</P>
<P>
   last night. It was rather late and I was reading in the easy
chair at the foot of my son's old bunk beds in the back bedroom.
Biddy had been napping contentedly in the bottom bunk but after a
while she wandered over, draped herself across the footboard, and
gazed longingly at the top bunk. ``Ye-oww,'' she demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get jump from the bottom bunk to the top one,'' I
explained without
</P>
<P>
   moving, ``you have to jump over here and launch from the back of
the chair like
</P>
<P>
   you always do.'' Biddy shook her head and yelled again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ye-owwww!'' Automatically I put down my book, got up, lifted
her from the bed
</P>
<P>
   and boosted her into the top bunk. She thanked me with a
``Mmm-row.'' Trust me, the only dummy in this house is a two-legged
one.
</P>
<P>
   But right now as I write, all's well in Biddy's kitty kingdom.
She's sprawled in a patch of sunshine, grinning and talking in her
sleep. I'm pretty sure I know what she's saying: ``This human is
putty in my paws.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right as usual.

   Homeworld's the place to beFOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Every year, a game comes out and kicks the incumbents in the
teeth. Last year it was Sierra's Half-Life, and now Sierra has done
it again with the release of Homeworld. Ever since Sierra released
a demo on the Web, buzz for this game has been building. It is
deserved. After a five-hour gaming session that lasted until 3
a.m., Homeworld sent this reviewer out into the world raving to all
who'd listen about how this game is gonna revolutionize real-time
strategy. Because, folks, it will. Forget StarCraft. Chuck Command
&AMP; Conquer. Throw out Total Annihilation. Homeworld changes
everything. It's all 3-D, on a beautifully rendered six-axis
universe. The ships are silky smooth; the game gives you full
control of the camera, zooming in and out, panning around. And you
think you've seen cool explosions? Zoom in on an attack formation,
and you'll feel like you're right in the middle of a ``Star Wars''
battle. Add to this an ongoing storyline revealed within the game
and beautiful hand-drawn animation interspersed between missions,
and you've got a legend in the making. There are a few 3-D
real-time strategy games on the horizon, including Digital Anvil's
``Conquest,'' due out next year. It will take a lot to usurp
Homeworld's status as the best of the breed. Sometimes games suffer
from being released too quickly, but Homeworld shows you can get
there first and still show off a fantastic game. FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Fishing. It's boring. You sit in a boat, pop open a beer, throw
your bait in the water and wait. And wait some more. That's why I
was ecstatic to see Agetec's Bass Landing ($60, for the
Playstation) packaged with a rod-and-reel-like peripheral (one of
the coolest peripherals I've ever seen). How could fishing from the
comfort of your own couch be boring? Especially with a virtual rod
vibrating in your hand every time a fish hits. However hard it was
to make it boring, they did it. This can be seen as a good thing or
a bad thing. It's ``bad'' because who wants to to play a fishing
game that's boring? But, on the ``good'' side, it's very realistic.
It took me 20 minutes just to catch a fish. And, when I caught the
fish, it was so small it wasn't worth the effort. The game also
comes equipped with a tutorial that's really hard for the angling
impaired to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Landing offers five lakes, seven tournaments, 20 lures, two
reels, eight fishing lines and a virtual depth finder so that you
can have the real feeling of catching 14 different kinds of fish.

 &HT;    Checking the weather on the Web
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ We still can't do
<TEXT>
anything about it, but at least we can venture to the following
weather-related Web sites:
<P>
   www.weather.com _ The Weather Channel's official site is
pinpoint accurate (well, as accurate as weather forecasting can
be). On weather.com, enter your ZIP code (or any ZIP code you want
information about) and you'll get a five-day forecast, current
conditions and the all-important Doppler radar. The best way to
avoid turning on the TV for your weather.
</P>
<P>
   www.redcross.org/
</P>
<P>
   disaster/safety/floods.html _ After a long, dry summer, we can
start preparing for winter and spring rain with this guide on
getting ready for floods. The Red Cross site includes information
on reducing the impact of flooding, assembling a disaster supply
kit, setting up a family disaster plan and what to do during a
flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   www.elnino.com _ Remember when every little weather aberration
was blamed on the El Nino, the mysterious phenomenon that wreaked
havoc on world climates? According to this San Diego site, El Nino
is actually ``a season that comes at irregular intervals and stays
for an unspecified period of time.'' We're still confused, but at
least someone out there is keeping the spirit of El Nino and La
Nina alive.

</P>

   Storms _ Now, was it the tornado of 1955 or the great hail storm
of 1957 that tore down Uncle Floyd's shed? When memory fails,
history is there to correct; this site is a searchable database of
historical weather diasters. Search by county and by type of event
for a list of historical damage done by Mother Nature.

 &HT;    Check review before going to movies
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nowadays, regular moviegoers spend enough money in a
month to make payments on a used car. It's not the tickets that get
you, it's the popcorn and Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there isn't much _ beyond bargain matinees _ that you can
do about the prices. But there are ways to make sure your
movie-going money is spent wisely. The Web has literally hundreds
of sites where you can find informed and literate movie reviews.
Many of these sites also help you find the names of the theaters in
your area where the movie is playing. But, for today's column, the
review is the thing.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a site called Filmcritic.com located, logically
enough, at www.filmcritic.com. One of the pluses of this site is
that it delivers a long and meaty review. Inside a one-paragraph
capsule, you'll get a review similar to the kind you'd find in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a hurry, you can just glance at the number of stars
awarded the movie, but if you want an informed opinion, the review
is just a click away. Most reviews are done by Christopher Null, a
magazine journalist and the author of a screenplay called
``Fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, now that many folks like to watch movies at home on
videotape or DVD, you'll also be able to search for older movies
that have been released that way.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Film Nation(at)Planet Lunch is located at
/homearts.com/depts/pl
</P>
<P>
   /movie/00filc1a.htm (or if that's too much typing for your
fingers, just follow the links from homearts.com). As you'd expect,
you can find reviews of most popular films here. But there are also
some special-purpose reviews.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's an entire category of reviews called
``Date Movies.'' These are specially selected for hand-holding and
earnest glances. Predictably, some of the movies reviewed in that
section include ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``At First Sight'' and
``You've Got Mail.'' Perhaps you can see the trouble without me
saying, but most of those movies are now only showing at second-run
houses and at your corner video store. But the reviews themselves
seem well done. Another feature of this site is a series of
interviews with filmmakers and actors.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent site is part of the service offered by
AccessAtlanta at www.accessatlanta
</P>
<P>
   .com/FEATURES/movies/. Most of the reviews are taken from the
ones printed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (and that makes
sense, since both AccessAtlanta and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution are owned by Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises).
One handy feature of the site is the fact that it's linked to other
movie review sites and to other movie news on the Web. So, a second
opinion for the movie is usually just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   Film Land at www.filmland.com is a really fine movie site for
those who want an insider's view of the movies. For instance,
you'll find sections that show you how much money the movie has
made and how that ranks against other new films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from that section, simply click on the name of the movie,
and you'll be taken to the movie's official Web site (almost every
film released these days, especially the big-budget ones, has its
own Web site). Obviously, these sites aren't exactly unbiased, but
they are usually rich in still photography and information about
the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since many moviegoers are teen-agers, someone in your
family may want to bookmark the Teen Age Movie Review Page at
www.theteenage.com
</P>
<P>
   /MovieReviews/movie
</P>
<P>
   reviews.htm. (Again, you can simply type in www
</P>
<P>
   .theteenage.com and follow the links if you want to save some
typing).

 &HT;    Online magazines cover lots of turf
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Read any good Web sites lately?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't, you should. You can sit in front of your
computer and peruse a wide variety of outstanding articles, essays
and opinions. Don't believe the folks who tell you people don't
want to sit at computers reading things. That's baloney. If you
have the attention span to sit and read the stupid e-mail jokes
your relatives and co-workers send, you certainly have the stamina
to take on headier stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When you mention online magazines, most people just assume you
mean Salon (www.salon.com). Salon is a great online magazine with
great writers tackling topics ranging from racism to sex, politics
and raising kids. But you already know that, so let's move on to
some other online reading material.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bad week for Microsoft, but its online magazine
Slate (www.slate.com) has never been in finer form. After many
sputters and misfires, including wordy articles, silly theme music
and even an online subscription plan, it's nice to see Slate settle
down and learn to love the online medium.
</P>
<P>
   Slate found its voice in political coverage that ranges from
presidential politics to foreign policy to parent company
Microsoft. Last week, the magazine ran a provocative story about
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush titled ``Do Dim
Bulbs Make Better Presidents?''
</P>
<P>
   The article cited an article from The New Yorker offline
magazine, which touted Bush's less-than-stellar academic record at
Yale in the mid-1960s. The thoughtful essay wondered if one really
needs to be able to finish The New York Times' Sunday crossword
puzzle or name each and every Third World leader to be a good
president, and the answer was ``not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, you could run out and get The New Yorker magazine to read
the original article and see a reprint of the younger Bush's
college report card, but why bother when you can read Slate's
analysis and opinion at your computer? (Wake-up call to The New
Yorker: Get some essays and a few original Roz Chast cartoons
online and people will be reading your articles online instead of
reading better articles about them online.)
</P>
<P>
   This past week brought another bit of controversy in a
discussion of Michael Lind's ``Vietnam: The Necessary War.''
There's also a refresher course for presidential contenders and
others who skipped geography class, called ``How to Tell Armenia
From Azerbaijan,'' which is as easy to read and understand as the
maps and glossaries ABCNews.com has built its reputation on.
</P>
<P>
   Feed magazine's founders, Steven Johnson and Stefanie Syman,
have yet to get rich with their online magazine (www
</P>
<P>
   .feedmag.com), but it's certainly not for lack of intelligence
or trying. Feed may be short on money, but it's never short on
ideas. Last week's commentary on the end of the Microsoft era was
as good as anything published about the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   The only real criticism of Feed is that it can sometimes be too
self-consciously hip and intellectual. But then they make up for it
with a series of offbeat interviews with people you'd never think
to interview, like a boy-crazy editor at Seventeen magazine.
</P>
<P>
   We also refuse to give up on fledgling publication Way South
(www.waysouth.com). This journal of Southern literature from mostly
unknown writers is worth reading whether or not you live in the
South. Publisher Grayson Hurst Daughters recently sold a story to
the folks at Salon, which hopefully will drive some traffic back to
Way South and give the magazine the boost it needs.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York magazine, Feed is trying to partner with
online magazines of similar size and financial predicament to form
a portal site for small, hip Web publications.
</P>
<P>
   This, they believe, will be the key to success and the
inevitable initial public offering. But before anybody gets rich,
they need readers. So take the next logical step up from e-mail and
read something interesting online today.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ How high-tech is Play-Doh? After all, it's just
Play-Doh, right? If you believe this, you haven't seen the new
Play-Doh, the super-duper, high-tech Play-Doh. The kind of Play-Doh
you find in Play-Doh's Seaside Playworld ($30). In this new
Play-Doh set, kids build a 3-D beach scene with a new lineup of the
pliable and reusable clay. Here you'll find a wet-and-sandy-feeling
Play-Doh and two slimy ocean-scented colors (smelling oddly similar
to Body Works' Sea Spray and Sea Weed bubble baths). The scented
and textured Play-Dohs add a bit of realism to the seascape and
help kids develop the senses. The set includes a pail to make sand
castles, a two-piece fish mold and lots of other ocean shapes.

   `CRASH' WORTH THE CASH
</P>
<P>
   You're sick of the shooter games. You're sick of the sports
games. You want a race game, but the adult racing games can be so
boring. Really, who wants to be in a NASCAR race and go around an
oval 80 times? That's when you find Sony's Crash Bandicoot's Crash
Team Racing ($50) and you think, ``Cool! Finally a racing game for
me!'' In Crash Team Racing, you take on the persona and drive the
car of any of your favorite characters, including Crash, Tiny or
Cortex. In the adventure mode, you try to win races in order to
solve the mystery of Aku-Aku. Tracks can be anywhere from the polar
ice cap to the Amazon rainforest. The game is fun for the whole
family and is especially entertaining in the head-to-head mode.

 &HT;    New book profiles barons of cable TV
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So much has changed in cable TV during the past
several years that even longtime participants have trouble keeping
up. But a new book by Stephen Keating, a reporter for The Denver
Post, tries to make sense of the rapid change rocking the industry.
Published by Johnson Books, ``Cut Throat'' profiles major figures
of the industry, among them Rupert Murdoch, John Malone and Charlie
Ergen. Keating also follows the rise of direct satellite television
and the entry of telephone companies into the cable business. The
book retails for $18.
</P>
<P>
   In its December issue, PC World calls the computer ``one of the
greatest inventions of the 20th century and one of the most
exasperating.'' The comment is part of a special section called
``Digital Century,'' which looks at the history of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can refight World War II in Microprose's new strategy game
called ``Iron Blitz.'' The game lets you fight the war from the
level of supreme commander, directing both the European and Pacific
theaters. The game, available only for PCs with Windows 95 or
higher, contains mild animated violence. It is recommended for ages
12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry in the horror game category is Terminal
Reality's ``Nocturne.'' It features gory 3-D action in which you
battle monsters, spirits and devils. The game is recommended for
mature audiences only. ``Nocturne'' does include a command that
lets you turn off the adult language, nudity and blood. But even
so, the game is not for young players.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   This may be the holiday season you at last try buying something
online. If so, there are plenty of new sites to check out. Among
the more popular is eToys, which carries more than 100,000 things
for kids. Prices aren't necessarily lower, when you add in the cost
of shipping. But you can't beat the convenience. You can check out
eToys at www.etoys.com.

 &HT;    Baseball's case vs. Pete Rose on Web
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Rose has always been guilty of having bad
haircuts. But when it comes to whether he is guilty of anything
else _ like betting on major-league baseball while managing a team
_ people are less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Fan reaction to Jim Gray's recent interview on NBC of baseball's
all-time hit leader is proof of one of two things: Either the news
media, as with the President Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair,
misjudged public outrage, or people actually believe Rose when he
says he did not bet on baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can judge for yourself. The Dowd Report, the findings of
the baseball commissioner's former special counsel, John W. Dowd,
is available at www
</P>
<P>
   .dowdreport.com.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, Dowd said he made the report available because of
the renewed interest in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page site includes images of the five-page agreement
signed 10 years ago last August by Rose and then-commissioner Bart
Giamatti. The documents are available in Adobe Acrobat Reader
format. If you don't have the software on your hard drive, it can
be downloaded free from the site.
</P>
<P>
   RATING THE STARS' WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Cindy's done it, and so have Daisy and Francis Ford. But is
there anything of substance to Web sites that bear the name of
someone famous?
</P>
<P>
   The premiere issue of eshopper, a magazine from the editors of
Yahoo Internet Life, takes a look at celebrity Web sites. The chart
ranks the sites of such luminaries as Cindy Crawford, Daisy Fuentes
and Francis Ford Coppola by what they sell, whether it's useful and
how much it seems to stroke the star's ego.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, a television personality, sells purses, tote bags,
clothing and jewelry from her well-reviewed site. The magazine says
the site is ``refreshingly low-key'' and the stuff for sale is
``tasteful, inexpensive and solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's site sells books, photos and the model's workout
videos. The magazine ranks Cindy.com fairly high on the ego meter:
``Cindy's lovely mug stares at you from every page. This site is
all about controlling the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, the movie director and budding winemaker, sells his
wine, his movies, pasta bowls and a fancy corkscrew. The products
are considered useful: ``Who can't use a night of wine, pasta and
`The Godfather'?''
</P>
<P>
   The December issue also tries to help you steer clear of
Internet scams, and it ranks the 300 best shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS STUFF GALORE
</P>
<P>
   Spend an hour on your drive home listening to a call-in sports
talk show on the radio. Then spend some time at ESPN.com or
SportsLine.com or any team's Web site and see the amount of
information devoted to sports, both college and professional.
</P>
<P>
   Sports information sources have expanded almost as fast as some
of the leagues. And some might say the growth is diluting the
quality of information on these sites as much as it has the quality
of play (see also: Florida Marlins and Cleveland Browns).
</P>
<P>
   One site, www.rivals.com, is hoping to become the site people
turn to for sports information on the Internet. Rivals.com has
attracted $30 million in venture capital to finance the effort. The
site contains links to more than 350 Web sites devoted to teams and
sports and related topics such as recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Features include team and player statistics, on-demand digital
video of games and player interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company was formed in 1998. Investors include
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM ...
</P>
<P>
   Radio Shack has decided to join them. Since more people are
online during work hours and the holidays are near, the company has
decided to make it easier for its employees to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-based company said last week it will start letting its
3,000 employees shop at Web sites on company computers during
breaks and before or after work. The company will even allow
employees to have packages sent to their work addresses to avoid
the risk of friends, loved ones and burglars spotting incoming
gifts.

 &HT;    New genealogy programs have different strengths
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Step right up, family researchers, it's genealogy time
again.
</P>
<P>
   We have two new genealogy programs, Generations V.6 from Sierra
and Family Origins V.8 from Parsons. Without further ado I'll turn
the podium over to my wife, the genealogist.
</P>
<P>
   She says:
</P>
<P>
   If I could combine the depth and breadth of the reports that
Family Origins generates and the ease of entry and screen of
Generations, I would have a contender. As it is, I'll probably stay
with Family Tree Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information in Family Origins feels dated _ there seem
to be more keystrokes than necessary. The family view screen
includes children and parents of both mother and father, but birth,
death and marriage information on just one of the spouses. I would
prefer smaller type and information on both on the same screen.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, however, are the best of any program I've seen. In
addition to the usual charts and reports _ family group sheets,
pedigree charts, hourglass charts, etc. _ Family Origins gives you
lists that range from addresses for mailing labels to unlinked
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   I found the Place list particularly useful. It tells me what
event I have recorded where _ if I ever make it to a library in
Lancaster County, Pa., I know to look for Andreas Kauffman, who
died there in 1743, Jacob Ringer, who was born there in 1757, and
Ulrich Longenecker, who died there in 1759. This would be
particularly helpful to anyone who takes the scatter-gun approach
to genealogy, looking for everyone at once. If you are dealing with
enough generations, it can be difficult to remember who lived in
what county when.
</P>
<P>
   The Problem list is also helpful, pointing out that Derick Op
den Graeff probably didn't live to be 332 and that Mary Lind
probably didn't marry at age 6. Programs such as Family Tree Maker
point out the problems when you enter the material, but mistakes
can slip in.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were interesting, although the average age at
death for males (65) may have been somewhat skewed by Derick Op den
Graeff.
</P>
<P>
   Family Origins has no manual, but is so intuitive that it
doesn't need one. The beauty of Generations is that the material is
available on a single screen. It profiles both mother and father,
with date and place of birth, death and marriage, as well as names
and dates of parents and children, and divorce, if any. The screen
also shows occupation, religion, education and notes. Entry is
easy, although somewhat more complicated than Family Tree Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Generations comes with 15 CDs. They include the Social Security
Death Index, Civil War muster rolls for both Union and Confederacy,
1870 census digital microfilm for counties in Ohio, Illinois and
Georgia and the World Name Index. I found Daniel Reitz in the 16th
Ohio Infantry but couldn't find Robert McDonald, who died within
months of joining the Georgia infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Generations transfers reports into your word processor. They are
fine as far as they go, but don't go as far as Family Origins.
</P>
<P>
   Generations has an excellent manual and also comes with an
informative book, ``Netting Your Ancestors _ Genealogical Research
on the Internet,'' by Cyndi Howells. Howells owns Cyndi's List
(www.CyndisList
</P>
<P>
   .com/), the starting place for genealogy on the Internet. She
has also served as an adviser to Generations.
</P>
<P>
   Further information and ordering data on Generations may be
obtained from www.sierra.com/sierrahome
</P>
<P>
   /familytree/. If you go to www
</P>
<P>
   .learningco.com/brands/default
</P>
<P>
   .htm, you can branch off to information on both Family Origins
and Family Tree Maker.

 &HT;    Better products are created in marketplace, not courts
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was glad that I wasn't a parent the night the
preliminary Microsoft antitrust findings came down.
</P>
<P>
   I knew, if I were a parent, I'd have to try to explain the
revised American dream. I'd have to tell my kids that it is OK to
succeed but that it is against the rules to succeed wildly and
completely.
</P>
<P>
   I'd explain that Microsoft is a company that dominates the
software market. I'd explain that _ like the Rockefellers, the
Carnegies and Henry Ford _ Bill Gates built a company that got a
lion's share of the market. And that, largely on the shoulders of
Microsoft, America became the dominant player in the software
business. While we no longer are the undisputed world leaders when
it comes to automobiles, steel or oil, America leads the world when
it comes to creating software. Now the government is worried that
Microsoft has done too well, succeeded too completely.
</P>
<P>
   That's where explaining the opinion gets more complicated,
because no one is completely pure in this case _ not the
government, not Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to explain that Microsoft has competed hard in a tough
business and done well. And that a judge believes that it has
become a monopoly. While there have been charges of tough and even
mean-spirited actions, Microsoft has not been charged by the court
with any illegal acts, not yet at least. But there is evidence that
_ as it became a giant _ it also became a bully, using its market
power to squash competition.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to teach a kid that it's OK to succeed at any
price. But the world isn't black and white, it's gray. And then I'd
have to tell the kids that America wasn't built by wimps. That
without tough and driven business leaders and businesses America
would have never emerged as a world power, a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The people who built America played tough. But ultimately, to
dominate their business niche, tough isn't enough _ the Fords, the
Rockefellers and Bill Gates sold something that people wanted to
buy and was in more demand than the products that competed against
it. In what may be the best demonstration of democracy I know,
people and businesses voted with their money.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft grew from a tiny company with a single product called
MS-DOS, an operating system for PCs. Microsoft didn't invent DOS.
Gates bought it for a song. But Microsoft did _ through a deal with
IBM _ nourish and promote DOS until it defeated the established
operating systems of its day. If you think that Microsoft and DOS
were dominant players in those days, go back and reread the books
that chronicle those times. Neither the company nor the products
were dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Windows. The first versions of Windows were so
bad they were jokes.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, there was strong competition from Macintosh,
which had a much superior operating system, and from IBM, which
also offered a better operating system, OS/2. Microsoft was a
powerhouse by then but not yet so big and powerful that it could
roll over an IBM or an Apple. Instead, it did a better job of
selling. That's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it did such a good job that Windows became the main way
people used personal computers. That's true today. And, over time,
what had been a mediocre product became one that is _ arguably at
least _ better. Macintosh enthusiasts will say that Apple still
leads the way. Linux backers will say that operating system is the
best _ much more stable, much less demanding of system resources.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the Mac folks or the Linux folks are right.
But the marketplace has voted for Windows so far. It has that
right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where being a country boy from Arkadelphia, Ark., may
handicap me. I honestly believe that if these products are better,
and sold smarter, that the marketplace will respond, long term.
There are early signs of that. Linux is growing fast (with no help
from the courts). And look at what's been happening with Apple.
People gave it up for dead, but Apple didn't roll over. It created
products that the marketplace wanted. The iMac is probably the
trendiest computer around today.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was done by court order. In fact, had there been a
court order that reduced the clout of Microsoft, the need to
innovate and make a better product wouldn't have been so desperate,
so important. Apple would have rolled along without innovation. The
marketplace, not the courts, creates better products.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's not popular _ and it sounds naive in the dwindling
days of the century _ but I believe the world works best when the
government stays out of the marketplace and lets the strongest
survive.

 &HT;    Hi-tech toys designed with girls in mind
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At least in the world of toys, there are times
when boys will be boys, and girls will be girls.
</P>
<P>
   Radica Games Limited, a Dallas-based company best-known for its
hand-held games, has a line of products sold under the name Girl
Tech designed to meet the unique desires of preteen girls. The
products add technology to such pursuits as keeping a diary,
hosting pajama parties and paying tribute to whoever is this week's
``best friend forever.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the products is the Password Journal, a plastic box that
opens only for its owner thanks to a voice recognition module.
Password Journal has compartments for trinkets and slots for pens
and paper. It's small enough to carry around and sells for $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Another Girl Tech gadget that uses voice recognition technology
is the Door Pass. Attach it to a door and it will ask for a
password any time the door is opened. Unless the owner speaks her
password, the Door Pass, which costs $19.99, sounds an alarm. The
Keepsake Box comes with a remote control, and the box will only
open when the owner punches in a secret code. The Keepsake Box is
supposed to show up in stores later this month and will sell for
$19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Also do out this month is Bug 'Em, a listening device. The user
places a ladybug-shaped microphone in the room she wants to monitor
and listens on a receiver from a nearby room. It is to sell for
$19.99.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Tech devices are sold through major retailers, and online
through EToys.com and Amazon.com.

   Homeworld's the place to beFOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Every year, a game comes out and kicks the incumbents in the
teeth. Last year it was Sierra's Half-Life, and now Sierra has done
it again with the release of Homeworld. Ever since Sierra released
a demo on the Web, buzz for this game has been building. It is
deserved. After a five-hour gaming session that lasted until 3
a.m., Homeworld sent this reviewer out into the world raving to all
who'd listen about how this game is gonna revolutionize real-time
strategy. Because, folks, it will. Forget StarCraft. Chuck Command
&AMP; Conquer. Throw out Total Annihilation. Homeworld changes
everything. It's all 3-D, on a beautifully rendered six-axis
universe. The ships are silky smooth; the game gives you full
control of the camera, zooming in and out, panning around. And you
think you've seen cool explosions? Zoom in on an attack formation,
and you'll feel like you're right in the middle of a ``Star Wars''
battle. Add to this an ongoing storyline revealed within the game
and beautiful hand-drawn animation interspersed between missions,
and you've got a legend in the making. There are a few 3-D
real-time strategy games on the horizon, including Digital Anvil's
``Conquest,'' due out next year. It will take a lot to usurp
Homeworld's status as the best of the breed. Sometimes games suffer
from being released too quickly, but Homeworld shows you can get
there first and still show off a fantastic game. FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Fishing. It's boring. You sit in a boat, pop open a beer, throw
your bait in the water and wait. And wait some more. That's why I
was ecstatic to see Agetec's Bass Landing ($60, for the
Playstation) packaged with a rod-and-reel-like peripheral (one of
the coolest peripherals I've ever seen). How could fishing from the
comfort of your own couch be boring? Especially with a virtual rod
vibrating in your hand every time a fish hits. However hard it was
to make it boring, they did it. This can be seen as a good thing or
a bad thing. It's ``bad'' because who wants to to play a fishing
game that's boring? But, on the ``good'' side, it's very realistic.
It took me 20 minutes just to catch a fish. And, when I caught the
fish, it was so small it wasn't worth the effort. The game also
comes equipped with a tutorial that's really hard for the angling
impaired to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Bass Landing offers five lakes, seven tournaments, 20 lures, two
reels, eight fishing lines and a virtual depth finder so that you
can have the real feeling of catching 14 different kinds of fish.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ How high-tech is Play-Doh? After all, it's just
Play-Doh, right? If you believe this, you haven't seen the new
Play-Doh, the super-duper, high-tech Play-Doh. The kind of Play-Doh
you find in Play-Doh's Seaside Playworld ($30). In this new
Play-Doh set, kids build a 3-D beach scene with a new lineup of the
pliable and reusable clay. Here you'll find a wet-and-sandy-feeling
Play-Doh and two slimy ocean-scented colors (smelling oddly similar
to Body Works' Sea Spray and Sea Weed bubble baths). The scented
and textured Play-Dohs add a bit of realism to the seascape and
help kids develop the senses. The set includes a pail to make sand
castles, a two-piece fish mold and lots of other ocean shapes.

   `CRASH' WORTH THE CASH
</P>
<P>
   You're sick of the shooter games. You're sick of the sports
games. You want a race game, but the adult racing games can be so
boring. Really, who wants to be in a NASCAR race and go around an
oval 80 times? That's when you find Sony's Crash Bandicoot's Crash
Team Racing ($50) and you think, ``Cool! Finally a racing game for
me!'' In Crash Team Racing, you take on the persona and drive the
car of any of your favorite characters, including Crash, Tiny or
Cortex. In the adventure mode, you try to win races in order to
solve the mystery of Aku-Aku. Tracks can be anywhere from the polar
ice cap to the Amazon rainforest. The game is fun for the whole
family and is especially entertaining in the head-to-head mode.

 &HT;    Checking the weather on the Web
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ We still can't do
<TEXT>
anything about it, but at least we can venture to the following
weather-related Web sites:
<P>
   www.weather.com _ The Weather Channel's official site is
pinpoint accurate (well, as accurate as weather forecasting can
be). On weather.com, enter your ZIP code (or any ZIP code you want
information about) and you'll get a five-day forecast, current
conditions and the all-important Doppler radar. The best way to
avoid turning on the TV for your weather.
</P>
<P>
   www.redcross.org/
</P>
<P>
   disaster/safety/floods.html _ After a long, dry summer, we can
start preparing for winter and spring rain with this guide on
getting ready for floods. The Red Cross site includes information
on reducing the impact of flooding, assembling a disaster supply
kit, setting up a family disaster plan and what to do during a
flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   www.elnino.com _ Remember when every little weather aberration
was blamed on the El Nino, the mysterious phenomenon that wreaked
havoc on world climates? According to this San Diego site, El Nino
is actually ``a season that comes at irregular intervals and stays
for an unspecified period of time.'' We're still confused, but at
least someone out there is keeping the spirit of El Nino and La
Nina alive.

   Storms _ Now, was it the tornado of 1955 or the great hail storm
of 1957 that tore down Uncle Floyd's shed? When memory fails,
history is there to correct; this site is a searchable database of
historical weather diasters. Search by county and by type of event
for a list of historical damage done by Mother Nature.

 &HT;    Check review before going to movies
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nowadays, regular moviegoers spend enough money in a
month to make payments on a used car. It's not the tickets that get
you, it's the popcorn and Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there isn't much _ beyond bargain matinees _ that you can
do about the prices. But there are ways to make sure your
movie-going money is spent wisely. The Web has literally hundreds
of sites where you can find informed and literate movie reviews.
Many of these sites also help you find the names of the theaters in
your area where the movie is playing. But, for today's column, the
review is the thing.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a site called Filmcritic.com located, logically
enough, at www.filmcritic.com. One of the pluses of this site is
that it delivers a long and meaty review. Inside a one-paragraph
capsule, you'll get a review similar to the kind you'd find in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a hurry, you can just glance at the number of stars
awarded the movie, but if you want an informed opinion, the review
is just a click away. Most reviews are done by Christopher Null, a
magazine journalist and the author of a screenplay called
``Fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, now that many folks like to watch movies at home on
videotape or DVD, you'll also be able to search for older movies
that have been released that way.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Film Nation(at)Planet Lunch is located at
/homearts.com/depts/pl
</P>
<P>
   /movie/00filc1a.htm (or if that's too much typing for your
fingers, just follow the links from homearts.com). As you'd expect,
you can find reviews of most popular films here. But there are also
some special-purpose reviews.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there's an entire category of reviews called
``Date Movies.'' These are specially selected for hand-holding and
earnest glances. Predictably, some of the movies reviewed in that
section include ``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``At First Sight'' and
``You've Got Mail.'' Perhaps you can see the trouble without me
saying, but most of those movies are now only showing at second-run
houses and at your corner video store. But the reviews themselves
seem well done. Another feature of this site is a series of
interviews with filmmakers and actors.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent site is part of the service offered by
AccessAtlanta at www.accessatlanta
</P>
<P>
   .com/FEATURES/movies/. Most of the reviews are taken from the
ones printed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (and that makes
sense, since both AccessAtlanta and The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution are owned by Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises).
One handy feature of the site is the fact that it's linked to other
movie review sites and to other movie news on the Web. So, a second
opinion for the movie is usually just a click away.
</P>
<P>
   Film Land at www.filmland.com is a really fine movie site for
those who want an insider's view of the movies. For instance,
you'll find sections that show you how much money the movie has
made and how that ranks against other new films.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from that section, simply click on the name of the movie,
and you'll be taken to the movie's official Web site (almost every
film released these days, especially the big-budget ones, has its
own Web site). Obviously, these sites aren't exactly unbiased, but
they are usually rich in still photography and information about
the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since many moviegoers are teen-agers, someone in your
family may want to bookmark the Teen Age Movie Review Page at
www.theteenage.com
</P>
<P>
   /MovieReviews/movie
</P>
<P>
   reviews.htm. (Again, you can simply type in www
</P>
<P>
   .theteenage.com and follow the links if you want to save some
typing).

 &HT;    Online magazines cover lots of turf
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Read any good Web sites lately?
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't, you should. You can sit in front of your
computer and peruse a wide variety of outstanding articles, essays
and opinions. Don't believe the folks who tell you people don't
want to sit at computers reading things. That's baloney. If you
have the attention span to sit and read the stupid e-mail jokes
your relatives and co-workers send, you certainly have the stamina
to take on headier stuff.
</P>
<P>
   When you mention online magazines, most people just assume you
mean Salon (www.salon.com). Salon is a great online magazine with
great writers tackling topics ranging from racism to sex, politics
and raising kids. But you already know that, so let's move on to
some other online reading material.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a bad week for Microsoft, but its online magazine
Slate (www.slate.com) has never been in finer form. After many
sputters and misfires, including wordy articles, silly theme music
and even an online subscription plan, it's nice to see Slate settle
down and learn to love the online medium.
</P>
<P>
   Slate found its voice in political coverage that ranges from
presidential politics to foreign policy to parent company
Microsoft. Last week, the magazine ran a provocative story about
Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush titled ``Do Dim
Bulbs Make Better Presidents?''
</P>
<P>
   The article cited an article from The New Yorker offline
magazine, which touted Bush's less-than-stellar academic record at
Yale in the mid-1960s. The thoughtful essay wondered if one really
needs to be able to finish The New York Times' Sunday crossword
puzzle or name each and every Third World leader to be a good
president, and the answer was ``not necessarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, you could run out and get The New Yorker magazine to read
the original article and see a reprint of the younger Bush's
college report card, but why bother when you can read Slate's
analysis and opinion at your computer? (Wake-up call to The New
Yorker: Get some essays and a few original Roz Chast cartoons
online and people will be reading your articles online instead of
reading better articles about them online.)
</P>
<P>
   This past week brought another bit of controversy in a
discussion of Michael Lind's ``Vietnam: The Necessary War.''
There's also a refresher course for presidential contenders and
others who skipped geography class, called ``How to Tell Armenia
From Azerbaijan,'' which is as easy to read and understand as the
maps and glossaries ABCNews.com has built its reputation on.
</P>
<P>
   Feed magazine's founders, Steven Johnson and Stefanie Syman,
have yet to get rich with their online magazine (www
</P>
<P>
   .feedmag.com), but it's certainly not for lack of intelligence
or trying. Feed may be short on money, but it's never short on
ideas. Last week's commentary on the end of the Microsoft era was
as good as anything published about the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   The only real criticism of Feed is that it can sometimes be too
self-consciously hip and intellectual. But then they make up for it
with a series of offbeat interviews with people you'd never think
to interview, like a boy-crazy editor at Seventeen magazine.
</P>
<P>
   We also refuse to give up on fledgling publication Way South
(www.waysouth.com). This journal of Southern literature from mostly
unknown writers is worth reading whether or not you live in the
South. Publisher Grayson Hurst Daughters recently sold a story to
the folks at Salon, which hopefully will drive some traffic back to
Way South and give the magazine the boost it needs.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York magazine, Feed is trying to partner with
online magazines of similar size and financial predicament to form
a portal site for small, hip Web publications.
</P>
<P>
   This, they believe, will be the key to success and the
inevitable initial public offering. But before anybody gets rich,
they need readers. So take the next logical step up from e-mail and
read something interesting online today.

 &HT;    Principal makes housecalls
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How would you like it if your principal showed up at
your house to read you a bedtime story?
</P>
<P>
   Younger kids in Boca Raton, Fla., like it very much and are
reading 20 books a month to earn the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Whispering Pines Elementary School Principal Alan Goldstein
wanted to improve his school's reading test scores. So he created
the ``Sandman.'' The Sandman makes 10 housecalls a month to
preschoolers, kindergartners and first-graders who read or had read
to them at least 20 books that month. The kids' names are drawn
from a hat to decide who gets the visits.
</P>
<P>
   For the older students at his school, Goldstein promises to dye
his hair purple and wear it around town for a week _ if they can
read 10,000 books as a group.

 &HT;    New book profiles barons of cable TV
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So much has changed in cable TV during the past
several years that even longtime participants have trouble keeping
up. But a new book by Stephen Keating, a reporter for The Denver
Post, tries to make sense of the rapid change rocking the industry.
Published by Johnson Books, ``Cut Throat'' profiles major figures
of the industry, among them Rupert Murdoch, John Malone and Charlie
Ergen. Keating also follows the rise of direct satellite television
and the entry of telephone companies into the cable business. The
book retails for $18.
</P>
<P>
   In its December issue, PC World calls the computer ``one of the
greatest inventions of the 20th century and one of the most
exasperating.'' The comment is part of a special section called
``Digital Century,'' which looks at the history of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   You can refight World War II in Microprose's new strategy game
called ``Iron Blitz.'' The game lets you fight the war from the
level of supreme commander, directing both the European and Pacific
theaters. The game, available only for PCs with Windows 95 or
higher, contains mild animated violence. It is recommended for ages
12 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The latest entry in the horror game category is Terminal
Reality's ``Nocturne.'' It features gory 3-D action in which you
battle monsters, spirits and devils. The game is recommended for
mature audiences only. ``Nocturne'' does include a command that
lets you turn off the adult language, nudity and blood. But even
so, the game is not for young players.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   This may be the holiday season you at last try buying something
online. If so, there are plenty of new sites to check out. Among
the more popular is eToys, which carries more than 100,000 things
for kids. Prices aren't necessarily lower, when you add in the cost
of shipping. But you can't beat the convenience. You can check out
eToys at www.etoys.com.

 &HT;    Baseball's case vs. Pete Rose on Web
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Rose has always been guilty of having bad
haircuts. But when it comes to whether he is guilty of anything
else _ like betting on major-league baseball while managing a team
_ people are less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Fan reaction to Jim Gray's recent interview on NBC of baseball's
all-time hit leader is proof of one of two things: Either the news
media, as with the President Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair,
misjudged public outrage, or people actually believe Rose when he
says he did not bet on baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can judge for yourself. The Dowd Report, the findings of
the baseball commissioner's former special counsel, John W. Dowd,
is available at www
</P>
<P>
   .dowdreport.com.
</P>
<P>
   On the site, Dowd said he made the report available because of
the renewed interest in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page site includes images of the five-page agreement
signed 10 years ago last August by Rose and then-commissioner Bart
Giamatti. The documents are available in Adobe Acrobat Reader
format. If you don't have the software on your hard drive, it can
be downloaded free from the site.
</P>
<P>
   RATING THE STARS' WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   Cindy's done it, and so have Daisy and Francis Ford. But is
there anything of substance to Web sites that bear the name of
someone famous?
</P>
<P>
   The premiere issue of eshopper, a magazine from the editors of
Yahoo Internet Life, takes a look at celebrity Web sites. The chart
ranks the sites of such luminaries as Cindy Crawford, Daisy Fuentes
and Francis Ford Coppola by what they sell, whether it's useful and
how much it seems to stroke the star's ego.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, a television personality, sells purses, tote bags,
clothing and jewelry from her well-reviewed site. The magazine says
the site is ``refreshingly low-key'' and the stuff for sale is
``tasteful, inexpensive and solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's site sells books, photos and the model's workout
videos. The magazine ranks Cindy.com fairly high on the ego meter:
``Cindy's lovely mug stares at you from every page. This site is
all about controlling the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Coppola, the movie director and budding winemaker, sells his
wine, his movies, pasta bowls and a fancy corkscrew. The products
are considered useful: ``Who can't use a night of wine, pasta and
`The Godfather'?''
</P>
<P>
   The December issue also tries to help you steer clear of
Internet scams, and it ranks the 300 best shopping sites.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS STUFF GALORE
</P>
<P>
   Spend an hour on your drive home listening to a call-in sports
talk show on the radio. Then spend some time at ESPN.com or
SportsLine.com or any team's Web site and see the amount of
information devoted to sports, both college and professional.
</P>
<P>
   Sports information sources have expanded almost as fast as some
of the leagues. And some might say the growth is diluting the
quality of information on these sites as much as it has the quality
of play (see also: Florida Marlins and Cleveland Browns).
</P>
<P>
   One site, www.rivals.com, is hoping to become the site people
turn to for sports information on the Internet. Rivals.com has
attracted $30 million in venture capital to finance the effort. The
site contains links to more than 350 Web sites devoted to teams and
sports and related topics such as recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Features include team and player statistics, on-demand digital
video of games and player interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company was formed in 1998. Investors include
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM ...
</P>
<P>
   Radio Shack has decided to join them. Since more people are
online during work hours and the holidays are near, the company has
decided to make it easier for its employees to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-based company said last week it will start letting its
3,000 employees shop at Web sites on company computers during
breaks and before or after work. The company will even allow
employees to have packages sent to their work addresses to avoid
the risk of friends, loved ones and burglars spotting incoming
gifts.

 &HT;    New genealogy programs have different strengths
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Step right up, family researchers, it's genealogy time
again.
</P>
<P>
   We have two new genealogy programs, Generations V.6 from Sierra
and Family Origins V.8 from Parsons. Without further ado I'll turn
the podium over to my wife, the genealogist.
</P>
<P>
   She says:
</P>
<P>
   If I could combine the depth and breadth of the reports that
Family Origins generates and the ease of entry and screen of
Generations, I would have a contender. As it is, I'll probably stay
with Family Tree Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Entering information in Family Origins feels dated _ there seem
to be more keystrokes than necessary. The family view screen
includes children and parents of both mother and father, but birth,
death and marriage information on just one of the spouses. I would
prefer smaller type and information on both on the same screen.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, however, are the best of any program I've seen. In
addition to the usual charts and reports _ family group sheets,
pedigree charts, hourglass charts, etc. _ Family Origins gives you
lists that range from addresses for mailing labels to unlinked
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   I found the Place list particularly useful. It tells me what
event I have recorded where _ if I ever make it to a library in
Lancaster County, Pa., I know to look for Andreas Kauffman, who
died there in 1743, Jacob Ringer, who was born there in 1757, and
Ulrich Longenecker, who died there in 1759. This would be
particularly helpful to anyone who takes the scatter-gun approach
to genealogy, looking for everyone at once. If you are dealing with
enough generations, it can be difficult to remember who lived in
what county when.
</P>
<P>
   The Problem list is also helpful, pointing out that Derick Op
den Graeff probably didn't live to be 332 and that Mary Lind
probably didn't marry at age 6. Programs such as Family Tree Maker
point out the problems when you enter the material, but mistakes
can slip in.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were interesting, although the average age at
death for males (65) may have been somewhat skewed by Derick Op den
Graeff.
</P>
<P>
   Family Origins has no manual, but is so intuitive that it
doesn't need one. The beauty of Generations is that the material is
available on a single screen. It profiles both mother and father,
with date and place of birth, death and marriage, as well as names
and dates of parents and children, and divorce, if any. The screen
also shows occupation, religion, education and notes. Entry is
easy, although somewhat more complicated than Family Tree Maker.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Better products are created in marketplace, not courts
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was glad that I wasn't a parent the night the
preliminary Microsoft antitrust findings came down.
</P>
<P>
   I knew, if I were a parent, I'd have to try to explain the
revised American dream. I'd have to tell my kids that it is OK to
succeed but that it is against the rules to succeed wildly and
completely.
</P>
<P>
   I'd explain that Microsoft is a company that dominates the
software market. I'd explain that _ like the Rockefellers, the
Carnegies and Henry Ford _ Bill Gates built a company that got a
lion's share of the market. And that, largely on the shoulders of
Microsoft, America became the dominant player in the software
business. While we no longer are the undisputed world leaders when
it comes to automobiles, steel or oil, America leads the world when
it comes to creating software. Now the government is worried that
Microsoft has done too well, succeeded too completely.
</P>
<P>
   That's where explaining the opinion gets more complicated,
because no one is completely pure in this case _ not the
government, not Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to explain that Microsoft has competed hard in a tough
business and done well. And that a judge believes that it has
become a monopoly. While there have been charges of tough and even
mean-spirited actions, Microsoft has not been charged by the court
with any illegal acts, not yet at least. But there is evidence that
_ as it became a giant _ it also became a bully, using its market
power to squash competition.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to teach a kid that it's OK to succeed at any
price. But the world isn't black and white, it's gray. And then I'd
have to tell the kids that America wasn't built by wimps. That
without tough and driven business leaders and businesses America
would have never emerged as a world power, a leader.
</P>
<P>
   The people who built America played tough. But ultimately, to
dominate their business niche, tough isn't enough _ the Fords, the
Rockefellers and Bill Gates sold something that people wanted to
buy and was in more demand than the products that competed against
it. In what may be the best demonstration of democracy I know,
people and businesses voted with their money.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft grew from a tiny company with a single product called
MS-DOS, an operating system for PCs. Microsoft didn't invent DOS.
Gates bought it for a song. But Microsoft did _ through a deal with
IBM _ nourish and promote DOS until it defeated the established
operating systems of its day. If you think that Microsoft and DOS
were dominant players in those days, go back and reread the books
that chronicle those times. Neither the company nor the products
were dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Windows. The first versions of Windows were so
bad they were jokes.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, there was strong competition from Macintosh,
which had a much superior operating system, and from IBM, which
also offered a better operating system, OS/2. Microsoft was a
powerhouse by then but not yet so big and powerful that it could
roll over an IBM or an Apple. Instead, it did a better job of
selling. That's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it did such a good job that Windows became the main way
people used personal computers. That's true today. And, over time,
what had been a mediocre product became one that is _ arguably at
least _ better. Macintosh enthusiasts will say that Apple still
leads the way. Linux backers will say that operating system is the
best _ much more stable, much less demanding of system resources.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that the Mac folks or the Linux folks are right.
But the marketplace has voted for Windows so far. It has that
right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where being a country boy from Arkadelphia, Ark., may
handicap me. I honestly believe that if these products are better,
and sold smarter, that the marketplace will respond, long term.
There are early signs of that. Linux is growing fast (with no help
from the courts). And look at what's been happening with Apple.
People gave it up for dead, but Apple didn't roll over. It created
products that the marketplace wanted. The iMac is probably the
trendiest computer around today.
</P>
<P>
   None of this was done by court order. In fact, had there been a
court order that reduced the clout of Microsoft, the need to
innovate and make a better product wouldn't have been so desperate,
so important. Apple would have rolled along without innovation. The
marketplace, not the courts, creates better products.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's not popular _ and it sounds naive in the dwindling
days of the century _ but I believe the world works best when the
government stays out of the marketplace and lets the strongest
survive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: Can you send me the phone number for UT Tower
tours? _ Kerry Watson
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope you want the $3 per person tickets for next year
because tickets for the weekend tours (10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday) are all reserved for this year (ending Dec. 12). That
is the word from the Tower tour staff, who are taking reservations
for next year now. Call 475-6633 or toll-free at (877) 475-6633.
However, reserved tickets that are unclaimed 20 minutes before each
tour will be released to lucky walk-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son and his fiancee are getting married soon. This is not
the first marriage for either one. Instead of gifts, they would
rather receive money. What is the proper way to indicate this on
the invitations? _ R.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is no proper way to include that wish on the
invitation. Carley Roney in ``The Knot's Complete Guide to Weddings
in the Real World'' advises couples to let friends and relatives
know this gift preference and encourage them to spread the word
among guests. The couple may be surprised by the interesting and
useful noncash gifts received, which can always be exchanged for
store credit (or cash) or liquidated (sold at a garage sale). Put
the givers of cash gifts at the top of the thank-you note list. It
is easier to lose a check than a chafing dish in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a third-generation Purdue Boilermaker. Purdue's marching
band takes pride in having ``The World's Largest Drum.'' When I
came to Austin and attended a few Longhorn games, I noticed UT's
band also takes pride in having ``The World's Largest Drum.'' Which
one is actually larger, or are they the same size? _ Bryan Parker
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's start with the University of Texas' drum, Big Bertha.
At 8 feet in diameter, 54 inches (4 1/2 feet) wide, Bertha stands
10 feet tall on her cart. Created by C.G. Conn Ltd., for the
University of Chicago in 1922, it came to UT courtesy of longtime
band benefactor Col. Harold Byrd in 1955. The Boilermakers' drum
was purchased in 1921 from the Leedy Corp. for the band, then
directed by Paul ``Spotts'' Emrick. This drum is ``about 8 feet in
diameter, 48 inches (4 feet wide) and stands (yep) 10 feet tall on
its perch,'' says Purdue's spokeswoman Kathy Matter. So it looks
like Purdue's ``World's Largest Drum'' is not quite as big as UT's
Bertha.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an address for Milton Friedman? _ Bill P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Address your missives to Nobel Prize winner (for economics,
1976) Friedman in care of the Hoover Institution, Stanford
University, Stanford, CA 94305-6010.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am changing physicians and was informed that charts can
only be transferred from one office to another. Don't I have a
legal right to obtain my personal medical records? _ L.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet you do. I checked with the Texas State Board of
Medical Examiners. Texas law requires a physician to release copies
of records to the patient or a new doctor, says spokeswoman Jill
Wiggins. The request must be in writing and include a description
of the records, the reasons for the release, and the person to whom
the information is to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Exception? If the physician feels releasing the information
would be harmful to the patient's physical or emotional health. The
physician is required to provide the information within 30 days of
receiving the request and may charge reasonable fees ($25 for the
first 20 pages and 15 cents for every page thereafter). Note the
records cannot be withheld based on a past-due account status.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   OK, readers, the requests for the colorful burning pine-cone
recipe have started to cross my desk. Dip pine cones in liquid
floor wax (yes, floor wax) and shake off the excess. Place the
dipped pine cones on newspapers. While they still are damp,
sprinkle with Rainbow Flame Crystals. Let dry. Toss one of your new
and improved pine cones into the fire and enjoy.

 &HT;    Tony's Gang helps sick children with stories and love
 &HT;    By Cathy Hulbert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Seven-year-old Craig Little of Kennesaw, Ga.,
practiced reading Dr. Seuss' ``Green Eggs and Ham'' until he almost
knew it by heart.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to read the story perfectly because a recording of his
reading would be sent to a seriously ill child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good doing this, and it'll probably make kids
who are sick feel good, too,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of dozens of children who showed up at an Atlanta
Chapter 11 bookstore to help Tony's Gang with its Tell Me a Story
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's Gang was created to brighten the lives of seriously ill
children and to provide support for their families. It is named for
Tony Lizza, who died of leukemia in 1996 after fighting the disease
for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood. The
treatment can make kids feel weak, sometimes too weak to go to
school or play.
</P>
<P>
   Tony's Gang has chapters in Georgia, Pennsylvania and New
Jersey. Others are forming.
</P>
<P>
   For the Tell Me a Story Project, kids take turns reading their
favorite books into a tape recorder. Their stories _ as well as
donated books _ will be sent around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who missed the recent recording session can still help by
writing stories and drawing pictures for the colorful Tony's Gang
Web site at www.tonysgang.com. The Web site features a raccoon and
a chameleon who want to build a treehouse _ the type of treehouse a
sick child can visit from his or her computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sick kids get very lonely sometimes, and this lets them know
that they're still cared about,'' said Ali Lizza, 12, of Marietta.
Ali speaks from experience because she is Tony's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Gretchen Lizza, said, ``Our most enthusiastic
support is coming from kids. They seem to understand what their
peers are going through.'' All stories and drawings submitted by
kids will be published on the Tony's Gang Web site, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Cooper, 9, of Marietta said her reading will make a
difference for sick children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this because I'd like to help save children's
lives,'' she said. ``If sick kids know they're special, it has to
make them feel better. Being sad can't be good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig's sister, Casey Little, 8, also showed up to help. She
said sick children ``don't get to hear other kids reading to them
like we do. So this might help.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tony's Gang seeks fund-raising and volunteer support
from adults, ``it's the kids who really get it,'' said Gretchen
Lizza.
</P>
<P>
   The group's other projects include the Pen Pal program, which
gears up in the spring, as well as a year-round collection to round
up new books and tapes for sick kids. Tony's Gang works with
hospital social workers and medical staffers to find kids who could
benefit from the projects.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU WANT TO HELP
</P>
<P>
   For more information on Tony's Gang, call 770-321-1320. Or you

 &HT;    Ambush tactics not what the public had in mind
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ What do Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Pete Rose
have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Besides their love of baseball, both were recently ``ambushed''
on national television, once again arousing public indignation over
mean-spirted, unfair reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is an ambush? Unless reporters submit all
questions in advance, any TV grilling could constitute an ambush.
An ambush has nothing to do with how tough the questions are. It
has to do with why they're asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of motivation,'' says Stephen Reese, head of
the journalism department at the University of Texas. ``Is the
journalist really trying to get the candidate's views and explain
them to the public? Or is he trying to put another notch in the
microphone?''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, enlightenment, not embarrassment, should be the
motivation. When the motivation is embarrassment, the result is
``gotcha journalism.'' Television is more prone to the charge
because the person's flustered reaction is part of the ``gotcha.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response to Boston reporter Andy Hiller's pop quiz two
weeks ago is still making news. Bush failed to identify three of
four world leaders, and he said a military coup in Pakistan
appeared to ``bring stability to the country.'' Then he tried to
turn the tables on the questioner, looking angry and defensive.
</P>
<P>
   During the World Series, Pete Rose was cornered by feisty NBC
reporter Jim Gray, who grilled him on whether he'd ever gambled on
baseball. Rose has been asked that question repeatedly and shows no
signs of changing his answer. The questions were legitimate, but it
angered viewers that they were asked when Rose, who was banned from
baseball for gambling, was at an event honoring the century's
greatest ball players. If Gray's motive wasn't bad, irate public
thinking goes, at least his manners were.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, however, Gray's questions to Rose, moments after he
had received a sustained ovation, didn't come out of the blue. At a
nontelevised news conference a short time before, the same
questions had been asked by Gray and others (and not answered). To
home viewers, Gray's combative interview on NBC came out of left
field at a time when Rose was basking in fan adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The public and the broadcast media have been wrestling with
ambush journalism ever since the earliest days of ``60 Minutes,''
when Mike Wallace leapt from behind a potted palm tree and thrust a
microphone into the face of a corporate executive who had been
avoiding him. Sometimes the ambush gets results, but more often
than not it just produces an embarrassed or guilty-looking subject.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldo Rivera has a long history of ambushing people, and any
time Sam Donaldson opens his mouth, he's accused of hostile
behavior. Even the mild-mannered Stone Phillips of ``Dateline NBC''
was accused of ambushing former President Bush with a question
about marital fidelity during the '92 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambushing a presidential candidate is not necessarily unfair,
if the questions themselves are meaningful and the answers tell us
something,'' Tom Rosenstiel, director of Columbia University's
Project for Excellence in Journalism, said in a report for the
Washington, D.C.-based Freedom Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear the public agrees. According to a recent poll by
the Pew Research Center for People &AMP; the Press, there's been an
erosion of support for the press' role as watchdog. Only 53 percent
of the respondents in a September survey said they value close
media scrutiny of candidates. A growing number believe such
scrutiny is a bad idea because it discourages good candidates from
running. And while the public is critical of the press, 30 percent
said the press is too easy on the front-runners. But campaigns are
so tightly controlled and choreographed that they seem to invite
ambush journalism. Popping off questions unexpectedly may be the
only way reporters can catch a candidate in an unguarded,
unpackaged moment.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are stuck in a no-win situation. Either they ambush
people and get criticized for unfairness, or they lob softball
questions _ like the ``Do-you-really-have-a-bad-temper?'' fluff
posed to Sen. John McCain by Charlie Gibson on ``Good Morning
America'' recently _ and get accused of sucking up to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's room in the middle for some real discussion of
what the political views are,'' Reese says. ``In the case of Bush,
it's quite important that he be questioned in a lot more detail
than he has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Detail, unfortunately, is a luxury TV reporters usually can't
afford. So many problems and so little time, with important
political stories reduced to sound bites and 30-second hits .
</P>
<P>
   ``(Brevity is) one of the weaknesses people point to, but in a
brief moment, Bush revealed that he thought the Pakistan coup
encouraged stability,'' Reese says. ``It's not necessarily the case
that you can't ask important questions if you have less time.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it's OK to pounce as long as some thought and preparation
goes into the questions. Reporters should ask themselves:
</P>
<P>
   1. Do people need to know the answer?
</P>
<P>
   2. Am I asking this really stupid question because I know he/she
won't know the answer and therefore he/she will look really stupid?
</P>
<P>
   3. Am I hoping that every TV news outlet in the country will
slap my earnest-looking face on the evening news?
</P>
<P>
   If the answer to the first question is yes, the reporter should
fire away. If the answer to either of the other two questions is
yes, the reporter should chant ``Geraldo!'' several times and
abandon the ambush.

 &HT;    PSYCHOLOGY: Would that we could be 8-year-olds again
 &HT;    By Hap Lecrone
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you ever wish you could be a kid again? If so, today's column
is designed for you.
</P>
<P>
   The author is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   I quit. I am hereby officially tendering my resignation as an
adult. I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities
of an 8-year-old again.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to go to McDonald's and think that it's a four-star
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud puddle and make
ripples with rocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to think M&AMP;Ms are better than money because you can eat
them.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to lie under a big oak tree and a run a lemonade stand
with my friends on a hot summer's day.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to return to a time when life was simple, when all you
knew were colors, multiplication tables and nursery rhymes, but
that didn't bother you, because you didn't know what you didn't
know and you didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   _ All you knew was to be happy because you were blissfully
unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to think the world is fair. That everyone is honest and
good. I want to believe that anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be
overly excited by the little things again.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to live simple again.
</P>
<P>
   _ I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains
of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the
month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip,
illness and loss of loved ones. I want to believe in the power of
smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth, justice, peace, dreams, the
imagination, mankind and making angels in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to outgrow shoes rather than wear them out, and I want
to go barefoot from June 1 to Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want my greatest fear of the day to be whether my mom is
going to cook squash for dinner and make me eat it.
</P>
<P>
   _ I want to believe that the cookies and milk I left on the
mantel for Santa Claus were really eaten by Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   So ... here's my checkbook and my car-keys, my credit card bills
and my 401K statements. I am officially resigning from adulthood.
And if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me
first, cause ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Tag! You're it.''
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Four Times Square, a new 48-story office tower, looks much like
any other modern skyscraper in the heart of New York City. But the
top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of
electricity-generating solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells
lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into
power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally
friendly electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public
understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to
insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people
have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of
interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and
do-it-yourself power is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office
managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting
cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which
allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy
bills by selling back any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof,
natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a
wind turbine up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power,
long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are
marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface
of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.
</P>
<P>
   Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder,
recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which
turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million
Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1
million buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering
sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20
cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of
conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much
as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy
Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San
Diego can switch to power from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent
solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at
a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for
use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar
glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced
would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer,
the company's vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost 10 times more than today's total solar-power
production worldwide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells could also generate compact, do-it-yourself power.
The cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen _ usually
drawn from a fuel like natural gas or methanol _ with oxygen,
launching chemical reactions that spark a current. They work
silently and cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Four Times Square uses the cells for only a fraction of its
total power needs, but in other settings they could pull much
heavier duty. A basement fuel cell working in tandem with solar
cells on a house's roof could churn out all the necessary local
energy, rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a tactical standpoint, it's a beautiful combination,''
says Thomas Hoff, head of Clean Power Research in Napa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, a home's solar power would rev up, especially in
the middle of the day when it is needed most. In the darker days of
winter, the fuel cell would kick into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells generate warmth as they work, so they can be used to
heat rooms or water as well. Add energy-efficient lights and
appliances, and you've got a system that could drastically cut
emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce the threat of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   If advanced fuel cells eventually power some cars _ and
companies like Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota are betting they
will _ mobile and stationary energy needs might someday merge. At
the end of the day, a home owner might plug the house into the
family car to light up the night.
</P>
<P>
   Most existing fuel cells rely on fossil fuels, but future
versions may tap cheaper renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, several breweries are powered by fuel cells that run
off waste gas produced during fermentation. Methane leaking from
landfills could become another useful source of
electricity-generating gas for fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you have a source of hydrogen-rich gas, you might
think of fuel cells,'' says Adam Serchuk of the Renewable Energy
Policy Project in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Energy Conversion Devices is combining solar and
fuel-cell technologies into the ultimate pollution-free home energy
system. Electricity from solar cells on the roof can split water
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be
siphoned off, stored and used to power fuel cells in the home and
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest demand for high-tech distributed power
sources is coming from poor communities overseas. Worldwide, 2
billion people live without electricity. In rural villages in
China, Mexico and India, on-the-spot energy sources such as wind
turbines, solar panels and small biomass power plants make a lot of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the solar cells and wind turbines made in the
United States are shipped to such remote areas. These markets have
supported the development of do-it-yourself power even while the
United States has continued to rely on cheap oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the technology works,'' says Mike Bergey, president of
Bergey Windpower. ``Now it looks like we'll get a chance to prove
it here in the U.S.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Four Times Square, a new 48-story office tower, looks much like
any other modern skyscraper in the heart of New York City. But the
top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of
electricity-generating solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells
lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into
power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally
friendly electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public
understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to
insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people
have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of
interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and
do-it-yourself power is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office
managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting
cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which
allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy
bills by selling back any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof,
natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a
wind turbine up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power,
long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are
marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface
of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.
</P>
<P>
   Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder,
recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which
turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million
Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1
million buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering
sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20
cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of
conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much
as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy
Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San
Diego can switch to power from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent
solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at
a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for
use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar
glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced
would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer,
the company's vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost 10 times more than today's total solar-power
production worldwide,'' he says.

<P>
   &UR; COSMIC CARTOGRAPHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, some cosmological studies indicated that the
universe is younger than the oldest stars, an obvious
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Freedman at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena,
Calif., recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to determine how
quickly the universe is expanding, then ran the picture backward to
figure out when it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Her international team estimates the cosmos is 12 billion years
old _ almost exactly the age of the most ancient stars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does this end the age debate?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Before, people were arguing whether it was 10 billion or 20
billion years old. Now we're talking about differences of a billion
or two.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why is it such a hard problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  To get the age, you need to know how fast the universe is
expanding, so you need velocities and distances. Measuring
velocities turned out to be easy, but measuring distances turned
out to be much harder than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   There's dust between stars, which blocks light. If you don't
correct for that, you get the distances wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter how long the universe has been
expanding?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The fact that we can measure an expansion rate at all tells
us the universe had a beginning. There was a time when galaxies
were close together, and before that there was the Big Bang. It
touches on the question of where we came from.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is the biggest unsolved problem in astronomy?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We don't know how galaxies came to be. We have no idea
about a time between roughly 300,000 and 1 billion years after the
Big Bang, when the universe was very hazy. There were no stars yet,
no galaxies yet. We have very little light available from that
time. It's a ``dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How will we ever learn about the dark ages of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By looking at infrared radiation, astronomers can access a
lot of this region. A new generation of telescopes planned for the
next decade will go above the atmosphere, which blocks infrared
radiation, and tell when the first stars and galaxies appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your personal motivation for doing this kind of
work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Part of the joy of being human is you ask questions and you
discover _ it's natural human curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLINDED BY THE LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite giant new observatories and fancy satellites, scientists
find their view of the cosmos increasingly obscured by the
by-products of a technological society.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union in
Vienna, researchers singled out some particularly galling modern
pollutants:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Space Junk. &LR;  The Department of Defense tracks 8,500 objects in
orbit around Earth, including dead satellites and bits of expended
rocket stages. Orbiting debris threatens commercial and scientific
satellites alike. Even telescopes on the ground could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium communication satellites are shiny and flat. If a
telescope catches sunlight glinting off one of them, it can burn
out a detector,'' says Patrick Crane, an astronomer at
Interferometrics in Chantilly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Light Pollution. &LR;  Stray light from street lamps wastes energy
and robs city dwellers of the night sky's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at Mount Palomar, near San Diego, have worked with
local officials to find mutually beneficial solutions. Mount Wilson
Observatory, near Los Angeles, has all but given up deep-sky
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Interference From Electronic Devices. &LR;  Cell phones, pagers and
other wireless gadgets are broadcasting their signals at some of
the frequencies that most interest radio astronomers _ and
companies are always looking to expand into new parts of the radio
band.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advertising. &LR;  There are serious proposals for placing
conspicuous billboards, mirrors and solar-power stations in Earth's
orbit. The first attempt at such a project, a Russian mirror that
would work as a huge spotlight, failed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHELTER FROM THE SOLAR STORM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every 11 years, a series of magnetic storms roils across the
sun, bombarding us with disruptive showers of charged particles.
</P>
<P>
   The particles wiggle the Earth's magnetic field, which, in turn,
can induce enough extraneous current in high-voltage power lines to
bring down the entire electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   One such event in 1989 left 6 million Canadians in the dark for
nine hours and cost $10 million to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When the solar cycle peaks again next year, however, utility
companies will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring program called Sunburst 2000 will constantly check
power lines around the world, looking for small induced currents
that indicate the first puffs of a solar squall.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be relayed to power-system managers within
five seconds so they can adjust the current to keep the lines from
overloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunburst 2000 will allow power companies to carry more
electricity more of the time and only back off when a storm hits,''
says Bill Feero, an engineer with Electric Research and Management
in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Feero plans to link Sunburst 2000 with space outposts to
gain an extra half-hour of warning. With any luck, the next wave of
solar storms won't take anyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURPRISE! SHE'S WIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Personal security will become more intimate with the Techno-Bra,
a fusion of miniature electronics and conductive fabric that
monitors the wearer's heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sudden change in pulse indicative of a panic
response, the bra transmits a radio signal that summons the local
police and indicates its location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discreet, comfortable, and won't label you as
vulnerable,'' says the garment's inventor, Kursty Groves, a recent
graduate of London's Royal College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In case of accidental fright, the wearer can hit a ``cancel''
button on the front clasp.
</P>
<P>
   The Techno-Bra should hit stores by Christmas 2000.

<P>
   Four Times Square, a new 48-story office tower, looks much like
any other modern skyscraper in the heart of New York City. But the
top 11 floors of the sleek glass exterior are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   The building's fashionable, light-blue skin contains an array of
electricity-generating solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Dig a little deeper, and you'll find a bank of giant fuel cells
lurking on the fourth floor, silently turning natural gas into
power. Four Times Square is its own freestanding environmentally
friendly electric utility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as corporate dealmakers and the general public
understand the value of these kinds of buildings, they're going to
insist on them,'' predicts Bob Fox, the building's lead architect.
</P>
<P>
   Since Edison's first lightbulb, an increasing number of people
have tied their energy fulfillment needs to the grid of
interconnected power lines. Now the trend is reversing, and
do-it-yourself power is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   Local blackouts and Y2K anxieties have home owners and office
managers alike worrying about a power-grid failure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, freestanding energy sources are getting
cleaner, cheaper and prettier. They can even be money-savers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty states now require utilities to use net metering, which
allows consumers who generate their own power to cut their energy
bills by selling back any excess.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, many buildings could sport solar cells on the roof,
natural-gas turbines and fuel cells in the basement and a link to a
wind turbine up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dramatic changes have popped up in solar power,
long dismissed as visually unappealing and impractically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Architects who once shunned bulky blue solar panels are
marveling at solar cells incorporated discreetly into the surface
of roofing shingles, windows, skylights and wall facades.
</P>
<P>
   Misawa Homes of Japan, that nation's largest home builder,
recently showed off its spare, modernist Eco Energy House, which
turns its solar accoutrements into elegant design elements.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, President Clinton has launched the Million
Solar Roofs Initiative to get solar-energy tiles on the tops of 1
million buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prices keep dropping. Two decades of engineering
sweat have brought solar electricity costs down to an average of 20
cents per kilowatt-hour.
</P>
<P>
   In sunny cities like San Diego, an equivalent flow of
conventional electricity during peak daytime hours can cost as much
as 28 cents, says Nancy Bacon, senior vice president of Energy
Conversion Diversion in Troy, Mich. At night, solar homes in San
Diego can switch to power from the local utility.
</P>
<P>
   First Solar in Toledo, Ohio, is starting to grow transparent
solar cells directly onto glass panes during their manufacture, at
a total cost only slightly higher than that of conventional glass.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, a typical glassmaker rolls out 600 tons of panes for
use in buildings. If just one plant were converted for making solar
glass following First Solar's technique, the glass it produced
would generate about 1 gigawatt of power a year, says Gary Dorer,
the company's vice president of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's almost 10 times more than today's total solar-power
production worldwide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells could also generate compact, do-it-yourself power.
The cells generate electricity by combining hydrogen _ usually
drawn from a fuel like natural gas or methanol _ with oxygen,
launching chemical reactions that spark a current. They work
silently and cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Four Times Square uses the cells for only a fraction of its
total power needs, but in other settings they could pull much
heavier duty. A basement fuel cell working in tandem with solar
cells on a house's roof could churn out all the necessary local
energy, rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a tactical standpoint, it's a beautiful combination,''
says Thomas Hoff, head of Clean Power Research in Napa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, a home's solar power would rev up, especially in
the middle of the day when it is needed most. In the darker days of
winter, the fuel cell would kick into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells generate warmth as they work, so they can be used to
heat rooms or water as well. Add energy-efficient lights and
appliances, and you've got a system that could drastically cut
emissions of carbon dioxide and reduce the threat of global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   If advanced fuel cells eventually power some cars _ and
companies like Ford, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota are betting they
will _ mobile and stationary energy needs might someday merge. At
the end of the day, a home owner might plug the house into the
family car to light up the night.
</P>
<P>
   Most existing fuel cells rely on fossil fuels, but future
versions may tap cheaper renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, several breweries are powered by fuel cells that run
off waste gas produced during fermentation. Methane leaking from
landfills could become another useful source of
electricity-generating gas for fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you have a source of hydrogen-rich gas, you might
think of fuel cells,'' says Adam Serchuk of the Renewable Energy
Policy Project in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Energy Conversion Devices is combining solar and
fuel-cell technologies into the ultimate pollution-free home energy
system. Electricity from solar cells on the roof can split water
molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could then be
siphoned off, stored and used to power fuel cells in the home and
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest demand for high-tech distributed power
sources is coming from poor communities overseas. Worldwide, 2
billion people live without electricity. In rural villages in
China, Mexico and India, on-the-spot energy sources such as wind
turbines, solar panels and small biomass power plants make a lot of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the solar cells and wind turbines made in the
United States are shipped to such remote areas. These markets have
supported the development of do-it-yourself power even while the
United States has continued to rely on cheap oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the technology works,'' says Mike Bergey, president of
Bergey Windpower. ``Now it looks like we'll get a chance to prove
it here in the U.S.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   &UR; COSMIC CARTOGRAPHER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades, some cosmological studies indicated that the
universe is younger than the oldest stars, an obvious
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Freedman at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena,
Calif., recently used the Hubble Space Telescope to determine how
quickly the universe is expanding, then ran the picture backward to
figure out when it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Her international team estimates the cosmos is 12 billion years
old _ almost exactly the age of the most ancient stars.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Does this end the age debate?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Before, people were arguing whether it was 10 billion or 20
billion years old. Now we're talking about differences of a billion
or two.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why is it such a hard problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  To get the age, you need to know how fast the universe is
expanding, so you need velocities and distances. Measuring
velocities turned out to be easy, but measuring distances turned
out to be much harder than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   There's dust between stars, which blocks light. If you don't
correct for that, you get the distances wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter how long the universe has been
expanding?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The fact that we can measure an expansion rate at all tells
us the universe had a beginning. There was a time when galaxies
were close together, and before that there was the Big Bang. It
touches on the question of where we came from.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is the biggest unsolved problem in astronomy?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We don't know how galaxies came to be. We have no idea
about a time between roughly 300,000 and 1 billion years after the
Big Bang, when the universe was very hazy. There were no stars yet,
no galaxies yet. We have very little light available from that
time. It's a ``dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How will we ever learn about the dark ages of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By looking at infrared radiation, astronomers can access a
lot of this region. A new generation of telescopes planned for the
next decade will go above the atmosphere, which blocks infrared
radiation, and tell when the first stars and galaxies appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your personal motivation for doing this kind of
work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Part of the joy of being human is you ask questions and you
discover _ it's natural human curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLINDED BY THE LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite giant new observatories and fancy satellites, scientists
find their view of the cosmos increasingly obscured by the
by-products of a technological society.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union in
Vienna, researchers singled out some particularly galling modern
pollutants:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Space Junk. &LR;  The Department of Defense tracks 8,500 objects in
orbit around Earth, including dead satellites and bits of expended
rocket stages. Orbiting debris threatens commercial and scientific
satellites alike. Even telescopes on the ground could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium communication satellites are shiny and flat. If a
telescope catches sunlight glinting off one of them, it can burn
out a detector,'' says Patrick Crane, an astronomer at
Interferometrics in Chantilly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Light Pollution. &LR;  Stray light from street lamps wastes energy
and robs city dwellers of the night sky's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at Mount Palomar, near San Diego, have worked with
local officials to find mutually beneficial solutions. Mount Wilson
Observatory, near Los Angeles, has all but given up deep-sky
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Interference From Electronic Devices. &LR;  Cell phones, pagers and
other wireless gadgets are broadcasting their signals at some of
the frequencies that most interest radio astronomers _ and
companies are always looking to expand into new parts of the radio
band.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advertising. &LR;  There are serious proposals for placing
conspicuous billboards, mirrors and solar-power stations in Earth's
orbit. The first attempt at such a project, a Russian mirror that
would work as a huge spotlight, failed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHELTER FROM THE SOLAR STORM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every 11 years, a series of magnetic storms roils across the
sun, bombarding us with disruptive showers of charged particles.
</P>
<P>
   The particles wiggle the Earth's magnetic field, which, in turn,
can induce enough extraneous current in high-voltage power lines to
bring down the entire electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   One such event in 1989 left 6 million Canadians in the dark for
nine hours and cost $10 million to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When the solar cycle peaks again next year, however, utility
companies will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring program called Sunburst 2000 will constantly check
power lines around the world, looking for small induced currents
that indicate the first puffs of a solar squall.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be relayed to power-system managers within
five seconds so they can adjust the current to keep the lines from
overloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunburst 2000 will allow power companies to carry more
electricity more of the time and only back off when a storm hits,''
says Bill Feero, an engineer with Electric Research and Management
in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Feero plans to link Sunburst 2000 with space outposts to
gain an extra half-hour of warning. With any luck, the next wave of
solar storms won't take anyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURPRISE! SHE'S WIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Personal security will become more intimate with the Techno-Bra,
a fusion of miniature electronics and conductive fabric that
monitors the wearer's heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sudden change in pulse indicative of a panic
response, the bra transmits a radio signal that summons the local
police and indicates its location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discreet, comfortable, and won't label you as
vulnerable,'' says the garment's inventor, Kursty Groves, a recent
graduate of London's Royal College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In case of accidental fright, the wearer can hit a ``cancel''
button on the front clasp.
</P>
<P>
   The Techno-Bra should hit stores by Christmas 2000.

   &UR; A: &LR;  Before, people were arguing whether it was 10 billion or 20
billion years old. Now we're talking about differences of a billion
or two.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why is it such a hard problem?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  To get the age, you need to know how fast the universe is
expanding, so you need velocities and distances. Measuring
velocities turned out to be easy, but measuring distances turned
out to be much harder than anyone anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   There's dust between stars, which blocks light. If you don't
correct for that, you get the distances wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why does it matter how long the universe has been
expanding?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The fact that we can measure an expansion rate at all tells
us the universe had a beginning. There was a time when galaxies
were close together, and before that there was the Big Bang. It
touches on the question of where we came from.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is the biggest unsolved problem in astronomy?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We don't know how galaxies came to be. We have no idea
about a time between roughly 300,000 and 1 billion years after the
Big Bang, when the universe was very hazy. There were no stars yet,
no galaxies yet. We have very little light available from that
time. It's a ``dark ages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  How will we ever learn about the dark ages of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  By looking at infrared radiation, astronomers can access a
lot of this region. A new generation of telescopes planned for the
next decade will go above the atmosphere, which blocks infrared
radiation, and tell when the first stars and galaxies appeared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your personal motivation for doing this kind of
work?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Part of the joy of being human is you ask questions and you
discover _ it's natural human curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLINDED BY THE LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite giant new observatories and fancy satellites, scientists
find their view of the cosmos increasingly obscured by the
by-products of a technological society.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union in
Vienna, researchers singled out some particularly galling modern
pollutants:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Space Junk. &LR;  The Department of Defense tracks 8,500 objects in
orbit around Earth, including dead satellites and bits of expended
rocket stages. Orbiting debris threatens commercial and scientific
satellites alike. Even telescopes on the ground could be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iridium communication satellites are shiny and flat. If a
telescope catches sunlight glinting off one of them, it can burn
out a detector,'' says Patrick Crane, an astronomer at
Interferometrics in Chantilly, Va.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Light Pollution. &LR;  Stray light from street lamps wastes energy
and robs city dwellers of the night sky's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers at Mount Palomar, near San Diego, have worked with
local officials to find mutually beneficial solutions. Mount Wilson
Observatory, near Los Angeles, has all but given up deep-sky
astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Interference From Electronic Devices. &LR;  Cell phones, pagers and
other wireless gadgets are broadcasting their signals at some of
the frequencies that most interest radio astronomers _ and
companies are always looking to expand into new parts of the radio
band.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advertising. &LR;  There are serious proposals for placing
conspicuous billboards, mirrors and solar-power stations in Earth's
orbit. The first attempt at such a project, a Russian mirror that
would work as a huge spotlight, failed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHELTER FROM THE SOLAR STORM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every 11 years, a series of magnetic storms roils across the
sun, bombarding us with disruptive showers of charged particles.
</P>
<P>
   The particles wiggle the Earth's magnetic field, which, in turn,
can induce enough extraneous current in high-voltage power lines to
bring down the entire electrical grid.
</P>
<P>
   One such event in 1989 left 6 million Canadians in the dark for
nine hours and cost $10 million to fix.
</P>
<P>
   When the solar cycle peaks again next year, however, utility
companies will be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring program called Sunburst 2000 will constantly check
power lines around the world, looking for small induced currents
that indicate the first puffs of a solar squall.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be relayed to power-system managers within
five seconds so they can adjust the current to keep the lines from
overloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunburst 2000 will allow power companies to carry more
electricity more of the time and only back off when a storm hits,''
says Bill Feero, an engineer with Electric Research and Management
in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Feero plans to link Sunburst 2000 with space outposts to
gain an extra half-hour of warning. With any luck, the next wave of
solar storms won't take anyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURPRISE! SHE'S WIRED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Personal security will become more intimate with the Techno-Bra,
a fusion of miniature electronics and conductive fabric that
monitors the wearer's heart rate.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a sudden change in pulse indicative of a panic
response, the bra transmits a radio signal that summons the local
police and indicates its location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discreet, comfortable, and won't label you as
vulnerable,'' says the garment's inventor, Kursty Groves, a recent
graduate of London's Royal College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In case of accidental fright, the wearer can hit a ``cancel''
button on the front clasp.
</P>
<P>
   The Techno-Bra should hit stores by Christmas 2000.

<P>
   KANNAPOLIS, N.C. _ Growing up in this textile mill town six
decades ago, John Bradford was fixated on birds. He drew birds in
grammar school when he should have been studying. He learned bird
calls. Whenever he saw a strange bird, he'd run home and look it up
in the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I never dreamed anything like this would happen,''
marveled Bradford, sitting amid the clamor and cages of a suburban
house that has become a national asylum for neurotic, injured or
neglected exotic tropical birds.
</P>
<P>
   There are 215 feathered patients currently in residence. Human
conversation occurs over a cacophony of squawks and shrieks and
whistles reminiscent of an amplified sound track of a Tarzan movie.
Particularly piercing is the voice of Ringer, a hyacinth macaw with
a formidable feathered head and a naked torso that appears ready
for the poultry section of a supermarket freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Ringer is ``a self-mutilator'' with emotional problems that
compel him to pluck his own feathers, explained Mary Bradford,
whose ornithological interests are as strong as her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradfords are birds of a feather, so to speak, who have put
together an amazing flock of troubled fowl. Hyacinth macaws like
Ringer, for example, are the world's largest parrots. Only about
1,000 remain in the wilds of Brazil, and those bred in captivity
sell for $5,000 to $40,000 in pet stores.
</P>
<P>
   Orko, a Moluccan cockatoo with a self-plucked body, won $10,000
on ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' for the recorded reaction to
his first encounter with a bald human. The Bradfords used the prize
money to build an aviary in their back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The original patient in what is now the non-profit Tropics
Exotic Bird Refuge is Georgie, a blind, blue and gold macaw. He
arrived by happenstance.
</P>
<P>
   After years of longing, the Bradfords had saved up enough in
1990 to buy a feisty pet parrot named Moppet. The bird had bitten
everyone but the Bradfords, so the pet store owner was impressed
with their handling skills. When Georgie's elderly owner could not
longer deal with a blind parrot, she gave the pet to the store.
</P>
<P>
   The store owners figured that ``anyone who could handle Moppet
could handle a handicapped bird,'' explained Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the couple was operating a sanctuary. Word spread
through bird clubs, magazines and Internet sites. Pet owners, zoos,
breeders and storekeepers were soon dropping off birds with
physical and mental problems at the modest, ranch-style house on
the edge of Kannapolis. Seeking room for their growing flock, the
Bradfords built two additions onto the house, then constructed two
buildings out back. John, a retired commercial printer, did the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream'' is a series of back-yard geodomes that will allow
the birds to fly free within an environment similar to their native
rain forests, said Mary. Meanwhile, operating funds come from
bird-loving contributors and sponsors such as bird feed companies.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary has been featured on Nickelodeon's ``Nick News'',
a TBS National Geographic Explorer segment, the UPN Network's
``America's Greatest Pets'' and other television programs. The
media attention brought in more requests for help from all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with birds that haven't adapted well'' as pets,
said Mary. Often calls come from frantic owners pleading, ``Come
and get this bird before I kill it or turn it loose.''
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   In a nation with an estimated 40 million pet birds, there is no
shortage of troubled tropical species.
</P>
<P>
   The problems often begin when people buy a macaw or cockatoo or
other large parrot on a whim, said Patrice Klein, the wildlife
veterinarian for the Humane Society of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since parrots can live up to 100 years, a conscientious owner
will have made a lifetime commitment, said Klein. Too often,
though, the person has no idea what the proper care of the new pet
entails.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs and cats have been domesticated over centuries of breeding
for cohabitation with humans. To a lesser extent, so have parakeets
and canaries. Not so the larger, exotic birds that in recent
decades have become ``popular and fashionable'' _ and expensive _
pets, said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Even if hatched domestically, ``they still have fairly wild
characteristics and complex needs,'' she explained. It is illegal
to import most of these exotic but endangered birds.
</P>
<P>
   In their jungle homes, these large birds live in flocks and
``are very social animals,'' Klein said. They often mate for life.
</P>
<P>
   In captivity, therefore, the birds need hours and hours of
interaction with their human owners. They can't be regarded as a
living decoration. Without proper care and attention, Klein said,
the birds can become ``psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Feather picking is a common behavorial problem among companion
birds,'' said Barry Hartup, a professor of wildlife medicine at the
Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. The causes can
be physical _ throid problems or parasites _ but more often are
emotional. A frequent cause is loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parrot species are very social animals'' and need
stimulation from their owners or other birds, said Hartup.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond their craving for attention, the birds bring other
problems into the homes of their owners.
</P>
<P>
   They are startlingly loud. Indeed, the Bradfords provide
earplugs for visitors. The screeches that a parrot uses for jungle
communications can quickly cause human headaches inside a house.
</P>
<P>
   Even the intelligence of the birds can cause problems. ``They
are like a two-year-old child,'' said Klein. Parents often describe
this as a difficult age for their children, and it's no different
with birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always in 'the terrible twos' and they live for 80
years,'' said Klein.
</P>
<P>
   STAR DASH
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies birds are perched on the Bradfords' mantelpiece
and real parrots fly freely within the house. There's a constant
clean-up of feathers and poop. The noise is endless. Sometimes it
seems that sanity has flown the coop.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister thinks we're crazy,'' said John. ``She says she
couldn't live like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bradfords have found satisfaction providing a home for
birds that need one. They take a few of their charges out for
educational lectures at schools, churches and community gatherings,
and they host field trips for science classes. Most of the birds
welcome company.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the backyard aviary, a visitor is greeted with choruses
of ``Hello,'' ``Hello,'' ``Hello,'' ``Hello,'' coming from dozens
of beaks. A single squawk sets off a chain reaction in cages across
the large room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always ask for their cages,'' said Mary. ``The bird should
move here with its own home and toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the aviary, John and Mary frequently open cages
and take out the bird inside. Every bird has its own favorite form
of play. A cockatoo might be cuddled like a baby, a parrot perched
on a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of species make up a sort of loud, living rainbow.
There are pink-breasted Bourke parakeets from Australia and African
gray parrots and white cockatoos that bounce up and down and spread
the feathers on their heads like an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   John points to a cage holding several multi-hued Quaker
parakeets. ``Some people think they make good pets,'' he said.
``But they're like a feathered pit bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Birds that are still self-mutilating wear protective bandages
and vests. Some have stopped attacking themselves but are
permanently plucked _ having destroyed the follicles from which
feathers grow.
</P>
<P>
   One cherry-headed conyer is almost completely bare of feathers.
It began its own plucking and was later assisted by a companion
bird that picked off the head feathers. The sad result is a bald,
beaked creature that appears to have come from a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Every bird here has a story. Tango lost a foot to frostbite
after being left outside by a previous owner. A tempermental
cockatoo was brought in by a couple afraid that the jealous bird
would hurt their new baby. A parrot with clipped wings was
paralyzed after falling from a perch.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the Bradfords tried to find homes for the troubled
birds. But they gave up after repeatedly having to ``rescue them
from the rescuers,'' said Mary. Now they hope to keep expanding to
care for the needy birds that folks just keep bringing in.
</P>
<P>
   The birds can't survive in the wild, said Mary, and would become
``hawk bait'' if set free.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bradfords keep taking them in, knowing that usually the
troubled birds have nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   ENDIT
</P>
<P>
   could not survive on their own. ``hawk bait.''
</P>
<P>
   no complaints from neighbors. ``our neighbors love us now that
we're so famous.''

   `` &UR; Comfortable in his skin &LR; '' was identified by Melinda
Henneberger of The New York Times as ``the favorite phrase of
admirers of ... former Sen. Bill Bradley.'' It appeared in a Howard
Fineman article in Newsweek in July: ``He came off as a relaxed
public man  &UR; comfortable in his own skin &LR; ,'' and Eleanor Clift used
it a month later on Fox TV: ``The fact that he's more  &UR; comfortable
in his own skin &LR;  is what makes him appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase's use in American politics was first remarked by
Michael Kinsley in 1988, then writing in The New Republic about
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis: ``Ironically it is the
uptight, humorless Dukakis who seems most  &UR; comfortable in his own
skin &LR; , to cite the official standard of campaign-trail media
psychologists.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also translated as  &UR; comfortable inside his skin &LR;  and is
from the French  &UR; etre bien dans sa peau &LR; . The meaning of the Gallic
trope is ``at peace with oneself,'' or in current political
terminology, ``the balanced, centered state of being that comes
when the person is not in conflict with the persona.'' (To be
inside someone else's skin, which never quite fits, is presumably
uncomfortable.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henneberger's recent use was to contrast the general
acceptance of Bradley's skin-insidership with the news media
brouhaha over the Gore campaign's retention, purportedly for image
guidance, of Naomi Wolf. She is the author who once noted that she
wrote in ``the first-person sexual,'' a singular locution.
</P>
<P>
   Because her employment was concealed, her guidance that Vice
President Gore act more like an  &UR; alpha male &LR;  _ mentioned only in
passing, she says _ was seized on by pundits eager to ridicule any
potential manipulation of images.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alpha male &LR; , I am informed by Edward Lucaire of New York, is a
coinage of Rudolph Schenkel, who studied dominance hierarchies
among captive wolves (no kin to the Gore consultant) at the zoo in
Basel, Switzerland, in the 1930s. It is the term now used for ``top
dog,'' employed by ethologists studying the micturition and mating
habits of predatory canids. Among wolves, it seems that only the
 &UR; alpha males &LR;  breed. We are now off on a tangent.
</P>
<P>
   Back to work. Of Ms. Wolf, Ms. Henneberger wrote, ``Her last
book, `Promiscuities,' is about girls sexually coming of age and
prescribes heavy petting as an alternative to early intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   What a pleasure it was to see  &UR; heavy petting &LR;  back in use.
That's old slang describing the sort of intimate caressing and
fondling defined accurately but clinically in the OED as
``noncoital sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Its origin was ``to treat as a pet'' _ that is, to stroke
lovingly. Between humans,  &UR; to pet &LR;  came to mean ``to fondle,'' or
in slang, ``to cop a feel,'' one step past  &UR; neck &LR; , ``to engage in
prolonged kissing.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 came the first cited use of the adjective-noun
combination: Mark Caine, in ``The S Man: A Grammar of Success,''
wrote of ``what is called  &UR; heavy petting &LR; , in which frank
exploration of each other's bodies is permitted.'' (I think it was
used in the '50s, synonymous with a baseball allusion, ``I hit a
triple but not a home run.'')
</P>
<P>
   Euphemism is occasionally desirable. The generalized, even
modest,  &UR; heavy petting &LR;  strikes me as more suitable in what used to
be called polite company than today's overly specific  &UR; mutual
masturbation &LR;  or  &UR; oral sex &LR; , which may or may not be involved in
medium-weight petting. If slang must be eschewed, another
possibility is  &UR; outercourse &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Back to the trope-a-dope of current politics. The knock being
put on Sen. John McCain as he creeps up on Gov. George W. Bush in
the polls is that he conceals a hot temper. ``Most Americans do not
expect their presidents to be Caspar Milquetoasts,'' the pollster
Whit Ayres said, referring to the wimpish cartoon character created
by Harold Tucker Webster in 1924, but ``they also don't want him
 &UR; flying off the handle &LR;  at inopportune times.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To fly off the handle &LR;  was first recorded in 1843 by the
Canadian Thomas Haliburton, author of a series of satires on a
too-shrewd Yankee named Sam Slick. ``You never see such a
crotchical old critter as he is,'' he quoted a character in a
novel. ``He  &UR; flies right off the handle &LR;  for nothing.'' The trope,
or figure of speech, is that of the head of an ax becoming detached
from its handle during a hard swing.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has been attacked for his lack of academic
achievement in college. ``According to the Yale document,'' wrote
Jane Mayer and Alexandra Robbins in The New Yorker, citing school
records, ``Bush was a C student. (This, of course, was in a
preinflationary time, the waning era of the  &UR; gentleman's C &LR; .)''
Bush, in self-deprecation, earlier used the phrase, saying,
``That's the difference between a Phi Beta Kappa and a  &UR; gentleman's
C &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries are no help in tracking down that phrase. Earliest
use I can find is in a 1959 Journal of Negro Education about bright
students ``poorly motivated, content to be a ` &UR; gentleman's C &LR; .'''
The quotation marks indicate earlier usage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Richard Merelman wrote in the University of Texas'
Journal of Politics, ``Although such ascriptive practices as the
 &UR; gentleman's C &LR;  are now dying out, the antiquated image of
education they reflect _ a view that education should legitimize a
social aristocracy by providing it with marks of status _ remains
embedded in the schools.'' (Whoever supplies the origin of this
phrase will get a helluva grade from me.)
</P>
<P>
   This department will try to stay on top of the Americanisms
cascading out of the 2000 campaign. That's how word mavens stay
 &UR; comfortable in their own skins &LR; .

FEDERAL DEFENDANT CAN'T SPEAK IN HIS OWN DEFENSE

<P>
   Imagine this: You're a juror in a criminal case. The defendant
is whisked into the room in a wheelchair. He's gagged. His attorney
follows. He's gagged, too. The federal government's prosecuting
attorneys are present at their table. They aren't gagged. The
prosecutors outline the case against the defendant. Neither the
defendant nor his attorney can respond to the charges _ because of
a ruling by the judge _ but the jury doesn't know why.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't fiction; it isn't a scene from a Kafka novel. It's
real. Can the defendant expect justice in such a federal district
court?
</P>
<P>
   The defendant in this Kafkaesque scenario is best-selling author
and publisher Peter McWilliams. In 1996, he was diagnosed with both
AIDS and an AIDS-related cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. McWilliams
underwent chemotherapy and radiation for the cancer and a
pharmaceutical therapy for AIDS. The cancer treatment resulted in
complete remission. The AIDS treatment entails a mixture of
chemically derived protease inhibitors and anti-viral medications
in order to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus in his body. He
must continue his AIDS treatment in order to live.
</P>
<P>
   When McWilliams began his intensive treatment, he experienced
violent nausea from the moment the medications reached his stomach.
He couldn't hold them down long enough for the medicines to be
absorbed by his body.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor prescribed every anti-nausea medication available.
None worked. He vomited out his numerous pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams might have died _ except he discovered that smoking
marijuana controlled the nausea long enough for his body to absorb
his medications. The amount of live AIDS virus in his blood dropped
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams lives in the Los Angeles area. In 1996, California
voters passed Proposition 215, the ballot measure that allows
patients to smoke marijuana with a doctor's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 215 also allows seriously ill patients or their
primary caregiver to grow marijuana for the patients' personal
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams cultivated 300 marijuana plants for his own medical
use.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government isn't about to let states legalize
marijuana, even for the compassionate use by serious and terminally
ill patients who find marijuana a palliative that eases their pain
and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, federal agents arrested McWilliams. He is
currently charged with manufacturing marijuana, conspiracy to
manufacture marijuana, and aiding and abetting the manufacturing of
marijuana. The terms of his bail were that he cannot use marijuana
to control his nausea and that he has to submit to random urine
tests.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams stopped smoking marijuana. He now takes the
prescription anti-nausea drug, Marinol, that he claims only works
about a third of the time. He vomits up much of his AIDS
medications and, by the fall of 1998, the amount of live AIDS virus
in his blood had reached a critical stage. McWilliams can no longer
walk any further than 50 feet and uses a wheelchair. He often
sleeps 18 hours a day. All this since the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The federal prosecutors found a friendly federal district court
judge in George H. King of the U.S. District Court of the Central
District of California. On Nov. 5, King ruled that McWilliams and
his attorney cannot use in McWilliams' defense: his medical
condition; Proposition 215; the National Institute of Medicine's
recent report on the medical usefulness of marijuana; a medical
necessity defense; nor may they mention the federal government's
own drug program which treats eight patients with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the defendant and his attorney are to appear in
court, but they will be gagged. This sounds like a something out of
a Soviet court during the Cold War: Say anything in your defense
and you're guilty; say nothing and you're guilty.
</P>
<P>
   What has this nation come to? A defendant in a criminal trial is
prohibited from telling a jury his reasons for smoking and growing
marijuana, about the California law which is supposed to protect
medical use of marijuana, about how his health plummeted because he
can no longer use marijuana, about medical research that verifies
the medical usefulness of marijuana and about the federal
government's own marijuana program.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' attorney can't even tell the jury that he cannot
address some key issues and why he can't.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' health is failing, his publishing house of 32 years
is bankrupt and he faces 10 years in federal prison _ because he is
ill and followed California state law.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams' attorney, Thomas J. Ballanco, says the federal
government is using his client as more than a test case: ``They're
making it a deterrence case. They want to hold this up to all the
other patients, in all the other states who might want to implement
the various state medical marijuana initiatives. And say look,
`We're still going to come after you. And we're still going to get
big prison sentences.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 12, McWilliams and his attorney sat down with the
prosecution and a different judge to negotiate a guilty plea.
Nothing has been decided yet. But pivotal to any plea agreement,
according to McWilliams, is his right to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Under Judge King's restrictions, McWilliams doesn't feel he has
a chance to win in a trial: ``This is an issue that is hopeless in
a court of law, unless there is jury nullification _ unless
somehow, some way the jury found out what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury nullification occurs when a jury deliberately rejects the
evidence of guilt or refuses to apply the law because it wants to
send a message about a social issue or because the result dictated
by the law is contrary to the jury's sense of justice, morality or
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a case in American law that justified jury
nullification, it's this one. The federal prosecutors, in this
case, have acted like shameless bullies _ pounding a sick man into
the ground. But their action is really aimed at all citizens who
may suffer from AIDS or cancer _ our parents, children, loved ones.

 BACK TO BASICS: PAUL McCARTNEY SINGS THAT OLD-TIME ROCK 'N' ROLL  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer Paul McCartney.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Actor Woody Harrelson sits in the VIP room on the mezzanine of
New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, chatting with rocker Sheryl Crow
and awaiting, with several thousand others, a preview playback of
Paul McCartney's new album, ``Run Devil Run.''
 &HT;    ``I guess I've been an enormous fan of his since I was 6,''
Harrelson says. ``It was the first music I listened to. I still
listen to his music every day, every single day.
 &HT;    ``And what I've heard about this album, it's more rockabilly and
rock 'n' roll. I like that.''
 &HT;    So does the rest of the crowd, a mix of contest winners,
celebrities and music-industry folks who sway and dance as ``Run
Devil Run's'' 15 songs _ 12 covers of old, mostly obscure rock 'n'
roll songs and three McCartney originals _ blast over the speaker
system.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, looking tanned and trim in a black suit, McCartney
sits in a quiet office nine stories above, talking about the album
which takes him back to where his legendary career began.
 &HT;    ``Run Devil Run,'' which arrives in stores Tuesday, was in the
works before McCartney's wife, Linda, died of breast cancer 17
months ago. He's released it, he says, as a tribute to her and as a
kind of comfort for himself in its return to his rock 'n' roll
roots.
 &HT;    ``It was next in line, the next project,'' explains the
57-year-old McCartney, who also has his third classical album,
``Working Classical,'' coming out on Oct. 19. ``I wanted to make a
rock 'n' roll record before the 20th century ended. It's also
something Linda was very keen on me doing, and she was egging me
on, really bugging me about it, because she was a big rock 'n' roll
fan.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, I regret she isn't here to hear it,'' he says.
``That's a major regret, but never mind _ we did it for her.''
 &HT;    With a smile, McCartney juts his thumb over his right shoulder.
 &HT;    ``She's still here,'' he says, ``bugging me _ `Come on, man, get
it right!'''
 &HT;    She would most likely be proud, as ``Run Devil Run'' presents
McCartney in his most rocking form in years, possibly since his
1988 collection of oldies for the former Soviet Union, ``CHOBA B
C.C.C.P.'' (``Back in the U.S.S.R.'').
 &HT;    His new songs _ the title track, ``Try Not to Cry'' and ``What
It Is'' _ display the same rollicking, resounding quality as the
covers, and the selections from the catalogs of Elvis Presley,
Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent, Fats Domino and others reveal a personal
and passionate connection to 1950s and early-1960s rock that goes
beyond simple sentimentality and nostalgia.
 &HT;    ``It's pure memories from childhood,'' McCartney says. ``There's
a fairground in Sexton Park where me and my friend Ian James walked
around in our flak jackets with the little flap on the top and
thought we were really cool, and we thought we'd attract women _
and we didn't.
 &HT;    ``To remember it was very exciting,'' he says, ``but also to be
a teen-ager at that time was a very exciting, interesting time. It
was America reawakening the world, because we were into sort of
other stuff. Suddenly Elvis and Little Richard came screaming out
across the Atlantic, and it was just so exciting for us all.''
 &HT;    If the song selection came from his youth, the actual making of
the album harkened back to McCartney's days with the Beatles. The
band which he and co-producer Chris Thomas assembled included his
old friend David Gilmour, the former guitarist from Pink Floyd, as
well as Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice, whom McCartney had never met
_ former Beatle Ringo Starr was his first choice, he says, but
Starr wasn't available.
 &HT;    They then set aside no more than a week in which to make ``Run
Devil Run.''
 &HT;    ``With the Beatles,'' McCartney recalls, ``what we used to do in
the very early days was we were expected to show up at the studio
at 10:00 on a Monday morning and be ready to record at 10:30.
Between 10:30 and 1:30 we were expected to have done two songs _
then we got 1:30 to 2:30 for lunch, then 2:30 to 5:30 for two more
songs. That was the way we did it.''
 &HT;    In that spirit, McCartney didn't even confer with the musicians
ahead of time.
 &HT;    ``So Monday morning it was, `Hey, how you doing? We're going to
make an album together,''' he recalls. ``So it was very
spontaneous, but that was the way I wanted to do it. It was
actually cool working that way _ I got some professional nostalgia
for it.''
 &HT;    The sessions netted 19 songs, 15 of which appear on the album.
The others will be used as B-sides, starting with his version of
Charlie Gracie's ``Fabulous,'' a Top 20 hit in 1957 which was the
first track the ad-hoc band recorded.
 &HT;    ``I met Eric Clapton in a restaurant in L.A. the other night,''
McCartney says. ``He said, `Man, I heard you found some stuff I
don't even know.'
 &HT;    ``These were just pure memories,'' he adds, ``all stuff that
really affected me as a kid.''
 &HT;    His current projects have also brought McCartney back into the
public eye after more than a year devoted primarily to private
mourning. He's held listening parties for ``Run Devil Run'' in Los
Angeles, New York and London, and he recently performed at the
annual awards ceremony for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, a cause long dear to Linda McCartney.
 &HT;    But the singer, who hasn't toured since 1993, says he has no
current plans to tour to promote ``Run Devil Run,'' though he
admits that he had ``a real great time'' performing live at the
PETA gig and that tour plans may eventually come together.
 &HT;    ``I think we're going to want to do it,'' McCartney says.
``Normally it's the promoters or your record company wants you to
do it, and there's something that forces you to do a tour. I
thought, `Wouldn't it be really cool if it's the band that's really
itching to get on tour?'
 &HT;    ``It may happen _ not at the moment, but it may well be soon.''
 &HT;    It will be difficult to tour without Linda, he adds. During
their 29-year marriage, they were apart only during the time he
spent in a Japanese jail after a January 1980 arrest for marijuana
possession.
 &HT;    His grieving, McCartney says, is not over, but ``Run Devil Run''
provides an appropriate point of re-entry.
 &HT;    ``It feels good, and it feels like Linda would be very behind
it,'' he says. ``One of the pieces of advice people will give you
if you have a major grief is get busy, keep busy, keep your mind
off it. And I didn't want to do that. I made a point of, for a
year, not doing that.
 &HT;    ``I said `No, I'm going to experience the feelings for a year,
try and find where that all takes me,'' he says. ``So now, after
all that time, I'm feeling more comfortable with just easing back
into things.''

 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Tim Burton does not live in a black house, with black furniture,
black carpeting and black roses in every room.
 &HT;    There are no coffins in his basement, tombstones in his backyard
or, for that matter, skeletons in his closet.
 &HT;    ``People who know me know I'm not like that,'' Burton says,
flashing a grin. ``I don't even consider my films dark.''
 &HT;    Well, that may be a bit hard to believe. After all, while the
39-year-old director did start off with the sun-dappled ``Pee-wee's
Big Adventure'' (1985), he's since made his name with such sinister
fare as ``Beetlejuice'' (1988), ``Batman'' (1989), ``Edward
Scissorhands'' (1990), ``Batman Returns'' (1992), ``Tim Burton's
The Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993, which he produced), ``Ed
Wood'' (1996) and ``Mars Attacks'' (1998).
 &HT;    Burton lives up to his reputation by sporting an all-black
ensemble and black shades during a conversation at New York's
Regency Hotel. He's a speed-talker, prone to changing subjects in
midsentence.
 &HT;    ``I've seen dark films,'' he insists. ``I guess it stems from
the puritanical roots of this country, in a way. In Mexico, they
celebrate the Day of the Dead. There's humor involved with it. It's
not treated with such ... `Eeeew.'''
 &HT;    Throughout his career, Burton has proved adept at fusing
``Eeeew'' with humor. And his latest film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' based
on Washington Irving's ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and set to
open nationwide on Nov. 19 ... well, let's just say that it won't
help him convince people that he's not a guy who makes dark films.
 &HT;    Set in 1799, the movie stars frequent Burton collaborator Johnny
Depp as Ichabod Crane, an offbeat, queasy constable assigned to
solve a slew of beheadings in Sleepy Hollow, a community as
littered with secrets as it is with corpses. Crane's investigation
brings him into contact with Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci),
daughter of Sleepy Hollow's most affluent couple (Michael Gambon
and Miranda Richardson), and with the notorious Headless Horseman
himself.
 &HT;    ``When I read the script I really liked it, and thought I could
actually do a movie like the ones I loved as a kid,'' Burton says,
``like the Hammer films of the 1950s and 1960s.
 &HT;    ``I knew the `Sleepy Hollow' story from school and the Disney
cartoon,'' he recalls. ``Actually, the cartoon had a fair amount of
inspiration on me because of the chase scene _ I remember, as a
kid, being really affected by that scene.
 &HT;    ``It set the tone I like, which is funny, scary and
action-oriented all at once.''
 &HT;    In his effort to make the best Hammer film Hammer never
produced, Burton erected the Sleepy Hollow village on sound stages
and on location in London. He also tapped the talents of genre
veterans such as Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths and Michael
Gough.
 &HT;    ``We were so lucky to get Christopher Lee,'' Burton says, giddy
as a vampire at a blood bank. ``When he was sitting there, it was
like looking at Dracula. He's hypnotic.
 &HT;    ``The scene in the movie with Johnny, Michael Gough, Michael
Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Jeffrey Jones and Ian McDiarmid was done
on our first day,'' he recalls. ``I was looking forward to that
day, and I couldn't wait to see all these people in one room at the
same time.
 &HT;    ``I was so scared,'' Burton admits, ``but it was amazing. I was
just looking at all of these guys who've done so many things. I was
like, `There's the Singing Detective,' or `There's Michael Gough,
who was in ``Konga,'' which is one of my favorites,' or `There's
Richard Griffiths and Jeffrey Jones.'
 &HT;    ``It was great, fantastic. I loved it.''
 &HT;    As for Depp, Burton knew from square one that his former Edward
Scissorhands and Ed Wood would make an ideal Ichabod Crane.
 &HT;    ``He does something different each time, and that's fun,''
Burton says. ``I like chameleons _ I like people who are different
from one film to the next.
 &HT;    ``Johnny's never really done action before, and we were going
for action with a bit of elegance,'' the director adds. ``I know
he's a good actor and I knew from `Scissorhands' that he's a good
physical actor, but I was surprised by how well he did the
action.''
 &HT;    Burton's earlier films often hinted at acts of terrible violence
or cruelty, but depicted them discreetly. Heads really do roll,
however, in the R-rated ``Sleepy Hollow'' _ and the director makes
no apologies.
 &HT;    ``It's part of the storytelling,'' he says. ``What I tried to do
was keep it in the fantasy realm, especially given the climate in
the country.''
 &HT;    The recent uproar over violence in movies is misdirected, Burton
believes.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of talk about violence, obviously,'' he says.
``But I feel that it's the wrong kind of talk. It's easy targets,
and the real root of it is not addressed at all.''
 &HT;    There was plenty of violence in the old Hammer films, he adds,
but he doesn't think it hurt him growing up.
 &HT;    ``If I didn't have the opportunity to see these kinds of movies
when I was a child, I don't know what I'd be like,'' the director
says. ``It was a catharsis for me.
 &HT;    ``Kids need parameters,'' he adds, ``but I think they're pretty
good at finding their own level of what they can and can't take. I
consider `Sleepy Hollow' a fairy tale, and most fairy tales deal
with even more horrific imagery.''
 &HT;    Passionate as he now is about ``Sleepy Hollow,'' Burton didn't
originally plan to make the film. He received the script only after
the long-gestating ``Superman Lives,'' which would have cast
Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel, hit a wall of Kryptonite.
 &HT;    ``I worked for a year on `Superman,''' Burton says, clearly
still seething more than a year after Warner Bros. pulled the plug
on the project. ``It was a year of my life. We were making the
movie.
 &HT;    ``It was probably one of the most damaging things for my psyche
that I've ever had happen,'' he says. ``I like to be positive, but
I actually feel that I wasted a year of my life. That's a terrible
feeling, and you never want to feel that in anything you do.''
 &HT;    Burton considers himself a Hollywood outsider, though he grew up
in Los Angeles and lives there _ and in New York _ with his
longtime girlfriend, actress Lisa Marie.
 &HT;    ``L.A. is a nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live
there,'' Burton says, smiling.
 &HT;    ``Listen, I like weather. I like walking. And those are two
things you can't do in L.A.,'' he says. ``They don't have them _
there's not much weather and you can't walk. If you walk in L.A.,
the cops will stop you and ask what you're doing.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Burton is a rare example of a vanishing breed: a
director who, working within the Hollywood system, is still able to
make highly individualistic films.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky enough to do what I've wanted to do, even
early on, even within the system,'' Burton admits. ``That's very
lucky, and my luck has held out.
 &HT;    ``I like doing my films,'' the director adds. ``I can't imagine
doing a Western. It would probably be the worst thing.
 &HT;    ``People say, `When are you going to make a real movie?'''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I treat my films as real,'' Burton says. ``I'm sorry, but
they're real movies to me.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jewel with Tobey Maguire in a scene from
``Ride With the Devil.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The name is Jewel _ Jewel Kilcher, technically, but she prefers
to be singular _ and it's hard to discourage her.
 &HT;    Always has been, since her earliest days on stage.
 &HT;    ``When I first started singing, there was one night in a rundown
bar. I was crying because all these drunks were screaming things at
me,'' the 25-year-old singer recalls during an interview at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. ``But my father said, `Stop thinking
about yourself. A lot of people have it worse than you _ sing for
them.'
 &HT;    ``That was the first moment when I realized that I was put here
on this earth to please an audience.''
 &HT;    That never-quit attitude came in handy when she finally found
the role she wanted to play in her screen debut _ a young frontier
woman who, in Ang Lee's Civil War drama ``Ride With the Devil,'' is
wooed by two young men whose lives are changed forever by a year of
combat.
 &HT;    Before she could even try to convince audiences that she had the
acting chops for the role in the movie, which will open Dec. 10,
Jewel had to persuade an even-more-skeptical audience of one,
director Lee.
 &HT;    ``I told her that I would work with her for six months and then
we would see if she could earn the part,'' Lee recalls in a
separate interview. ``Honestly, we didn't think a big music star
like Jewel would stick with the program where she would learn
acting with no promise of a role.''
 &HT;    But the singer surprised him, persevering and ultimately winning
the role.
 &HT;    ``I've had many movie offers in the past,'' Jewel says. ``But I
chose the Ang Lee movie because it's not so much about war _ to me,
the film's message is that extreme circumstances force you to get
to know yourself.
 &HT;    ``In peaceful times a person can go, `What the hell am I going
to do with myself?''' she says. ``You socialize. You flirt. You get
married _ your entire life is on this course. And I think this
movie shows what happens when something big knocks a human being
off their course.
 &HT;    ``Some of the strongest people I know have had to go to depths
within themselves to fight for their lives,'' she adds. ``They're
currently fighting a war called poverty.
 &HT;    ``But the best part of fighting a war is that you emerge even
stronger,'' she says. ``My friends who survived the most bleak
circumstances have more peace of mind than people who were handed
everything on a platter.''
 &HT;    Even a topless scene didn't dissuade her.
 &HT;    ``There's a scene where I breastfeed someone,'' Jewel says. ``I
felt comfortable doing this on screen, because I knew Ang didn't
put breast-feeding in the movie because he wanted a glimpse of my
boob. He just wanted to add softness and warmth to his movie.
 &HT;    ``For another director, hell no, I wouldn't have done it,'' she
adds. ``For Ang, nothing was impossible for me to muster up.''
 &HT;    ``Nothing is impossible'' is the novice actress's motto,
actually. Jewel Kilcher grew up in rural Homer, Alaska, living with
her bohemian parents and two brothers on 800 acres of land. There
was no television nor running water, and the bathroom was an
outhouse in the field.
 &HT;    ``People ask, `Did you know you were this poor as a child?'''
Jewel says. ``Of course I did _ I grew up in the '80s. All I wanted
in my life back then was a pair of new acid-washed jeans, and I
felt denied because we couldn't afford them.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand,'' she says, ``I also felt very proud of my
heritage as a kid. I felt lucky that I came from a family who could
make things _ we were a really talented family, so for Christmas we
would get beautiful baskets and hand-knit sweaters. These were
gifts that had some meaning behind them.''
 &HT;    Her parents moonlighted as a singing/songwriting duo, and in
their spare time taught their daughter to yodel.
 &HT;    ``It was my show-biz break,'' she says, laughing. ``I was so
good at yodeling that my parents made me part of the show.''
 &HT;    But the show ended a few years later when her parents divorced.
During her father's visits, Jewel would sing with him in different
bars. Her mother devoted her time to home-schooling her daughter
and focusing on music, art and poetry.
 &HT;    Eventually, Jewel earned a voice scholarship to Michigan's famed
Interlochen Arts Academy, where she studied opera, sculpture, dance
and drama.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, her mother moved to San Diego, where times got even
tougher. After Jewel graduated from high school she returned home,
where she and her mother waitressed, punched cash registers and
struggled to make ends meet.
 &HT;    ``When you're poor in the city, that's a different ball of
wax,'' Jewel says. ``It was just about getting by from meal to
meal. And it was about witnessing heartbreak _ I would see people
collapsing in the streets from drug overdoses.''
 &HT;    The worst moment came when she was felled by a kidney infection.
 &HT;    ``I could barely walk,'' she says quietly, ``but I had no
insurance, so hospital after hospital refused to treat me. It was a
brutal wake-up call about life.''
 &HT;    Finally, Jewel decided that she wanted to become a singer and
songwriter.
 &HT;    ``My mother said we needed to give this dream 100 percent
effort,'' she recalls. ``To do that, we couldn't worry about paying
the rent. So we moved into the family van. We would only eat
carrots and peanut butter. At night, I would sing in the local
coffee shops.''
 &HT;    A regular gig at the Innerchange Coffeehouse in Pacific Beach
got her career moving. In 1994 she was signed by Atlantic Records
and sent out on a nationwide coffeehouse tour. The next year, her
debut album, ``Piece of You,'' was released.
 &HT;    It took 14 months, but ``Piece of You'' finally made its way
into the Billboard Top 200. The singles ``Who Will Save Your Soul''
and ``You Were Meant for Me'' eventually climbed the charts, with
the first song peaking at No. 11 and the second hitting No. 2.
 &HT;    The album went triple platinum, and Jewel became a star and an
inspiration to millions.
 &HT;    ``I hate, hate, hate the word idol,'' Jewel says intensely. ``I
would rather be an inspiration.''
 &HT;    Her fans helped make Jewel's second album, ``Spirit'' (1998),
into another hit _ and likewise ``A Night Without Armor: Poems''
(Harper-Collins, 1998), her book of poetry. But she admits to
feeling uncomfortable with their level of devotion.
 &HT;    ``Finally,'' she says, ``I wrote to my fan group on the Internet
and said, `I don't want to cripple people. If I'm here to make you
people worship someone, I will quit right now _ I can't be
responsible for that thinking. I'd much rather you people use the
inspiration I give you to do something with your own lives.''
 &HT;    And Jewel got her wish.
 &HT;    ``For my last birthday,'' she recalls, ``the fans wanted to send
me a present. I'm like, `Hi, I'm rich. Don't need presents. Give
them to people who need them.'
 &HT;    ``Now they send me a book of everyone who does community service
in their areas,'' Jewel says. ``I get thousands of hours of
community service done in my name. That's so cool.''

JALEEL WHITE BATTLES THE GHOST OF WHAT'S-HIS-NAME

entertainment package.)

 By CHRISTOPHER NOXON  
 c.1999 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaleel White doesn't like to talk about the character he played
for nearly 10 years on network television.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he'd rather not think at all about that little,
polka-loving dweeb, Urkel. The character's name alone _ goofy and
guttural, an instant buzzword for all things nerdy _ makes him
wince visibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him die,'' the 22-year-old White says, relaxing on the
patio of Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. ``I've got a mental
tombstone for that character. I've got lots of flowers around it,
but that boy is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be that easy to erase the memory of the character,
who surely ranks as one of television's most vivid sitcom
creations.
</P>
<P>
   White had made appearances on ``The Jeffersons'' and the pilot
of ``Saved by the Bell'' before auditioning at age 12 for a guest
spot on the ABC series ``Family Matters,'' appearing before
producers in tight suspenders, trousers cut off at mid-shin and an
enormous pair of plastic eyeglasses that framed his darting, googly
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He moved around the sound stage in jerks and jolts, and spoke in
a voice so high-pitched and nasal that it hovered several registers
above that of anyone else who dared inhabit the same scene.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Urkel was born.
</P>
<P>
   That guest spot grew into a starring role, and led the
Friday-night sitcom to an astonishing nine seasons on ABC and CBS,
ranking alongside ``Seinfeld'' for longevity. At the peak of the
show's popularity, the schoolyard set's version of Cosmo Kramer had
a breakfast cereal, an ABC special and legions of fans.
</P>
<P>
   When the end finally came in 1997, long after White had grown
out of the twiggy, 5-foot frame in which he began, ``Family
Matters'' vanished with hardly a peep, its final episodes broadcast
in the Nielsen dead zone of July.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later White has returned to prime-time television in a
most unlikely package. Few recognized him in the opening scene of
his new UPN sitcom, the cannily titled ``Grown-Ups,'' which
premiered in August and is now running Mondays at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Urkel's getup is gone. So is his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we met a bulked-up fellow in a tank top and Air Jordans
who shoots hoops and makes quirky asides to a pudgy sidekick. As J.
Calvin Frazier, a frustrated junior manager at a corrugated-box
company, White is playing the sort of young man who, faced with the
uber-nerd Urkel, would be likely to administer a quick and expert
wedgie.
</P>
<P>
   But even with his gym-enhanced physique, White knows he will
have to work hard to make audiences forget the role that made him
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you break your Vinnie Barbarino/Mork mode, that's what
you are,'' he says, citing the television roles that sparked the
careers of John Travolta and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the studio machine had a lot invested
in Urkel,'' he says. ``They sold that character for a decade. You
think you can go out and break that in a year? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives at UPN don't mind a bit if the scent of Urkel
clings to the buffed-up White. According to Tom Nunan, the
network's president of entertainment, while the association may not
do much for the struggling network's ``cool factor,'' White has
nothing to be embarrassed about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching him play that part over the years was like watching
Jerry Lewis or Groucho Marx or, dare I say, Charlie Chaplin at
times,'' Nunan says. ``It was perfectly realized. Urkel was a very
successfully rendered character, and a lot of people have a lot of
affection for him.''
</P>
<P>
   White is not one of those people. Shortly after ``Family
Matters'' was canceled, he told a reporter, ``If you ever see me do
that character again, take me out and put a bullet in my head and
put me out of my misery.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor attributes that bitterness to his feeling, long before
the show ended, that he had wholly outgrown his inner Urkel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in his senior year at the University of California at Los
Angeles, White is a film student and avid jock, closely following
pro and college basketball and hanging out with Anfernee Hardaway,
the star guard for the Phoenix Suns. His speech is fast and
colorful _ ``Some mango would be the bomb,'' he tells a waitress _
and his abilities as a performer, he says, extend far beyond
geekdom.
</P>
<P>
   And while he enjoyed the perks of starring in a long-running
network show, White says he was more than happy to leave behind the
life of a child star.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get credit for what you do _ you get chalked up to
being cute or cuddly,'' he says. ``And you're never treated like
your adult counterparts. They come along and get production deals
and do other shows. With a child, it's like, `Send him a bike.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any surprise that the man behind Urkel just wants a little
respect?
</P>
<P>
   To make sure he gets it, White told UPN that he would appear in
``Grown-Ups'' only if he could also produce, working alongside
series creator Matthew Miller.
</P>
<P>
   At first the former child star was not exactly welcomed by
Miller, a 27-year-old screenwriter who had sold ``Grown-Ups'' as an
hour-long dramedy, a sort of ``Ally McBeal'' for guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a phone call telling me that `Grown-Ups' was getting
picked up, but as a half-hour, multi-camera show starring Urkel,''
Miller says in a separate interview. ``I immediately hung up the
phone. That was my big artistic stance _ it lasted about 15
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   His doubts eased, Miller says, when White came in for a reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's totally charming,'' the writer says. ``His timing makes
it so easy to write for him. You just give him the suggestion of a
joke, and he nails it.''
</P>
<P>
   White hopes that audiences will feel the same way once they see
him performing a regular-guy role, wearing pants that fit. In fact,
he's counting on many viewers not making the Urkel association at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times parents will see me on the street, grab their
kids, pull them over and say: `Look, look! Urkel!''' he says. ``And
the kids just look at me, like, `Huh?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how happy that makes me _ at this point, it's
very rewarding not to be recognized.''
</P>

 &HT;    Actor Woody Harrelson sits in the VIP room on the mezzanine of
New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, chatting with rocker Sheryl Crow
and awaiting, with several thousand others, a preview playback of
Paul McCartney's new album, ``Run Devil Run.''
 &HT;    ``I guess I've been an enormous fan of his since I was 6,''
Harrelson says. ``It was the first music I listened to. I still
listen to his music every day, every single day.
 &HT;    ``And what I've heard about this album, it's more rockabilly and
rock 'n' roll. I like that.''
 &HT;    So does the rest of the crowd, a mix of contest winners,
celebrities and music-industry folks who sway and dance as ``Run
Devil Run's'' 15 songs _ 12 covers of old, mostly obscure rock 'n'
roll songs and three McCartney originals _ blast over the speaker
system.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, looking tanned and trim in a black suit, McCartney
sits in a quiet office nine stories above, talking about the album
which takes him back to where his legendary career began.
 &HT;    ``Run Devil Run,'' which arrives in stores Tuesday, was in the
works before McCartney's wife, Linda, died of breast cancer 17
months ago. He's released it, he says, as a tribute to her and as a
kind of comfort for himself in its return to his rock 'n' roll
roots.
 &HT;    ``It was next in line, the next project,'' explains the
57-year-old McCartney, who also has his third classical album,
``Working Classical,'' coming out on Oct. 19. ``I wanted to make a
rock 'n' roll record before the 20th century ended. It's also
something Linda was very keen on me doing, and she was egging me
on, really bugging me about it, because she was a big rock 'n' roll
fan.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, I regret she isn't here to hear it,'' he says.
``That's a major regret, but never mind _ we did it for her.''
 &HT;    With a smile, McCartney juts his thumb over his right shoulder.
 &HT;    ``She's still here,'' he says, ``bugging me _ `Come on, man, get
it right!'''
 &HT;    She would most likely be proud, as ``Run Devil Run'' presents
McCartney in his most rocking form in years, possibly since his
1988 collection of oldies for the former Soviet Union, ``CHOBA B
C.C.C.P.'' (``Back in the U.S.S.R.'').
 &HT;    His new songs _ the title track, ``Try Not to Cry'' and ``What
It Is'' _ display the same rollicking, resounding quality as the
covers, and the selections from the catalogs of Elvis Presley,
Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent, Fats Domino and others reveal a personal
and passionate connection to 1950s and early-1960s rock that goes
beyond simple sentimentality and nostalgia.
 &HT;    ``It's pure memories from childhood,'' McCartney says. ``There's
a fairground in Sexton Park where me and my friend Ian James walked
around in our flak jackets with the little flap on the top and
thought we were really cool, and we thought we'd attract women _
and we didn't.
 &HT;    ``To remember it was very exciting,'' he says, ``but also to be
a teen-ager at that time was a very exciting, interesting time. It
was America reawakening the world, because we were into sort of
other stuff. Suddenly Elvis and Little Richard came screaming out
across the Atlantic, and it was just so exciting for us all.''
 &HT;    If the song selection came from his youth, the actual making of
the album harkened back to McCartney's days with the Beatles. The
band which he and co-producer Chris Thomas assembled included his
old friend David Gilmour, the former guitarist from Pink Floyd, as
well as Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice, whom McCartney had never met
_ former Beatle Ringo Starr was his first choice, he says, but
Starr wasn't available.
 &HT;    They then set aside no more than a week in which to make ``Run
Devil Run.''
 &HT;    ``With the Beatles,'' McCartney recalls, ``what we used to do in
the very early days was we were expected to show up at the studio
at 10:00 on a Monday morning and be ready to record at 10:30.
Between 10:30 and 1:30 we were expected to have done two songs _
then we got 1:30 to 2:30 for lunch, then 2:30 to 5:30 for two more
songs. That was the way we did it.''
 &HT;    In that spirit, McCartney didn't even confer with the musicians
ahead of time.
 &HT;    ``So Monday morning it was, `Hey, how you doing? We're going to
make an album together,''' he recalls. ``So it was very
spontaneous, but that was the way I wanted to do it. It was
actually cool working that way _ I got some professional nostalgia
for it.''
 &HT;    The sessions netted 19 songs, 15 of which appear on the album.
The others will be used as B-sides, starting with his version of
Charlie Gracie's ``Fabulous,'' a Top 20 hit in 1957 which was the
first track the ad-hoc band recorded.
 &HT;    ``I met Eric Clapton in a restaurant in L.A. the other night,''
McCartney says. ``He said, `Man, I heard you found some stuff I
don't even know.'
 &HT;    ``These were just pure memories,'' he adds, ``all stuff that
really affected me as a kid.''
 &HT;    His current projects have also brought McCartney back into the
public eye after more than a year devoted primarily to private
mourning. He's held listening parties for ``Run Devil Run'' in Los
Angeles, New York and London, and he recently performed at the
annual awards ceremony for People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, a cause long dear to Linda McCartney.
 &HT;    But the singer, who hasn't toured since 1993, says he has no
current plans to tour to promote ``Run Devil Run,'' though he
admits that he had ``a real great time'' performing live at the
PETA gig and that tour plans may eventually come together.
 &HT;    ``I think we're going to want to do it,'' McCartney says.
``Normally it's the promoters or your record company wants you to
do it, and there's something that forces you to do a tour. I
thought, `Wouldn't it be really cool if it's the band that's really
itching to get on tour?'
 &HT;    ``It may happen _ not at the moment, but it may well be soon.''
 &HT;    It will be difficult to tour without Linda, he adds. During
their 29-year marriage, they were apart only during the time he
spent in a Japanese jail after a January 1980 arrest for marijuana
possession.
 &HT;    His grieving, McCartney says, is not over, but ``Run Devil Run''
provides an appropriate point of re-entry.
 &HT;    ``It feels good, and it feels like Linda would be very behind
it,'' he says. ``One of the pieces of advice people will give you
if you have a major grief is get busy, keep busy, keep your mind
off it. And I didn't want to do that. I made a point of, for a
year, not doing that.
 &HT;    ``I said `No, I'm going to experience the feelings for a year,
try and find where that all takes me,'' he says. ``So now, after
all that time, I'm feeling more comfortable with just easing back
into things.''

WHAT, ME DARK? TIM BURTON TAKES A RIDE THROUGH `SLEEPY HOLLOW'

 (Includes a color slide of Tim Burton directing Johnny Depp in a
scene from ``Sleepy Hollow.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Tim Burton does not live in a black house, with black furniture,
black carpeting and black roses in every room.
 &HT;    There are no coffins in his basement, tombstones in his backyard
or, for that matter, skeletons in his closet.
 &HT;    ``People who know me know I'm not like that,'' Burton says,
flashing a grin. ``I don't even consider my films dark.''
 &HT;    Well, that may be a bit hard to believe. After all, while the
39-year-old director did start off with the sun-dappled ``Pee-wee's
Big Adventure'' (1985), he's since made his name with such sinister
fare as ``Beetlejuice'' (1988), ``Batman'' (1989), ``Edward
Scissorhands'' (1990), ``Batman Returns'' (1992), ``Tim Burton's
The Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993, which he produced), ``Ed
Wood'' (1996) and ``Mars Attacks'' (1998).
 &HT;    Burton lives up to his reputation by sporting an all-black
ensemble and black shades during a conversation at New York's
Regency Hotel. He's a speed-talker, prone to changing subjects in
midsentence.
 &HT;    ``I've seen dark films,'' he insists. ``I guess it stems from
the puritanical roots of this country, in a way. In Mexico, they
celebrate the Day of the Dead. There's humor involved with it. It's
not treated with such ... `Eeeew.'''
 &HT;    Throughout his career, Burton has proved adept at fusing
``Eeeew'' with humor. And his latest film, ``Sleepy Hollow,'' based
on Washington Irving's ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and set to
open nationwide on Nov. 19 ... well, let's just say that it won't
help him convince people that he's not a guy who makes dark films.
 &HT;    Set in 1799, the movie stars frequent Burton collaborator Johnny
Depp as Ichabod Crane, an offbeat, queasy constable assigned to
solve a slew of beheadings in Sleepy Hollow, a community as
littered with secrets as it is with corpses. Crane's investigation
brings him into contact with Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci),
daughter of Sleepy Hollow's most affluent couple (Michael Gambon
and Miranda Richardson), and with the notorious Headless Horseman
himself.
 &HT;    ``When I read the script I really liked it, and thought I could
actually do a movie like the ones I loved as a kid,'' Burton says,
``like the Hammer films of the 1950s and 1960s.
 &HT;    ``I knew the `Sleepy Hollow' story from school and the Disney
cartoon,'' he recalls. ``Actually, the cartoon had a fair amount of
inspiration on me because of the chase scene _ I remember, as a
kid, being really affected by that scene.
 &HT;    ``It set the tone I like, which is funny, scary and
action-oriented all at once.''
 &HT;    In his effort to make the best Hammer film Hammer never
produced, Burton erected the Sleepy Hollow village on sound stages
and on location in London. He also tapped the talents of genre
veterans such as Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths and Michael
Gough.
 &HT;    ``We were so lucky to get Christopher Lee,'' Burton says, giddy
as a vampire at a blood bank. ``When he was sitting there, it was
like looking at Dracula. He's hypnotic.
 &HT;    ``The scene in the movie with Johnny, Michael Gough, Michael
Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Jeffrey Jones and Ian McDiarmid was done
on our first day,'' he recalls. ``I was looking forward to that
day, and I couldn't wait to see all these people in one room at the
same time.
 &HT;    ``I was so scared,'' Burton admits, ``but it was amazing. I was
just looking at all of these guys who've done so many things. I was
like, `There's the Singing Detective,' or `There's Michael Gough,
who was in ``Konga,'' which is one of my favorites,' or `There's
Richard Griffiths and Jeffrey Jones.'
 &HT;    ``It was great, fantastic. I loved it.''
 &HT;    As for Depp, Burton knew from square one that his former Edward
Scissorhands and Ed Wood would make an ideal Ichabod Crane.
 &HT;    ``He does something different each time, and that's fun,''
Burton says. ``I like chameleons _ I like people who are different
from one film to the next.
 &HT;    ``Johnny's never really done action before, and we were going
for action with a bit of elegance,'' the director adds. ``I know
he's a good actor and I knew from `Scissorhands' that he's a good
physical actor, but I was surprised by how well he did the
action.''
 &HT;    Burton's earlier films often hinted at acts of terrible violence
or cruelty, but depicted them discreetly. Heads really do roll,
however, in the R-rated ``Sleepy Hollow'' _ and the director makes
no apologies.
 &HT;    ``It's part of the storytelling,'' he says. ``What I tried to do
was keep it in the fantasy realm, especially given the climate in
the country.''
 &HT;    The recent uproar over violence in movies is misdirected, Burton
believes.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of talk about violence, obviously,'' he says.
``But I feel that it's the wrong kind of talk. It's easy targets,
and the real root of it is not addressed at all.''
 &HT;    There was plenty of violence in the old Hammer films, he adds,
but he doesn't think it hurt him growing up.
 &HT;    ``If I didn't have the opportunity to see these kinds of movies
when I was a child, I don't know what I'd be like,'' the director
says. ``It was a catharsis for me.
 &HT;    ``Kids need parameters,'' he adds, ``but I think they're pretty
good at finding their own level of what they can and can't take. I
consider `Sleepy Hollow' a fairy tale, and most fairy tales deal
with even more horrific imagery.''
 &HT;    Passionate as he now is about ``Sleepy Hollow,'' Burton didn't
originally plan to make the film. He received the script only after
the long-gestating ``Superman Lives,'' which would have cast
Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel, hit a wall of Kryptonite.
 &HT;    ``I worked for a year on `Superman,''' Burton says, clearly
still seething more than a year after Warner Bros. pulled the plug
on the project. ``It was a year of my life. We were making the
movie.
 &HT;    ``It was probably one of the most damaging things for my psyche
that I've ever had happen,'' he says. ``I like to be positive, but
I actually feel that I wasted a year of my life. That's a terrible
feeling, and you never want to feel that in anything you do.''
 &HT;    Burton considers himself a Hollywood outsider, though he grew up
in Los Angeles and lives there _ and in New York _ with his
longtime girlfriend, actress Lisa Marie.
 &HT;    ``L.A. is a nice place to visit, but you wouldn't want to live
there,'' Burton says, smiling.
 &HT;    ``Listen, I like weather. I like walking. And those are two
things you can't do in L.A.,'' he says. ``They don't have them _
there's not much weather and you can't walk. If you walk in L.A.,
the cops will stop you and ask what you're doing.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Burton is a rare example of a vanishing breed: a
director who, working within the Hollywood system, is still able to
make highly individualistic films.
 &HT;    ``I've been lucky enough to do what I've wanted to do, even
early on, even within the system,'' Burton admits. ``That's very
lucky, and my luck has held out.
 &HT;    ``I like doing my films,'' the director adds. ``I can't imagine
doing a Western. It would probably be the worst thing.
 &HT;    ``People say, `When are you going to make a real movie?'''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``I treat my films as real,'' Burton says. ``I'm sorry, but
they're real movies to me.''

 (Includes a color slide of Jewel with Tobey Maguire in a scene from
``Ride With the Devil.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The name is Jewel _ Jewel Kilcher, technically, but she prefers
to be singular _ and it's hard to discourage her.
 &HT;    Always has been, since her earliest days on stage.
 &HT;    ``When I first started singing, there was one night in a rundown
bar. I was crying because all these drunks were screaming things at
me,'' the 25-year-old singer recalls during an interview at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. ``But my father said, `Stop thinking
about yourself. A lot of people have it worse than you _ sing for
them.'
 &HT;    ``That was the first moment when I realized that I was put here
on this earth to please an audience.''
 &HT;    That never-quit attitude came in handy when she finally found
the role she wanted to play in her screen debut _ a young frontier
woman who, in Ang Lee's Civil War drama ``Ride With the Devil,'' is
wooed by two young men whose lives are changed forever by a year of
combat.
 &HT;    Before she could even try to convince audiences that she had the
acting chops for the role in the movie, which will open Dec. 10,
Jewel had to persuade an even-more-skeptical audience of one,
director Lee.
 &HT;    ``I told her that I would work with her for six months and then
we would see if she could earn the part,'' Lee recalls in a
separate interview. ``Honestly, we didn't think a big music star
like Jewel would stick with the program where she would learn
acting with no promise of a role.''
 &HT;    But the singer surprised him, persevering and ultimately winning
the role.
 &HT;    ``I've had many movie offers in the past,'' Jewel says. ``But I
chose the Ang Lee movie because it's not so much about war _ to me,
the film's message is that extreme circumstances force you to get
to know yourself.
 &HT;    ``In peaceful times a person can go, `What the hell am I going
to do with myself?''' she says. ``You socialize. You flirt. You get
married _ your entire life is on this course. And I think this
movie shows what happens when something big knocks a human being
off their course.
 &HT;    ``Some of the strongest people I know have had to go to depths
within themselves to fight for their lives,'' she adds. ``They're
currently fighting a war called poverty.
 &HT;    ``But the best part of fighting a war is that you emerge even
stronger,'' she says. ``My friends who survived the most bleak
circumstances have more peace of mind than people who were handed
everything on a platter.''
 &HT;    Even a topless scene didn't dissuade her.
 &HT;    ``There's a scene where I breastfeed someone,'' Jewel says. ``I
felt comfortable doing this on screen, because I knew Ang didn't
put breast-feeding in the movie because he wanted a glimpse of my
boob. He just wanted to add softness and warmth to his movie.
 &HT;    ``For another director, hell no, I wouldn't have done it,'' she
adds. ``For Ang, nothing was impossible for me to muster up.''
 &HT;    ``Nothing is impossible'' is the novice actress's motto,
actually. Jewel Kilcher grew up in rural Homer, Alaska, living with
her bohemian parents and two brothers on 800 acres of land. There
was no television nor running water, and the bathroom was an
outhouse in the field.
 &HT;    ``People ask, `Did you know you were this poor as a child?'''
Jewel says. ``Of course I did _ I grew up in the '80s. All I wanted
in my life back then was a pair of new acid-washed jeans, and I
felt denied because we couldn't afford them.
 &HT;    ``On the other hand,'' she says, ``I also felt very proud of my
heritage as a kid. I felt lucky that I came from a family who could
make things _ we were a really talented family, so for Christmas we
would get beautiful baskets and hand-knit sweaters. These were
gifts that had some meaning behind them.''
 &HT;    Her parents moonlighted as a singing/songwriting duo, and in
their spare time taught their daughter to yodel.
 &HT;    ``It was my show-biz break,'' she says, laughing. ``I was so
good at yodeling that my parents made me part of the show.''
 &HT;    But the show ended a few years later when her parents divorced.
During her father's visits, Jewel would sing with him in different
bars. Her mother devoted her time to home-schooling her daughter
and focusing on music, art and poetry.
 &HT;    Eventually, Jewel earned a voice scholarship to Michigan's famed
Interlochen Arts Academy, where she studied opera, sculpture, dance
and drama.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, her mother moved to San Diego, where times got even
tougher. After Jewel graduated from high school she returned home,
where she and her mother waitressed, punched cash registers and
struggled to make ends meet.
 &HT;    ``When you're poor in the city, that's a different ball of
wax,'' Jewel says. ``It was just about getting by from meal to
meal. And it was about witnessing heartbreak _ I would see people
collapsing in the streets from drug overdoses.''
 &HT;    The worst moment came when she was felled by a kidney infection.
 &HT;    ``I could barely walk,'' she says quietly, ``but I had no
insurance, so hospital after hospital refused to treat me. It was a
brutal wake-up call about life.''
 &HT;    Finally, Jewel decided that she wanted to become a singer and
songwriter.
 &HT;    ``My mother said we needed to give this dream 100 percent
effort,'' she recalls. ``To do that, we couldn't worry about paying
the rent. So we moved into the family van. We would only eat
carrots and peanut butter. At night, I would sing in the local
coffee shops.''
 &HT;    A regular gig at the Innerchange Coffeehouse in Pacific Beach
got her career moving. In 1994 she was signed by Atlantic Records
and sent out on a nationwide coffeehouse tour. The next year, her
debut album, ``Piece of You,'' was released.
 &HT;    It took 14 months, but ``Piece of You'' finally made its way
into the Billboard Top 200. The singles ``Who Will Save Your Soul''
and ``You Were Meant for Me'' eventually climbed the charts, with
the first song peaking at No. 11 and the second hitting No. 2.
 &HT;    The album went triple platinum, and Jewel became a star and an
inspiration to millions.
 &HT;    ``I hate, hate, hate the word idol,'' Jewel says intensely. ``I
would rather be an inspiration.''
 &HT;    Her fans helped make Jewel's second album, ``Spirit'' (1998),
into another hit _ and likewise ``A Night Without Armor: Poems''
(Harper-Collins, 1998), her book of poetry. But she admits to
feeling uncomfortable with their level of devotion.
 &HT;    ``Finally,'' she says, ``I wrote to my fan group on the Internet
and said, `I don't want to cripple people. If I'm here to make you
people worship someone, I will quit right now _ I can't be
responsible for that thinking. I'd much rather you people use the
inspiration I give you to do something with your own lives.''
 &HT;    And Jewel got her wish.
 &HT;    ``For my last birthday,'' she recalls, ``the fans wanted to send
me a present. I'm like, `Hi, I'm rich. Don't need presents. Give
them to people who need them.'
 &HT;    ``Now they send me a book of everyone who does community service
in their areas,'' Jewel says. ``I get thousands of hours of
community service done in my name. That's so cool.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaleel White doesn't like to talk about the character he played
for nearly 10 years on network television.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he'd rather not think at all about that little,
polka-loving dweeb, Urkel. The character's name alone _ goofy and
guttural, an instant buzzword for all things nerdy _ makes him
wince visibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him die,'' the 22-year-old White says, relaxing on the
patio of Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel. ``I've got a mental
tombstone for that character. I've got lots of flowers around it,
but that boy is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be that easy to erase the memory of the character,
who surely ranks as one of television's most vivid sitcom
creations.
</P>
<P>
   White had made appearances on ``The Jeffersons'' and the pilot
of ``Saved by the Bell'' before auditioning at age 12 for a guest
spot on the ABC series ``Family Matters,'' appearing before
producers in tight suspenders, trousers cut off at mid-shin and an
enormous pair of plastic eyeglasses that framed his darting, googly
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   He moved around the sound stage in jerks and jolts, and spoke in
a voice so high-pitched and nasal that it hovered several registers
above that of anyone else who dared inhabit the same scene.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Urkel was born.
</P>
<P>
   That guest spot grew into a starring role, and led the
Friday-night sitcom to an astonishing nine seasons on ABC and CBS,
ranking alongside ``Seinfeld'' for longevity. At the peak of the
show's popularity, the schoolyard set's version of Cosmo Kramer had
a breakfast cereal, an ABC special and legions of fans.
</P>
<P>
   When the end finally came in 1997, long after White had grown
out of the twiggy, 5-foot frame in which he began, ``Family
Matters'' vanished with hardly a peep, its final episodes broadcast
in the Nielsen dead zone of July.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later White has returned to prime-time television in a
most unlikely package. Few recognized him in the opening scene of
his new UPN sitcom, the cannily titled ``Grown-Ups,'' which
premiered in August and is now running Mondays at 9.
</P>
<P>
   Urkel's getup is gone. So is his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Instead we met a bulked-up fellow in a tank top and Air Jordans
who shoots hoops and makes quirky asides to a pudgy sidekick. As J.
Calvin Frazier, a frustrated junior manager at a corrugated-box
company, White is playing the sort of young man who, faced with the
uber-nerd Urkel, would be likely to administer a quick and expert
wedgie.
</P>
<P>
   But even with his gym-enhanced physique, White knows he will
have to work hard to make audiences forget the role that made him
famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you break your Vinnie Barbarino/Mork mode, that's what
you are,'' he says, citing the television roles that sparked the
careers of John Travolta and Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the studio machine had a lot invested
in Urkel,'' he says. ``They sold that character for a decade. You
think you can go out and break that in a year? No way.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio executives at UPN don't mind a bit if the scent of Urkel
clings to the buffed-up White. According to Tom Nunan, the
network's president of entertainment, while the association may not
do much for the struggling network's ``cool factor,'' White has
nothing to be embarrassed about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching him play that part over the years was like watching
Jerry Lewis or Groucho Marx or, dare I say, Charlie Chaplin at
times,'' Nunan says. ``It was perfectly realized. Urkel was a very
successfully rendered character, and a lot of people have a lot of
affection for him.''
</P>
<P>
   White is not one of those people. Shortly after ``Family
Matters'' was canceled, he told a reporter, ``If you ever see me do
that character again, take me out and put a bullet in my head and
put me out of my misery.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor attributes that bitterness to his feeling, long before
the show ended, that he had wholly outgrown his inner Urkel.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in his senior year at the University of California at Los
Angeles, White is a film student and avid jock, closely following
pro and college basketball and hanging out with Anfernee Hardaway,
the star guard for the Phoenix Suns. His speech is fast and
colorful _ ``Some mango would be the bomb,'' he tells a waitress _
and his abilities as a performer, he says, extend far beyond
geekdom.
</P>
<P>
   And while he enjoyed the perks of starring in a long-running
network show, White says he was more than happy to leave behind the
life of a child star.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get credit for what you do _ you get chalked up to
being cute or cuddly,'' he says. ``And you're never treated like
your adult counterparts. They come along and get production deals
and do other shows. With a child, it's like, `Send him a bike.'''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any surprise that the man behind Urkel just wants a little
respect?
</P>
<P>
   To make sure he gets it, White told UPN that he would appear in
``Grown-Ups'' only if he could also produce, working alongside
series creator Matthew Miller.
</P>
<P>
   At first the former child star was not exactly welcomed by
Miller, a 27-year-old screenwriter who had sold ``Grown-Ups'' as an
hour-long dramedy, a sort of ``Ally McBeal'' for guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a phone call telling me that `Grown-Ups' was getting
picked up, but as a half-hour, multi-camera show starring Urkel,''
Miller says in a separate interview. ``I immediately hung up the
phone. That was my big artistic stance _ it lasted about 15
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   His doubts eased, Miller says, when White came in for a reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's totally charming,'' the writer says. ``His timing makes
it so easy to write for him. You just give him the suggestion of a
joke, and he nails it.''
</P>
<P>
   White hopes that audiences will feel the same way once they see
him performing a regular-guy role, wearing pants that fit. In fact,
he's counting on many viewers not making the Urkel association at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times parents will see me on the street, grab their
kids, pull them over and say: `Look, look! Urkel!''' he says. ``And
the kids just look at me, like, `Huh?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how happy that makes me _ at this point, it's
very rewarding not to be recognized.''
</P>

RUSSELL CROWE: THE ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actor Russell Crowe builds his characters from the outside in.
</P>
<P>
   For Bud White, the thuggish police detective he played so
memorably in ``L.A. Confidential,'' Crowe began with buzz-cut '50s
hair and a too-tight jacket that seemed to be bursting with Bud's
barely contained rage.
</P>
<P>
   For his role in ``The Insider'' as real-life tobacco industry
whistle blower Jeffrey Wigand, the 32-year-old actor had to put
himself in the body of a man 20 years his senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a long period of preproduction when we did
costume, makeup and hair tests,'' the New Zealand-born,
Australian-reared Crowe said in a recent telephone interview from
Los Angeles. ``(Director) Michael (Mann) told me, `You don't have
to physically look like Wigand.' But in my mind _ maybe because I'm
stupid and literal _ I had to look like him. I couldn't do it
otherwise. It would be like playing Abraham Lincoln with a
mustache.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we bleached my hair seven times, we cut big swatches out of
my temples to give me a receding hairline, took out 70 percent of
my hair's volume. And in the end I wore a wig anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile I led a sedentary lifestyle, ate and drank whatever
I felt like so that I'd put on weight. Michael didn't think it was
important for me to do that, but I disagreed. I had to understand
how Jeffrey Wigand felt physically before I could deal with what
was going on inside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I don't spend the whole time walking around in
character. That's pretentious nonsense. But I do adjust my life to
match that character, because something ridiculously insignificant
might help me find my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it worked. In a separate phone interview, the
real-life Wigand has nothing but praise for Crowe's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to Russell,'' Wigand said. ``He's got it down. He
even looks like me.'' (See related story on this page.)
</P>
<P>
   What makes Crowe's performance even more remarkable is that he
didn't meet the man he was portraying until just before the cameras
began rolling. Because of his confidentiality agreement with his
former employer, Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco company, Wigand could
participate in the film in only the most tangential manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally met Jeffrey, I felt pretty good,'' Crowe said
in his thick Australian accent (think ``Crocodile Dundee''). ``I
knew then that I had a good grasp on the character. Said to myself,
`Well, all right then, I've pegged it.' But I did learn something
important from the meeting. It made me realize there was a massive
emotional impact on this guy, that what we were doing in the film
was a real series of events and a real person. What I came away
with was the idea that this was a man under siege.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, during a long period of harassment _ legal and
otherwise _ from his former employer, Wigand saw his marriage and
career crumble. For his willingness to speak out on what he saw as
the tobacco industry's pattern of lies and deceptions, Wigand lost
almost everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing somebody who's still alive and kicking is a tightrope
job,'' Crowe admitted. ``And it's complicated by the fact that
Jeffrey is by no means a simple person.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's flawed, as we all are. He's a human being. Ultimately I
think the social impact of his actions was a byproduct of a man
trying to protect his family. Jeffrey didn't set out to be a hero,
and he doesn't consider himself a hero now. There were true and
real reasons in his mind for doing what he did, and most of them
had to do with how one man protects himself and his family against
a powerful corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   An actor since the tender age of 6, Crowe dismisses the idea
that Wigand turned whistle blower out of revenge or anger at having
been fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anger,'' the actor said, ``it's impotent anger.
Mate, if your family was receiving death threats, how would you
react? I think Jeffrey's a hero because he didn't pick up a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Crowe continues his assault on Hollywood. His next
role will be as an international hostage negotiator in director
Taylor Hackford's ``Proof of Life.'' It will mark the first time in
an American film that Crowe will employ his Australian accent _
ironically, many moviegoers in this country assume that he's one of
us.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Crowe takes great pleasure in being a human chameleon
whose looks and manner of speaking vary from film to film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, mate, that's when my job is the best, isn't it? I've had
conversations in bars with people, and they're telling me about
movies I've been in and they just have no idea that I'm the bloke
they're talking about. But that's when it's good. Immersing
yourself in another personality _ that's the important, satisfying
part of the job. After all, being a film actor isn't about being an
insipid, good-looking bloke. If you've ever seen `Raging Bull,' you
know what I'm aiming for.''
</P>
<P>
   So Crowe is a big admirer of Robert De Niro. Has he ever met his
idol?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't just want to meet De Niro socially,'' Crowe said
with a low chuckle. ``I want to get in the ring with him!''

A WHISTLE-BLOWER'S STORY: THE MAN: JEFFREY WIGAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wigand told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   He testified in court _ and for Mike Wallace in front of the
``60 Minutes'' cameras _ about his work as chief of research and
development for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco. He stated flatly that
the heads of tobacco companies knew beyond a doubt that nicotine
was addictive, even though they denied it before Congress. He said
tobacco in cigarettes was routinely treated with chemicals to
enhance the effect of the nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wigand told the truth. As a result, his marriage
crumbled, he became unemployable in his field of expertise. He was
sued, his character smeared. A tobacco industry lawyer publicly
labeled Wigand ``a habitual liar, a bad, bad guy.'' Wigand's family
received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Then CBS buckled under pressure from the Brown &AMP; Williamson,
which threatened to sue the network if Wigand's accusations _ still
protected by a confidentiality agreement _ were aired. Envisioning
potentially devastating litigation that could scotch Westinghouse's
pending acquisition bid for the network, CBS shelved the interview
(it was broadcast months later).
</P>
<P>
   Now Wigand's story is being told in the film ``The Insider,''
directed by Michael Mann. It opened last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, my daughters used to come home from school and ask
me why I worked for a tobacco company,'' Wigand said in a recent
interview from Charleston, S.C., where he is director of Smoke-Free
Kids, a not-for-profit tobacco education group. ``They had me
there. What could I tell them? That I had a mortgage, a family, a
child with a birth defect'' _ his oldest daughter had spinal bifida
_ `` ... that I couldn't just run away from a well-paying job?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Wigand was forced out, apparently because he openly
questioned some company policies regarding research and
development. He was given a severance package contingent on his
silence about tobacco industry matters. He had every intention of
following the agreement, he said, until he found himself the focus
of an intimidation campaign waged by his former employer.
</P>
<P>
   There were threatening e-mail messages, and Wigand found a
bullet in his mailbox. The film depicts Wigand being stalked by a
stranger late at night on a driving range, an incident that he
admits didn't actually occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``But was I followed? Yeah. By an ex-FBI agent hired by Brown &AMP;
Williamson. One of my attorney's offices was searched. Another had
her car broken into and her files on me were taken. While I was
giving a deposition in court, my briefcase was taken by a Brown &AMP;
Williamson lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that moment in the movie at the driving range capture all
that? Yes, it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigand thinks ``The Insider'' is a masterpiece, but admits it's
hard for him to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it recently with one of my daughters, and I was proud of
the film. But it's still very emotionally intense. It brings back
lots of highs and lows. The scenes with my family are pretty hard
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Michael Mann has done a brilliant job of compressing three
years into 21/2 hours of film and remaining faithful to the actual
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigand says there's no one answer to why he decided to blow the
whistle on big tobacco, although he says revenge had little to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was based on a lot of things. I didn't like how my
agreement with Brown &AMP; Williamson was turning into a form of
extortion. I didn't like being threatened. I didn't like my kids
questioning my moral compass. And it just really made me mad to see
the tobacco CEOs lying in front of Congress and co-opting the local
FBI agents and police.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a Kentucky court's restraining order, Wigand cannot
publicly discuss details of his work at Brown &AMP; Williamson. All in
all, he's not impressed with justice in his former home, which he
believes kowtows to the power of the tobacco lobby. Kentucky, after
all, is a big tobacco-growing state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly think the courts in Kentucky worked,'' he
said. ``I had two lawyers, they had 40. The tobacco companies had
the judges. They're used to getting their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a story about how big tobacco tries to
intimidate another industry _ the media. It's about getting the
truth out, the price you pay for that, the moral lessons we present
to our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Of CBS' handling of his revelatory interview, Wigand said:
``That wasn't a glorious moment in journalism. They gave their word
to me that I'd be protected, and then someone leaked the contents
of the interview to the New York Daily News. That put me in a
position I wasn't ready for. I had no lawyer, I was living in
Louisville teaching high school, I was completely vulnerable when
the legal attack came.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' depicts ``60 Minutes' '' Mike Wallace (played by
Christopher Plummer) as reluctantly agreeing with the network's
decision not to run the Wigand interview. Wallace has protested
that the film distorts his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I like Mike Wallace a lot,'' Wigand said. ``I think he's
had a noble, stellar career. But he's got this blemish on it. Just
like I do. We all make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when his life was at a low point, Wigand took
a job as a chemistry teacher at Dupont Manual High School in
Louisville. He turned out to be a natural and before leaving
education a year ago was named Kentucky Teacher of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco industry harassment followed him even to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school had to post a guard at my classroom door. Brown &AMP;
Williamson subpoenaed my employment records from the principal. But
the kids kept me sane. When I had bad days, the students would take
me out for a spaghetti dinner. They were the glue that kept me
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 56, Wigand is a single guy rebuilding his life. For
all he knows, he'll always be a single guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy walking around with me,'' he said. ``People
actually attack me. I've been verbally assaulted by individuals,
and I have no idea who they are.''

`NEW' ALBUMS BY CSNY AND OTHER AGNIG ROCKERS JUST AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY FINN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of the brand-new Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young CD is
``Looking Forward,'' and on the wispy title track, Neil Young
sings: ``Writing a song, won't take very long//Trying not to use
the word `old' ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Age and maturity, though, are the implicit themes on this
record. Nearly 30 years after they released ``Deja Vu,'' one of the
more acclaimed epilogues to the 1960s, CSN&AMP;Y are together again,
older and richer and willing to share the bounty of their years.
(Young turned 54 on Friday; the others are between 55 and 60.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking Forward'' is one of several major-label records
released recently by seminal//mythical rock stars trying to deal
with their maturity without speaking the word ``old,'' and like
most of those records, ``Forward'' suffers from that inherent
denial. As a writer for salon.com wrote in a bit about the CSN&AMP;Y
album and world tour: ``I almost cut my hair ... then I remembered
I didn't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes and actors have peaks, primes and declines _ natural,
physical paths to retirement. But rock stars? They just keep
writing songs, keep hoping that the generation that grew up with
them will grow old with them, will negotiate their shifts in focus:
from sex, drugs and rebellion to regrets, love, melancholy,
divorce, rebirth, death ...
</P>
<P>
   It was in the winter of my 50th year when it hit me//I was
really alone//And there wasn't a hell of a lot of time left ...
</P>
<P>
   That's Iggy Pop, 52, reciting the poem that opens ``Avenue B,''
his fierce, lugubrious new disc inspired by a recent divorce.
</P>
<P>
   His intent, Pop told Mojo magazine, was to write specific lyrics
and good melodies that would ``provoke emotion without depending on
noise ... It's not a divorce record. It's a post-marriage record
about a guy figuring out what he's going to do with what is left of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   That precise objective served him well. ``Avenue B'' gets
uncomfortably raw and emotional, proving that, like visual artists
and photographers, rock musicians can remain fresh and provocative
as they get older _ or because they've grown older.
</P>
<P>
   On ``She Calls Me Daddy,'' Pop sits alone in the dead quiet of
his apartment, reliving his mistreatment of a woman he slowly froze
out of his life: ``I was always ashamed she read Cosmopolitan//I
should have been proud of her ...//She just wanted to believe
someone would love her ...''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Avenue B'' is the only recent exception to the rule. Like
Dylan's highly acclaimed, Grammy-winning ``Time Out of Mind,''
Pop's new record succeeds because Iggy is up front about his
position in life _ he's growing older and more alone _ something
Sting, 49, isn't ready to admit, at least not on record.
</P>
<P>
   On the title track to ``Brand New Day,'' a feeble flight of
adult-contemporary tunes, Sting, who was once inspired to sing
about the tyranny of South American dictators, sings wistfully
about the future: ``Turn the clock to zero, honey//I'll sell the
stock, we'll spend all the money//We're starting a brand new day.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to a rock superstar to figure his portfolio will buy
him time, or at least a fresh start. The rest of the album is a
sunshower of platitudes and cliches dressed in slick, predictable
pop arrangements _ the sounds of a guy who will charter a flight to
the Bahamas when winter sets into his 50th year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately CSN&AMP;Y's ``Looking Forward'' suffers some of the
same afflictions: vacuous anthems about hope and paradise; lyrics
weakened by cliches, sentimentality or rank pretension.
</P>
<P>
   Young's contributions are the most respectable, though they
sound a lot like the better country-folk moments on ``Harvest
Moon.'' Beyond those tunes, there are plenty of sweet, perfect
vocal harmonies but little flavor or heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seen Enough'' is Stills' cranky sermon against all that
cyber-stuff the yung'uns are into these days; ``Heartland,'' one of
Nash's two contributions, is an outsider's mushy conception of life
here in slow, lazy middle America, where people ``try to share
their hopes and dreams'' and where ``on any given day you can find
your way back home ...'' (But you might want to avoid the Grandview
Triangle.)
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, who has suffered two lives' worth of personal turmoil
and torment, nonetheless commits the most severe acts of banality.
On ``Stand and Be Counted,'' he sings: I want to stand alone in
front of the world and that oncoming tank//Like that Chinese boy
that we all have to thank ...
</P>
<P>
   Later, on ``Dream for Him,'' he festers over what to tell his
young son and other innocents about all the bad things out there in
the world today _ like two-faced politicians. Whatever happened to
teaching your children well?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between Sting's tedium, CSN&AMP;Y's pretensions and Iggy
Pop's naked testimony lies the intent of David Bowie, 52, on his
album ``Hours ... ,'' released in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a complicated album, by any means,'' he blithely told
Rolling Stone recently. ``It's just a guy reflecting on his
youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, the record showcases Bowie's voice and his strengths
as a songwriter, at times invoking the flavors of records like
``Heroes'' and ``Low.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyrically, though, ``Hours ...'' could use a little more
complication. Unfortunately, things don't get more introspective
than wan lines like, ``All of my life I've tried so hard//Doing my
best with what I had//Nothing much happened all the same ...''
Ultimately, Bowie sounds detached from the project, like he's
making a cameo appearance on his own album.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone deserves extra slack, though, it's Bowie, who has
proved that he's capable of remaking himself or of concocting his
own provocative take on whatever fresh fad catches his fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Other rockers emeritus look back for an excuse to cut an album,
such as Bryan Ferry, 54, one of Bowie's contemporaries. ``As Time
Goes By,'' Ferry's first record in five years or so, is his version
of several 1930s standards.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Run Devil Run,'' the new record of old-time rock songs by
Paul McCartney, 57, Ferry's ``Time'' is essentially a vanity
project: a few of his favorite songs. Lacking a similar emotional
attachment, though, the listener ultimately feels uninterested,
like he's watching slides of someone else's vacation to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Devil,'' McCartney called in famous friends like David
Gilmour of Pink Floyd and Ian Paice of Deep Purple to help him
re-create the music that made him want to be a rock star way back
in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the record is crisp and brilliant. Emotionally,
though, it is 15 shades of neutral. `` `Run Devil Run' is the sound
of the past and the promise of the future,'' the liner notes say.
``It is Paul McCartney looking forward by stepping back.'' And
slogans like that are the rationale of an artist out of fresh
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Ferry, bless his heart, curtly explains his dearth of fresh
material: He refuses to put out inferior music, a trait some have
confused for writer's block or an addiction to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   In Mojo recently, he told a writer: ``I felt pressure to get
something out because I hadn't had anything for a long time ...
From `Boys and Girls' (1985) onwards, it's been dead slow, I must
confess, but I think your life gets more complicated as you get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, on the other hand, contrives a supernal explanation for
what inspired ``Looking Forward.'' In promotional literature
provided by Reprise Records, he starts with a truth: ``One of the
things they used to say about us was that we were speaking for our
generation ...''
</P>
<P>
   But he parlays that into a wobbly assumption: ``And I think in a
sense that's still true. You hear a lot of music these days about
rage and frustration and anger but not much about hope and love and
forward motion. That's what we continue to stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly explains the end of ``Looking Forward,'' a song
written by Denny Sarokin called ``Sanibel.'' The song includes
images of a girl in white, a ship, an island and ``starlit nights
in paradise,'' which is where the singer ultimately wants to spend
his life.
</P>
<P>
   CSN&AMP;Y will tour the world (they come to Kemper Arena on Jan. 26)
and they will no doubt rock the place by reliving so many of their
fine songs.
</P>
<P>
   But records like ``Looking Forward'' and ``Brand New Day'' make
it clear that, like jocks and actors, rock stars have their primes,
too: Eventually the spotlight leaves them and their muse loses
context and fresh ideas, no matter what they continue to stand for.

REAGAN BIO IS LATEST IN NONFICTION EMBELLISMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 GEORGE GURLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many readers have turned to biographies in recent years,
complaining of a dearth of good stories and characters in
contemporary novels. Perhaps as a way of addressing this
deficiency, it has become commonplace for novelists to introduce
historical characters in their fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this has been effective _ J. Edgar Hoover, Frank
Sinatra and others in Don Delillo's Underworld, Bobby Kennedy, JFK
and Howard Hughes in James Ellroy's American Tabloid. Often,
however, the device comes across as a lazy man's way to create
verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   But fiction is one thing, nonfiction another. What are we to
make of a biography _ a literary form that's supposed to be factual
_ in which fictional characters appear?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Edmund Morris did in his biography of Ronald Reagan,
Dutch, which has been the recipient of a nearly unanimous barrage
of rotten tomatoes. Morris, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his
biography of Teddy Roosevelt, says that he turned to fiction
because _ after 14 years of work and extraordinary access to Reagan
and his personal papers _ he was still unable to explain the man.
Morris thought fiction would help him get inside Reagan so he could
reveal what makes him tick.
</P>
<P>
   Most complaints about Dutch are that _ fact or fiction _ it's
not a very good book. Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times called
it a ``bizarre, irresponsible and monstrously self-absorbed book''
with ``a looney hodgepodge of fact and fiction.'' Peggy Noonan in
The Wall Street Journal said it was a ``high dive, belly flop into
the pools of Narcissus.'' Joan Didion in The New York Review of
Books chastised Morris for factual errors as well as sophomoric
fictional devices. The consensus seems to be that the fictional
characters and scenes in Dutch are not just extraneous to Reagan
but don't work on any level.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, see Dutch not just as a hatchet job but as a
violation of the nonfiction writer's obligation to tell the truth.
Kakutani, for one, deplored the tendency of today's writers to
project themselves and their prejudices into matters of fact.
</P>
<P>
   But is this altogether bad? If biography were just about facts,
people wouldn't keep writing new books about the same person.
There's always room for reinterpretation. There never will be an
end to biographies of Napoleon or Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Judith Thurman _ author of Secrets of the Flesh: A
Life of Colette _ boldly affirmed the point in a recent article.
``There is no objective biography,'' she said. ``You are judging in
what you choose to describe and the way you choose to structure the
story. The question is how conscious you are of your own
subjectivity and how much latitude you can allow your subject.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of autobiography, another supposedly nonfiction form
where the author ought to know the facts, the last thing we expect
is truth. On the contrary, we expect the author to put himself in
the best light and his enemies in the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Embellish or not?
</P>
<P>
   In his recently released memoir, River-Horse: The Log Book of a
Boat Across America, William Least Heat-Moon created Pilotis, a
``sequential composite'' character based on the seven people who
accompanied him on parts of the trip. The first thing you notice
about Pilotis it that ``he'' is remarkably eloquent and witty. Did
Heat-Moon prune, embellish and burnish his utterances?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, the people I asked to go with me are
well-read and articulate,'' he said in a recent conversation.
``When they said something memorable I told them to write it down.
I burnished to the extent that I cut out the stupid things they
said and things that would take away from the unity of the
character, Pilotis.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat-Moon said he wouldn't feel comfortable with making
something up and putting it in someone else's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the reader to have confidence that I'm reporting
accurately,'' he said. ``But I'd argue for the right of anyone else
to embellish. My rule of thumb is that as long as the reader knows
what you're doing, it's fair. When you come to the end of Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil, John Berendt tells you that he's
made some of this up. Why didn't he tell you at the beginning?''
</P>
<P>
   Heat-Moon said he was afraid of getting some flak for Pilotis
due to the controversy surrounding Dutch. But he informs the reader
of Pilotis' composite nature at the outset. Furthermore, was he
under the same obligation as Morris? The seven characters who make
up Pilotis aren't players on the public stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the democracy didn't depend on anything any of
us said,'' Heat-Moon said. Nor does he present himself as a
journalist, reporting on someone else's trip. In the case of
River-Horse, which would you rather have, aesthetic truth or
journalistic truth?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Unger, associate professor and head of the Urban
Journalism program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City,
agreed with Heat-Moon's rule for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it `truth in advertising,' '' Unger said. ``If you make
it clear what you're doing, it's usually OK. In the case of Dutch,
Morris did some things to conceal what he was going, such as making
up footnotes ... You have to ask what's your contract with the
readers. If it's simply to entertain them, you can do pretty much
what you want to. If your contract is to tell them what really
happened, you have to do just that. It may be open to the writer's
interpretations, but it's not open to manufacturing quotes,
characters and events ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Trust or not?
</P>
<P>
   ``A truth is not hard to kill,'' wrote Mark Twain. ``A lie told
well is immortal.'' William Faulkner made up many unforgettable
characters in his novels _ fair enough. But he also told tall tales
about his exploits in the Royal Air Force. Whom can we trust? Can
we put our hands on anything that's absolutely true? Alas, for the
real skinny, we may have to wait until Judgment Day. Even in the
sciences, which aspire to the highest standards of truth, there
have been cases of falsification.
</P>
<P>
   Freud has been accused of having suppressed facts that would
have contradicted his theories. Margaret Mead distorted the truth
in her famous anthropological study Coming of Age in Samoa,
according to anthropologist Derrick Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Mead argued that young girls go through puberty without sexual
hang-ups in Samoa because of its liberated culture. Freeman has
charged that Mead heard what she wanted to hear and that her thesis
is the virtual opposite of the truth. Samoans are in fact very
uptight and repressive about sexual matters, according to him.
</P>
<P>
   The most venerated historical traditions, in fact, may partake
of fiction. A big issue in anthropology today is the ``invention of
traditions,'' said Allan Hansen, University of Kansas professor of
anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that a lot of oral histories of cultures are
highly embellished and made up to suit political agendas of the
present rather than representing accurate accounts of the past,''
he said. ``It's not so much that the people are lying. It's that
tradition is, in fact, an embellishment of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen himself has written about the ``invention of tradition''
in the case of the Maori culture in New Zealand. And he's run into
some opposition from New Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like to be told that their `traditions' aren't
historically accurate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Hansen grew up in Ronald Reagan's hometown,
Dixon, Ill. Before he was born his family actually lived in one of
the houses Reagan lived in.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Dixon, Hansen noticed a mural in his motel
of the young Reagan in a swimsuit along with a tribute to the
legend that he saved the lives of some 70 people when he was a
lifeguard. (The main fictional character in Dutch is one of those
Reagan ``saved.'')
</P>
<P>
   `` `Gee,' I thought,'' said Hansen. `` `That's a lot of people.
There must have been a terrible rash of drownings in Dixon after he
retired.' '' Hansen thought it over and concluded that Reagan
probably counted it as a rescue every time he blew his whistle.
``Talk about invented tradition,'' he said.

   HMO: Beginning next year, Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs will
face the biggest cut in benefits in this decade. Premiums also are
going up in most HMOs. The is happening nationwide because of
federal cutbacks in Medicare payments, healthcare inflation and the
rising cost of prescription drugs. About 50,000 area seniors are
enrolled in Medicare HMOs. This doesn't affect the 200,000 local
folks who just get regular Medicare, which provides fewer benefits.

&HT;    HOLIDAY GIFT IDEAS THAT ARE BOOD FOR BODY AND SOUL

   Natural medicines and herbal remedies are hot. But it can be
tough for a novice to figure out what's good for what. And it's
possible to go broke buying the plethora of books touting the
healing powers of everything from cayenne pepper for arthritis to
St. John's wort for depression.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``The PDR Family Guide to Natural Medicines and Healing
Therapies,'' (Crown Publishing; $23), which promises to ``sort the
help from the hype'' in the growing field of natural medicines.
</P>
<P>
   This objective guide, published by the editors of the respected
Physician's Desk Reference, offers a serious evaluation of hundreds
of herbal remedies and therapies, including evaluations of which
work and which remain unproven. The guide, available at most
bookstores and Internet booksellers, also offers advice on how to
choose a qualified herbal practitioner and ways to protect against
quacks and frauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a door, it's a beginning,'' says a sign at the
front of Teddy G's Boxing Gym in Reseda, where $79 a month gets you
24 workouts with former amateur boxer Teddy Groat. It's the perfect
gift for a stressed-out loved one _ or anyone looking for a good,
aggressive aerobic workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, they're not in good shape when they come in, but you
can bet they are in great shape when they leave,'' Groat said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his clients are men and women looking to get in shape,
not take on Mike Tyson. But, Groat said, after a few months most
people should know how to survive in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call (818) 345-8200. The Hollywood Gym on
La Brea Los Angeles also offers boxing lessons at $89 a month. Call
(323) 845-1420.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, long hair and baseball didn't mix. Small holes
were cut in the back of batting helmets to accommodate ponytails,
but extricating the hair from the hole can be a hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Fret no more, long-locked athletes. The Female Athlete offers a
``ponytail-friendly batting helmet,'' which features a raised
ponytail port on the back. No threading required. Just slip it on
and step up to the plate. The helmet costs $27. Call (888) 316-5882
to order.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Frisbees? These flying disks never really went out of
fashion, but they often are overlooked as an inexpensive gift or
stocking stuffer. It's tough to beat the simple fun of tossing a
saucer around a park or beach _ and it's not bad exercise either.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional Frisbee is tough to find on cluttered toy store
shelves, but there are some intriguing alternatives. Our favorite
comes from Van Nuys-based WPF Inc. _ ``The Brain Freaky Flying
Disc.'' The squishy foam saucer looks _ as advertised _ like a
brain. You can also get a shark, mouth, Earth, eyeball or pizza.
Freaky Flying Discs cost $7.99 at Toys `R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   Too many hoop dreams are dashed by strict neighborhood codes
that prohibit basketball backboards in driveways. But there are
many fine portable goal systems that can be wheeled out for fun and
stored away when the game's over. The goals, available at many
local mass-merchandise and sporting-goods retailers, range in price
from $100 to $250. The more expensive goals offer more options:
adjustable height _ from 7 to 10 feet _ and backboards that can
withstand slam dunks.
</P>
<P>
   For those who like to hike, authors Jerry Schad and John
McKinney have written two books that are literal hiking catalogs
for Angelenos. McKinney's ``Day Hiker's Guide to Southern
California'' (Olympus Press; $14.95) and Schad's ``101 Hikes in
Southern California: Exploring Mountains, Seashore and Desert''
(Wilderness Press; $15.95) rank everything from the difficulty of a
hike to the scenery. Both books are available in stores or on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fitness nuts who prefer function over fashion will love the
Timex 100-lap Ironman Triathlon watch. The watch features an
Indiglo night light that activates at the flick of a wrist, a dated
training log diary and enough memory to store 100 lap times. The
Ironman costs $59.95 and is available at most sporting-goods stores
or major retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say a glass of red wine a day can help the body fight
heart disease. It tastes great, too. Bryan Thomas, manager of
Woodland Hills Wine Co., recommends three red wines you can give as
a toast to a loved one's good health: A 1996 Spelletich Cellars
cabernet sauvignon, $29.99; a 1997 Stags Leap Wine Cellars cabernet
sauvignon, $29.99; or a 1996 Lewis Cellars merlot, $31.99. Cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Biking anytime can be hard on the posterior. And biking at night
in Los Angeles can be lethal. The Velo Flash Gelite Safety Flash
bike seat tackles both these problems with a squishy,
posterior-friendly gel filling and red LED lights on the back to
catch the attention of clueless motorists. The seat cost $19.99 at
Target. Batteries included.
</P>
<P>
   For those gift-givers looking for a ridiculously expensive gift,
the folks at Sunbeam have come up with the Body Comp Scale. The
scale uses a low-frequency current to determine weight, percentage
of body fat, lean muscle mass and body mass index. The information
is printed out on a color printer. With a price tag of $3,595, the
folks at Sunbeam aren't kidding when they say the scale is for
serious or affluent users only. Call (800) 815-6615 to order it.

<P>
   Digital video
</P>
<P>
   Digital video is one of this season's hottest trends. Shoot your
stuff on a digital video camera, edit it on a computer, then master
it to DVD or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Apple are making the most DV friendly computers, with
the high-speed IEEE 1394 connectors for transferring video and
great editing software.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's newest iMacs include two with DVD drives, and their G4s
are the most powerful desktop computers ever. Both lines combine
the delightful Mac operating system, tremendous power and easy
iMovie editing software, for as little as $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   For Windows-compatible machines, Sony's Digital Studio line is
the way to go. The top-end model comes loaded, with a DVD-ROM
drive, a rewritable CD-ROM drive and tons of software, including a
limited-edition version of Adobe's Premiere video-editing software
for less than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Computer software
</P>
<P>
   For children's titles, try Midnight Play, based on a notable
Czech illustrator's work; and Trans-Con!, an engrossing simulation
of building the transcontinental railroad last century.
</P>
<P>
   For golfers, Links LS 2000 is the choice, while the abiding
beauty of the newly gussied-up Myst Masterpiece Edition remains a
good choice for many.
</P>
<P>
   For offbeat reference, try National Geographic Maps, all 8
CD-ROMS of it, and Mad, with more than 500 Mad magazines and
special issues and lots of wacky extras.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzle fans will adore Pandora's Box, the latest creation of the
Russian wizard who made Tetris. And strategy gamers will love
Panzer General Assault 3D and Command &AMP; Conquer Tiberian Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who like a little gore will go for the beautifully wrought
Nocturne and, assuming it ships in a couple of weeks, Quake III
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Consoles
</P>
<P>
   For Sega Dreamcast, start with Sonic Adventure, Soul Calibur and
Ready2Rumble, the best of the launch titles. Then add NBA Showtime:
the NBA on NBC; Virtua Fighter 3tb; Sega Bass Fishing; and Air
Force Delta.
</P>
<P>
   For Sony PlayStation, great new titles include: the
free-wheeling Omega Boost; role-playing wonder Final Fantasy VIII;
music game Um Jammer Lammy; extreme sports Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
and Cool Boarders 4; and wrestling title WCW Mayhem. For real
mayhem, try Dino Crisis and Resident Evil 3 Nemesis. For great
driving fun, try Hot Wheels Turbo Racing and Crash Team Racing.
</P>
<P>
   For Nintendo N64, younger gamers will beg for Pokemon Snap! Also
try Mario Party and Super Smash Brothers for multiplayer fun. Older
players will enjoy Quake II and another PC import, the real-time
strategy game, Command &AMP; Conquer. &UR; !end! &LR;

<P>
   You don't have to remember what the dressing room of Hollywood's
now-defunct Club Lingerie looked like to be enthralled by author
Lewis Shiner's realistic account of the fictional rise and fall of
a Next Big Thing named Laurie Moss. With unusual insight, ``Say
Goodbye'' ($23.95) tells you what that dressing room looked like _
plus a lot more about the machinations of the music biz as it
devours promising new talent. We follow Moss from her Texas roots
to her first recording contract, from her struggling early days in
Los Angeles to her final tour _ and beyond. A rock fan won't find a
better read this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soul music didn't disappear with the popularity of hip-hop, it
just packed up and moved to Jackson, Miss., where the mighty Malaco
label is based. ``The Last Soul Company: Malaco _ A 30 Year
Retrospective'' ($70.97) is a delightful six-disc box featuring
various artists that proves the patient is still robust. Included
among these 112 examples of gritty Southern r&AMP;b magic are obvious
'70s gems like King Floyd's ``Groove Me,'' Jean Knight's ``Mr. Big
Stuff,'' Dorothy Moore's elegant ``Misty Blue'' and raw, earthy
sides from Little Milton, Bobby ``Blue'' Bland, Johnny Taylor and
the great Bobby Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, ``At the Close of a Century'' ($59.97, in stores
Nov. 23) is the first comprehensive retrospective of Stevie
Wonder's incredible career, and they really got it right. These 70
beautifully remastered selections span the '60s through the '90s on
four discs, collecting all of Wonder's 27 Top 10 hits, key album
tracks, soundtrack contributions and a first-time rarity: Wonder's
original 1967 version of ``Until You Come Back to Me (That's What
I'm Gonna Do),'' a Top 10 hit for Aretha Franklin in '74.
</P>
<P>
   Considered one of the greatest rock concert films ever, ``Stop
Making Sense'' was first shown in 1984. Using no voice-overs, no
cut-aways to the audience or backstage and no between-song patter,
director Jonathan Demme focused on the music of Talking Heads and
had 'em dancing in the aisles. The remixed and remastered DVD
version of ``Stop Making Sense'' ($29.95) includes three audio
mixes, several bonus tracks that didn't make it on the original
soundtrack, commentary by all four band members and Demme, original
promotional trailer, and more.

   As a rule, I never anticipate spending part of a weekend
suspended from a moving gasbag 800 feet above Times Square, so
imagine my surprise when I found myself doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In popular parlance, of course, moving gasbags suspended over
cities are known as blimps, and New York certainly has its share.
On any given weekend, the skies over the five boroughs are
crisscrossed by a veritable exhalation of airships, including the
Goodyear blimp, the Fuji blimp, the Sea World blimp and the MetLife
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in an era of Lockheed wide-bodies and Air France
Concordes, any aircraft that can fit comfortably behind Bullwinkle
in a Thanksgiving Day parade is not going to cut an especially
dramatic figure, and few people would choose the plump and poky
ship when other means of travel are available.
</P>
<P>
   But could the blimp be getting a bad rap? Is there more to these
stately sky whales than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   The history of lighter-than-air flying ships began in 1783 when
the Montgolfier brothers _ Manny, Moe, and Jacques _ launched the
first working hot-air balloon, in Annonay, France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was not actually much demand for hot-air
balloons, but the Montgolfier brothers had apparently shown up late
for Career Day, and after the Wright brothers and the Smith
brothers got dibs on airplanes and cough drops, they had to settle
for what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Montgolfiers' achievement was impressive: They
built a balloon of fabric backed by paper that was 75 feet tall and
49 feet wide and contained 77,000 cubic feet of hot air, which was
heated by burning straw and wool.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-air balloons definitely had drawbacks, not the least being
keeping the air hot. An alternative was to fill the bladder of the
craft not with air but with hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen is the lightest of all elements and thus the most
buoyant. The problem is that hydrogen is also one of the most
temperamental elements, given to exploding in the presence of a
flame, a spark, or even an ill-considered remark:
</P>
<P>
   Bystander: Hey, has that hydrogen put on a little weight or
something?
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen: BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the same year that the Montgolfiers flew their
balloon, French physicist J.A.C. Charles invented a
lighter-than-air craft of his own, featuring a rubber-coated silk
bladder capable of holding 22,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was Charles' design that hydrogen craft quickly
replaced hot-air models, and by the middle of the next century the
ships were in wide use, principally by the military.
</P>
<P>
   During both the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War,
balloons were put to work as aerial observation posts, helping both
to determine the course of military history and to fill the
newspapers of the era with countless memorable battlefield quotes
(``Yup, there's Prussians down there'').
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the balloons were given a simple, onomatopoeic name _
blimp _ thought to evoke the noise the giant gas bladder made when
thumped by a thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clever moniker, the ships had problems, and one
of the thorniest was their size. As lighter-than-air ships became
more and more popular, builders sought to lift bigger and bigger
loads of people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the load, however, the more hydrogen you needed to do
the lifting, and this required enormous bladders, which were
difficult to manufacture with the relatively low-quality fabrics
available in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a whole new type of airship _ the rigid airship,
made with a skeleton of lightweight ribbing covered by a fabric
balloon that would remain structurally sound no matter how big it
got.
</P>
<P>
   The first rigid ship was launched in 1900 by Count Ferdinand von
Zeppelin of Germany, who, as luck would have it, was already named
after an airship.
</P>
<P>
   When World War I rolled around, Germany built dozens of the
ships, equipped them with propellers, and flew them across the
English Channel, where they were used to bomb Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By law, of course, when German engineers invent so much as an
especially tasty strudel, they're required to at least try to bomb
Great Britain with it, and even today, whole British cities are
occasionally felled by aerial bombardments of Leica cameras and
Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked as though German zeppelins were going to
become the industry standard. In the '30s, however, all that
changed when Germany built the largest rigid airship ever
constructed, the 804-foot Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Launched just three years before the outbreak of World War II,
the ship was built in part to show the world the industrial prowess
of the German nation. Unfortunately, as the Hindenburg was
completing a trans-Atlantic crossing in 1937, it was apparently
struck by lightning, and before the ship even reached its mooring
mast in Lakehurst, N.J., it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, things went downhill for hydrogen airships,
with designers quickly switching to nonflammable helium. But the
damage to the lighter-than-air reputation was done.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characteristic that all the modern-day members of
America's blimp flock have in common is that they are blimps, as
opposed to zeppelins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigidity of rigid airships was always a disadvantage,''
says Jim Thiele, president of the American Blimp Corporation, an
airship manufacturer in Hillsboro, Ore. ``When you're working with
rigid structures, you have to be aware that if you bend them enough
they break. This means that you have to make them extremely strong.
With a soft structure, you can bend 'em and bend 'em and nothing
ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to build such flexible ships, contemporary
manufacturers like Thiele rely on materials not available to their
19th-century forebears. The main body of the blimps his company
makes is composed of two parts: an inner layer (the bladder) and an
outer layer, called an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder, which actually holds the helium, is made of
leak-resistant polyurethane that's welded together from strips. A
130-foot-long bladder capable of holding 68,000 cubic feet of
helium weighs only 250 pounds and leaks away little more than 1
percent of its helium per week.
</P>
<P>
   While resistant to leaks, though, the bladder is not resistant
to punctures, so it is protected by a comparatively heavy 450-pound
envelope made of a polyester ripstop fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although the envelope is the outer structure, it's actually a
few inches smaller in volume than the polyurethane balloon it
surrounds. This deliberately poor fit helps prevent ruptures by
guaranteeing that when the blimp is fully inflated, it is the
sturdier envelope rather than the thinner bladder that takes the
load.
</P>
<P>
   But simply stuffing a bladder from the Big &AMP; Tall Men's Shop
into an envelope from Misses &AMP; Juniors is not enough to keep a
helium-filled blimp flying. Helium is an inert element _ that is,
it does not react easily with other elements _ and it is this
nonreactiveness that allows it to be used so safely not just in
blimps but at carnivals and birthday parties and in incandescent
lamps.
</P>
<P>
   But just because helium doesn't explode does not mean it doesn't
expand; it can change dramatically in response to the temperature
and pressure of the surrounding air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took a blimp and filled it with helium and floated it
higher and higher,'' Thiele says, ``the pressure inside would
steadily climb as the atmospheric pressure dropped. Ultimately, the
blimp would burst.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this from happening, all of Thiele's blimps are also
equipped with an additional, igloo-shaped balloon within the
bladder, called a ballonet. Filled with ordinary air as opposed to
helium, the ballonet represents about 20 percent of the total gas
volume of the blimp when it leaves the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the airship climbs higher and the atmosphere grows thinner,
air is vented from the ballonet to keep the pressure within the
bladder from growing too great. When the blimp descends into
thicker atmosphere, air is pumped back into the ballonet to prevent
the pressure from dropping too low.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele filled me in on more critical blimp data, but no amount
of talking about blimps was going to take the place of riding in
one, so I contacted one of American Blimp's customers _ the MetLife
insurance company _ to request a couple of hours aloft. To my
alarm, MetLife graciously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The mooring site where I was to find the MetLife blimp was at
the Linden Airport in Linden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piloting a blimp is like piloting no other aircraft,'' said
Charlie Graham, the man who would be behind the blimp controls
during my two hours aloft. ``Most of us are licensed to fly planes
or helicopters as well, but you still need a separate FAA license
to command a lighter-than-air ship. At the moment, there are only
about 30 active blimp pilots in the entire world, which makes us
rarer than space shuttle pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the meadow where the MetLife blimp ought to
have been, there was no blimp, no hangar, not so much as a single
tarmac attendant waving those extraterrestrial flashlights with
cones on the ends. All I saw was a 30-foot pole rising from the
ground and half a dozen guys standing around in matching polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our ground crew,'' Charlie said, indicating the men.
``And this,'' he added, pointing to the pole, ``is our garage.
Overnight, we moor the nose of the blimp to this mast and just let
it float there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few expectant minutes spent scanning the sky, I saw
somebody point roughly northeast and spotted an unmistakable blue
dot approaching from over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind is a big variable in landing a blimp,'' Charlie told me.
``The ideal situation is to hit a head wind just as you're making
your final descent. This slows you down and lowers your altitude
and ground speed. It also helps to have a cloud cover since bright
sun heats the helium and increases its buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   After two or three approaches, exactly the right conditions
suddenly prevailed, and the pilot was able to bring his blimp low
enough for the ground crew to get hold of its cables and wrestle it
into place.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments after that for the other pilot to hop
out and Charlie and me to climb aboard and cast ourselves off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the ground in a lighter-than-air ship is a surprisingly
busy business. Outside the open window of the gondola, the twin
Limbach engines whined and churned. In front of me, the nose of the
blimp dipped, rose and swung lurchingly from side to side while the
ropes dangling from it swayed lazily back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, Charlie operated his throttles, rudder pedals and
ballonet cords in an absurd choreography that was equal parts Chuck
Yeager, Wilbur Wright and Willy Wonka.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the ride stabilized, and as we glided about 600
feet above the New Jersey coast, Charlie began our tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be approaching Manhattan from the southwest,'' he
shouted over the engines, ``so the first landmark you'll see will
be a pretty obvious one.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a lazy circle around the Statue of Liberty _ close
enough to elicit visible waves from the people around the pedestal,
far enough to get away safely if Liberty decided to drop the torch
and pick up a rolled-up newspaper _ before peeling off and heading
for Manhattan proper.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the part of the main island that
we were now approaching was the World Trade Center towers looming
just a few hundred feet ahead. Glancing at the altimeter, I saw
that we were about 800 feet high; the towers, I knew, rise above
1,300. Now, I don't pretend to be a Mr. Navigational Smarty-pants,
but you didn't have to be Ponce de Lesn either to know that left,
right, or up would have been good choices right about then.
Happily, Charlie chose left, and we skirted the northwest tower and
began to glide over the thicket of Manhattan itself.
</P>
<P>
   When at last we reached the airport, Charlie, impressively,
brought the blimp to a landing on just his first approach. More
impressively, he didn't point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Working his controls while the ground crew grappled with the
cables, he nodded a good-bye, and I jumped out. The blimp then flew
unceremoniously back into the blue, and Charlie drifted back off
for another couple hours of atmospheric ad work trooping the
MetLife colors.
</P>
<P>
   As trips aloft went, my two lighter-than-airborne hours had
lacked a lot _ no purpose, no destination, definitely no in-flight
snack service.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I live in New York another 50 years, it's almost
certainly the only time I'll travel so far uptown and know for
certain I'm going to make all the lights.

<P>
   As a rule, I never anticipate spending part of a weekend
suspended from a moving gasbag 800 feet above Times Square, so
imagine my surprise when I found myself doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In popular parlance, of course, moving gasbags suspended over
cities are known as blimps, and New York certainly has its share.
On any given weekend, the skies over the five boroughs are
crisscrossed by a veritable exhalation of airships, including the
Goodyear blimp, the Fuji blimp, the Sea World blimp and the MetLife
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in an era of Lockheed wide-bodies and Air France
Concordes, any aircraft that can fit comfortably behind Bullwinkle
in a Thanksgiving Day parade is not going to cut an especially
dramatic figure, and few people would choose the plump and poky
ship when other means of travel are available.
</P>
<P>
   But could the blimp be getting a bad rap? Is there more to these
stately sky whales than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   The history of lighter-than-air flying ships began in 1783 when
the Montgolfier brothers _ Manny, Moe, and Jacques _ launched the
first working hot-air balloon, in Annonay, France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was not actually much demand for hot-air
balloons, but the Montgolfier brothers had apparently shown up late
for Career Day, and after the Wright brothers and the Smith
brothers got dibs on airplanes and cough drops, they had to settle
for what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Montgolfiers' achievement was impressive: They
built a balloon of fabric backed by paper that was 75 feet tall and
49 feet wide and contained 77,000 cubic feet of hot air, which was
heated by burning straw and wool.

<P>
   As a rule, I never anticipate spending part of a weekend
suspended from a moving gasbag 800 feet above Times Square, so
imagine my surprise when I found myself doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   In popular parlance, of course, moving gasbags suspended over
cities are known as blimps, and New York certainly has its share.
On any given weekend, the skies over the five boroughs are
crisscrossed by a veritable exhalation of airships, including the
Goodyear blimp, the Fuji blimp, the Sea World blimp and the MetLife
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in an era of Lockheed wide-bodies and Air France
Concordes, any aircraft that can fit comfortably behind Bullwinkle
in a Thanksgiving Day parade is not going to cut an especially
dramatic figure, and few people would choose the plump and poky
ship when other means of travel are available.
</P>
<P>
   But could the blimp be getting a bad rap? Is there more to these
stately sky whales than meets the eye?
</P>
<P>
   The history of lighter-than-air flying ships began in 1783 when
the Montgolfier brothers _ Manny, Moe, and Jacques _ launched the
first working hot-air balloon, in Annonay, France.
</P>
<P>
   At the time there was not actually much demand for hot-air
balloons, but the Montgolfier brothers had apparently shown up late
for Career Day, and after the Wright brothers and the Smith
brothers got dibs on airplanes and cough drops, they had to settle
for what they could get.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the Montgolfiers' achievement was impressive: They
built a balloon of fabric backed by paper that was 75 feet tall and
49 feet wide and contained 77,000 cubic feet of hot air, which was
heated by burning straw and wool.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-air balloons definitely had drawbacks, not the least being
keeping the air hot. An alternative was to fill the bladder of the
craft not with air but with hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen is the lightest of all elements and thus the most
buoyant. The problem is that hydrogen is also one of the most
temperamental elements, given to exploding in the presence of a
flame, a spark, or even an ill-considered remark:
</P>
<P>
   Bystander: Hey, has that hydrogen put on a little weight or
something?
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen: BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the same year that the Montgolfiers flew their
balloon, French physicist J.A.C. Charles invented a
lighter-than-air craft of his own, featuring a rubber-coated silk
bladder capable of holding 22,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
   So successful was Charles' design that hydrogen craft quickly
replaced hot-air models, and by the middle of the next century the
ships were in wide use, principally by the military.
</P>
<P>
   During both the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War,
balloons were put to work as aerial observation posts, helping both
to determine the course of military history and to fill the
newspapers of the era with countless memorable battlefield quotes
(``Yup, there's Prussians down there'').
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the balloons were given a simple, onomatopoeic name _
blimp _ thought to evoke the noise the giant gas bladder made when
thumped by a thumb.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clever moniker, the ships had problems, and one
of the thorniest was their size. As lighter-than-air ships became
more and more popular, builders sought to lift bigger and bigger
loads of people and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the load, however, the more hydrogen you needed to do
the lifting, and this required enormous bladders, which were
difficult to manufacture with the relatively low-quality fabrics
available in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a whole new type of airship _ the rigid airship,
made with a skeleton of lightweight ribbing covered by a fabric
balloon that would remain structurally sound no matter how big it
got.
</P>
<P>
   The first rigid ship was launched in 1900 by Count Ferdinand von
Zeppelin of Germany, who, as luck would have it, was already named
after an airship.
</P>
<P>
   When World War I rolled around, Germany built dozens of the
ships, equipped them with propellers, and flew them across the
English Channel, where they were used to bomb Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By law, of course, when German engineers invent so much as an
especially tasty strudel, they're required to at least try to bomb
Great Britain with it, and even today, whole British cities are
occasionally felled by aerial bombardments of Leica cameras and
Mercedes sedans.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked as though German zeppelins were going to
become the industry standard. In the '30s, however, all that
changed when Germany built the largest rigid airship ever
constructed, the 804-foot Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Launched just three years before the outbreak of World War II,
the ship was built in part to show the world the industrial prowess
of the German nation. Unfortunately, as the Hindenburg was
completing a trans-Atlantic crossing in 1937, it was apparently
struck by lightning, and before the ship even reached its mooring
mast in Lakehurst, N.J., it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, things went downhill for hydrogen airships,
with designers quickly switching to nonflammable helium. But the
damage to the lighter-than-air reputation was done.
</P>
<P>
   The principal characteristic that all the modern-day members of
America's blimp flock have in common is that they are blimps, as
opposed to zeppelins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rigidity of rigid airships was always a disadvantage,''
says Jim Thiele, president of the American Blimp Corporation, an
airship manufacturer in Hillsboro, Ore. ``When you're working with
rigid structures, you have to be aware that if you bend them enough
they break. This means that you have to make them extremely strong.
With a soft structure, you can bend 'em and bend 'em and nothing
ever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to build such flexible ships, contemporary
manufacturers like Thiele rely on materials not available to their
19th-century forebears. The main body of the blimps his company
makes is composed of two parts: an inner layer (the bladder) and an
outer layer, called an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The bladder, which actually holds the helium, is made of
leak-resistant polyurethane that's welded together from strips. A
130-foot-long bladder capable of holding 68,000 cubic feet of
helium weighs only 250 pounds and leaks away little more than 1
percent of its helium per week.
</P>
<P>
   While resistant to leaks, though, the bladder is not resistant
to punctures, so it is protected by a comparatively heavy 450-pound
envelope made of a polyester ripstop fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Although the envelope is the outer structure, it's actually a
few inches smaller in volume than the polyurethane balloon it
surrounds. This deliberately poor fit helps prevent ruptures by
guaranteeing that when the blimp is fully inflated, it is the
sturdier envelope rather than the thinner bladder that takes the
load.
</P>
<P>
   But simply stuffing a bladder from the Big &AMP; Tall Men's Shop
into an envelope from Misses &AMP; Juniors is not enough to keep a
helium-filled blimp flying. Helium is an inert element _ that is,
it does not react easily with other elements _ and it is this
nonreactiveness that allows it to be used so safely not just in
blimps but at carnivals and birthday parties and in incandescent
lamps.
</P>
<P>
   But just because helium doesn't explode does not mean it doesn't
expand; it can change dramatically in response to the temperature
and pressure of the surrounding air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took a blimp and filled it with helium and floated it
higher and higher,'' Thiele says, ``the pressure inside would
steadily climb as the atmospheric pressure dropped. Ultimately, the
blimp would burst.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this from happening, all of Thiele's blimps are also
equipped with an additional, igloo-shaped balloon within the
bladder, called a ballonet. Filled with ordinary air as opposed to
helium, the ballonet represents about 20 percent of the total gas
volume of the blimp when it leaves the ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the airship climbs higher and the atmosphere grows thinner,
air is vented from the ballonet to keep the pressure within the
bladder from growing too great. When the blimp descends into
thicker atmosphere, air is pumped back into the ballonet to prevent
the pressure from dropping too low.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele filled me in on more critical blimp data, but no amount
of talking about blimps was going to take the place of riding in
one, so I contacted one of American Blimp's customers _ the MetLife
insurance company _ to request a couple of hours aloft. To my
alarm, MetLife graciously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The mooring site where I was to find the MetLife blimp was at
the Linden Airport in Linden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piloting a blimp is like piloting no other aircraft,'' said
Charlie Graham, the man who would be behind the blimp controls
during my two hours aloft. ``Most of us are licensed to fly planes
or helicopters as well, but you still need a separate FAA license
to command a lighter-than-air ship. At the moment, there are only
about 30 active blimp pilots in the entire world, which makes us
rarer than space shuttle pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the meadow where the MetLife blimp ought to
have been, there was no blimp, no hangar, not so much as a single
tarmac attendant waving those extraterrestrial flashlights with
cones on the ends. All I saw was a 30-foot pole rising from the
ground and half a dozen guys standing around in matching polo
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our ground crew,'' Charlie said, indicating the men.
``And this,'' he added, pointing to the pole, ``is our garage.
Overnight, we moor the nose of the blimp to this mast and just let
it float there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few expectant minutes spent scanning the sky, I saw
somebody point roughly northeast and spotted an unmistakable blue
dot approaching from over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind is a big variable in landing a blimp,'' Charlie told me.
``The ideal situation is to hit a head wind just as you're making
your final descent. This slows you down and lowers your altitude
and ground speed. It also helps to have a cloud cover since bright
sun heats the helium and increases its buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   After two or three approaches, exactly the right conditions
suddenly prevailed, and the pilot was able to bring his blimp low
enough for the ground crew to get hold of its cables and wrestle it
into place.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments after that for the other pilot to hop
out and Charlie and me to climb aboard and cast ourselves off.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the ground in a lighter-than-air ship is a surprisingly
busy business. Outside the open window of the gondola, the twin
Limbach engines whined and churned. In front of me, the nose of the
blimp dipped, rose and swung lurchingly from side to side while the
ropes dangling from it swayed lazily back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   To my left, Charlie operated his throttles, rudder pedals and
ballonet cords in an absurd choreography that was equal parts Chuck
Yeager, Wilbur Wright and Willy Wonka.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, the ride stabilized, and as we glided about 600
feet above the New Jersey coast, Charlie began our tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be approaching Manhattan from the southwest,'' he
shouted over the engines, ``so the first landmark you'll see will
be a pretty obvious one.''
</P>
<P>
   We made a lazy circle around the Statue of Liberty _ close
enough to elicit visible waves from the people around the pedestal,
far enough to get away safely if Liberty decided to drop the torch
and pick up a rolled-up newspaper _ before peeling off and heading
for Manhattan proper.
</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the part of the main island that
we were now approaching was the World Trade Center towers looming
just a few hundred feet ahead. Glancing at the altimeter, I saw
that we were about 800 feet high; the towers, I knew, rise above
1,300. Now, I don't pretend to be a Mr. Navigational Smarty-pants,
but you didn't have to be Ponce de Lesn either to know that left,
right, or up would have been good choices right about then.
Happily, Charlie chose left, and we skirted the northwest tower and
began to glide over the thicket of Manhattan itself.
</P>
<P>
   When at last we reached the airport, Charlie, impressively,
brought the blimp to a landing on just his first approach. More
impressively, he didn't point it out.
</P>
<P>
   Working his controls while the ground crew grappled with the
cables, he nodded a good-bye, and I jumped out. The blimp then flew
unceremoniously back into the blue, and Charlie drifted back off
for another couple hours of atmospheric ad work trooping the
MetLife colors.
</P>
<P>
   As trips aloft went, my two lighter-than-airborne hours had
lacked a lot _ no purpose, no destination, definitely no in-flight
snack service.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I live in New York another 50 years, it's almost
certainly the only time I'll travel so far uptown and know for
certain I'm going to make all the lights.

U.S., CHINA REACH ACCORD ON BILATERAL TRADE, MEMBERSHIP IN WORLD

<P>
   BEIJING _ American and Chinese trade negotiators announced one
of the largest trade deals in American history Monday, a
comprehensive agreement to open China's economy to foreign
competitors in return for Beijing's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and
China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, signed the agreement here
at 3:50 p.m. Monday, shook hands and raised a champagne toast to
the conclusion of 13 years of on-and-off negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say that this is a profound and historic moment in
U.S.-China relations,'' said a clearly exultant Ms. Barshefsky,
adding that the agreement would not only aid the economies of both
countries but also serve as an anchor in their tumultuous political
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The last six days of arduous negotiations were conducted in a
``win-win spirit,'' Shi said at the ceremony, ``and finally we
reached an agreement that serves the interests of both China and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing, Ms. Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, the White
House chief of economic policy, were driven to the secluded
leadership compound for a brief meeting and photo opportunity with
the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The accord goes to the heart of China's transition to an open,
market economy and for the first time it puts Beijing under the
jurisdiction of the rules of international trade set by the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a badly needed centerpiece for President
Clinton's fraying policy of engagement with China _ holding the
promise of tangible benefits for many American companies and
consumers, as well as a positive influence on China's future
development.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Turkey on Mondday, Clinton said: ``I think this is a
good agreement for China, for America and for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken often of ``integrating China into the world
economy'' and gradually getting the country to embrace ``the rule
of law,'' starting with commercial law. But without a WTO
agreement, his aides said, he would have little progress to point
to.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement may also help to repair the damage done from
charges of Chinese spying in the United States, the accidental
American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May and
China's continuing suspicion that the United States is attempting
to ``contain'' its military and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful completion of WTO will go a long way to smooth out
some of the extreme oscillation that we have seen in Sino-American
relations in recent years,'' said Joseph Fewsmith, a China expert
at Boston University. ``I think it gives us a chance to build some
substance into a relationship that has been badly damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO sets rules for global commerce, adjudicates disputes and
is generally intended to press for freer markets. Monday's
agreement is a huge step toward membership for China. It still must
complete side agreements with the European Union, Canada and some
developing countries before its application can be taken up by the
body's 134 member states, but Shi on Monday expressed the hope that
China could be in by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably already too late, experts said, for China to be
fully admitted before Nov. 30, when a new round of global trade
negotiations will begin in Seattle, but these talks are expected to
last for years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From the beginning, the American goal was to press China not
only for large reductions in tariffs on imported farm products and
industrial goods such as automobiles, but to persuade China to
commit itself to allowing foreign companies to take majority
investments in many industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement involves a general reduction in China's import
tariffs from the current average of 22.1 percent down to 17
percent, with tariffs on major American farm products cut sharply
to 15 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs on automobile imports, which now range up to 100 percent
to protect China's inefficient producers, will be reduced over a
six-year period to 25 percent, with the fastest reduction in the
initial years. Equally important, foreign auto companies and banks
will for the first time be able to offer consumer loans for car
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Chinese consumers may soon be purchasing General Motors
cars, for example, with the ``GMAC'' loans so familiar to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most contentious issues in recent days, Ms.
Barshefsky said, involved the American demands for ways to respond
to ``import surges'' and for use of a methodology to identify
illegal ``dumping.'' China wanted such measures to phase out
quickly, but in the end agreed to surge protections for a 12-year
period, and the anti-dumping regime for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the textile area, politically sensitive in the United States,
it was the Americans who called for restrictions on free trade. The
Chinese wanted to scale back the American demand to continue its
existing textile import quotas for another 10 years. In the end,
the United States agreed to end quotas after five years, but with
special ``anti-surge'' safeguards for another four years after
that.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-dumping and textile provisions are charged issues for
Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to keep the support of organized
labor in his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment in China's telecommunications sector had
become a sore point inside China, where some saw it as an issue of
national security. The Americans fought for ownership rights but
finally agreed that foreign firms could take 50 percent ownership
of companies in this booming sector, beginning two years after
China enters the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Important provisions will open Chinese retail banking to foreign
firms over several years, and also improve market access for
insurance companies, and legal and accounting firms. In the infant
financial securities field here, foreign companies are held to
minority stakes in such activities as underwriting stock issues.
</P>
<P>
   For China _ which is still unraveling the legacy of Mao Zedong's
cloistered, command economy _ entry into the world trade body
symbolizes acceptance into the ``club'' of the world's major
economic players.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists here compare WTO entry to Deng Xiaoping's
landmark opening of the economy to market forces and foreign
influence in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening of China to the outside world began with Mao
Zedong's meeting with Richard Nixon in 1972,'' said Hu Angang, a
leading economist here at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ``The
second major stage was marked by Deng Xiaoping's visit to the
United States in 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joining WTO will represent a whole new stage in China's
opening to the world,'' Hu said. ``It will signify a shift from
partial to comprehensive opening and reform,'' he said, ``and a
shift from an opening based on domestic rules to an opening based
on internationally defined rules.''

TALENTED POINT GUARDS SHOW THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Khalid El-Amin knew things had changed when he took a brief
vacation with his family to the Bahamas this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Even there, hundreds of miles and several months removed from
the highlight of his career, El-Amin, the point guard for the
national champion Connecticut Huskies, was the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers would come and talk about the game, about the
season,'' El-Amin said, adding that feedback was preferable to the
derision and taunts he received during last season. ``That was OK.
That kind of attention is fine. Now I want to show people that we
can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn may be able to do that, or at least make the Final Four,
because El-Amin is back and now is The Man in Jim Calhoun's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, point guards are taking lead roles in many of the top
programs around the country, and history shows if you want to
compete for a championship, you'd better have a quality point
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the NCAA champs of the recent past. El-Amin last season,
Kentucky with Wayne Turner in 1998, Mike Bibby for Arizona in 1997,
Tyus Edney at UCLA in 1995. When Duke won back-to-back titles in
1991 and '92, Bobby Hurley was the catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there have been other stars, ranging from Duke's Christian
Laettner and Grant Hill to UConn's Richard Hamilton last season,
but the linchpin for success most often has been found in the
backcourt, primarily at the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the guards are the guys, more often than
not, to help you win games when it comes down to the end,'' said
Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien, who saw his team go from last in the
Big Ten to the Final Four after point guard Scoonie Penn became
eligible following his tranfer from Boston College. ``You may have
a play called and are as organized as you can be, but most of the
time it comes down to who is going to be able to create and have
hands on the ball at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches such as O'Brien like to control the flow and tempo of
the game. ``Coaches try to have their fingerprints on everything,''
he said with a laugh. ``But a lot of situations at the end, you
can't dictate what's going to happen. Having a real good point
guard gives you a sense of confidence that at the very least the
right decision will be made, the right thing attempted.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien does not dismiss the advantage of having good big men.
``But you can have the best guy in the world, at the end of the
game, it's really hard to get the ball to him, unless you have
someone who can do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten, like most conferences, is loaded with quality point
guards. And those teams that don't have one, are making getting one
a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to talent, experience is a key ingredient at the
point. When you can find a senior point guard such as Penn or
Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, you have an even bigger edge.
</P>
<P>
   Because William Avery opted for the NBA after two seasons at
Duke, coach Mike Krzyzewski is at the disadvantage of working in a
freshman, highly touted Jason Williams. Williams already has
acknowledged the difference between high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find out all those moves you used in high school don't
work here,'' said Williams. ``They don't work at all. It made me
realize I have to stop doing all those fancy moves and keep it
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say a freshman can't do the job. Arizona has Jason
Gardner moving into the role as a team leader, and Florida is
turning to highly recruited Brett Nelson, who has been called the
best player out of West Virginia since Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young guys are much more aware now than they were five
years ago of how critical strength is in their adjustment to
college,'' said Arizona coach Lute Olson, who hopes to have Gardner
make a smooth transition from last year's star, Jason Terry.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner hopes to make the adjustment quickly. ``We have a great
team,'' he said, ``and I think the guys will help me out in
practice and let me know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you need more than a point guard to win consistently.
``It's just like baseball,'' said O'Brien. ``If you're strong up
the middle, you've got a chance to be pretty good. Point guard,
center. You fill those two spots and you can plug in the gaps and
get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the mid-major level, point guards are essential. And
often they are asked to do more than at bigger programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any good team is going to have good guard play in general,''
said Boston University coach Dennis Wolff, who must try to rebound
from last season's 9-18 disappointment with a mixture of veterans
and newcomers led by sophomore point guard Dereck Franklin. ``At
our level you end up compromising a little; you need the point
guard to score a little more than a point guard might have to at
other places. But the main thing is that the point guard must have
a connection with the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   At UConn, El-Amin has that connection with Calhoun, who has
given his point guard more leeway than almost any player he has
coached. ``Khalid is just a special, special person,'' said
Calhoun. ``He just has an ability to make everyone around him a
better player.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere you look you see point guards who are stars or are
ready to reach that level. From Cleaves, who is the consensus pick
as player of the year, to Penn, El-Amin, and Pepe Sanchez, a
four-year player for John Chaney at Temple. Then there's the group
of freshmen who are stepping from high school into key roles in
college.
</P>
<P>
   The point seems to be well taken. If you want to win, you need
someone to lead the way, and who better to lead than the point
guard?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of always been that way,'' said O'Brien. ``But it
just seems to me that's there more quality at that position than
ever before.''

MARKSMEN ARE A SHOT IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, there was a perennial Eastern Basketball
League All-Star guard named Swish McKinney, so nicknamed because,
well, c'mon, duh. The man made exceedingly sweet music when he shot
the basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, many people maintain that a more likely nickname for
the average basketball player coming out of college would be Clang.
</P>
<P>
   The overall team shooting percentage for the 310 Division 1 NCAA
basketball teams last year was .436, which happens to be the lowest
figure in 34 years. Figures can be exquisite prevaricators, as we
all know, but the unmistakable fact is that shooting figures have
been drifting downward for the past 15 years, or ever since teams
established the high mark of .481 in 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches are alarmed; some are not. Some coaches are
resigned to a changing cultural world; some are determined to turn
things around. But the one thing everyone can agree on is that the
pure act of shooting the basketball ought to be the lifeblood of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shooting is at its all-time worst,'' maintains George
Washington coach Tom Penders, who claims that his early '70s Tufts
squads, featuring the likes of Leroy Charles, Eddie Tapscott, and
Dennis Mink, could shoot better than anything that's out there
today. ``Skills and fundamentals are eroding, even as we speak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not getting any better,'' agrees Duke coach Mike
Krzyzewski. ``A lot of it has to do with the fact that to be a good
pure shooter requires time, and most kids today don't put the
overall time in at the gym that people did in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that shooting has gone down,'' says Princeton's Bill
Carmody. ``Our own shooting has gone downhill; I can tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always struggling to find kids who can shoot,'' says
Boston University's Dennis Wolff. ``And good shooting can cure a
lot of ills.''
</P>
<P>
   But optimists do exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting a little better,'' says Syracuse coach Jim
Boeheim, himself a solid shooter three decades ago. ``I see kids
working on shooting a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech and Roy Williams of Kansas go much
further. ``It may not be what it was overall in years past,'' says
Cremins, ``but there are still great shooters out there. We just
signed a kid named Marvin Lewis, who is one of the best shooters in
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got shooters on my team who are as good as anything I saw
10 years ago here or 20 years ago when I was at North Carolina,''
declares Williams. ``We've got as good a shooting team as we've
ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people who agree that shooting isn't what it used to be are
reluctant to excoriate the shooters themselves. They prefer to laud
the modern defenses and, therefore, the defenders. ``I think a lot
of it has to do with the defense,'' says Massachusetts coach
Bruiser Flint. ``Everybody plays up so tight to defend the 3. We
want opponents to be shooting with a hand in their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is much better today,'' echoes Boston College's Al
Skinner. ``You can no longer be a stand-still jump shooter and
expect to get shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is finally getting its due,'' submits Arkansas coach
Nolan Richardson. ``Before, you'd go to clinics and all you'd hear
was offense. Now people want to hear about how to stop someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're guarded now,'' says Utah's Rick Majerus. ``Everyone
videotapes everything. Preparation is better. If you're just a
shooter, you're up against people who are much more athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   But are they stopping guys who can really shoot it in the first
place? Are there any more kids around like Richardson's own Al
Dillard, who once drilled a surreal 12 3-pointers in a single game?
``Now he could flat-out stick it,'' rhapsodizes Richardson.
``That's all he did. He'd be out there two hours after practice,
still shooting. He was dedicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach K had a serious shooter of his own these last four years
in Trajan Langdon. ``It didn't happen by accident,'' Krzyzewski
explains. ``He really worked at it. On days off, he'd be in the
gym, shooting. Shooting is an art, and good art takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most kids today are not interested in devoting that sort of time
to becoming a great shooter. Shooting has lost its cache. Rather
than turning themselves on by the sight and sound of sinking shot
after shot after shot from the outside (or dreaming of acquiring a
nickname like ``Swish''), they want to take it to the hoop and
throw one down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid might make three or four in a row during practice,''
points out Flint. ``He goes back to the locker room. And what does
he hear? `Hey man, so-and-so dunked on you!' ''
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation has grown up equating dunking and
dipsy-doodle moves with basketball. Shooting is an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dunks,'' sighs Flint, ``get you on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   A young player today considers it a rite of passage to have Dick
Vitale screaming ``OHHH, WHAM-BAM, WHAT A SLAM! OH, BAYBEEE!'' in
his honor. Sticking the J won't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time you ever see a jump shot on the highlights,''
says Coach K, ``is if it's a last-second game-winning shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just the dunks. ``What do kids replicate?''
inquires Utah's Rick Majerus. ``It's (Latrell) Sprewell's spin
move, or (Allen) Iverson's crossover move, never a jump shot. I
haven't had a kid come to me in years with what I'd call shot
preparation or shot readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders can relate to that. ``You talk to a kid about something
like stepping into a shot or holding your release, and they look at
you as if they're speaking a foreign language,'' he says.
``Shooting is nowhere near what it once was. Why is a guy like Dale
Ellis still around after all these years? Because he can shoot. You
look at Classic TV and see something like the 1972 All-Star Game.
You go, `Jack Marin just missed a jump shot?' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are 3-point shooters, yes. What's missing from the game
today are the scoring machines from the 10- to 20-foot range. You
hear it over and over. The ``intermediate'' game is on the
endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no intermediate game,'' laments Michigan State coach
Tom Izzo. ``Where are the kids who can take one or two dribbles,
pull up, and shoot? That's what separates the colleges from the
pros now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids do not practice in that area as much as they used to,''
says Skinner. ``If they do penetrate, they either take it to the
hoop or kick it out for the 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The classic theory of man-to-man offense was to set screens,
then have someone use them to get open for a jumper. That's almost
extinct now. ``The art of coming off a screen is lost,'' says
Richardson. Of course, there would have to be some screens in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones who still run those types of offenses,'' points
out Williams, ``are Bob Knight and his disciples.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmody listens to all this and sometimes wonders if he's
participating in the same sport. ``The intermediate game?'' he
inquires. ``Was it ever there? You have to be good to do that. It's
a lot easier to drive and it's a lot easier to make the long shot
than do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmody has thought a lot about shooting. Without it, Princeton
can't win. Forget about the celebrated back door stuff. Princeton
is only good when Princeton can make open shots. By the way,
Carmody isn't buying the defense argument. ``I don't care what type
of offense you run,'' he says, ``when it's all said and done, 65
percent of the time you're going to get an open shot. You've got to
have guys who can make those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Brian Hammel, Eddie Murphy, and Dana Skinner aren't
around today. They all flourished in the '70s, the Golden Age of
Division 2 basketball in New England. These guys were shooters. Al
Shields coached Hammel and coached against the other two, who
composed an astonishing Merrimack backcourt. ``There is absolutely
no doubt in my mind,'' says Shields, the long-time Bentley coach
and athletic director, ``that those two were the best shooters on
one team I ever saw in New England _ in any division.'' Take this
to the bank: No team in today's Top 25 has shooters to compare.
</P>
<P>
   What all the above-mentioned heavy hitters are doing is trying
to remake their new, improved athletes into Hammels, Murphys, and
Skinners. From Coach K, who has got an entire separate practice
facility where his players can practice shooting during their free
time, to Flint, who has added an additional 20 minutes of shooting
practice each day, the search is on for someone who can simply put
the ball in the basket in a non-dunk manner.
</P>
<P>
   Cremins wonders if any of it helps. ``I'm not so sure great
shooters aren't born,'' he theorizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a great shooter out there,'' says Penders,
``everybody tries to recruit him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one scholarship left,'' explains Izzo, ``and it's
reserved for a shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Born or manufactured, pure shooters are precious. Every coach
wants to find his own Swish McKinney.

DO ANIMALS GET BORED? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do animals get bored?
</P>
<P>
   K.M., Haydenville, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, according to Dr. Nicholas Dodman of the Tufts University
School of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may not like to give it the human word ``boredom.''
But it is. The animals are finding something else to do when they
aren't stimulated or can't do what they are programmed
instinctively to do.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman cites several examples. ``Horses have what are called
`stall vices,' things they do when they're stuck in their stall for
hours with nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He says 25-35 percent of horses do something called cribbing,
grasping a solid surface like their hay bucket or stall door in
their teeth and pulling backwards on it. It causes air to move
around in their throats making a gulping noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some do it 600 times an hour,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others pace circles into their stall floor. Some dig with their
hooves, sometimes holes up to their chests.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs will chase their tails, chase shadows, leap into the air at
imaginary insects, gnaw on furniture. Many dogs with nothing to do
for hours will lick their paws excessively, causing sores called
licking granuloma. Some dogs gulp at the air ``until they look
inflated, like they ate a basketball,'' Dodman says. ``The air
eventually comes out both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Bored cats will eat, as in chew AND swallow, non-food items,
like plastic shower curtains, running shoes, woolen objects. Bored
Siamese cats are particularly known for a condition called ``wool
sucking.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodman says monkeys in research facilities sometimes
self-mutilate, picking at their own skin until it bleeds. Bored
Macaque monkeys are known to do rectal probing. A gorilla at a
local zoo was pulling out his hair and eating it, making himself
vomit, behavior Dr. Dodman attributed to boredom. Polar bears in
zoos pace. One at the Bronx Zoo did the backstroke excessively in
its pool. A Russian bear at the San Diego zoo started drinking
water out of its paw, something those animals don't normally do.
</P>
<P>
   Common anti-depressant drugs like Prozac, also used to treat
humans with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), are sometimes
given to bored animals that have OCD-like behavior. It cured those
bears, Dr. Dodman said, and the gorilla, and prescribed properly
can also help house pets that have adopted compulsive behaviors
because of boredom.

   A couple of elementary corrections. A few weeks ago in a column
we labeled Uranium ``Ur.'' The symbol is ``U.'' And we said the
derivation of the name Hydrogen is from the Latin hudor, for water.
Hudor is Greek. Aqua is Latin. Mea culpa is oops, we messed up.

EARLY JUMPERS KEEP TALENT POOL SHALLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Packer has long criticized the NBA for allowing
underclassmen to declare themselves eligible for the draft. The CBS
analyst doesn't have a problem with the kids earning big money. He
does have a problem, however, with the draining of talent and other
impacts the departures have had on the college game.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Packer argues, coaches are forced to change their
recruiting and team development from a four-year plan to a two-year
plan. No telling when a high-scoring freshman or sophomore will
bolt for the NBA, leaving his team without experienced players to
compete in the NCAA tourney.
</P>
<P>
   College basketball fans will be hearing Packer's opinions a lot
this winter, as CBS will televise 40 games, mostly on Saturdays,
including the NCAA tournament. Also chronicling this year's Road to
the Final Four will be ESPN and ESPN2, which with a crew of
announcers headed by Dick Vitale will cover 273 men's games and 56
women's games. Other outlets will be Fox Sports New England and New
England Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of underclassmen ``has changed the history of the
college game,'' Packer said. ``You will no longer have players of
that magnitude sticking around for their senior years. You'll never
see that again.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Packer has a new target: the Continental Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Packer predicts that in the next five years the CBA, under the
ownership of Isiah Thomas, will attract many All-American high
school players, leaving the college game without young talent. The
loss of younger players won't mean the death of college basketball,
though. The game will be just as competitive, but not as dominated
by potential pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those fans who can accept the way the game will be,
college basketball will still be a lot of fun,'' Packer said. ``But
the game will undergo another dramatic shift in five years. No
longer will the college game have the 100 top high school
prospects. I have great respect for Isiah, and he will be able to
offer a 17- or 18-year-old kid the chance to make $75,000 a year to
play basketball and have a shot at the NBA without going to a
single class.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell if Packer is right. Thomas is still busy
reorganizing the CBA, and of more pressing concern to college
commentators is the impact the NCAA tournament has had on coaching
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge, but unfortunate in a sense, because a team's and
coach's success is completely defined by what happens in March,''
said CNN/SI's Seth Davis. ``A team could have a great year but lose
in the second round or the Sweet Sixteen and then be perceived as
not having a good year. The tournament is a bit hyperbolized.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of the college game's focus on the NCAA tournament is
the advent of what are called ``good losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, a team worried about its national
ranking and tournament seeding loaded up its early-season schedule
with weak opponents to build up its record. But the days of playing
teams that former St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca described as the
``Little Sisters of the Poor'' are over.
</P>
<P>
   Because the NCAA tournament selection committee considers
strength of schedule as an important factor, coaches don't have to
be afraid of losing to competitive teams. ``It allows them to get
better through losing,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lousiville's Denny Crum was probably the first coach to use
early-season games to improve weaknesses, an unusual plan
considering Crum was a disciple of UCLA coach John Wooden, who
rarely scheduled tough opponents early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The responsibility of a coach has changed dramatically in the
last 15 years so much so that a head coach doesn't relate to a
Wooden these days,'' Packer said. ``Any coach of a major program
has to use the early games to test his team and shore up their
weaknesses. The coach has to get his players ready to not only
execute during tournament time but also display mental toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside of tournament play is the pressure on coaches to
win. Packer said he has never seen so much angst among coaches.
``They are really afraid if they don't win the big one, they will
be considered a loser,'' Packer said.
</P>
<P>
   Packer believes Richmond coach Dick Tarrant has the right idea.
Richmond has never won a national championship but has been able to
score major upsets in tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarrant knew that he didn't have enough talent to win a
championship,'' Packer said. ``He knew his team was not capable of
winning three games in the tournament. He might win two games and,
as a result, he used to say, `My Final Four is making it to the
Sweet Sixteen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a coach out there today that really has that
perspective.''

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, general counsel for
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees
public colleges.

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

NO. 1 UCONN WELCOMES THE GANTLET 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   University of Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma is having a hectic
week, and the season hasn't even begun.
</P>
<P>
   It began when his team rolled over the Australian Institute
team, 96-64, in last Sunday's exhibition game. On Wednesday, he
fielded questions from Husky fans in an on-line chat. On Thursday,
he and his team were the guests of honor at a reception at a local
TV station held after practice. And, all week he was waiting to get
letters of intent from five high school players to whom he has
offered scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's grueling at times, but it's part of the grind that
comes from being the No. 1 team in the country in the AP preseason
poll.
</P>
<P>
   And while the spotlight puts added pressure on the team,
Auriemma seems to be relishing the spotlight. Especially after last
season, which ended with a thud when the team didn't get beyond the
Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to this season,'' he said via e-mail.
``It's a tremendous honor for us to be ranked No. 1. We're just
going to enjoy it and keep it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The perspective, he acknowledged, will be quickly challenged
when the team embarks on its season next Sunday against Iowa. Over
the next five months, the Huskies will face second-ranked Tennessee
twice and Rutgers (No. 4) twice. Add to that UCLA (No. 5),
Louisiana Tech (6th), Notre Dame (8th), Penn. St. (10th), Illinois
(12th), and Boston College (19th), and the Huskies will have plenty
of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, said Auriemma, who is not known for ever giving his
players an easy route to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our schedule, we'll have the chance to prove if we're No.
1 or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma's top player is also one of the country's top players.
Junior Svetlana Abrosimova, a 6-foot-2-inch forward from St.
Petersburg, Russia, averaged 16.6 points per game, 6.6 rebounds,
and 3.7. assists.
</P>
<P>
   She was named preseason All-America for the second consecutive
year and also the Big East's preseason player of the year. Last
season, she was voted Big East player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma said the accolades are definitely deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever coached anybody who can do as many
things as she can on a basketball court,'' he said. ``She is an
important player for us because she is going to touch the ball the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn, which went 29-5 in the regular season last year and
shared the Big East title _ its eighth _ with Rutgers, and won the
Big East Championship, returns most of its lineup, and returns them
in playing form.
</P>
<P>
   Shea Ralph, who sat out the year before with an anterior
cruciate ligament tear, was back last year, although she missed
four games with a knee injury. The 6-foot shooting guard came back
to be the team leader as she averaged 16.8 points and pulled down
an average of 3.8 rebounds. (She scored a career-high 36 against
BC.)
</P>
<P>
   Another player plagued by injury was Sue Bird, who was sidelined
after only eight games with an ACL, but is back to take over the
point guard spot.
</P>
<P>
   Kiersten Walters, who had filled in for Bird, was felled with a
knee injury at the end of last season and is still a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors are going to have another look at the knee,''
Auriemma said. ``We're going to try as much as we can to get her
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also suffering on the sidelines was 6-foot-2 forward Swin Cash,
who averaged 9.5 points but missed 12 games with a stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman ``fab five'' have moved up a grade, but are still
known by that moniker, according to Auriemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting more and more confident in their own games and
in each other as a group,'' he said, acknowedgling that sometimes
they still act like the new kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still kind of a young team at times,'' said Auriemma.
``They still have some growing up to do, and they will throughout
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is Tamika Williams, last year's Big East
rookie of the year who led UConn in rebounds (6.8) and was No. 3 in
the nation and the Big East in field-goal percentage (.658) as she
averaged 13.5 points per game. Rounding out the stellar recruiting
class was 6-foot-2 forward Asiha Jones (9.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   This year, there is only one freshman _ Kennitra Johnson, from
New Albany, Ind. The 5-7 guard who averaged 21 points, 5 steals,
and 4 rebounds her senior year was named a Parade first team
All-America and Gatorade Indiana player of the year last year.
Johnson also was named Big East preseason rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The other new face is 6-6 center Christine Rigby, who was seen
on the sidelines but not on the court last year. She sat out the
season after transferring from Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   The only two seniors in UConn's lineup are 6-foot-1 forward
Stacy Hansmeyer, and 6-5 center Paige Sauer.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma, who is entering his 15th season as head coach, has
been with UConn to the NCAA tournament 11 times, to the Final Four
three times, and took his team to the national title in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   While he's not going to make any guarantees, Auriemma will come
as close as he can to a making a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good group,'' said Auriemma. ``It's as good a group
as I've had here in a long time. I really feel confident about
these players.''
</P>
<P>
   For the coach of a No. 1 ranked team, he should.

<P>
   What began, at least officially, as a limited campaign to stamp
out terrorism and create a ``security zone'' around Chechnya, is
looking more and more like a full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   It has many parallels with, as well as differences from, the
first Chechen war, which ended in 1996. Both the parallels and the
differences are, to say the least, very disquieting.
</P>
<P>
   The main, tragic similarity is, of course, the incredible toll
on the people of Chechnya. While Russian officials are trying hard
to play down the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe, the
refugees tell a different story.
</P>
<P>
   There are tens of thousands of them, shivering in makeshift
tents or living in overcrowded homes in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. The unluckier ones have died in air raids and missile
attacks, such as the one that killed and wounded hundreds of
civilians in Grozny's central market on Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But, whereas the first war was very unpopular among the Russian
public, this time it is different. In part, the Chechens themselves
are to blame for this lack of compassion. As Fiona Hill of the U.S.
human rights organization Freedom House recently pointed out,
``sympathy for them rapidly dissipated in the face of blatant
kidnappings, assassinations, murders and attacks on economic
targets in neighboring areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The invasion of Dagestan, to the east, this past summer, led by
the Islamic warlord Shamil Basayev, left the Russian government no
option but to respond with force _ this, at least, is the position
taken in favor of the bloody Russian assault.
</P>
<P>
   But what really infuriated Russian public opinion and made it
support the military campaign were the terrorist bombings in Moscow
and other Russian cities, which killed hundreds of people and were
widely, though so far without proof, attributed to ``Chechen
bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing public support for the war, which has resulted in a
sharp rise in the popularity of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin,
is disturbing. It is of course natural for any nation to rally in
support of its soldiers. But people seem to be too eager to swallow
the crude official propaganda, and the media too willing to play
along.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian generals, who still blame the media and the
politicians for their defeat in the first war, have seized upon the
initial popular support with a vengeance. This time, the generals
made it very clear that they will be in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, top officers, such as Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief
of the Russian general staff, and Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, commander
of the Western forces in Chechnya, have publicly and not too subtly
warned of possible mutiny and even civil war should their hard-line
campaign be thwarted by the political leadership in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This, for the Russian military, which typically steers clear of
politics, is extremely unusual behavior, and it is the most
disturbing aspect of the war. If left unchecked, it could lead to a
political tragedy compounding the human tragedy that we are
witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   With Moscow's politics increasingly opaque under multiple layers
of intrigue, we will probably not know any time soon what prompted
President Boris N. Yeltsin to rush back to Moscow Nov. 3 from his
vacation on the Black Sea. But reports are rife that army generals
were threatening to resign in protest unless they were allowed to
fight the war their way, to an all-out victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to Moscow, Yeltsin has been characteristically
enigmatic. Allowing a situation like this to occur in the first
place was another of the many failures of his political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian politicians have appeared all too eager to jump on
the war bandwagon. The Communists and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's
extreme nationalist group are the most vociferous supporters of the
war, but even among the younger generations, whose main agenda is
economic reform, few have dared to criticize the way the war is
being prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   What little criticism there has been comes from former Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who says that he is against turning
the campaign into a full-scale war, and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader
of the Yabloko Party, a pro-Western advocate of reform, who has
called for a conditional cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even such expressions of common sense have been politically
costly: Primakov's popularity ratings have been declining, in part
because he is seen as insufficiently tough, and Yavlinsky's
initiative has been roundly criticized by politicians of various
stripes and, according to opinion polls, has little popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, it is hard to be optimistic. The war is set to
continue, although even a victory of the Russian army is likely to
be hollow. From the mountains in the south, Chechen fighters will
continue to launch raids and exhaust Russian troops, whose
casualties are now probably higher than admitted by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Any turn for the better would be most likely to result from a
reconsideration of the situation by the Russian people. There are
some signs that such rethinking may have started. The Russian press
is beginning to publish stories that run counter to the official
propaganda line. Opinion polls indicate that a growing percentage
of the people are having doubts about the war. Some observers
believe that support for it has peaked and will soon begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes reason will emerge to influence the course of events
and prevent the tragic situation in Chechnya from getting any
worse.

<P>
   After the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the United States accused Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born
construction tycoon, of financing terrorist camps in Somalia,
Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Egypt and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, America fired cruise missiles at bin Laden's
camps in eastern Afghanistan, killing nearly 20 militants but
leaving his network unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Washington demanded bin Laden's extradition. But the Taliban,
who rule Afghanistan, refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban emerged in late 1994 as a messianic movement made up
of ``taliban'' (literally, students) from Islamic ``madrasahs''
(seminaries) who were living as refugees in Pakistan. They vowed to
bring peace to wartorn Afghanistan, establish law and order, disarm
the population and impose ``sharia'' (Islamic law).
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the nature of the Taliban _ who they are and what
they represent _ has been difficult for outsiders to understand
because of the excessive secrecy that surrounds their leaders and
political structure.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban do not issue policy statements or hold regular press
conferences. There is no Taliban manifesto. Because of the strict
religious ban on photography and television, Afghans do not even
know what their new leaders look like. The one-eyed Taliban
religious leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, does not meet with
non-Muslims and so remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Taliban's purist ideology and the Pakistani recruits it
has nurtured have had immense cross-border repercussions in
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   An already fragile nation in the midst of an identity crisis,
economic meltdown, ethnic and sectarian division _ and a military
regime that overthrew the government of former Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in October _ Pakistan could easily be submerged by a new
fundamentalist wave led by neo-Taliban groups.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pakistan's support for the Taliban is coming back to
haunt it. By 1998, neo-Taliban parties had become a major influence
in the Pakistani provinces of Baluchistan and the North West
Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
   In those regions, they had begun banning television and videos,
imposing ``sharia'' punishments such as stoning and amputation,
assassinating Pakistani Shiite Muslims and forcing women to adopt
the restrictive Taliban dress code. Their influence is now starting
to creep elsewhere into Pakistan _ to Punjab and Sind.
</P>
<P>
   Already in July the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), a strongly
anti-Western political party, issued death threats to all Americans
in Pakistan, to be carried out if bin Laden is extradited to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is reluctant to help the United States capture bin
Laden, if only because it would create the appearance that
Islamabad was seen to do Washington's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi dilemma is even worse. Saudi Arabia has helped finance
the Taliban and has provided crucial military support for their
offensives. After the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, the Saudis
suspended diplomatic relations with the Taliban and ostensibly
ceased all aid. They did not, however, withdraw diplomatic
recognition and private donations continue to flow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia would like to leave bin Laden in
Afghanistan. His arrest and trial in the United States could be
highly embarrassing, exposing his continuing relationship with
sympathetic members of the ruling elites and intelligence services
of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis
trained and fought in Afghanistan. By now, the JUI and its many
breakaway factions have become the main recruiters of Pakistani and
foreign students to fight for the Taliban. These battle-hardened
militants now gravely threaten Pakistan's own stability.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the thousands of foreign radicals now fighting
alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan are determined to someday
overthrow their own regimes and carry out Taliban-style revolutions
in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Chechnya-based militants who took over parts of
Dagestan in July included in their ranks Arabs, Afghans and
Pakistanis, most of whom had fought in the '80s Afghan holy war, or
``jihad,'' against the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main recruiters of Arab militants for the Afghan
jihad was bin Ladin. As the richest and highest-ranking Saudi to
participate in the struggle, he was heavily patronized by both
Pakistani and Saudi intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin left Afghanistan in 1990 but returned in May 1996.
Striking up a friendship with Omar, the Taliban chief, bin Ladin
moved to Omar's base in Kandahar in early 1997. Bin Ladin reunited
and rearmed the Arab militants still remaining in Afghanistan after
the war against the Soviets, creating the ``055'' brigade. The
Taliban had no contact with Arab Afghans or pan-Islamic ideology
until then.
</P>
<P>
   But Omar was quickly influenced by his new friend and became
increasingly vociferous in his attacks on Americans, the United
Nations and the Saudis and other pro-Western Muslim regimes. Recent
Taliban statements reflect a bin Ladin-style outrage, defiance and
pan-Islamism that the Taliban had never used before his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   By now U.S. officials claim that, with most of his bank accounts
frozen, bin Laden finances his operations through opium.
Afghanistan now produces three times more opium than the rest of
the world put together. Ninety-six percent of it is cultivated in
Taliban-controlled areas, making the Taliban the largest heroin
producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Drug Control Program reports that Afghanistan produced
4,600 metric tons of opium in 1999 _ twice as much as in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Taliban collect a 20 percent tax from opium dealers and
transporters _ money that goes straight to the Taliban war chest.
Drug dealers operate the only banking system in Afghanistan _
offering farmers credit in advance of their poppy crop. This
criminalized economy has weakened states throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, chaos in Afghanistan is seeping through its
porous borders. Its ongoing civil war has polarized the region,
with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia backing the Taliban, while Iran,
Russia, India and four former Soviet Central Asian republics
support the opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is producing enormous economic disruption
throughout the area, as the Afghan warlords' dependence on
smuggling and drug trafficking grows insatiable.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 World Bank study estimates that the smuggling trade
between Pakistan and Afghanistan alone amounted to $2.5 billion in
1997, equivalent to more than half of Afghanistan's estimated gross
domestic product. Add to that the smuggling to and from the rest of
the region and the total rises to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This smuggling has crippled local industry in all the affected
states; local factories cannot compete with smuggled, foreign-made,
duty-free consumer goods. The smuggling also creates huge losses in
customs revenue and sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue, Pakistan's
losses in 1998 amounted to 30 percent of the government's total
revenues of $6 billion. The Taliban tax on the smuggling trade was
its second-largest source of income after drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Afghan opium was exported to the West through Pakistan
in the 1980s, there are now multiple export routes through Iran,
the Persian Gulf states and Central Asia. As these routes expand,
so do the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   New transport and smuggling mafias have developed in
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Iran. They are ignored by
their governments, due to a web of corruption that benefits
everyone from border guards to cabinet ministers. Not surprisingly,
all these transport mafias are keen supporters and major funders of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   And this illegal economy is only expanding, since Afghanistan's
formal one remains nonexistent. The Afghan infrastructure is
devastated, health care and education are virtually absent, and
abject poverty is rampant. Afghanistan today has six working
factories, compared to 220 in 1979. Fighting and smuggling offer
the only employment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington's sole response so far has been its
single-minded obsession with bringing to justice the now-legendary
</P>
<P>
   bin Laden _ hardly a comprehensive policy for dealing with this
increasingly volatile part of the world.

<P>
   ``Talibanization,'' the destabilizing export of Afghan-style
radical Islam, may be a new term in the American political lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   But in Central and South Asia, where the repercussions of the
superstrict Taliban rule of Afghanistan have been widely felt, the
word has become all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As political fragmentation, economic meltdown, ethnic and
sectarian warfare, and Islamic fundamentalism tighten their grip on
Pakistan and much of the rest of the region, the dangerous behavior
of Afghanistan's leaders is no longer a local affair.
</P>
<P>
   For Western nations to presume that they can safely exploit the
vast oil and gas riches of Central Asia without first helping bring
peace to Afghanistan is unrealistic to the extreme. A new Great
Game is being played in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, however, are no longer questions of mere political
influence or who gets to build oil and gas pipelines where. These
issues will be irrelevant unless the West figures out how to stop
the spreading conflagration in Afghanistan _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   For Afghanistan to be at the center of both dialogue and
conflict between civilizations is nothing new. The country's
location at the crossroads between Iran, Central Asia, the Arabian
Sea and India has given its mountain passes a strategic
significance for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At certain times, Afghanistan has acted as a buffer between
competing empires and ideologies. At others it has served as a
corridor through which armies marched.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to colonize the country, most recently by the
British and the former Soviets, have failed and in the process
given the Afghans a fierce sense of independence and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, patron of the Afghan rebellion against the
Soviet invaders, walked away after the Soviet Union withdrew its
last troops in 1989. The Afghans, once on the frontline of the Cold
War, were left with a devastated country. One million had died
during the ten-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   But only three years later, when Kabul fell to the
``mujahideen'' warriors who had fought off the Soviets, gory civil
war again gripped the country, fueled by neighboring countries
trying to carve out areas of influence. By now, the civil war has
pitted the majority Pushtun population in the south and east
against the ethnic minorities of the north _ Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara
and Turkmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of Afghans are Sunni Muslims, although Shiites
predominate among the Hazaras and some Tajik clans settled in
central Afghanistan. Traditional Islam in Afghanistan believed in
minimum government with as little state interference as possible.
Another key factor contributing to Afghan tolerance was the
enormous popularity of Sufism, a mystical and undogmatic branch of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Taliban arrived, none of Islam's extreme orthodox
sects _ such as the conservative Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia _ had
found a home in Afghanistan. But the Taliban emerged at a critical
juncture, as the country was fractured by warlords, and an
ideological vacuum grew within the Islamist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their predecessors, the Taliban have little knowledge of
Islamic and Afghan history, of ``sharia'' (pure Islamic law) or the
Quran. Their exposure to the radical Islamic debate around the
world is minimal; indeed, they are so rigid in their beliefs that
they admit no discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan believes that a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan will be
an ally and give its army strategic depth in its ongoing conflict
with India. In particular, Islamabad considers support for the
Taliban necessary because of its dispute with India over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban and fundamentalist groups in Pakistan give major
support to Kashmiri insurgents resisting New Delhi's control of
Indian Kashmir. Islamabad therefore cannot drop its support for
them without affecting the Kashmir cause it espouses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the increasing Islamicization of the Kashmiri struggle has
undermined both the Kashmiris' own demand for self-determination
from India and Pakistan's bid to win international mediation of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmiri independence movement is losing world sympathy as
more and more Pakistani and Arab recruits join the fight and turn
it into a Taliban holy war, or ``jihad.'' The longer this goes on,
the less chance there will be that the territorial dispute will
ever be peacefully resolved. Day by day, the danger grows.
</P>
<P>
   With their porous borders, weak security apparatuses, and
crisis-torn economies, the five former Soviet Central Asian
republics _ Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan _ have every reason to fear the turmoil emanating from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The threats include the flow of drugs and weapons and a possible
flood of refugees if the opposition to the Taliban, the Northern
Alliance, is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But Central Asia's leaders, who have not changed since the
Soviet era, are growing increasingly authoritarian. Their rigged
elections have undermined democratic alternatives, leaving
underground Islamist movements as the only political opposition.
Widespread poverty and unemployment provide a fertile recruiting
base for young militants.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent Afghan civil war, the newly independent
Central Asian states supported their ethnic kin in northern
Afghanistan, who provided a buffer against the spread of
fundamentalism. That buffer has now been virtually eliminated. The
Taliban control Afghan territory bordering Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apart from Turkmenistan, which has declared itself neutral
in the Afghan conflict, these states continue to support the
weakened Northern Alliance. Ahmad Shah Masud, the alliance's ethnic
Tajik military commander, keeps a major resupply base in southern
Tajikistan, where he receives arms from Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is also threatened by the Taliban. The Shiite regime in
Tehran has long opposed Pushtun fundamentalism because it is backed
by a regional rival _ Pakistan _ and because it is Sunni-dominated.
</P>
<P>
   China too has been affected by the ascendance of the Taliban.
Beijing shunned the civil war in Afghanistan until February 1999,
when it first made overtures to the Taliban in an attempt to stem
the tide of Afghan heroin flooding Xinjiang. The heroin was helping
fund Islamist and nationalist opposition to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those militants trained and fought with the Afghan
mujahideen since 1986, and Chinese officials say the arms and
explosives the rebels have used against Chinese security forces
come from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's reasons for its regional adventurism are a mixture
of naivete, frustration, and ideology. At one level, the Taliban
insist that Afghan tribal tradition obliges them to give aid and
sanctuary to neighbors. But the Taliban are also furious with Iran
and Uzbekistan for their military support of the Northern Alliance.
</P>

<P>
   ``Talibanization,'' the destabilizing export of Afghan-style
radical Islam, may be a new term in the American political lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   But in Central and South Asia, where the repercussions of the
superstrict Taliban rule of Afghanistan have been widely felt, the
word has become all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As political fragmentation, economic meltdown, ethnic and
sectarian warfare, and Islamic fundamentalism tighten their grip on
Pakistan and much of the rest of the region, the dangerous behavior
of Afghanistan's leaders is no longer a local affair.
</P>
<P>
   For Western nations to presume that they can safely exploit the
vast oil and gas riches of Central Asia without first helping bring
peace to Afghanistan is unrealistic to the extreme. A new Great
Game is being played in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, however, are no longer questions of mere political
influence or who gets to build oil and gas pipelines where. These
issues will be irrelevant unless the West figures out how to stop
the spreading conflagration in Afghanistan _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   For Afghanistan to be at the center of both dialogue and
conflict between civilizations is nothing new. The country's
location at the crossroads between Iran, Central Asia, the Arabian
Sea and India has given its mountain passes a strategic
significance for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   At certain times, Afghanistan has acted as a buffer between
competing empires and ideologies. At others it has served as a
corridor through which armies marched.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to colonize the country, most recently by the
British and the former Soviets, have failed and in the process
given the Afghans a fierce sense of independence and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, patron of the Afghan rebellion against the
Soviet invaders, walked away after the Soviet Union withdrew its
last troops in 1989. The Afghans, once on the frontline of the Cold
War, were left with a devastated country. One million had died
during the ten-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   But only three years later, when Kabul fell to the
``mujahideen'' warriors who had fought off the Soviets, gory civil
war again gripped the country, fueled by neighboring countries
trying to carve out areas of influence. By now, the civil war has
pitted the majority Pushtun population in the south and east
against the ethnic minorities of the north _ Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara
and Turkmen.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of Afghans are Sunni Muslims, although Shiites
predominate among the Hazaras and some Tajik clans settled in
central Afghanistan. Traditional Islam in Afghanistan believed in
minimum government with as little state interference as possible.
Another key factor contributing to Afghan tolerance was the
enormous popularity of Sufism, a mystical and undogmatic branch of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Taliban arrived, none of Islam's extreme orthodox
sects _ such as the conservative Wahhabis from Saudi Arabia _ had
found a home in Afghanistan. But the Taliban emerged at a critical
juncture, as the country was fractured by warlords, and an
ideological vacuum grew within the Islamist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their predecessors, the Taliban have little knowledge of
Islamic and Afghan history, of ``sharia'' (pure Islamic law) or the
Quran. Their exposure to the radical Islamic debate around the
world is minimal; indeed, they are so rigid in their beliefs that
they admit no discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan believes that a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan will be
an ally and give its army strategic depth in its ongoing conflict
with India. In particular, Islamabad considers support for the
Taliban necessary because of its dispute with India over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban and fundamentalist groups in Pakistan give major
support to Kashmiri insurgents resisting New Delhi's control of
Indian Kashmir. Islamabad therefore cannot drop its support for
them without affecting the Kashmir cause it espouses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the increasing Islamicization of the Kashmiri struggle has
undermined both the Kashmiris' own demand for self-determination
from India and Pakistan's bid to win international mediation of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmiri independence movement is losing world sympathy as
more and more Pakistani and Arab recruits join the fight and turn
it into a Taliban holy war, or ``jihad.'' The longer this goes on,
the less chance there will be that the territorial dispute will
ever be peacefully resolved. Day by day, the danger grows.
</P>
<P>
   With their porous borders, weak security apparatuses, and
crisis-torn economies, the five former Soviet Central Asian
republics _ Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan _ have every reason to fear the turmoil emanating from
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The threats include the flow of drugs and weapons and a possible
flood of refugees if the opposition to the Taliban, the Northern
Alliance, is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But Central Asia's leaders, who have not changed since the
Soviet era, are growing increasingly authoritarian. Their rigged
elections have undermined democratic alternatives, leaving
underground Islamist movements as the only political opposition.
Widespread poverty and unemployment provide a fertile recruiting
base for young militants.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent Afghan civil war, the newly independent
Central Asian states supported their ethnic kin in northern
Afghanistan, who provided a buffer against the spread of
fundamentalism. That buffer has now been virtually eliminated. The
Taliban control Afghan territory bordering Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apart from Turkmenistan, which has declared itself neutral
in the Afghan conflict, these states continue to support the
weakened Northern Alliance. Ahmad Shah Masud, the alliance's ethnic
Tajik military commander, keeps a major resupply base in southern
Tajikistan, where he receives arms from Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is also threatened by the Taliban. The Shiite regime in
Tehran has long opposed Pushtun fundamentalism because it is backed
by a regional rival _ Pakistan _ and because it is Sunni-dominated.
</P>
<P>
   China too has been affected by the ascendance of the Taliban.
Beijing shunned the civil war in Afghanistan until February 1999,
when it first made overtures to the Taliban in an attempt to stem
the tide of Afghan heroin flooding Xinjiang. The heroin was helping
fund Islamist and nationalist opposition to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those militants trained and fought with the Afghan
mujahideen since 1986, and Chinese officials say the arms and
explosives the rebels have used against Chinese security forces
come from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's reasons for its regional adventurism are a mixture
of naivete, frustration, and ideology. At one level, the Taliban
insist that Afghan tribal tradition obliges them to give aid and
sanctuary to neighbors. But the Taliban are also furious with Iran
and Uzbekistan for their military support of the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And Kabul is deeply frustrated with its rejection by the
international community and the Muslim world, which has refused to
recognize the Taliban government. By harboring dissidents,
Afghanistan gets its revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prestige is spreading across the region because we have
truly implemented Islam, and this makes the Americans and some
neighbors very nervous,'' says Afghan Information Minister Amir

</P>

IT'S CLEARER SAILING FOR VIRGINIA TECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought the Bowl Championship Series rankings were
hopeless, things cleared up. That's the beauty of November games.
Sure, there's no playoff system, but consider the significance of
Saturday's games.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee lost to Arkansas. So long, Vols.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State lost to Alabama. See you, Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State lost to Michigan. The Lions' roar was completely
silenced.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State lost to Nebraska. The Wildcats again were the
Mildcats.
</P>
<P>
   What is apparent is Virginia Tech's position of strength.
Barring another abnormality in the computer rankings, Virginia Tech
looks like a lock to make the BCS championship Sugar Bowl game in
New Orleans Jan. 4 _ if the Hokies get past 2-7 Temple next week
and 7-2 Boston College the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The other slot looks like it will go to the winner of the
Florida State-Florida game next week, although if Florida wins it
must still beat Alabama in a rematch in the SEC title game in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The most shocking loss was Tennessee's. Just when the Vols
seemed poised to make a serious run at defending their national
championship, they got beaten by Arkansas, 28-24. That was the same
score as last year, when the Razorbacks fumbled away the lead in
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Race still on
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy race may not be quite over. Although Ron
Dayne broke Ricky Williams's NCAA career rushing record with 216
yards in Wisconsin's 41-3 win over Iowa, other contenders remain.
Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton threw five touchdown passes
in Tech's 45-42 win over Clemson. ``It's not over yet,'' said
Hamilton, who argues that with two games remaining, against Wake
Forest and Georgia, he has a chance to convince some voters. He may
be right. Dayne's done for the regular season and Heisman voters'
memories tend to be short . . . With Wisconsin's victory and Penn
State's loss to Michigan, the Badgers are making back-to-back Rose
Bowl visits for the first time in their history . . . What's going
on at Florida? Coach Steve Spurrier's Fun and Gun offense has
become Run and Gun. The Gators' passing game has been nonexistent.
In Saturday's 20-3 win over South Carolina, the Gators had only 161
yards in the air. ``We're not as mighty as some people think we
are,'' said Spurrier. ``But we keep winning.'' . . . What a year
for South Carolina coach Lou Holtz. The Gamecocks have lost 20
games in a row, the most in Division 1-A, and are 0-10 this season.
Holtz's wife, Beth, is battling cancer and on Friday his mother,
Ann Marie, died . . . Miami freshman running back Jarrett Payton
wore No. 34 in the Hurricanes' loss to Virginia Tech. It was, of
course, the number his father, Walter, wore with the Chicago Bears.
Payton died two weeks ago and his son wanted to do something to
honor his father. ``It was something I never thought I'd do,'' said
Payton, who wore No. 32 when he arrived at Miami. ``But it felt
like the timing was right.'' . . . What a wild two weeks for Duke.
Last week, the Blue Devils were blown away by Clemson, 58-7.
Saturday they rolled to a 48-35 win over Wake Forest . . . It's a
good thing Ohio State coach John Cooper signed his contract
extension earlier in the year. Folks in Columbus are not real happy
with Cooper after the Buckeyes' 46-20 loss to Illinois. With a 6-5
record, Ohio State needs to beat Michigan next week to even qualify
for a bowl. Illinois, on the other hand, has its six wins and is
bowl eligible, with road triumphs over Ohio State and Michigan to
boot.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Red-letter day
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was some good news for Rutgers. By beating
Syracuse in overtime, 24-21, the Scarlet Knights avoided a winless
season, and beat the Orangemen for the first time in 12 years. It
was also revenge for the Knights, who were four-touchdown
underdogs. In the last three years, Syracuse had outscored them,
152-17 . . . If Pittsburgh can beat West Virginia next week and
Miami can beat either Syracuse or Temple in the next two weeks, the
Big East could have five of its eight teams bowl eligible, a
delightful set of circumstances. The league must start to work on
finding a spot for Syracuse if the Panthers become bowl eligible .
. . Boston College's win over West Virginia guarantees the Eagles a
bowl slot. Their best bet is Nashville and the Music City Bowl
against a Southeastern Conference team, but a win over Notre Dame
Saturday probably would send the Eagles to the Insight.com Bowl in
Tucson. If one makes the assumption that Virginia Tech was expected
to be as good as it is, can there be any other choice for Big East
Coach of The Year than BC's Tom O'Brien? Had the Eagles not blown
that lead against Miami, they would be very much in the hunt for a
BCS bowl slot, a remarkable turnaround after a pair of 4-7 seasons.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spoiling for a fight
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's loss to Penn casts the Crimson into the role of Ivy
League spoilers. And whose season better to spoil than Yale's. The
Bulldogs need a win over the Crimson to clinch at least a tie for
the Ivy title. With back-to-back losses, coach Tim Murphy's Crimson
now need a win at Yale to guarantee a winning season . . . If the
season were to end today, here's how the BCS bowls probably would
look: Sugar Bowl _ Florida State vs. Virginia Tech; Orange Bowl _
Florida vs. Michigan; Fiesta Bowl _ Nebraska vs. Tennessee; Rose
Bowl _ Wisconsin vs. Stanford . . . Wisconsin locked up a Rose Bowl
berth with its win over Iowa, but the Pac-10, as usual, is muddled.
A Stanford win over California Saturday would clinch the berth for
the Cardinal. A Stanford loss to Cal and a Washington win over
Washington State would send the Huskies to the Rose.

CHERISHED PETS RECEIVE PRICEY HIGH-TECH TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photo of a vet with an ultra-sound and a photo of
Sterling (cat) with his owner) 
 By CHRIS BRENNAN 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sterling is a medical success story, once near death but now
thriving, thanks to the donated kidney that saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling, by the way, is a cat. A cat who has had an organ
transplant, a surgery once reserved only for humans. As the 1900s
come to a close, it's not unusual for our four-legged friends to
benefit from some of the same medical advances humans have access
to.
</P>
<P>
   Only fair, animal activists might argue, since much of the
research used to develop the techniques is conducted on animals.
</P>
<P>
   But extending the new technology to veterinary care comes at a
price tag not everyone can or is willing to pay. In the extremes _
Sterling's case, for example _ the cost of saving a pet can equal
that of a new car or a week in Europe for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's tab, because his condition was so advanced, ended up
somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000. But the expense was worth it
to owner Diana Markovich, even though the cat was a stray she had
rescued as a kitten.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a blessing and a miracle,'' said the Lakeland, Fla.,
woman. ''He's like a million dollar kitty.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the only option for an animal in Sterling's
condition would have been euthanasia. But a booming economy has
given rise to the demand for more options in pet care and for
advances in treatment and diagnostic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started in 1970, a lot of the stuff we did was by
hand,'' said Tom Houghton, a veterinarian at Cleveland Heights
Animal Hospital, where Sterling receives care. ''If we really
wanted to get sophisticated, we used an X-ray.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the medical setting Sterling had the good fortune
to encounter was a high-tech environment of highly trained
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   When the cat's kidneys began to fail, he was taken to the
University of Florida's Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital in
Gainesville. He was so weak that the veterinarians were unable to
operate, and twice they recommended ending the cat's life.
Markovich would not give permission.
</P>
<P>
   As a last resort, Sterling received a kidney from an
18-month-old cat named Charlie, who had been used in experiments to
study feline leukemia. (Charlie was later adopted by a student).
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a pretty big ordeal we went through,'' said Markovich.
''He was on life support in severely critical condition for three
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she said, the cat is stronger than ever. Like humans who
receive transplanted organs, he must take drugs to keep his body
from rejecting the kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Hi-tech developments extend beyond the veterinary teaching
hospitals and are making a difference in treatment options at the
local clinics.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cleveland Heights Animal Hospital, a new $27,000 laser
enables veterinarians to remove tumors in areas that once made for
difficult surgery _ under a tongue, near a tonsil, above an eye.
</P>
<P>
   For a 1-year-old black Labrador retriever named Sheriff, the
laser meant quicker healing and less pain following a procedure
veterinarians often perform _ neutering.
</P>
<P>
   The laser beam, invisible to the eye except for the small puff
of smoke it creates, slices through skin quickly and efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a tool of the future for surgery,'' said Dr.
Houghton.
</P>
<P>
   Other advances in use at the hospital include a $20,000
ultrasound machine that enables veterinarians to examine internal
organs without the need for invasive surgery and a $7,000 hand-held
blood testing machine that can help with diagnosis of diabetes and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   And coming soon to the clinic: Electromyograms that show the
electrical activity in muscle contractions. The test, known as an
EMG, can help a veterinarian diagnose vision or hearing problems
and evaluate strength in limbs.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is also making it much easier to bring specialists
into the diagnosis and treatment process, regardless of their
physical location. The Internet makes it possible for X-rays and
medical charts to be reviewed by the right specialist, no matter
where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't possibly be experts about everything,'' Houghton said
of the local veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is enhancing the life of pets in other ways, as
well. A proliferation of sites catering to animal needs reflects
the growing demand for all kinds of pet products and services.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Heights Animal Hospital's Web site
(www.pethospital.com) offers a link to suppliers of 14,000 items
that can be purchased online. Pet owners can also e-mail questions
about their pets for the veterinarians to answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I answered several people's questions this morning in much
less time than it would take for me to call them,'' Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   The answers, themselves, speak to the new age of veterinary
medicine. A misbehaving dog may be prescribed the pet version of
Prozac to control his mood. A continuous barker may require a
lasering procedure on the vocal chords, known as ''de-barking.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as human health care has given rise to alternative
treatments _ many of which embrace ancient techniques _ so, too,
has veterinary medicine. Dr. John Haromy, a Lake Wales, Fla.,
veterinarian, uses acupuncture and homeopathic remedies on some of
the animals he treats.
</P>
<P>
   It's not very futuristic, he concedes, but it is an alternative
to the high-priced animal care some pet owners are encountering.
</P>
<P>
   A hip replacement surgery for a dog can cost more than $1,000,
said Haromy. He treats hip trouble using acupuncture needles to
push gold pellets under the skin of the animal, a procedure that
costs less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a manner of speaking, I'm in the past, like 5,000 years
ago,'' he says of the ancient healing arts.
</P>
<P>
   But the future will see more alternative medicine for pets,
Haromy says.
</P>
<P>
   The International Veterinarian Acupuncture Society once
attracted just Haromy and one other doctor to an alternative
medicine class. Now the society limits their enrollment each year
to 100 vets.
</P>
<P>
   When animals begin to have surgeries that cost thousands of
dollars, can health insurance be far behind? The numbers are still
small, but some pet owners want to cushion the blow of a major
health problem.
</P>
<P>
   National Casualty Co. in Anaheim, Calif., reports the sale of
more than 850,000 pet health insurance policies since 1980.
Premiums range from $92 to $227 a year for cats and dogs, depending
on the pet's age and the amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And Houghton expects to see more pet insurance policies in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a coming thing,'' he said. ''This equipment
isn't any less expensive for animal use than for human use.''

   Smoking starts in childhood: 89 percent of the adults who smoke
on a daily basis started before they turned 18. Each day more than
3,000 children and teens in the United States try cigarettes for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can't sit on the sidelines and hope for the best. If we
want tobacco-free children, we better start early and come out
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   We need to powerfully reinforce an understanding of the
addictive nature and harmfulness of tobacco because we are
challenged by an industry that has spent billions of dollars on
advertising and promotional programs to influence our children to
have positive attitudes about this drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Great American Smokeout on November 18 is an ideal time for
parents to initiate family communication about tobacco and to
increase the resistance of children and teens to this dangerous
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips to help parents discuss both the dangers of
tobacco and the concept of addiction to children in an
age-appropriate manner. 5- to 8-year olds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even 5- to 8-year-olds can begin to understand a little bit
about the idea of addiction. You can ask your children: ''Did you
ever have the feeling that you couldn't stop yourself from doing
something?'' Bring up eating favorite foods as an example. ''You
know, maybe you had one scoop of ice cream and felt like you just
HAD to have another scoop, and if you took it, sometimes you felt
like you still needed another one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, addiction to cigarettes is a little like that. People
feel as though they can't stop smoking. They always need another
cigarette. The trouble is, this doesn't just cause a little upset
tummy, the way too much ice cream might. Cigarettes are very
unhealthy and can cause all kinds of illnesses, including ones that
kill people.''
 &UR; 9- and 10-year-olds &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With a 9- or 10-year-old you can talk in more detail about
addiction. I like to tell kids that addiction actually means being
a slave. When you are addicted to a drug, you are controlled by the
drug. You need more and more of it.
</P>
<P>
   I let children know that tobacco is one of the toughest
addictions to break. Because it is legally available to adults and
socially accepted, many young people are very surprised to hear
this. They may have heard of cocaine, heroin or speed, and believed
that these were tougher addictions. Tobacco is in the same league
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your children if they have ever seen people ''climb the
walls'' because they needed a cigarette. You could talk about
public places, such as movie theaters where smokers charge to the
door to get their fix at the end of the show. Explain that these
people were uncomfortable because they couldn't smoke for just the
length of the movie _ less than two hours.
 &UR; 11 and 12-year-olds
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 11 or 12, children are able to understand and
discuss the concepts of tolerance and withdrawal that underlie
addiction. For a drug to be physically addictive, it must create
both tolerance in a user and a withdrawal syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance means that a person needs more and more of a drug to
get the same effect. As people begin to use more tobacco, they may
worry about how much they smoke and feel as though they want to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Once addicted, however, it's not easy to pull out. When addicted
individuals stop using a habit-forming drug, such as tobacco, they
will experience a wide range of uncomfortable symptoms during the
withdrawal process.
</P>
<P>
   Children may have seen documentaries or fictional movies that
demonstrate this. They may have seen or heard about ''the shakes''
that occur when alcoholics quit drinking. You can explain that
withdrawal symptoms from tobacco are severe. They vary from person
to person, but typical ones include coughing, sweating, muscle
aches and cramps, nausea, headache, hypersensitivity to physical
stimuli, sleep disturbance and weight gain.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to illustrate tolerance is by referring to a thriller
or adventure movie that children have seen several times.
</P>
<P>
   For example: ''Do you remember the thrill you got the first time
you saw (whatever happens to be the current hit)? When you went
back the second time, did you get the same thrill? How about the
third time? Sometimes drugs are like thriller movies. People want
more of that same feeling, so they keep going back for more. But
they're never satisfied the way they were the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''With drugs, this reaction is called tolerance. A smoker needs
more and more tobacco to feel good when smoking. That's why they
may start by only occasionally smoking a single cigarette or two,
but eventually find themselves smoking a pack or more every day.''
 &UR; The teen years &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By the teen years, all of our tobacco prevention education
should be interactive. That is, it should involve a respectful
dialogue between parents and children. We need to share ideas,
express our thoughts and feelings, and listen to those of our
adolescent children.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange-of-information model is a disciplined way for
parents and teenagers to be rational, even though they are
discussing issues that are emotionally charged.
</P>
<P>
   The model has five parts:
</P>
<P>
   1. Children and parents agree to have a discussion about
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   2. Parents present their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   3. Children present their point of view.
</P>
<P>
   4. They discuss each other's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   5. Parents and children reach an understanding and make
agreements with one another.
</P>
<P>
   When children become adolescents, we can no longer get away with
simply laying down the law. We must involve them in a discussion.
If we discount their thinking, we will find ourselves in power
struggles. The dialogue will come to a grinding halt. When this
happens, we will no longer know what our children are thinking or
doing. We cannot help advance their thinking or influence their
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Another way that parents end the dialogue and lose their
influence is by listening as long as they like what they hear, but
then hitting the roof when they hear something they don't like.
Adolescents respond to this aggressiveness by hiding the truth.
They begin to say only what they believe their parents want to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   The key to effectively influencing the behavior of adolescent
children is to use an educational approach: to create and maintain
dialogue. Adolescents benefit from the adult perspective. Parents
benefit by better understanding their children. Good discussions
increase mutual understanding and can lead to agreements when none
seemed possible. When agreements are made after a thorough
discussion, children feel a sense of ownership in the outcome and
are likely to abide by the terms they helped establish.
 &UR; Parents who are smokers &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Parents who smoke worry that it would be hypocritical to insist
that their children refrain from smoking. Although their children
may accuse them of hypocrisy and embarrass them, their own
discomfort is a secondary issue. It is a primary parenting
responsibility to call for a clear message that tobacco products
are unhealthy and children should not use them.
</P>
<P>
   If you are addicted to nicotine and regret that you smoke, you
can say this to your children. Let them understand what has
happened to you, how it happened and that you hope to spare them
from the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the best thing for all involved is for you to
overcome your own addiction. Sometimes people cannot make difficult
changes for themselves, but can for others. You could channel an
urge to care for your children into something that would be
positive for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Often people try to stop and fail several times before they
finally succeed. But many do succeed. The Great American Smokeout
is a good time to start.

MODEL EVERYDAY DINNERS ON THANKSGIVING CLOSENESS
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURA TAXEL 
 c.1999 magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving is the quintessential family meal. Traditionally
it's a day set aside for the generations and relations to gather
around the table and eat together.
</P>
<P>
   We plan our lives so we can be there. We expect a leisurely meal
of good food and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a special time, but one that many believe should not be
reserved for holidays. Shared mealtimes give parents the
opportunity to oversee what their children are eating, to model
healthy eating habits and at the same time offer emotional
nourishment too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eating is related to the emotional life of the family, or
should be,'' said Dr. Derrick Lonsdale of the Preventive Medicine
Group, an Ohio practice that specializes in nutritional related
problems. ''Shared meals are an essential part of raising healthy
children and a time for the social intercourse of family life,
providing an opportunity to reinforce relationships. I'm convinced
that the fact that most families don't do this on a daily basis is
impacting the well-being of children.''
</P>
<P>
   I've always thought family meals should be a daily event. So,
with the occasional exception, my husband, our sons, and I sit down
and eat together every night, working around a complex schedule of
jobs, classes, meetings, and activities.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy. I'm no June Cleaver. I don't live to make the
guys pot roast and lasagna, day after day, week after week. I work,
I chauffeur, and I know what it's like out there on the front lines
of the fast track. If I don't have time to cook, we may turn to
take-out, but we will still gather round the table to socialize as
we chow down.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever eats alone or in front of the TV; it's simply not
allowed. Some nights we have to make a special effort to wait for
each other. But we do these things because, although it is
difficult to maintain the ritual of the family meal, I'm convinced
that we benefit in many ways. Pediatricians and nutritional experts
agree.
</P>
<P>
   Children's nutritional health depends both on what they eat and
how they eat it. Obviously, their growing bodies need
good-for-you-food. But they also need to have that food in the
company of others.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionist Laurel Mellin, former director of the Center for
Child and Adolescent Obesity at the University of California-San
Francisco School of Medicine, believes that lacking scheduled,
structured mealtimes with the family, children may turn to the
refrigerator for their nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eating together is a sign of family order and closeness,'' she
says. ''When families don't eat together, it often means that
they're not as organized or connected as children need them to
be.'' Writing in The Journal of Pediatric Health Care, Mellin cited
emotional overeating triggered by boredom, loneliness, sadness, and
anger; meal irregularity, and high-fat, fast food diets as factors
related to the dramatic rise in childhood obesity.
</P>
<P>
   With both parents working, there's often no one home to prepare
a meal and anchor the family to a regular meal time. Children who
are home alone after school may snack so much that they have no
appetite for dinner. Older children are on the run from one
activity to another. Tired parents may find it easier if everyone
watches TV during the meal. Fast food has come to describe not only
what most people eat, but also how they eat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's rare that families sit down to eat dinner
together nowadays,'' said Joanne Lane, a registered dietitian in
private practice. ''It's a lost tradition that's creating bad
eating habits. Many convenience foods are high in fat, salt, and
sugar. Because they're quick, they encourage eating fast and in
isolation. Family members routinely skip meals, or grab food on the
run.
</P>
<P>
   ''And of course when family members aren't eating together every
day, it can't help but lead to diminished communication between
parents and children.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a working parent,'' she adds. ''The hardest thing was
figuring out what to make so I pre-planned menus, prepared food
days in advance, cooked two dinners at once and froze one, and used
the crock pot often. I'd balance takeout food like pizza with green
salads, fresh fruits and vegetables.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating meals as a family is no guarantee that children won't
suffer from obesity or experience other diet-related problems. A
dinner hour for the family does not necessarily mean that everyone
will stay in touch. But the practice goes a long way towards
helping.
</P>
<P>
   Because the dinner table may be the first and only time in the
day that the whole family gets together, it's important that it be
an occasion for socializing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let it be a time to discipline, argue, issue ultimatums,
nag about table manners, or for kids to tattle on one another,''
says Dr. Robert Mendelson, an Oregon pediatrician with more than 30
years experience and one-time spokesperson for The American Academy
of Pediatrics. ''Make it a what-did-you-do-today time. Give
everyone a chance to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating dinner together, once so typical an event it didn't even
warrant discussion, is increasingly uncommon. The changes in how
families function are here to stay. We can't go back to the world
of the '50s, so we need some new, creative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell busy parents that if it can't be every day, than at
least they should pick some days of the week when the family will
convene around the dinner table,'' said Ellen Caspaer, Ph.D., a
psychologist in family practice. ''If it can't be dinner, try
breakfasts. But make the commitment because shared meals in a
family are about much more than just eating.''
</P>
<P>
   So when your family sits down to Thanksgiving dinner this year,
think about how you can make that celebration a part of your
children's life, each and every day.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to help you:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Make dinner a scheduled family gathering. Parents must
plan their time around this event. If they make it a priority in
their lives, children will too. If it can't be every night, then
designate certain days as family meal days and protect that time
from any distractions.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Make the meal hassle-free, an occasion for relaxed,
positive contact between family members. Offer healthy, balanced
choices, but don't focus on who eats how much of what. If you set a
good example, the kids will eventually follow your lead.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)If younger children need to eat earlier, or older
children need to eat separately because of unavoidable commitments
that conflict with the dinner hour, their mealtimes need to be a
social time too. They shouldn't eat alone. Someone should sit down
with each family member when they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Younger children can still come to the table and join in the
family time too, having a before bedtime snack or something to
drink.

BILL CLINTON'S LONG GOODBYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now begins the end.
</P>
<P>
   With the next presidential election now officially less than a
year away, Bill Clinton is embarking on a long farewell. He may
have goals for his last year in office, but he has little real hope
of achieving them. He may send proposals to Capitol Hill, but he
has little real hope of signing them into law. He may have dreams
of putting final touches on his legacy, but he has little real hope
of giving new shape to how historians will view his eight years in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eighth year is not a productive time,'' says George C.
Edwards, director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A
&AMP; M University. ``Everybody does not put politics aside and come
together for the common good in the eighth year. Believing in that
is like believing in the tooth fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, Bill Clinton _ dreamer, policy wonk, master of the
10-part program _ can set a foundation for a future in which he
will not play a part. But this final year of his presidency will
pose special challenges and present special impediments to success.
</P>
<P>
   Eight full years in the White House is a rare phenomenon: Since
mid-century, only three men, Eisenhower (1953-1961), Reagan
(1981-1989), and Clinton will have done it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his two GOP predecessors, Clinton doesn't enter his last
year mired in fatigue. Clinton is a young man at 53, compared with
Eisenhower, 69, and Reagan, 76, when they began their eighth years.
Clinton still has fresh ideas, fresh approaches, fresh interests.
Many of his priorities, especially expanded health insurance,
remain unrealized.
</P>
<P>
   But he faces formidable obstacles. Many presidents are eased off
the stage, often by their vice presidents. ``I'm in the seventh
year of my vice presidency,'' Al Gore told a New Hampshire teenager
the other day, ``and I'm ready to graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Eisenhower watched Richard Nixon win the 1960 Republican
nomination and then lose the White House to US Senator John F.
Kennedy of Massachusetts; Reagan watched his vice president, George
Bush, become the 1988 GOP nominee and defeat Governor Michael S.
Dukakis of Massachusetts for the presidency. Clinton is being
overshadowed not only by Al Gore, who is in an unexpectedly heated
race with Bill Bradley, the former US senator from New Jersey, for
the Democratic nomination, but he is also being challenged in the
spotlight by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who almost certainly
will be campaigning for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know as I've ever seen anyone who looks as
marginalized as Clinton does,'' says Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at the Claremont Graduate University in
California. ``He's a political hologram: He's there but he's not
really there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton's prospects are weakened by a daunting
combination of factors that shape his time and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   He presides over a government divided by party, with the
Democrats holding the White House and the Republicans controlling
Capitol Hill. He's the first impeached president in 131 years,
eroding his moral authority and making the ``bully pulpit'' harder
to ascend in his final months than it otherwise might be. And the
absence of the kind of tensions spawned by the Cold War make it
unlikely that the nation will rally around the president as it did
so many times when the United States and the old Soviet Union stood
face to face with their antagonisms _ and their nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When historians look back at the Clinton presidency, they will
see that he tried to do a host of things and argued on their behalf
_ but in most cases was unsuccessful,'' says Robert Schmuhl,
chairman of the American studies department at the University of
Notre Dame. ``His last year would probably be little different.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that these low expectations might provide him with
an opening for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still lots of balls in the air over there _ deals
Congress may want to cut to have a record to run on, peace treaties
in the Middle East and Ireland,'' said Mike McCurry, who served as
press secretary in the Clinton White House. ``A few little things
and he'll look great by comparison with the other eight-year
presidents. One of the reasons may be that Clinton never had a
second term. He's been dragging a ball and chain around for most of
the second term, so in some ways he's just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the precedents are exceedingly discouraging. Eisenhower
entered his last year in the wake of a recession and a disastrous
set of midterm congressional elections in which the Democratic
margins grew to 63-35 in the Senate and 280-153 in the House. The
Congressional Quarterly annual assessment for 1960 called the year
a time of ``indifferent accomplishment and spirited partisanship.''
So little was at stake that the Congress adjourned nine minutes
before midnight Sept. 1. ``Weighed against the slim fruits of the
1960 session were acres of unharvested production, blighted by the
rust of political schism,'' concluded the editors of the quarterly,
which is respected for being rigorously nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   The only important achievement of the year was the 1960 civil
rights bill, which passed after two months of petty debate and is
remembered chiefly for the role played by Lyndon B. Johnson, which
adumbrated Johnson's later role as a presidential advocate for
aggressive civil rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower tried but failed to win authority to raise interest
rates on government bonds. He tried but failed to win a boost in
the federal gas tax. Major school-aid programs stalled on Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan did little better in 1988, when the nation was still
reeling from a stock market crash and when the Republicans, who had
controlled the Senate for the first six years of his presidency,
were still settling uneasily into their role as the minority in the
chamber. The administration, moreover, was still suffering from
repercussions from the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In Reagan's last year, Washington took a tentative step on
overhauling welfare, approved an expansion of Medicare, and
ratified an arms accord with the Soviet Union, but overall left few
footprints in the capital or the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there wasn't a lot to do _ then or now.
</P>
<P>
   The president flew to Norway early this month in the hope of
pushing Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, toward new steps in the peace process. His
special envoy, former Democratic senator George Mitchell of Maine,
still toils to establish peace in Ireland. Major economic questions
remain unresolved in Washington, including how to use the budget
surplus, whether taxes need to be lower (or flatter), how to shore
up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In his last year, the president must decide whether to reappoint
Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank. Greenspan's
term expires in June and he can stay until the Senate confirms his
successor. Already Democrats are pressing Clinton to appoint Robert
Rubin, but Republicans believe that the former treasury secretary
is ``too political'' and are prepared to argue that the question
should wait until the next president is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The country still hasn't decided how it's going to improve the
schools, preserve the environment, care for the sick, and cure its
manifold social ills. That's probably what elections are for. It's
probably not what ends-of-presidencies are for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Administrations run out of steam and they run out of political
capital by the time they get to the eighth year,'' says Edwards,
the Texas A &AMP; M political scientist. ``It's wonderful to talk about
a `legacy year,' but there is very little chance that there will be
much legacy from the last year. The conditions for a legacy item,
like major reform of Social Security, just are not there.''

SALVADOR ON A BRUTAL ANNIVERSARY

<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``The Spirit breathes in many ways, and supreme among
them is the disposition to give one's life for others, whether by
tireless daily commitment or by the sacrifice of a violent
death.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   --Reverend IGNACIO ELLACURIA, S.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rector, University of Central America &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celina Ramos would be 25. A raven-haired university student
perhaps. Or a social worker. Or a mother.
</P>
<P>
   But Celina Ramos was shot to death, along with her mother, Elba,
10 years ago (Nov. 15), on the same night and on the same campus
where six Jesuit priests were murdered by right-wing Salvadoran
terrorists, at the University of Central America in San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of the brutal killing, which ultimately shocked
the US Congress into shutting off military aid to El Salvador's
ruling oligarchy, will be remembered with a candlelight procession
and all-night vigil near the university garden where the six
elderly priests were shot, each in the head. After the killings,
Celina Ramos's stepfather, Obdulio, who still works as a gardener
for the university, planted commemorative rose bushes in the
blood-drenched soil. His wife had been a housekeeper on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary will also be marked by forums on liberation
theology, with a special look at the writings of the six priests,
rector Ignacio Ellacuria, Ignacio Martin-Baro, Juan Ramon Moreno,
Amando Lopez, Segundo Montes, and Joaquin Lopez y Lopez. All were
university faculty. An anthology of their writings has been
published, titled ``Companions of Jesus: the Jesuit Martyrs of El
Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   What was gained by their martyrdom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is cloudy, although the peace agreement three years
later, in 1992, between warring factions in the 12-year civil war
continues to hold. Presidential elections in March _ which retained
the right-wing Arena Party in power, but gave the now fragmented
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, one-third of
the National Assembly seats and many local mayoralties _ were
relatively free of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of bloodshed are still strong on both sides. And the
Arena Party is cognizant that economic growth cannot occur in a
nation paralyzed by militias.
</P>
<P>
   El Salvador's current business boom (the country has one of the
highest credit ratings in the Western Hemisphere) is largely fueled
by the $1.2 billion sent back home each year by the 1 million
Salvadorans who have emigrated to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But along with money orders, the United States has introduced
Salvadorans to another huge export: crime.
</P>
<P>
   From the slums of East Los Angeles, Salvadoran youths have
mastered gang violence. They are called ``Las Maras.'' Transported
back to Central America, the gangs' crime has grown amid the
plethora of weapons shipped there by the United States during the
civil war. Maras graffiti _ the letters MS _ is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the annual murder rate is 150 per 100,000 people,
among the highest in Latin America, and 12 times the rate of New
York City.

   Saddled with one of the densest populations in Latin America
(708 people per square mile), El Salvador is struggling to set firm
feet on a slope of prosperity. There are always coffee exports, and
there is some industrialization, although many factory jobs have
been lost to Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any pattern of self-sustaining growth?'' says Robert
White, former US ambassador to El Salvador who was recalled in 1981
by President Reagan for decrying US support for the right-wing
militia. White, now president of the Center for International
Policy in Washington, does not have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Class divisions are still sharp. True to its history, the rich
grow richer and the poor remain poor. Some 60 percent of
Salvadorans have little access to health care. More than 30 percent
do not have safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the class truce continues. There is none of
the violence of a decade ago, no attacks on San Salvador's wealthy
quarter of San Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   White says, ``The rich in El Salvador could tolerate violence in
the barrios of the poor, but not seeing their Mercedes used for
target practice.''

A CENTURY IN THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the 20th century been worth it? Has the pursuit of harsh
reality instead of Platonic beauty, an acceptance of disorder
instead of a search for order, been an invigorating trip or a road
to nowhere? Whatever you make of it, the 20th century is our time,
and unless you have sealed yourself off in a monastery (in which
case you're not reading this), it is the time we have to come to
grips with as millennium madness says goodbye to Modernism and
hello to who-knows-whatism.
</P>
<P>
   The history of art in the 20th century can be broadly described
as the movement from Romanticism to Modernism, from thinking of
humanity as being on a quest for spiritual meaning to a species at
the nihilistic mercy of a Godot (or God) who is either silent or
nonexistent. What unites the modernists of the late 19th and the
20th centuries _ from Fyodor Dostoevsky, Karl Marx, and Charles
Baudelaire to city-builder Robert Moses _ is, says author Marshall
Berman, that ``They are moved at once by a will to change _ to
transform both themselves and their world _ and by a terror of
disorientation and disintegration, of life falling apart. They all
know the thrill and the dread of a world in which `All that is
solid melts into air' '' (the title of Berman's 1982 book).
</P>
<P>
   That ``disorientation'' is felt by the audience as well, trying
to keep up with the growing non-narrative abstraction of artists in
the shadow of Freud, Darwin, and Nietzsche; the streams of
consciousness of James Joyce and Virginia Woolf; the Surrealism of
Eugene Ionesco and Samuel Beckett; the serialism of Arnold
Schoenberg and Alban Berg; the Abstract Expressionism of Jackson
Pollock and Willem de Kooning.
</P>
<P>
   These were, of course, only the most radical exponents of their
idioms, and one could assemble a less severe list of Iris Murdoch,
August Wilson, Igor Stravinsky, and Pablo Picasso. Nevertheless,
all these artists embody that same sense of disorientation with the
world. And as musicians and painters, in particular, retreated into
the academies, the door was left open for a more democratic,
electronic, accessible, and _ let's be honest _ more exciting
avenue of expression: popular art.

   Marshall McLuhan predicted the growing supremacy of the
plugged-in artists of music and movies. As the 1960s took form,
with help from McLuhan, poetry on the page seemed sleepy next to
Bob Dylan's folk-rock lyricism; theater was decidedly low-tech and
nonvisceral next to a Martin Scorsese film; and even television
series like England's ``The Prisoner'' seemed to capture the times
as well as any novel.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their latter-day counterparts _ Prince or Ani DiFranco,
David Lynch or ``The X-Files'' _ have advanced the form or not,
there is a growing sense of the limitations of pop culture today.
As playwright Craig Lucas said in a letter to the New York Times
Arts section Sunday, ``As for our supposed competition, can
somebody tell me what is the burning passion behind David E.
Kelley's `vision,' or the deeper messages in Quentin Tarantino's
pop-culture slaughterfests? So many movies praised for their
supposed engagement with serious issues strike at least one viewer
as being thoroughly predigested and uninspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lucas's letter goes beyond theatrical or generational whining
and strikes a chord about the shallowness of popular art, there is
an even greater lament about the legacy of abstract art. Getting
beyond the polemics about the recent Brooklyn Museum of Art's
recent exhibit, ``Sensation'' stands as a touchstone for the debate
about abstract and conceptual art. Glenn D. Lowry, director of New
York's Museum of Modern Art, came to the defense of contemporary
art with an op-ed piece in the Times: ``Art is a language, a means
of communicating deeply held ideas and beliefs, and to dismiss that
which we do not like because we do not understand it makes no more
sense than ignoring German or Chinese literature because we cannot
read German or Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that what appreciating art has come to? That it is as
difficult to comprehend as a foreign language? True, it takes some
time and intelligence to deal with the language of Shakespeare or
Melville; it helps to know the origins of Impressionism to
appreciate van Gogh or Monet; and everyone knows that Stravinsky's
``The Rite of Spring'' caused a riot in 1913. Still, one does not
need to learn a new language, verbal or tonal, to sense what the
artist is trying to convey. It may be that pop culture has devalued
art to the point where we want everything instantly accessible; but
perhaps the elite cult of inacessibility has been even more
damaging _ and may have even paved the way for the supremacy of pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction to the 10-CD retrospective of composer John
Adams, the president of Nonesuch, Robert Hurwitz, recounts a story
that's emblematic of the way many have come to think about art in
the 20th century. He had been hired in the 1970s to write the liner
notes for ultracerebral composer Elliott Carter's Pulitzer
Prize-winning String Quartet No. 3. He took great pride in making
all the intellectual and structural connections, and greatly
admired the music, but has not had any interest in listening to the
piece since:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge gap between what the music was supposed to be
saying, and my gut response to it. Should you have to convince
yourself to like a piece of music _ music to be admired but not
listened to? (In 1999 it is possible to talk about this, but in
1974, if you were a composer, musician, or critic . . . you
couldn't even think this way.'')
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Nonesuch points a way to how we, at the end of the
century, can look at art in all its incarnations. For want of a
better term, call it Eclecticism. Not a nonjudgmental,
Madonna-is-equal-to-Faulkner Eclecticism, but perhaps less of a
polarized art world: one where one can render unto Carter what is
Carter's and unto Adams what is Adams's, along with a healthy
respect for jazz, world music, Mozart, Broadway . . .
</P>
<P>
   Is it not possible to lose oneself in the surrealism of Salvador
Dali one week and the rejection of that world in Winslow Homer the
next? Don't a nonrepresentational novel like Salman Rushdie's ``The
Ground Beneath Her Feet'' and Michael Frayn's more realistic
``Headlong'' both tell us important things about the unbearable
lightness of being? And one probably could make as much of a case
for a David E. Kelley vision as a Craig Lucas world view.
</P>
<P>
   The Modernism of the 20th century is exhausted; what will take
its place in the 21st is impossible to see. This doesn't seem like
the time for manifestos _ this transition calls for synthesis more
than a new thesis.

DISGRACE 
By J.M. Coetzee. Viking. 
220 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Great subjects do not necessarily lend themselves to great
literature. When history eclipses the imagination, the writer must
overcome the force of the external rather than embrace it;
otherwise, what you have is a tract instead of a novel. Tolstoy got
around this problem _ one where the world is too much with us _ by
expanding the parameters of realism; Faulkner, by concentrating on
his postage stamp of invention called Yoknapatawpha. Writers of
modern South Africa have been faced with a peculiar kind of
challenge. The state-sanctioned iniquities of apartheid made
literature itself seem suspect, a weapon in the language of the
oppressor that, even in the right hands, couldn't promise to build
a house, feed a family, or save an innocent life.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the finest novelists of contemporary South Africa, J.
M. Coetzee has both confronted and evaded this tyrannical reality
of his homeland. In ``Waiting for the Barbarians'' and ``The Life
and Times of Michael K,'' he dealt allegorically with the moral
consequences of racial inhumanity; in ``Foe'' and ``The Master of
Petersburg,'' he turned to the creative process _ to the world of
Daniel Defoe and Dostoyevsky _ for his inspiration. Now faced with
the chaos and overt suffering of a post-apartheid state, he has
written a small but bracing novel in ``Disgrace'' _ the story of a
self-centered, middle-aged white man, a former professor whose
downfall is of his own making as well as his only possible
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   In October ``Disgrace'' was awarded England's coveted Booker
Prize (the second for Coetzee, after ``The Life and Times of
Michael K''), and it's tempting to speculate why: The novel is
tightly, forcefully realized, and about as morally and politically
germane as it's possible to be these days. But it isn't Coetzee's
best work. Next to the piercing beauty of the prose in ``Waiting
for the Barbarians,'' this is a slightly drab story; next to the
wrenching suffering of ``Michael K,'' the troubles of ``Disgrace''
feel desultory and sometimes bitter. What the novel does accomplish
is the evocation of a suffocating milieu where any action is
compromised _ where history's mark, when cruel enough, cannot be
undone by the mere gestures of love or mercy.
</P>
<P>
   David Lurie is a familiar anti-hero of contemporary Western
fiction; his solipsism even feels slightly American, though he
lives in Cape Town. Twice-divorced, 52, the father of a grown
daughter, he's languishing at Cape Technical University teaching
communications skills; his old department, classics and modern
languages, has been disbanded in the post-apartheid order. Though
his heart belongs to Wordsworth and Byron, he now spends his time
teaching indifferent students about punctuation and inductive
reasoning. For his own untended fires, he visits women from
Discreet Escorts, until a chance encounter with a female student 30
years his junior charts the beginning of his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Exposed almost immediately for their brief and disastrous
affair, Lurie is hardly repentant; he provokes the academic
committee investigating his impropriety, and eventually resigns his
position in the midst of scandal. Clutching what's left of his
pension and his reputation, he sets out for the Eastern Cape, where
his daughter, Lucy, works a small farm. A gentle, plain woman in
her mid-20s, Lucy has chosen a vastly different life from that of
her father; she loves women, keeps a boarding kennel of dogs;
shares the upkeep of the land with an older, black African named
Petrus. It's symptomatic of Lurie's lack of power over his daughter
that she refers to him only as ``David''; though she treats him
with respect and affection, it's also clear from the moment of his
arrival that Lurie's intellectual tools _ his scholarly pursuits,
his interminable irony _ are worse than useless here.
</P>
<P>
   Then one morning, everything changes. Three young black men
approach from nowhere, asking to use the phone. Cautious but afraid
of her own suspicion, Lucy kennels the Dobermans who might have
protected her. And the next few hours are what Lurie thinks of as
``not human evil, just a vast circulatory system, to whose workings
pity and terror are irrelevant.'' Lurie and his daughter get away
with their lives, but not much else; undone by violation, they have
also lost the link between them of mutual understanding. He carries
the burden of having failed to protect his daughter; she, the
larger and less personal weight of history _ of being a white woman
alone in a land of vengeful reclamation. The refuge afforded each
of them in the past abandons them now: Her dogs are gone, her good
will is but a naive intangible, and Lurie's beloved Byron _
scalawag that he was _ goes the way of the dustheap of history.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding that takes place from this pivotal moment in
``Disgrace'' is the agonizing point of the story, one with more
endurance than hope. Petrus, who had disappeared the day of the
attack, understands what has happened to Lurie and Lucy; neither
friend nor enemy, he is instead an impenetrable witness to history.
Like the magistrate of ``Waiting for the Barbarians'' and the title
character of ``Michael K,'' Lurie must undergo a transformation of
self _ the old bundle of defenses and demands he once thought of as
character has managed to rob him of humility and blind him to
decency. Crawling rather than ascending from the ashes, he emerges
clinging to his love for Lucy _ larger than any of his life's
possessions, and certainly the only one that will last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disgrace'' is a relentlessly bleak novel; some of it is also
predictable. Faced with the heartless byproducts of a brutal piece
of history, Coetzee has delivered this story with a familiar
mastery, but the voice here is austere _ as Lurie conceives of it,
English itself has become ``an unfit medium'': ``Like a dinosaur
expiring and settling in the mud, the language has stiffened.''
However apt or powerful this observation, its application does not
lift ``Disgrace'' into the splendid stylistic realm that ``Waiting
for the Barbarians'' inhabited. David Lurie, teacher of the
Romantics, turns away from the old pathways of aesthetic retreat;
as if imposing similar penance on himself, Coetzee has relinquished
beauty for something with the cold weight of steel.
</P>
<P>
   At moments, the moral conceit of ``Disgrace'' seems reminiscent
of the world invoked by William Trevor _ a lightless place where
grace is never promised but not forgotten, either. And yet there's
something too simplistically harsh about this novel, as though the
form itself must suffer under the scourge of South Africa.
Dis-graced and dismantled, Lurie will find his only chance at
redemption through the sacrificial act of honoring the dead. His
work is to grasp that the fires of passion, so seductive and
elusive to him in theory, still go on burning, burning, in the
light of day.

WHY AMERICANS WOULD RATHER DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With glittering pomp and ancient ceremony, Nicholas II was
crowned czar of All the Russias on Massachusetts Avenue, just past
Symphony Hall near Boston's South End. There was some tension
between the young czar's widowed mother and his new wife,
Alexandra. But how it was resolved I won't know until I get in the
car to go home this evening and resume listening to my current
book-on-tape, Robert K. Massie's moving account of the last years
of the Romanov dynasty, ``Nicholas and Alexandra.''
</P>
<P>
   My daily commute to and from work generally takes about 25
minutes. Traffic and weather sometimes conspire to make it last 45
minutes or more. But if I've got a good book to listen to, a
prolonged commute doesn't upset me. In fact, I don't mind my
solitary drive at all _ I rather like it.
</P>
<P>
   And I am far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide survey of drivers conducted for American
Demographics, fully 45 percent agreed that ``driving is my time to
think and enjoy being alone.'' Only 30 percent disagreed; the
remainder were neutral. This is an issue with no gender gap: A
preponderance of both men and women say they like their drive time.
The sentiment holds up across income lines, too. Only among drivers
older than 55 is the number who don't enjoy commuting greater than
the number who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time they spend sitting in their cars . . . offers many
drivers a rare space over which they have total control,'' writes
Alan Sipress in his Washington Post story on the American
Demographics survey, ``a breather amid the breathless pace of work
and home, phones, and the Internet.'' The story cites other
evidence, assembled by scholars at the Brookings Institution and
the American Enterprise Institute, confirming that ``motorists are
far less negative about the time they spend in the car than experts
had previously believed.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hardly takes think tanks and scholars to demonstrate that
Americans generally like to drive themselves to work. For decades
we have been bombarded with demands that we get out of our cars and
into mass transit. We've been told that cars are bad for the
environment and bad for communities. We've been hit with heavy
gasoline taxes and we often hear demands that they be made even
heavier. We've been forced to deal with hurdles that make commuting
alone, and driving in general, more difficult, from speed traps to
carpool lanes to crumbling highways to the maddening ineptness of
motor vehicle bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we drive. Only 5 percent of commuters take mass
transit to work. And the number has been dropping. While the use of
cars (including light trucks, such as pickups and SUVs) has soared
more than 85 percent since 1970, the use of mass transit _ buses,
subways, trolleys, commuter trains _ has dropped by 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today transit represents barely 1 percent of the nation's
surface passenger travel,'' says Wendell Cox, a transportation
analyst, whose invaluable ``Urban Transport Fact Book'' can be
found at www.publicpurpose.com. ``During the 1980s, transit's work
trip market share declined in all but two of the 39 largest
metropolitan areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually without exception, every time a city builds or expands
a subway system, the percentage of commuters using public transit
declines. At a cost of more than $10 billion, Washington, D.C.,
built a gorgeous metrorail network in the 1970s and '80s. It now
carries a smaller proportion of the region's commuters than the old
bus and streetcar system did 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are not being obstinate. It makes sense to prefer
private cars to public trains and buses. Cars and highways are
available 24 hours a day. They go virtually everywhere, no small
consideration in a nation with widely dispersed population centers.
They sharply reduce travel time _ nationwide, the average mass
transit commute takes 42 minutes, while the average commuter
driving to work makes it in only 20. And without question, cars and
highways are safer: Fatality rates are notably lower for cars and
highways _ especially interstate highways _ than for most forms of
mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a ``love affair'' with cars that keeps Americans behind
the wheel. It is the freedom, flexibility, and efficiency that
automobiles provide. Nor is this an American phenomenon. Anywhere
people have the choice, they choose to drive. In Europe, where
gasoline frequently costs upwards of $4 a gallon, automobile use
has risen steadily for decades. Since the liberation of East
Germany in 1989, the share of riders using mass transit has been
halved; the share using cars now equals that in the former West
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you call a system that 85 percent of workers _ 100
million people _ use every day?'' asks Cox. ``You call it mass
transit. It is the automobiles on our highway system. We have
already made the capital investment. We already own the vehicles.
All we need to do is use what we've got better.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticar propagandists need to face reality: Americans, with
reason, would rather drive. Subways and commuter trains, no matter
how much is spent to subsidize them, will never account for more
than a minuscule fraction of commuter trips. We have far more mass
transit than we need, but not nearly enough highway lanes. It is
time to start spending the money where it's needed, and to make
drivers, not straphangers, our top transportation priority.

BIG EAST BECOMING BIG NATIONALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY VAN HANDLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the time Louisiana Tech carried off the first trophy until
just over a dozen years later, the roll call of NCAA women's
basketball champions was a virtual geographical cornucopia of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   From Southern Cal to Old Dominion to Texas to Stanford to Texas
Tech to North Carolina, every region in the country was represented
_ except one.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Northeast gained its first national title when the
University of Connecticut broke through in 1995, the Huskies'
success still was considered a curiosity. After all, order was
restored the next three years when Tennessee of the mighty
Southeastern Conference won three straight times before ceding last
season to Purdue of the equally intimidating Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Even after UConn became one of the sport's glamour teams, the
Big East often was viewed as a one-team league. Show us more, the
world of women's basketball seemed to be saying.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, when Notre Dame went to the Final Four, and 1998,
when four Big East teams went to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And until last season, when the conference kept its Four on the
Floor until the third round. And this year, when the same Gang of
Four are consensus Top 20 preseason selections.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East is no longer the Big Easy.
</P>
<P>
   It has been far from an overnight process, the establishment of
the Big East as a force in collegiate women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the conference didn't get the respect it deserved,''
said Doris Burke, who starred at Providence in the mid 1980s.
``There was parity among the teams, beating each other up among the
round-robin format of the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but that didn't translate into NCAA success. For the
tourney's first eight years, the Big East was known as a ``one and
done'' league. Only three times had a conference team won so much
as a first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, an aggressive former Virginia assistant took UConn
to its first Final Four. The women's basketball establishment was
shocked when Geno Auriemma and the Huskies nearly upset Virginia in
the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn caught lightning in a bottle in 1991,'' said longtime
Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter Mel Greenberg and the originator
of the national women's poll in 1976. ``They got some breaks, such
as when a higher-seeded team lost, but they certainly enhanced the
coverage of the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something of a surprise when UConn made it,'' said Doug
Herakovich, publisher of the North Carolina-based Women's
Basketball Journal, which has circulation nationwide. ``They raised
the bar in the Big East. Geno Auriemma came on the scene and proved
you can build a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' first taste of national publicity coincided with
Rebecca Lobo's senior year of high school in nearby Southwick,
Mass. UConn's success made it easy for the highly touted scholastic
star not to stray too far from home to attend college. Thus,
Auriemma had his first blue-chip recruit and four years later, Lobo
and UConn were national champions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Huskies' popularity captivated the national
media, UConn still had little company at the top of its conference.
Essentially, UConn was the Big East, and from its bully pulpit
swatted away any league competition, losing only twice from
1995-98. The Huskies' success didn't help the Big East as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``UConn carried the baton, so to speak, for the entire Big
East,'' said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, the Huskies had company. A year after losing in
overtime in the national semifinals to eventual champion Tennessee,
UConn watched the Final Four on television. Notre Dame, in only its
second year in the conference, became the latest Big East team to
fall to the Lady Vols.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two significant coaching hires before the Irish's
success laid the foundation for last season. Rutgers, also a
conference add-on in 1995, hired C. Vivian Stringer (12 years at
Big Ten Iowa, a Final Four in 1993). Two seasons earlier, a
somnambulant Boston College gave Cathy Inglese (back-to-back
perfect records at Vermont) a chance to awaken its program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having grown up in New England and coached here, I knew it was
a premier conference,'' said Inglese. ``I wanted to get it to
become a bigger and better conference, more than just one team.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Generally, coaching has been the most important factor in the
rise of the Big East. If the conference is to continue to be
regarded as a major national factor, the coaches will have to
continue to play a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to UConn, a team like that can only help
you,'' said Bill Gibbons, whose Holy Cross team often scheduled Big
East teams in nonconference games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame has their own ambitions,'' said Greenberg.
``Rutgers hired Vivian, who just was not going to take not being
competitive. Cathy was a great hire for BC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is their quality of coaches,'' said Herakovich. ``The
competition is getting tougher and tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with game strategy and preparation, coaches must also
recruit and serve another, equally important though often
overlooked function, according to Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches in the SEC are constantly touting their conference
to the media,'' said Burke, who is a commentator for college games
and also for the WNBA's New York Liberty. ``The rest of the coaches
at other conferences like the Big East should do that as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions as to the Big East's rank among the nation's
conferences vary anywhere from Herakovich's No. 3 (1 and 2 being
the SEC and Big 12) to top four to top half-dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The Ratings Percentage Index, used by the NCAA to select and
seed teams for the NCAA tournament, is perhaps the most accurate
measure. Last season, the Collegiate Basketball News's RPI rated
the Big East seventh; in its four years ranking teams, the
publication placed the Big East anywhere from sixth to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while it appears the upper third of the league is in
terrific shape, work remains to make the Big East one of the
nation's elite conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big East used to have a terrible bottom portion,'' said
Greenberg. ``Not anymore. They play other conferences and hold
their own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of how the schools (under the top echelon)
will turn it around,'' said Burke. ``It'll be a key for schools
like Villanova and Providence to break through. How they'll do it,
I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff builds on itself,'' said Herakovich. ``BC can
sell that you can play UConn and be on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC and its yearly quota of six or seven NCAA tournament
teams might laugh at such a seemingly picayune recruiting tool, but
the Big East doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all four teams winning a game, that attracts attention
and notoriety,'' said Inglese. ``Name recognition is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Greenberg said: ``People know who the Big East is now.''

BC EAGLES GETTING RESPECT EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Cathy Inglese can't get far without passing by the
photo, which at 28x40 inches not including frame looms almost as
large on the wall outside her Boston College office as it does in
the history of the women's basketball program. In it, the
scoreboard (5:52 left in the first half, Eagles 31, Huskies 19);
the Conte Forum crowd (8,606, a full house); the ball arcing toward
guard Alissa Murphy (32 points, a career high). All combining to
hint at the triumphs and turning points to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just demonstrates what last season was all about,'' said
Inglese last week. ``It was a special year.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, BC's magical 78-66 upset of the second-ranked
University of Connecticut was the cornerstone for the most
successful season in school history, in which the Eagles would
crack the Top 25 for the first time, finish 22-8 and make their
first trip to the NCAA tournament. But it was the second-round
tournament game against powerhouse Tennessee, in which BC came out
aggressively and led for most of the first half before losing,
89-62, that laid the foundation for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed us we belonged,'' said returning guard Cal Bouchard.
</P>
<P>
   No one is arguing. As the 1999-2000 season begins Monday night
(Nov. 15) with a tough matchup against Maine (24-7 last season),
Boston College is ranked as high as 15th in one preseason poll, and
comes in at 19 _ ahead of recent Final Four teams Duke, Purdue, and
North Carolina State _ in the benchmark Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never started the season that way,'' said Inglese.
``Last year, I thought we were a good team entering the season, but
people didn't know about us.'' After three successive campaigns of
18-10, 17-11, and 22-8, said the coach, ``This year would be a good
year to show people we're here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles certainly won't be sneaking up on anybody. Although
they've lost center Whitney Steele, who was second high-scorer a
year ago with 11.3 points a game, BC returns four starters and
senior captain Bouchard, the feisty guard who was sidelined for the
second half of last season when she went down Jan. 10 with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want so badly to make it (back to the NCAAs) for her,'' said
Inglese, still pained that the soul of her squad missed out on much
of last season's excitement. ``She was one of the kids who turned
the program around.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bouchard in the backcourt will be senior Murphy, who led
the team last year with 16 points a game to earn the Big East Most
Improved Player Award, and sophomore Brianne Stepherson of
Masconomet High School, who by year's end had taken charge at point
guard. Sophomore Nicole Conway, who started 17 games last year,
will be first off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any benefit to Bouchard's injury, it was the
emergence of Murphy, who quickly stepped into a leadership role
while averaging 37.7 minutes a game. Now, said Inglese, ``We've got
two great go-to players. Whoever takes the last shot, I feel
totally confident.''
</P>
<P>
   In the frontcourt, Jamie Cournoyer is the leading candidate to
replace Steele at center. The 6-foot, 3-inch junior out of North
Attleboro High School started six of the final seven games of the
season, and scored a career-high 16 points in the tournament loss
to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jamie is ready to do some damage,'' said Inglese.
</P>
<P>
   Joining her will be hard-nosed sophomore Becky Gottstein, who
led the team in rebounding with 7.1 a game and was third in scoring
with 10.4 points as a freshman surprise who earned Big East rookie
of the week honors six times. Freshman Maureen Magarity, a 6-2
forward out of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., who is good in the low post,
should see some action.
</P>
<P>
   Also making its debut in the lineup: pressure. Last year, 20
wins was a milestone; the NCAA bid, historic. This year, the bar
has been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year we're going to have to deal with
(outside) expectations,'' said Inglese. ``Before, they were just
ours. We've gotten the attention now, you don't want to let anybody
down. But you have to put it in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In that, she brings experience. When Inglese came to BC in 1993,
it was following back-to-back seasons at the University of Vermont
in which the Catamounts took records of 29-0 and 28-0 into the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way to handle that is the same way I handled it in
Vermont after the first undefeated season, in that you really try
to keep it focused internally,'' said Inglese. ``You play to reach
your own goals. If you do that, everything externally will take
care of itself. That's going to be important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her players seem to be taking in it stride. ``I'm actually not
nervous about it,'' said Bouchard. `Yeah, there are expectations.
But we always had them of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' schedule is neither easy nor ideal. Starting with
the trip to Maine, which beat Stanford to advance to the second
round of the NCAAs last spring and is led by the nation's
fourth-leading scorer (24.2 points) in Jamie Cassidy, BC doesn't
seem to get a break. Its games against Big East rivals UConn (Jan.
26), Notre Dame (Feb. 5), and Rutgers (Feb. 23) are all on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   But while there will be no repeat of the picture-perfect rapture
in Conte Forum that erupted after BC vanquished UConn last season,
the confidence it spawned lives on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be something I tell my grandkids,'' said Murphy last
week, reminiscing about the stunning victory. ``I don't think
anything will be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard corrected her. ``Unless,'' she said, ``we go to the
Final Four.''

BRADLEY HAS THE MONEY TO PRESS GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Vice President Al Gore visited Texas a year ago to woo
influential Democrats, he tried fruitlessly to dissuade former
state comptroller John Sharp from signing on with Bill Bradley,
Gore's sole challenger for the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president said to me, `Look, it's impossible for Bill
Bradley to win New Hampshire. Look how far behind he is. And as
vice president, I will raise so much money that Bill Bradley won't
be able to raise money,' '' Sharp recalled last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was wrong on both counts. In New Hampshire, the upstart
Bradley has pulled even with or ahead of President Clinton's heir
apparent in several polls. But more ominously for Gore, Bradley now
appears likely to have several million dollars more to spend than
Gore during the six-week period between Feb. 1 and March 14, when
the nomination is likely to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate may spend the $40.2 million permitted under
federal election law during the primaries. But well before Gore
began to take Bradley seriously, Gore's campaign spent lavishly,
disbursing millions for high-end office space, $15,000-a-month
salaries, expensive travel, and squads of advance staff for every
vice presidential appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the former senator from New Jersey has campaigned
parsimoniously, often traveling with a single aide and carrying his
own garment bag. More recently, Sharp recalled, Bradley arrived in
Texas with two staff members. ``I thought he was getting a little
bit uppity,'' the Texan said.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of Gore's miscalculation are unprecedented in
modern-day presidential politics: When voters start paying close
attention in about 10 weeks' time, Bradley may have between $5
million and $8 million more to spend than Gore over the following
two months, according to Federal Election Commission reports, and
forecasts by independent analysts and officials of the two
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   To a host of politicians who have worked for past insurgent
candidates who soared early only to fall back to earth for lack of
resources, Bradley's financial competitiveness suggests a tectonic
shift in the landscape of presidential campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, challengers like Bill Bradley dry up and blow away
because of the huge advantages incumbent vice presidents have
during the nominating process,'' said Thomas D. Rath, a New
Hampshire Republican who in 1988 backed Senator Bob Dole only to
see his candidate overwhelmed by then-Vice President Bush. ``But
Gore has been wasteful, even profligate, in his spending. Now
Bradley has the capacity to go the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   William G. Carrick, who ran Representative Richard A. Gephardt's
unsuccessful 1988 campaign against the well-financed effort of
Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, said in an interview
that Bradley's ability to compete dollar-for-dollar all but ensures
a drawn-out battle for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   More typically, Carrick said, ``challengers do not really lose
the nomination contest to the front-runner. They simply run out of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom, which a year ago gave Bradley little
chance against Gore, still holds that Gore, with the support of
party leaders and help from labor unions, is likely to prevail over
Bradley in the end, though not without a protracted battle. And in
most national polls, Gore still holds a sizable lead over Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, who is Gore's spokesman, said that much of what
Gore has spent has been invested wisely, in critical field
operations in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and California, and
will produce a bumper crop of convention delegates once voters go
to the polls. And Steve Grossman, a Gore supporter who until
recently was Democratic National chairman, made much the same
point, saying, ``Al Gore may be outspent by Bill Bradley in the
last few months of the campaign. But I don't believe for a
nanosecond that Al Gore will be out-organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Democratic officeholders are withholding their
endorsements. And while the arcane arithmetic of the delegate
allocation process argues against an early knockout, especially by
the challenger, some Democrats believe, and some Gore advisers and
supporters fear, that Bradley may be able to use his husbanded
campaign funds to turn conventional wisdom on its head once more.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory L. Schneiders, a former aide to President Carter who is
neutral in the Bradley-Gore contest, said that if Bradley wins the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, Gore might ``go into a downward
spiral.'' Expressing their own worst fears, two of Gore's advisers
said privately that if Bradley prevails in New Hampshire and can
parlay his money and momentum into victories in the two biggest
primary contests on March 7, California and New York, there could
be a move by party leaders to persuade Gore to abandon his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how Bradley chooses to spend his money, the
challenger could mount advertising campaigns in some states where
Gore may not be able to counter. Or if the struggle drags on, the
Gore campaign may run out of money before Bradley does.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no doubting the fact that Bradley's
fund-raising prowess has reenergized Gore and his campaign. Over
the past several weeks, the vice president has become a more
aggressive campaigner; his headquarters staff has been halved and
salaries have been trimmed. To save even more money, the campaign
even relocated from an expensive downtown Washington office
building to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But, fiscally, much of the damage is done. Said Carrick: ``In
the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992, the kids were sleeping on
floors. But after all those years in the White House, they're not
used to husbanding money. The culture demands that they spend. It's
hard for Al Gore to turn that culture around.''
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, for instance, Gore's campaign is paying top
dollar, $4,200 a month, for a downtown campaign headquarters.
Across town, Bill Bradley's campaign office is so modest, a single
large room for $500 a month, that its walls lack paint.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore now finds Bradley's thriftiness something to
emulate, cutting costs has been difficult. Simply moving a
50-person staff to Nashville costs money. What's more, the Gore
campaign was sufficiently certain early on that Gore would be the
party standard bearer that his campaign is now stuck with a lease
through the year 2000 for the Washington headquarters it has
abandoned. The cost: $59,069 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said the campaign is trying to sublet the space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to reduce expenses. It's much easier to keep them
from growing in the first place,'' Gina Glantz, who is Bradley's
campaign manager, said of her rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Glantz's tightfistedness is also evident:
While the Gore campaign has nine offices across the state,
Bradley's campaign makes do with two. Bradley's operatives even use
cell phones for traditional phone banks. The reason: To save the
$1,000 deposit the phone company demands for each line it installs.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers both campaigns reported to the FEC through Sept. 30
suggest the dimensions of the deficit Gore may face. As of that
date, Gore had outraised Bradley by more than $5 million. But the
vice president's campaign had spent $14.5 million to Bradley's $8.5
million by that point.
</P>
<P>
   That might not matter if Gore had outraised Bradley by 3-to-1 or
4-to-1 as many Democrats had expected. On the GOP side of the
ledger, for instance, Texas Governor George W. Bush had a 6-to-1
fund-raising advantage on Sept. 30 over Senator John McCain of
Arizona, who is considered his most serious challenger.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley matched Gore's fund-raising in the second and third
quarters, and even the Gore staff expects Bradley to outraise the
vice president in the three-month period that ends Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring his ability to raise large amounts of money,
Bradley raised $1.5 million Sunday at a Madison Square Garden
fund-raiser that featured some of the basketball stars he played
with during his career with the New York Knicks. Last week, the
Bradley campaign surpassed $1 million in donations raised from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With Bradley now expected to raise and spend the $40.2 million
maximum, Gore's heavy spending this year will leave Bradley with
the ability to spend about $6 million more during the primary
season, by many estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick, who ran the Gephardt campaign, said the deeper pockets
will allow Bradley to make large media buys in some states _ ``a
tremendous advantage,'' he said. Also, he said, Gore's treasury
might force him to shortchange some key states, like Georgia, North
Carolina, and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Democratic strategists predict that Bradley's
resources may prompt Gore to mount only a token campaign in New
York, where Bradley already leads in polls; and spend more than
planned to try to deny Bradley victory in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane, the Gore spokesman, said the vice president now expects
a drawn-out battle, yet he took some solace from Bradley's
fund-raising success. ``It's one more validation of the success of
the Clinton-Gore economy that the other guy running can find so
many people to contribute to his campaign,'' he said.

WASHING OUR HANDS OF THE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you wash your hands?
</P>
<P>
   How many times did your mother ask you that question when you
were growing up? Maybe she still asks you. My mother asks,
occasionally. Force of habit. At least I think it's force of habit.
Maybe she thinks I still need to be reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers may be wrong about some things, but they're right about
the importance of washing your hands. So get in there and scrub.
That means you, kid. And don't forget to wash the backs of your
hands, because germs are lurking everywhere, poised to do their
worst, and their worst is very bad indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Germs. The word alone used to scare us. We've lost our fear.
We've put our faith in antibiotics. But antibiotics aren't a sure
cure anymore. More and more contagious diseases are fighting back,
changing, adapting, learning to coexist with modern medicines,
rendering them useless.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times last week reported that, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hospitals are teeming
with potentially lethal infection. Each year 1.8 million people
pick up infections while hospitalized for something else, according
to the Centers, and 20,000 of them die as a result.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times story, studies have shown that medical
personnel aren't washing their hands as thoroughly or as often as
they should. Dirty hands spread infection, sometimes fatal
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. You check in for, say, a tonsillectomy and you check
out, permanently, because somebody neglected to wash his or her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So if doctors and nurses, of all people, aren't washing their
hands, who is?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the rest of the population isn't doing a great job of it
either. You might even call us the great unwashed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 hand-washing survey of 7,000 people
conducted for the American Society of Microbiology, 98 percent of
Americans said they always wash their hands after they visit the
bathroom. That's what they said, but researchers stationed in
public bathrooms found that only 68 percent of those observed
washed up afterward. Women were somewhat more likely to wash than
men, 74 percent to 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study asked about hand-washing in other, non-bathroom
situations. Only 48 percent of those interviewed said they washed
after handling an animal. And a mere 33 percent said they washed up
after coughing or sneezing into their hands. (So Donald Trump is
right about at least one thing; he refuses to shake hands because
he believes it spreads disease.) On a more encouraging note, 81
percent of those surveyed said they washed before handling food,
and 78 percent said they did after changing a diaper. That's what
they said, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times story, medical personnel surveyed cited
lack of time as a major reason for failing to wash their hands as
often as they should, i.e dozens, even hundreds of times a day.
Hospital hand-washing is time-consuming. One study found that some
of the busiest doctors, those in an intensive care unit, were the
least likely to wash their hands. Since doctors and nurses are only
going to get busier, one researcher suggests hospital patients take
responsibility for hygiene and ask every health care worker who
approaches: Did you wash your hands?
</P>
<P>
   Most non-medical people need to wash their hands only a few
times a day. It takes seconds. Why do so many people neglect to do
it? Maybe they think it's unnecessary. Or maybe it's a kind of
germ-related narcissism. They can't imagine their germs could harm
anyone. And other people's germs? Mother was right; they can make
you sick. So wash your hands, for her sake.

ODDS DWINDLE COMMUNISTS WILL REGAIN DOMINANCE IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIPETSK, Russia _ Generation X glanced up. Generation Red glared
down.
</P>
<P>
   In a run-down movie theater in the dreary southern Russian city
of Lipetsk, the Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, known as the
candidate of the angry, the elderly and the dispossessed, was
trying to connect with the Nintendo crowd: young people playing
video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiya, kids, hey, wait, don't run away, let's take a look at
that,'' Zyuganov began in his sonorous baritone. ``Hmm, those are
pretty good graphics. What's that with the sword, a samurai? Hey,
if you win, do you get a prize?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh? Uh, no,'' said Ivan Bazarov, 18, who will vote for the
first time in December's parliamentary elections, but not for the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Zyuganov was back in his element, surrounded by red
flags, beaming through a cold drizzle at a crowd of retirees as the
old Soviet national anthem played. These were the people he had won
over long ago, people who miss the certainties of living in the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks before the Dec. 19 vote, the Communists are leading a
pack of 28 parties, with about 20 percent of the vote, according to
most polls. There was a time when such numbers made people all over
the world wonder about a red revanche in Russia. But no longer. In
the view of most observers here, the Communists are out of touch,
and already out of the race for the big prize that will be
contested next summer, the Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Communists
have maintained the core of voters that has made them Russia's most
powerful opposition party. But as each subsequent year brings new
hardships and Russia's ranks of angry, impoverished, and
dispossessed increase, the Communists' support has remained about
the same. The appearance of powerful competitors means that their
share of seats in the lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
will probably shrink from the current 140, nearly a third of the
Duma's 450 seats.
</P>
<P>
   This says as much about the way Russia has changed as it does
about the way the Communists have not. No longer can anyone portray
Russia as a battlefield of an entrenched Soviet system versus
liberal, Westernizing reformers, as President Boris N. Yeltsin
successfully did in defeating Zyuganov in 1996 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of a `Communist comeback' has disappeared,'' said
Dmitri Kamyshev, political analyst for the weekly Kommersant Vlast.
</P>
<P>
   The battles being fought now are murky conflicts among feuding
power elites and oligarchs, motivated as much by their narrow
self-interest as by the future of Russia. Fittingly, all party
leaders sound the same: Stop the crime, corruption, and bandit
capitalism that has dominated Yeltsin's Russia; return dignity to
ordinary people after years of crisis and hardship.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Zyuganov has been saying that for years, long before
it became fashionable? After four years as the main party in
parliament, the Communists have become just another party. They
scare no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists have become an opposition party that is part of
the system,'' said Sergei Mulin, a political commentator for the
newspaper Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   When the Communist faction in the State Duma gave preliminary
approval to the government's fiscal 2000 budget two weeks ago, some
opposition figures speculated that the Communists had supported the
Kremlin in exchange for government backing in the parliamentary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Commmunists denied any deals. But that the theory exists is
confirmation of a larger truth in these elections: Far more than
the Communists, the Kremlin fears the Fatherland/All Russia bloc,
led by Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, as well as Yevgeny Primakov, a
former prime minister and a leading presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' platform calls for prosecuting and jailing
well-connected businessmen whom they accuse of plundering the
economy. But so does Fatherland's Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists talk about recovering state assets sold off under
the efforts to build a market economy. Such talk used to strike
fear in the hearts of investors. But lately Yeltsin's government
has been accused of taking control of lucrative companies, and of
running roughshod over shareholders' rights, to help finance the
upcoming election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists appeal to Russia's erstwhile great power status.
But so does Primakov, who, polls say, would easily defeat Zyuganov
in a head-to-head presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists hit a low point late last year when they failed
to denounce or distance themselves from anti-Semitic remarks by two
prominent party members (who eventually left to form their own
movement).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Luzhkov enforced oppressive residence rules for
people with dark skin who live in Moscow, and the Kremlin began
prosecuting its latest brutal campaign in the Caucasus. Anytime
someone reminds Zyuganov that Communists in Russia once killed
millions during the Great Terror of the 1930s, he smiles and says,
``But who's doing the killing now?''
</P>
<P>
   But being no worse than anyone else has not brought Zyuganov
more support. Instead, his party's supporters are Russia's oldest
and least educated, according to a report by the think tank
Carnegie Moscow Center. Far from revolution, they want something
that is getting less likely each year: a return to the life they
knew 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everything we need, food, clothing, work, education,
medicine,'' said Lipetsk pensioner Tamara Sokova, 62, as she
listened to Zyuganov in Lipetsk. Sokova cannot make ends meet on
her $15 monthly pension, so she started collecting bottles to sell
to recycling firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except now the empty bottles have started to disappear,''
Sokova said. ``Because too many people are collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Communists chide their leader for not doing more to attract new
voters, for failing to build a larger coalition uniting leftists
and nostalgic nationalists, for not turning his old message of
opposition to the Yeltsin regime into something positive for
Russians to rally around, and for being so wooden that he makes Al
Gore look fiery by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of Yeltsin and his proteges is treason of
Russia's interests,'' Zyuganov intoned at a rally about 1,000
people in Yelets, a decrepit industrial town that lies 250 miles
south of Moscow, where buildings ruined during World War II have
not been restored. ``Over $150 billion has left Russia, and today
the budget is smaller than that of Finland. Where did it all go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot him! Shoot Yeltsin!'' cried one very small, elderly
woman carrying an anti-Semitic poster. Her cry raised a smattering
of applause from those close enough to hear her tiny voice.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov smiled down at her benignly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are at least 7,000 of you,'' he beamed at the crowd as
his aides snickered at the exaggeration. ``It is good to see you
all here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Olya and Sveta, two 18-year-olds hurrying past the rally,
had no intention of voting for Zyuganov. Nor did they know anyone
who would.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard all about the Communist era,'' said Olya, who is too
young to remember much about it. ``They'd make us have ration cards
and tell us what to think. They'd make it illegal to have fun.''

ENGINEERING BODY PARTS FROM SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, a doctor treating a diabetic's hard-to-heal foot ulcer
can open a sterile plastic bag, take out a swatch of artificial
skin containing two layers of living human cells, and apply it to
the wound to speed its healing.
</P>
<P>
   Not far off, scientists say, are bioengineered replacements for
damaged or diseased soft tissues, cartilage, ligaments, and bone to
treat injuries and disease.
</P>
<P>
   And a still more-distant prospect, but already in research, are
blood vessels and heart valves grown from scratch in the
laboratory, and a long list of other substitute body parts. Just in
the past year, scientists have isolated versatile ``stem cells''
from human embryos that can mature into any type of cell in the
body, and potentially could be used to form many kinds of tissues
and organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a revolution where we can create new
parts for cells, organs, tissues, and integrate them seamlessly''
into the body,'' said William Haseltine, CEO of Human Genome
Sciences in Rockville, Md. He even predicted that implanting young
cells into older people could ``dramatically extend age.''
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine delivered this pep talk last month in New York City,
at what was said to be the first conference of the major players in
the fledgling commercial enterprise of tissue engineering.
</P>
<P>
   A major force driving the field is medicine's shift away from a
longtime focus on infectious and other acute diseases; instead,
it's confronting a vast and aging population beset by chronic
degenerative diseases, from Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease to
arthritis and diabetes. Indeed, these are the targets for tissue
engineering therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Tissue engineering refers to rebuilding or repairing parts of
the body using a combination of artificial materials and living
cells. Often, the human cells are grown in the laboratory and then
draped onto a fibrous, biodegradable scaffolding made in the shape
of the desired tissue or organ. After implantation in the body, the
cells become part of the surrounding tissue and the nonliving
scaffolding melts away.
</P>
<P>
   Who might benefit from these expected advances? Almost anyone:
patients with bone and joint injuries, cancer patients who've had
tissue removed, leaving an unsightly defect; people with
degenerative brain diseases, who might be helped by transplants of
nerve tissue; and back pain sufferers, who might have synthetic
disks placed in their backbones.
</P>
<P>
   Another group might be those waiting for transplants of donor
organs; the continuing shortage of organs is said to be responsible
for 4,000 deaths each year. If tissue engineering can eventually
supply those scarce organs, it could also reduce the need for
devices like dialysis machines or artificial hearts, say advocates.
</P>
<P>
   For many medical problems, ``we won't replace parts, we'll renew
them and they will be indistinguishable from one's own,'' said
Kirby S. Black, vice president for research at Cryolife, Inc., a
Kennesaw, Ga., company that is testing a tissue- engineered heart
valve.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York meeting, sponsored by TechVest LLC, an
investment research firm, scientists and officials from 50
companies described bioengineered products in development or on the
drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Though in no way lacking for ideas and product prototypes, the
promised revolution is barely underway from a commercial
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Only one bioengineered product containing living cells has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It is Apligraf, an
artificial skin made by seeding human cells _ obtained from
infants' foreskins following circumcision _ onto a matrix made of
collagen, an animal protein. The cells form the two distinct layers
of actual human skin, but there are no blood vessels or hair
follicles.
</P>
<P>
   Its manufacturer, Organogenesis Inc. of Canton, recently
reported that clinical trials showed that Apligraf-covered diabetic
foot ulcers healed more quickly than those treated conventionally.
Dr. Aristidis Veves of the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, a
researcher in the foot ulcer trials, said he believes the living
skin cells secrete growth factors that speed the ulcer repair.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the slow pace of commercialization, tissue engineering
faces many technical hurdles. And it hasn't been widely embraced by
private investors, many of whom see a quicker return in Internet
ventures, for example, even though in time, ``regenerative
medicine,'' as Haseltine calls it, promises to be a huge market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector needs to get a second wind today,'' said Michael
Ehrenreich, president of TechVest. As with other innovative
technologies, he said, ``there has been unreasonable expectation at
an early stage'' which, when not quickly fulfilled, has scared off
some investors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sefton, a professor of biomedical engineering at the
University of Toronto said the long-term goal ``is off-the-shelf
availability...of different types and sizes of organs,'' adding
that it would overcome the ethical dilemmas in allocating the
limited supply of donor organs.
</P>
<P>
   Sefton heads a consortium of researchers called LIFE, which has,
as he put it, ``a very ambitious if not crazy'' goal of creating a
bioengineered heart in the next 10 years. Few in the field believe
it can be done that quickly, given that making any kind of
three-dimensional, complex organ is beyond present capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers say growing replacement organs remains an
ultimate goal. ``I believe tissue engineering has the potential to
address the problem'' of donor organ shortages, said Robert Nerem,
who heads the joint Center for the Engineering of Living Tissues at
Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the speed bumps in tissue engineering's path, said Nerem,
are questions about obtaining cells to make products, how to mass
produce tissue-built organs, and how to get them approved by the
FDA in a reasonable time.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of using stem cells to supply the cells for tissues
and organs ``is very exciting,'' said Nerem, ``but we know so
little about how to stimulate stem cells to go down a pathway to
become a (specific) differentiated cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that remains to be done, many feel that tissue
engineering will play a large role in the future of medicine. ``I
think this is the natural next frontier,'' said Michael Ehrenreich,
president of TechVest.
</P>
<P>
   Among the near- and far-term applications presented at the
meeting were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ CryoLife's heart valve, which is a pig's heart valve designed
to encourage the growth of a patient's own cells onto it after it
is implanted.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laboratory-grown cartilage products that could replace the
meniscus in the knee joint, a cartilage often damaged by sports
injuries or arthritis. One company in cartilage research, Advanced
Tissue Sciences of La Jolla, Calif., is also testing skin
substitutes and working on tissue-engineered small blood vessels to
substitute for the leg veins commonly removed from patients to
create coronary bypass grafts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transplants of nerve cells from pigs and eye cells from humans
intended to relieve symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other brain
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stem cell research aimed at creating a source of all kinds of
tissue and organ-repair cells. Researchers last year isolated
embryonic stem cells for the first time. They are obtained from
days-old human embryos, and are the cells that mature and
differentiate into all the tissues of the developing fetus.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Geron Corp., of Menlo Park, Calif., hopes to
harness embryonic stem cells and make the cells that develop from
them immortal. Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., of Baltimore, is betting
on a different type of stem cell found in most organs, called
mesenchymal stem cells, that could generate a wide range of cell
types and could be obtained from adults, getting around the ethical
issues of research on embryos.

WHAT'S BEST MAKEUP FOR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Often in your articles you say that people now retired or
near retirement should be able to safely earn a 6.5 percent yield
from an established fixed-income portfolio. You also mention that
they should keep a portion of their portfolio in stock funds or
individual stocks to protect against inflation. However, I don't
recall seeing where you discussed the makeup of the fixed-income
portfolio, and the percentage of the total portfolio that should be
in stocks. Could you provide specifics and the names of the funds
you would select?
</P>
<P>
   M.C., Arlington, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Part of this _ how I would suggest you build a fixed-income
portfolio _ is pretty easy. But the percentage of your total
savings that should be in stocks is pretty hard to pin down, since
it relates largely to the overall resources and needs of the
individuals in question.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a person needs an $80,000 annual income stream
and has resources of $4 million, he could probably leave all of his
money in stocks, where the long-term returns are likely to be
highest, and where he could expect to get enough money for his
needs from the dividend yields.
</P>
<P>
   But most of us don't live like that. Generally, I consider that
a person is in a pretty comfortable situation if they have a
fixed-income portfolio that supplies their income needs, and in
addition a stock portfolio that represents 50 percent of the value
of the fixed-income portfolio, with the latter designed to protect
them against inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no need to panic if you can't fit your specifics
into that profile. That is a target for a very comfortable
retirement. If a person has enough money to keep a third of his
savings in stocks, the chances are good that he can move through
retirement with little or no erosion of principal.
</P>
<P>
   That's a comfortable situation, but not necessary; what is
necessary is to have enough money to provide you with the funds you
need in retirement, including the raises you will have to give
yourself to keep in step with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, it is quite satisfactory that their principal
decline steadily as they age _ just so long as they don't get into
a situation in which they will outlive their income stream.
</P>
<P>
   So it all comes down to the fact that there is no such thing as
a one-size-fits-all financial plan.
</P>
<P>
   To a much lesser degree, that's also true of building a
fixed-income portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   What I usually suggest to people who are comfortable with the
vagaries of the bond markets is a three-tiered fixed-income
portfolio, with a GNMA or government securities account at the
center and representing about half of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the opposite ends of the spectrum, I suggest equal
investments in a high-yield (or junk bond) fund, balanced either by
a short-term corporate bond fund, CDs, or a money market fund at
the conservative end.
</P>
<P>
   If a person is uncomfortable with the risks of a junk bond fund,
he or she could reorganize the plan with about two-thirds of the
money in intermediate-term government-backed securities such as the
GNMA fund, and the balance in conservative holdings such as I
outline above.
</P>
<P>
   The returns in that case, of course, would dip a bit lower, but
for many people, the additional peace of mind is worth the lower
return.
</P>
<P>
   (And of course, investors should be aware that all of these
investments except the CDs and money market investments entail
risk, and that such holdings must be viewed as long-term
investments, with as much focus on the yield as fluctuations in net
asset value.)
</P>
<P>
   As for specific funds, I tend to favor those of Vanguard, based
on its plain-vanilla, low-cost approach to running its business.
Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond fund, Vanguard GNMA, and
Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond funds would be my choices. (And
for the record, they are, since I hold positions in the latter two
offer-ings.)
</P>
<P>
   Most fund families offer similar funds, and you are not likely
to hurt yourself if you go elsewhere. But I do suggest that on the
fixed-income side of your portfolio you confine your research to
no-load funds. Good research and talented portfolio managers can
often make a stock fund with a sales charge a wise investment, but
in general the added cost of a sales load is simply too much for a
fixed-income portfolio manager to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I enjoy your column, but I was saddened by your seeming lack
of understanding of charitable giving; you seem to say get and keep
all you can and maybe your heirs will be able to give some away. I
believe that giving is a test of our humanity.
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Santa Clarita, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Gee, I think you may have misread a column a couple of weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That involved a couple who had a pool of money invested in
stocks, and their plan was to take a percentage of that money each
year and distribute it to charities. This, of course, was an
admirable approach to handling their money.
</P>
<P>
   But from other factors in their financial situation it seemed
that they would be a bit hard-pressed to meet their retirement
goals with any significant margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   So I suggested that they allow this money to accumulate during
their remaining years, and to designate through their wills that
this money eventually go to charity. I didn't say they shouldn't
give at all.
</P>
<P>

FRONT-RUNNERS CAN, AND DO, FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 12 months to go, the probable political landscape of next
November's election has begun to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get of sense of what will happen then is by reviewing
what transpired in the months before past elections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Republican contender George Bush and Democratic
front-runner Michael S. Dukakis battled for their parties'
nominations, and then against each other for the nation's top job.
A few months out from election day, polls showed Dukakis with a
comfortable lead. But he somehow managed to lose that edge and end
up as runner-up when the votes were counted.
</P>
<P>
   The same lesson could prove true for George W. Bush who _
presuming he battles back a primary challenge from US Senator John
McCain _ is considered the front-runner against either of the
Democratic challengers, Vice President Al Gore or Bill Bradley, the
former senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Because front-runners have a way of losing their leads, Gore,
who is currently lagging 10 points behind Bush in some polls, has
as good a chance as Bush of being elected next November.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Democrats Gore and Bradley, and Republicans Bush and
McCain, locked in close battle for the New Hampshire primary in
February. But the winner of that primary, as history has proved,
does not necessarily win the presidency the following November.
</P>
<P>
   When the late Paul Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary in 1992
to the surprise of many pollsters, second-place finisher Bill
Clinton went on to win other primaries, the nomination, and the
presidency _ proving that other factors, such as money and a strong
political network, are also vital to becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Gore (presuming he's the Democratic nominee) will
have the money and a strong national network to help him win the
nomination at the Democratic National Convention. That will put him
in position to run a strong campaign against Bush down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's vulnerability is underscored by the fact that polls now
show McCain, with his come-from-behind candidacy, now tied with him
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And if the 1988 election offers any lessons, its that even if
Bush maintains a strong lead after the GOP convention, it could
still evaporate into the fall air, as did Dukakis's commanding lead
over George W.'s father that year. Whether Gore _ who is striving
to shake off his stiff image _ does ovetake his foes is, of couse,
anybody's guess, but history has proven at least that it can
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And history has also proven that a carpetbagger running in New
York for US senator can also win, despite being behind in the polls
12 months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   When the late Robert Kennedy ran for a senate seat from New York
in 1964, even his famous name could not guarantee a win over the
incumbent, Kenneth Keating. The media inside and outside New York
kidded and chided Kennedy about his carpbetbagging and his lack of
knowledge about the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, despite having to run the political New York
gauntlet _ something Hillary Rodham Clinton is currently
experiencing _ Kennedy won.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, too, can overcome the jokes about her
carpetbagging campaign, and her current second place in the polls,
to defeat New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in next year's senatorial
race. Of course, Kennedy's example does not guarantee a Clinton
victory, but it makes it more of a possibility than Clinton critics
might be willing to admit.
</P>
<P>
   Current polls also give Democrats a good chance of retaking the
US Senate and House next year. When a recent CBS-New York Times
poll asked people how they would vote in congressional elections,
45 percent said they would pick a Democrat and 38 percent said they
would pick a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   This poll spells bad news for the GOP, which is witnessing a
reverse of the good fortune it had in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage Democats have this year is that Gore is more of a
known quantity than Bush, given Gore's nearly eight years as a
highly-public vice president. If there were anything that could be
damaging to Gore, it would have come out by now. Bush, on the other
hand, as Texas governor is lesser known. And as he becomes more
visible to the electorate, Bush also appears to become more
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   His failure to know the names of certain heads of state in an
unexpected quiz during a recent television interview has not helped
him. Although it may not do as much damage as Quayle did to himself
when he misspelled ``potato,'' the public is as likely to remember
Bush's foreign relations facility as it is Quayle's spelling.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a very strong push by Bradley and McCain to derail
Gore and Bush. Congress appears to be shaping up for a Democratic
takeover, and no Clinton should ever be counted out of any race,
including the one in New York.

HEARING ECHOES OF `THE DEATH OF ZIONISM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been more than 17 years, but I can still hear the wiry,
young bearded settler shout, ``This is the death of Zionism,'' as
he struggled in vain against the clutches of four Israeli soldiers
_ one to a limb _ who carried him out of his apartment in the
northern Sinai town of Yamit.
</P>
<P>
   I held his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the young man's wife and daughter screamed and sobbed as
they saw him carried off, resisting the first efforts of women
soldiers assigned to calm them down and get them to focus on
packing their belongings in military-issue cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Yamit, similar scenes played out that Friday morning
as the Israeli army, bringing Israel into compliance with the terms
of its peace treaty with Egypt, removed the last pockets of settler
resistance to the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jewish army, it was the first such wrenching assignment
and the largest of its kind so far, dwarfing the pre-dawn
evacuation this past Thursday of Havat Maon, an illegal hilltop
outpost in the southern West Bank that religious nationalist
settlers had set up to create political ``facts on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's order to evict the Havat Maon
settlers removed an obstacle to the latest round of Mideast
peacemaking, this time between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But the brief clash last week between hundreds of Israeli troops
and dozens of protesters at the hastily built hilltop outpost paled
in comparison to the four-day showdown over the idyllic coastal
community of Yamit, when 20,000 troops were involved.
</P>
<P>
   That late-April Friday in 1982, evacuation day, had been
preceded by ultimatums, 11th-hour negotiations, and a steady
emotional buildup as Israelis braced for the spectacle of their
army doing the unthinkable: removing fellow Israelis from homes
they had built in good faith to help realize the Zionist dream of a
secure homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Havat Maon, Yamit was populated primarily by secular
middle-class Israelis trying to find a better quality of life in a
new community. The northern Sinai, unlike the West Bank, was not
part of the holy land. No settler could claim God promised this
land to the Jews. It was just a sliver of territory on the edge of
a giant strategic buffer zone between Israel proper and Egypt, then
the Jewish state's most powerful adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Yamit, its name in Hebrew evokes the sea, literally sprang up
from the sand dunes a few hundred yards from the Mediterranean, a
growing cluster of red-roofed stucco homes divided by pedestrian
walkways and tropical gardens. Residents boasted that they didn't
lock their doors, that the community was a throw-back to simpler
times.
</P>
<P>
   But you won'f find Yamit today on a map. The Israeli army,
operating under the orders of the hawkish then-defense minister,
Ariel Sharon, saw to it.
</P>
<P>
   The army had assembled a select group to handle the delicate
task of evicting Jews, calling in soldiers training to be
commanders and amassing a disproportionate number of senior
officers.
</P>
<P>
   For some soldiers, the evacuation of Yamit, while painful,
symbolized the triumph of democracy and of the peace process. For
others it was a national tragedy. An American Jew on my own
ideological journey (and a trainee in a noncommissioned officers
course), I espoused the former view.
</P>
<P>
   My team's first assignment, the previous day, was to help a
family pack its belongings. The family, a man in his 50s and his
daughter, who said she was a soldier on leave, had lived in Yamit
for years. They were not resisting the order to leave, but they
were emotionally exhausted from confronting the inevitability of
losing their home. The father shuffled around in apparent shock.
From outside came the sounds of a bulldozer knocking down his
neighbor's house.
</P>
<P>
   In one cardboard box we put his collection of imported liquor, a
prized possession for Israelis in those days, and carried it
outside. His daughter, spotting the box, came over. Without a word,
with a contemptuous half-smile on her lips and her eyes wide and
defiant, she bent down, grabbed a bottle, and flung it against a
garden wall. The exploding glass made everyone jump. Her smile
widened and she threw another before she whirled and stalked off.
</P>
<P>
   That evening my team was invited to a surreal farewell cookout
as another family, one of Yamit's first, they said, emptied their
freezer and lobbied the officers to leave their evacuation to the
end. ``Please,'' they pleaded with a colonel, ``just guarantee us
we'll be the last to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   One soldier, seeing the panic in the eyes of the family members
and sensing that their request would not be met, refused the
family's hospitality and scolded his comrades. ``How can you eat
their food? Tomorrow you'll pull them out by force.''
</P>
<P>
   Late that night the army sent its troops onto the roofs of
apartment buildings, seizing the ``high ground'' in anticipation of
the confrontations at dawn.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as it was to wrestle a man away from his hysterical
family, other troops had even more arduous tasks.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shekhunat Ha'Ixim,'' the ``X Neighborhood'' in which rows
of previously evacuated apartments had been marked with large black
painted X's, literally crossed off the army's list, settler
activists with megaphones mounted a counterstrike, taking to the
roofs, where they held out for hours and scuffled with soldiers
before succumbing to the inevitable. Notably, most of these
activists had come to Yamit from settlements in the West Bank in
the days and weeks before the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a group of right-wing university students led by
Tzachi Hanegbi, who years later joined the Likud Party and
eventually served as justice minister under former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, shouted their defiance of the army from atop a
70-foot-high monument to fallen Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   But away from the isolated clusters of holdouts, the demolition
proceeded in earnest. Bulldozers knocked down the one-story villas;
excavation machines, looking like giant birds of prey, brought
their pneumatic hammers down on the reinforced concrete tops of
bomb shelters; and teams led by the army's engineering corps rigged
the larger apartment buildings with sacks of TNT and other
explosive ordnance, linking each neighborhood in a giant white web
of twined explosive fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the order was given for all military personnel to clear
the town, and we retreated the prescribed safe distance. The blast
came promptly at the appointed hour, and a giant mushroom dust
cloud rose over what had been Yamit.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of that day was quickly forgotten by the rest of the
world when Israel invaded Lebanon 6 1/2 weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   But for Israelis an important lesson had been well learned. Many
suspected it was a lesson deliberately taught by the Likud
government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister
Sharon. And it was a lesson apparently not lost on Ehud Barak: If
it were this difficult to abandon the sands of the northern Sinai,
how could settlers ever be uprooted from the West Bank?

 UNDATED: ... nostalgia buffs.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One significant change did occur for a while in our century. Up
until the 1950s, much pop music was written and performed by
composers with classical training who were quick to see the value
and the quality of music developed by and for people who had little
or no formal musical education. There was a lot of interest in
building bridges between jazz and concert music. Rock music, on the
other hand, alienated many composers who were already established
by the time it came along, and there was a split. It is only more
recently that composers who have spent their whole lives with rock
music have tried to invest their own work with some of rock's best
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Music has also been multicultural for centuries, as composers
followed their curiosity wherever it led them; that tendency grew
in the 20th century because of the single most important real
innovation, the electrification of civilization. With the invention
of the phonograph, by Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner, and its
subsequent development, it became possible in for all the music of
the past, and most of the music of the world's cultures, to become
simultaneously present in the ear and imagination of a composer.
The phonograph played a major role in awakening interest in unknown
music; and so did efforts after World War II, centered in Boston,
to build authentic copies of historical instruments like the
harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   The electrification of music has been a mixed blessing. It led
to experiments and achievements in music written for electronics,
though composers soon discovered how quickly technology could
outrace them; some masterpieces of the genre now require equipment
as historical as a harpsichord.
</P>
<P>
   It also became possible to divorce music from its original
context; Bach's ``St. Matthew Passion'' could be recycled as
background music for restaurants. The mediafication of music
catapulted the business aspect of the art into a whole new
dimension and led to the glorification of the performer at the
expense of the composer. Paganini and Liszt were precursors of the
modern superstars, but they were composers whose music was written,
in part, to display their prowess as performers. But few of the
great performers of our century were also composers. Early in the
century, the superstars created by the new media, like the tenor
Enrico Caruso, performed the music that was then new and that the
audience wanted to hear them in; today's superstars, like Luciano
Pavarotti or Cecilia Bartoli, do not sing new music, in part
because that's not what the public wants to hear them do. The
performers of this century that the public of future centuries will
be most grateful to will be the ones who inspired the creation of
great new work _ performers like the tenor Peter Pears, or the
cellists Mistislav Rostropovich and Yo-Yo Ma, succesors to
performers like Joseph Joachim, whose abilities and spirit led to
the creation of the most famous violin concertos of the 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in this country especially, there is real concern about
how to renew the audience for classical music in a time when
cultural education has collapsed. The aging of the audience, and
the always uneasy alliance between art and commerce, has had
serious consequences for the music business: It is on the verge of
a richly earned collapse. But as the scholar-pianist Charles Rosen
has pointed out, there is no problem with the steady advance of
central musical culture. A certain portion of the population
continues to be born with musical abilities and an imperative need
to make music, and a larger portion of the population is born with
the need to hear it. In the forthcoming century, composer and
public will find new ways to get in touch with each other, as they
always have.

UNDER CLOSER LOOK, BRADLEYCARE DOESN'T ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Answer me this: If your purpose is to reduce the
ranks of the 45 million people with no health insurance, what sense
does it make to throw scarce federal dollars at people who already
have health insurance?
</P>
<P>
   Or this: What sense does it make to throw more of those scarce
dollars, in the form of tax deductions for premiums, at people who
not only already have health insurance but are also filthy rich?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to BradleyCare. When the former New Jersey senator made
his proposal, he got praise (including from me) for breaking new
ground, putting the principle of universal coverage back on the
table credibly, and breathing fresh policy air into a stale,
partisan shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   As with any big idea, there were holes involving cost, coverage,
Medicare, and Medicaid. But expectation was that probing and
discussion would produce more answers and refinements that would
further improve Bill Bradley's signature new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't happened. As a result, what Bradley has dismissed as
``timid'' _ Vice President Al Gore's ideas _ now loom as sensible,
workable, and more progressive. By building on what already exists,
Gore has a way over the next decade to increase insurance coverage
to almost the level Bradley's ideas would, but at a cost that
doesn't gobble the lion's share of any budget surplus, leaves room
for investment in Medicare, and also leaves room for investment in
other national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a left-right, liberal-moderate ideological squabble.
As with so many other big issues in the '90s, it is a case where
the most progressive ideas turn out to be the most fiscally
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, the Gore-Bradley debate can be boiled down
without too much oversimplification to three issues _ cost,
coverage, and the bedrock federal entitlements, Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley's proposal doesn't cost more than Gore's because it is
more nearly universal. It costs more, at least three times more,
because it offers subsidies for everyone regardless of need, and
regardless of whether they already have insurance. More
dramatically, it costs a lot more because of a prescription drug
benefit that while stingy on the front end is open-ended on the
back end.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley proposal's fiscally dangerous assumption is that
every Medicare beneficiary over age 80 would enroll in an HMO to
get the drug benefit. But there are currently only four such
outfits in existence. What we do have reason to expect, from work
by the Congressional Budget Office, is that at least 80 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries would sign up for the drug benefit. The
difference between CBO anlysis and Bradley hope is huge. Dr.
Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University last week pegged the 10-year
cost at nearly $400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bradley's proposal would cost more because it makes
insurance premiums tax deductible for everyone and gives subsidies
on a sliding scale to people who have insurance, and not merely the
uninsured. In all, Thorpe pegs the 10-year cost of BradleyCare at
slightly more than $1 trillion, which consumes the entire projected
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, rather than refute Thorpe, attacks him as
damaged ``Clinton-Gore'' goods. But his first-term job was working
on his field of expertise, cost-estimating. His initial projections
about the Bradley and Gore proposals came after a request from The
Washington Post, and his revised work last week came after
Bradley's people sought to persuade him otherwise. He could not
responsibly agree to their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley's costs are supposed to be for a worthy purpose,
attaining insurance coverage for nearly all the uninsured _ which
would produce savings in acute care expenses as well as better
health.
</P>
<P>
   However, the question has arisen whether, for example, the
existence of the subsidies may cause many employers to dump
coverage, or what would be the impact of ending Medicaid as we know
it, as Bradley has proposed, on AIDS patients or low-income nursing
home patients who couldn't buy insurance with the vouchers they
would get in ``exchange.'' What more likely would be in store would
be substitution of public dollars for private ones. Thorpe figures
Bradley's proposal would add 15 million people to the insured
population, compared to 12 million in Gore's plan, which is
targeted on kids and adults with no insurance. Bradley would end up
insuring 89 percent of the population, compared to 88 percent with
Gore's plan, but would spend $700 billion more. Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   --Ending Medicaid as we know it is dangerous enough if you keep
in mind adults for whom it is a vital safety net. But BradleyCare
virtually demands ignoring Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   That's not responsible. Medicare will need both reform and new
money over the next decade to be ready for the baby boom
generation's retirement. Simply to assume, as Bradley does, that
because the program appears solvent under current economic
conditions until the year 2015, it doesn't need attention upfront,
is quixotic. Gore, like President Clinton, more wisely wants to
invest 15 percent of any budget surplus in Medicare's future.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been a better debate. But by going for pie in
the sky, Bradley has crashed.

EVEN GORE BACKERS SAY HIS CRITIQUE OF BRADLEY MAY BE OVERSTATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A speech on the floor of the US Senate 18 years ago
is now resounding on the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   It was July 31, 1981, when Bill Bradley announced that he
opposed President Reagan's tax cut, the largest in US history, but
would support the president's massive, across-the-board cut in
domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no spending cuts are easy to make, some must be made,''
the former New Jersey senator said then. ``Our economy requires a
reduction in federal spending if we are ever to restore the
economic growth that will allow us for the long term to keep our
promises to the poor, the disabled, and the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Al Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, regularly reminds party activists that Bradley voted
for ``Reaganomics'' in what the vice president calls ``the single
most defining vote for the Democrats in the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president portrays Bradley's vote as part of a pattern
of abandoning Democratic causes, including Bradley's leaving the
Senate in 1997 and declaring that ``politics is broken'' after Newt
Gingrich led the GOP takeover of Congress; Bradley's contemplating
an independent run against President Clinton in 1996; and his
support of Republican proposals for school vouchers and raising the
retirement age for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Gore supporters disagree with his intepretation of the
1981 vote as a litmus test of party loyalty, because Bradley had
the company of 30 other Democratic senators, many of whom now
support Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley did not vote with the 26 Democratic senators
who supported Reagan's 25 percent tax cut, which some politicians
and poverty specialists say hurt the economy more than the budget
cut. According to some economists, if the full Senate had voted as
Bradley did, in favor of the cutting the budget by $35 billion and
against the tax cut, the federal budget deficit would have been
nearly erased at a time of sharp inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While some Democratic senators supporting Gore disagree, they
also cringe at Gore's suggestion that the budget-cut vote was a
watershed moment for the party. To three senators who voted for the
Reagan budget cuts 18 years ago, Gore's criticism of Bradley could
be taken as an indirect swipe at them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would respectfully disagree with the vice president,'' said
former senator Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat from Arizona. ``To me
that was not a defining vote. It was about people like me who were
moderate Democrats who gave the guy a chance. At the time, I was
enamored with President Reagan like everybody else,'' he said. ``I
thought he really knew what he was talking about economically, but
it turned out he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While careful not to say he was offended by Gore's criticism,
Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana, said,
``I'm not sure there is much traction with an issue that old for
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wendell Ford, a former Democratic senator from Kentucky,
said of Gore's critique: ``I don't take it personally. Fortunately,
in this life, you make a mistake and they don't make a criminal out
of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who has
not endorsed either presidential candidate, said Gore's criticism
of the budget vote was ``excessive. First, it was 18 years ago and
it's only one vote. If there was a consistent pattern . . . it
would be more damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Some poverty specialists said Bradley redeemed himself in their
eyes after voting for the budget cut by working to extend health
care for children, expand the earned income tax credit for the
poor, and enforce child-support laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1984 to 1996, he was one of two or three principal
leaders in the Senate working to expand poverty programs,'' said
Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposals he is offering in the campaign'' for nearly
universal health coverage for the uninsured and to substantially
reduce child poverty ``do seem consistent with the record he had
established in the last 12 years in the Senate,'' Greenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said of Bradley: ``You can't on one
hand cast your vote and declare the system broken and then run for
president and not expect people to raise questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Al Gore never declared that politics was broken,
never turned his back on important constituencies within the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Bradley has let Gore's criticisms pass.
Though in a recent interview, Bradley said his time away from the
Senate was a ``period of rejuvenation'' and reflection that enabled
him to see where he wants to take the country.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wilkins, a Bradley supporter and historian at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., defended Bradley's vote, saying the tax
cut was the ``Draconian part'' of Reagan's economic program, and
Bradley opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   In a slap at Gore, Wilkins said leaving the vice presidency was
never an option for Gore like leaving the Senate was for Bradley.
``He stayed because he was determined to be president,'' said
Wilkins, ``and the way to become president is . . . not to resign
as the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Bradley's musings about an independent candidacy,
Wilkins compared Bradley to Jimmy Carter, who once said he had
``lust in his heart'' for women other than his wife but had never
cheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought about it, but he didn't do anything about it,''
Wilkins said of Bradley. ``What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   At last month's town meeting in New Hampshire, Gore tried a new
line of attack. He said the cost of Bradley's sweeping health-care
proposal would eat up the nation's budget surplus and ``shred the
social safety net.'' Since then, Gore has begun to challenge
Bradley to explain his stance on raising the retirement age for
Social Security. And just Saturday, the vice president said
Bradley's health-care plan would hurt blacks disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   Former Republican Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, director of
the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, said Gore is likely to continue experimenting
with attacks against Bradley until he finds a theme that works. Any
thoughts by his campaign that Gore would be crowned as the
Democratic nominee have faded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's got a fight on his hands. He never dreamed that, and
his staff never dreamed that,'' Simpson said. ``Bill Bradley is
driving Gore goofy. He's thrown them all off. They've now rolled up
the carpet and put the crown away.''

THE PUSH OF TECHNOLOGY, THE PULL OF SONGWRITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the slapback echo that enhanced Elvis Presley's first
records in Memphis, to the computerized sounds that regularly spice
today's hip-hop CDs, this century has seen a roller-coaster ride of
music mixed with technology. Some might also call it a love-hate
affair, as artists and consumers have been drawn to technology,
then repelled by it, then drawn back _ back and forth, like a
yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   The songwriter is still the primary shaper of music _ from
Jimmie Rodgers and Robert Johnson to Muddy Waters and John Lennon,
from Joni Mitchell to Alanis Morissette, from James Brown to Puff
Daddy, from Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, from Johnny Rotten to
Kurt Cobain _ but the ways musicians can present their songs on
stage and in the studio have changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidity of technological advances has made careers in the
blink of an eye, and destroyed them just as quickly, once the
technology has become obsolete. Remember Human League, the avatars
of synth-pop in the early '80s? Remember quadrophonic sound?
Remember those disco productions? Two-track recordings? Talk boxes?
All those have gone the way of the dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   The new buzz words are loops, autotuners, Pro Tools, and ISDN
lines, which bounce off satellites and allow Barbra Streisand, for
instance, to sit at her Malibu beach home and listen to mixes of
her album beamed to her from a New York studio. And in real time,
no less.
</P>
<P>
   To use or not to use _ that's the question artists have faced in
dealing with technology since the dawn of the rock era in the '50s,
back when Les Paul refined the electric guitar and invented
overdubbing and tape echo.
</P>
<P>
   Some have gone overboard with special effects _ think back to
the first $1 million studio album, Fleetwood Mac's bloated ``Tusk''
in 1979 _ while others have gone the minimalist route, such as
Boston's Godsmack, which made its self-titled, near-double-platinum
CD for just $5,000 last year. The century has shown that there's no
one route to success _ which is what is so fascinating and so
dangerously addictive about the pop business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are records that someone made in a basement that sound
great, and some made for a million dollars that sound terrible,''
says Mike Denneen, owner of Q Division studio in Boston and
producer of records for Aimee Mann, Letters to Cleo, Guster, and
Gigolo Aunts, among others.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to say that artists are always able to choose
their methods of recording, but that isn't true in this century and
not likely to be true in the next, either. The likes of Springsteen
and Michael Jackson can do what they want, based on prior success,
but many new acts have been stuck with producers chosen by their
record labels. The result can be gimmicky studio sounds layered
into their records whether the acts want them or not. Thus, we've
had a century of bands often apologizing for their records, saying
instead, ``Come see us live. That's where you'll see the real us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not always true, either, of course. The proliferation of
backing tapes _ kicked into high gear by Madonna and Janet Jackson
_ has made some concerts a disquieting study in artifice. That's
hardly what the founding fathers of rock _ Presley, Jerry Lee
Lewis, Little Richard, Big Joe Turner, Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison
_ had in mind. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wonderful accidents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But technology has also prompted some wonderful accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology gets developed to serve music, but people will find
uses and ways for it that are different from how it was
conceived,'' says Bob Weir, the longtime Grateful Dead
singer/guitarist. ``Look at guys like Muddy Waters in the late '40s
and '50s who took their amps and cranked them all the way up. You'd
think you would get a distorted sound, but he and some of his
Chicago friends got a great sound that became the future of the
blues, then of rock.'' (As Waters sang, ``The blues had a baby and
they called it rock 'n' roll.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Grateful Dead are a marvelous example of a band that often
took a minimalist approach in the studio _ recording some albums
that explored sparse folk and country-blues _ but a maximalist
approach on stage. They pioneered large, stadium-ready sound
systems; in their later years, they were among the first to of
high-tech miniature monitors that fit inside the ears of musicians
to help them hear each other better, replacing the outmoded monitor
speakers that once cluttered the stage floor.
</P>
<P>
   As for performance quality, the century's advances can be summed
up by contrasting the Beatles' show at Shea Stadium in 1966, which
few fans heard because of the inferiority of the speaker system, to
later stadium shows by Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, and U2,
which required up to 15 trucks of equipment. The last Rolling
Stones tour featured the best, most equalized sound ever heard in a
stadium setting.
</P>
<P>
   Again, some acts have gone overboard with concert presentation.
But then, fans have come to expect that from pop stars ever since,
in the wake of Woodstock '69, the music became big business. The
'80s saw Michael Jackson using $500,000 robotic spiders on stage
during the ``Victory'' tour that followed his 40-million-selling
``Thriller'' album. The Stones used cherry pickers and metal
bridges. Pink Floyd erected a towering video screen and oversized
mirror ball rising from the middle of the crowd. And U2's last tour
featured a large LED (light-emitting diode) screen and a space
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Rock as fantasy and apocalypse _ it's all been done, as stage
shows have evolved from the barroom roots of the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fin de siecle concerts also feature wireless
microphones, headset mikes (pioneered by Peter Gabriel and used
extensively by Garth Brooks), hydraulically lifted stage props,
computerized Vari-lites, and ceiling harnesses that hoist teen
idols like 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys high above the
audience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music as spectacle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The public has become so accustomed to music as spectacle and
special effect that even many of today's club acts have to bring
along separate sound and lighting engineers. It's costly, but
necessary, to hold the attention of a generation that can quote
chapter and verse from the satirical rock film ``This Is Spinal
Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lion's share of advances have been in the studio.
Presley and other Memphis titans recorded in mono at Sam Phillips's
Sun Studio in the mid-'50s. Then came the three-track studio
consoles used when producer Phil Spector forged his ``wall of
sound'' pop records. And then came the adrenaline rush of the
Beatles (and producer George Martin), who went from four-track
recording on the breakthrough ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band'' (1967) to the first eight-track album, ``Abbey Road''
(1969).
</P>
<P>
   Technology then became a runaway express. The '70s saw the
influx of 16-track recordings, popularized by Steely Dan, then
24-track in the late '70s. There were even a few 40-track consoles.
These, according to Carl Beatty, who teaches recording engineering
at Berklee College of Music, were used by Leon Russell (who would
ask a backup singer to layer 30 tracks of vocals behind his own)
and the British art-pop group, 10cc, whose 1975 hit, ``I'm Not in
Love,'' was similarly layered. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Music's mood swings &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But pop music, being the cyclical beast that it is, swung back
to a minimal use of technology espoused by the punk bands of the
late '70s, such as the Sex Pistols and the Ramones. They didn't
even like guitar solos, labeling them too indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s saw a return to lush productions, along with the
synth-pop era (whose demise was forecast by Keith Richards in 1983
when he said, ``All those new effects you could get two or three
years ago _ everybody has heard them now''). A new backlash led to
a surge of stripped-down acoustic records, such as Springsteen's
``Nebraska'' and Tracy Chapman's self-titled debut, whose songs had
been developed when she was a Tufts University student singing in
the streets of Harvard Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a cycle of audiences wanting performers to be
larger than life and different from them, to be glamorous like
Mariah Carey,'' says producer Denneen. ``And then a cycle of
audiences saying, `No, we want performers to be just like us,
because anybody can be in a band.' You see that cycle repeated
constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came digital sound _ leading up to the 48-track digital
recordings that are popular today _ with its own inevitable
counter-reaction in the grunge era of the early '90s. That was
spearheaded by Kurt Cobain's Nirvana and other Seattle groups such
as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. They restored the
primacy of the electric guitar, along with lyrics that came from
the street and from the heart, not from some pompous songwriting
hack.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of hip-hop was also sparked by technology. Sampling
devices enabled rappers to set up computerized beats and edit
sampled sounds plucked from soul pioneers from James Brown to
George Clinton's P-Funk. Pop fusionist Beck made this approach
palatable to rock audiences in his landmark ``Odelay'' CD in 1966.
It was a sonic collage of surprises, such as applying hip-hop beats
to a country melody.
</P>
<P>
   As the new millennium approaches, there's now a device called
the autotuner, which corrects the pitch of a singer, both in the
studio and in concert. It was used by Cher on her recent album,
which shouldn't surprise anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest hope for the next millennium is the way that costs
have decreased in recording studios, enabling young bands to make
records that sound just as good as those made by superstars. A
company called Tascam will soon market a digital, 24-track
hard-disc recorder for just $4,000, which could render high-priced
studios obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the cost structure changing the industry, because it's
getting so unbelievably cheap,'' says Berklee engineer Beatty.
``It's a fertile period. Things are happening so fast.''

AN AMERICAN CLASSIC IN WAR AND PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EISENHOWER 
By Geoffrey Perret. Random House. 
685 pp. Illustrated. $35. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We knew him as the irresistible hero of World War II, the
architect of the North Africa offensive and D-Day. As the commander
of NATO when Berlin was a flashpoint in the early days of the Cold
War. As the genial president whose easygoing ways _ the shopworn
aphorisms, the graceful golf stroke _ symbolized America in the
1950s. We knew him, mostly, as Ike.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at century's end, comes a new biography of Dwight D.
Eisenhower, written by Geoffrey Perret, befitting the New Look that
Ike pushed at the Pentagon and the new look that historians,
commentators, and political professionals are taking at the
president who, until recently, was known primarily as the
placeholder between Truman and Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The new, refurbished Ike is a visionary, a strong and
decisive president in his own right, just as cagey as Truman, just
as charismatic as Kennedy, and maybe more nearly indispensable than
either of them. This Ike is a man for whom it can be said _ unlike
the current incumbent _ that the presidency was the culmination of
a lifetime of experiences, not a formative experience in its own
right.
</P>
<P>
   This new life of Eisenhower, appearing just two decades after
the monumental two-volume biography by Stephen Ambrose, is a
breezier, more compact version, lacking in the details and, on
occasion, the bite that gave the Ambrose books their distinction.
No matter. Perret has examined documents and source material
unavailable to Ambrose and, of course, writes with two decades'
more perspective. Inevitably the experience of the Clinton
presidency, animated by chaos theory, has shaped Perret's (and our
own) view of Eisenhower, who was nothing if not steady and sure,
and who was not much for either chaos or theory.
</P>
<P>
   In myth and memory, Eisenhower was not a complicated man, but
Perret reminds us that he was the son of a mother whose impulse ran
to pacifism, a man whose autobiography oddly begins not in Abilene
but at West Point, and one whose early life, like so many great
generals', was a portrait in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower's frustration came not from drink nor from defeat,
but from dreariness. He ached for the front in World War I and
never saw it, and though he trained hundreds of soldiers and
readied tank battlions for combat overseas, he didn't receive
orders to depart for France until November 1918. That was the month
the war ended. But he was dashing and he was dedicated, and he
learned to wait his turn. It came in command, not in combat.
</P>
<P>
   His great role came not in Washington but in London. Here is
Perret's description of Eisenhower's arrival in England, when he
and the Allies were haunted by tragedy even as they were preparing
for triumph: ``an avatar in khaki, brass buttons and a rainbow
smear of medal ribbons, the manifest form of the assurance of
victory, with all the power of America at his back.''
</P>
<P>
   In England he struggled with Winston Churchill, struggled with
his own doubts as he pressed ahead with the strategic plan for
Allied forces in the battle of North Africa, and struggled with
Charles de Gaulle and French sensibilities, a political problem
that, up to the very night of the invasion, preoccupied Eisenhower
_ and was precursor to graver, more consequential political
challenges he would face two years later in the invasion of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For Eisenhower was a military man with a political job. Indeed,
his political skills were a match for his military skills, and they
were brought to bear with de Gaulle, Churchill, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, George Marshall, Omar Bradley, and Bernard Montgomery.
(Three months after D-Day, with the Allies deep into Europe, Ike
touched the field marshal's knee and said: ``Steady, Monty. You
can't speak to me like that. I'm your boss.'')
</P>
<P>
   He suppressed (though never conquered) tensions by creating a
chain of command where each American would have a British officer
above him and another one below him; as a consequence, each British
officer had an American above him and an American below. The result
was, as Perret explains, ``to take combined arms to a level that no
one had ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   The big challenge, of course, was Overlord, the hugely
complicated, hugely costly, hugely heroic invasion of Europe: more
than 4,000 warships, 3,500 heavy bombers, 1,500 medium bombers,
5,000 fighters, plus the hopes of millions. It remains the greatest
military operation in history, and, revisionism be damned, it
remains the greatest moment of Eisenhower's career.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this Ike developed his own leadership style but,
more important, his own decision style. ``It was when Eisenhower's
mind seemed made up that he was probably still open to new ideas,
and when he sounded undecided, there was a good chance he had
already made a decision,'' Perret writes, explaining that the
peculiar Ike style ``reserved him his freedom of action while he
went about picking other people's brains with the cold-blooded
detachment of a professional burglar.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, too, the open questions were closed, the closed
questions opened. He was a Republican who shored up the New Deal
(his goals included expansion of Social Security and the
establishment of a Department of Health, Education and Welfare). He
was a warrior who abhorred war and looked skeptically on the Cold
War the United States and the Soviet Union were prosecuting. Listen
to Eisenhower: ``This world in arms is not spending money alone. It
is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its
scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy
bomber is this _ a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.''
</P>
<P>
   His mind was supple enough to argue for reduced levels of
military spending but insufficiently supple to see the difference
between the threats the West faced at Munich in 1938 and at Dien
Bien Phu in 1954 (or in Iran and Guatemala). And yet he left the
nation with a priceless gift, a farewell address quoted,
astonishingly, as often as Washington's, with his warnings about
``the conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large
arms industry'' (his shorthand: ``the military-industrial
complex''), cited for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenhower was an American original and, in Europe as in the
White House, an American symbol. He was the emblem of a native
patriotism and a native savvy. Like the country, he was naive,
optimistic, pragmatic, shrewd, inventive, slow to anger but
fearsome when roused. With an American face, he was, for two
decades, in war and in peace, in uniform and out, the face of
America.

DON MCKELLAR: PLAYING THE ENDGAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Don McKellar was writing ``Last Night,'' a movie set during
the putative last six hours on earth, he was thinking of calling it
``Whimper'' _ as in, the world ends not with a bang, but with a
whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unpopular title,'' McKellar says, dryly, over a
steak at a recent interview in the Back Bay. ``My distributor was
not very happy with that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Last Night'' it became. But ``Last Night,'' which opens
Friday, is not exactly an ``Armageddon,'' ``Deep Impact,'' or
``Independence Day'' kind of movie. No bigtime smash-it-up special
effects. No Harrison Ford, Will Smith, or Bruce Willis playing a
Mighty Mouse kind of hero, rushing in to save the day. Frankly, for
an end-of-the-world movie, ``Last Night'' is rather low on
explosions and mayhem. For budget reasons, yes (it cost just under
$2 million to make), but also by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought I would love to do that (even) if I had
the budget,'' says McKellar, who directed and stars in the film.
``The idea was to make a more intimate film by making it not about
what is happening, but about the people.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellar, 36, plays the lead character, Patrick, who is trying
to decide how to spend his Last Night, as is everyone else in the
movie. Patrick's first choice is solitude, but it's not a goal he
will be able to achieve. Some of his friends, acquaintances, and
strangers make choices such as these: Craig (Callum Keith Rennie)
wants to enjoy as many choice permutations of sexual intercourse as
he can, including a go-round with his former French teacher
(Genevieve Bujold); Duncan, a gas-company employee (played by
director David Cronenberg) calls customers assuring them they can
count on uninterrupted service right until the end; Jennifer (Sarah
Polley) wants to party; Patrick's parents and relatives want to
re-create Christmas festivities; Sandra (Sandra Oh) wants
desperately to get across town to spend the evening with her
husband. And, yes, some of the folks in the background, out on the
street, opt for that perennial apocalyptic favorite, looting and
pillaging.
</P>
<P>
   One curious bit about the film is that the reason the world is
ending is never defined. ``It was not the point,'' says McKellar,
``and I thought it would have been a distraction for the audience
to be wondering what was going on _ `Can this happen? What is Bruce
Willis doing?' I did not want the audience thinking about that. And
also, I didn't want the characters to be discussing that on the
last day.''
</P>
<P>
   He also avoided the usual disaster-movie cliche of having, as
McKellar puts it, ``some lame exposition with some news broadcaster
explaining the science.'' What he aimed for when the camera
ventures outside was ``that stark, empty, sort of paranoid look.''
</P>
<P>
   But McKellar's people are not behaving as if they were in an
updated ``Road Warrior.'' ``It is Canada,'' he says, with a laugh.
``Americans always ask: `Where is the violence? Where is the
violence?' ''
</P>
<P>
   McKellar's working premise was that his characters had known
about the end of the world for three or four months and had dealt
with the ``disbelief and denial and the panic. They are at a point
now where they have come to terms with it. I'm not suggesting
that's true of society, but of the people I'm focusing on.'' All of
McKellar's characters, he says, ``eventually deviate from their
plan, and all of them benefit from it, to some degree. It is the
end of the world, and being open to it, to other humans in
difficult situations.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, says McKellar, ``some comic effects and absurd
angles'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   McKellar, who says he was a class clown in school, is himself a
witty, self-deprecating chap, negotiating the baby steps of stardom
with some hesitancy. ``I am fairly privileged to be making
movies,'' he says: He enjoys the travel that comes with the
business, the fancy hotel suites studios put him in. Home life?
``The apartment is a little messy,'' he says. He lives with a
2-year-old black-and-white female cat named Stinky he found at a
bar. He has just broken up with a girlfriend.

   Prior to ``Last Night,'' McKellar earned kudos for his work as a
screenwriter for ``The Red Violin'' and ``Thirty Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould.'' Heady stuff. The first film he ever appared in
was a cheapie called ``Road Kill,'' which also featured former
Ramones singer Joey Ramone. Cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' takes place on McKellar's native turf, Toronto,
which has frequently been used as Anycity for Hollywood
productions. He says some Canadians watching the film laughed
happily, in suprise, when actual Toronto streets and locations were
noted _ imagine, Toronto playing Toronto!
</P>
<P>
   McKellar, who was born in the city and attended the University
of Toronto, says the natives have gotten over the buzz of having
their city featured in movies. He admits he was probably not the
most popular guy in town when he shot a demolished-streetcar scene
that closed down streets and brought a fire engine to the site
three times in one day.
</P>
<P>
   McKeller _ whose most recent acting credit was playing a creepy
high-tech game-maker in Cronenberg's ``eXistenZ'' _ did not
initially envision himself as the lead actor in ``Last Night.'' He
says he thought he'd play the part of the sex-obsessed Craig _
``He's more like me in real life. But my French producer suggested
the other part was better. I thought it was a way of throwing
myself right in the middle of the film with no one else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, pretty scared,'' McKellar says, about
shouldering the writing/directing/acting yoke. ``I was most scared
about the acting thing, because I thought it would be difficult for
the other actors because actors are afraid to comment on their
peers' performances. I think overcoming my fear of megalomania was
part of it. But I made sure I had actors that I trusted both in
their skill and in their person. I did not want to have any big
strange egos, and I had worked with a number of them before.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronenberg, whom McKellar calls ``the godfather of the Canadian
scene,'' was cast as the soft-spoken gas company worker. ``He's
very articulate, very controlled,'' says McKellar, ``and yet he
makes these (weird) movies, and you can see that going on'' within
him.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a character to Canadian films in general, McKellar
says, it would be ``our most successful films have been fairly
unnusual films. They're indie films by definition, they come out of
a more renegade (mindset), closer to regional film-makers like
David Lynch or George Romero. Outsider cinema. On the other hand, I
think there is something of a historical affinity for European
cinema and a closer emotional connection there than a lot of
American indie guys have. I think we are not generally as tempted
by genre pieces. `Last Night' is, theoretically, a genre. I won
this award at a sci-fi festival in Portugal and I thought, `I guess
it's science-fiction, I never really thought about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McKellar has been living with ``Last Night'' for a couple of
years, and has discovered ``directing is sort of the first thing I
want to do. I have got to get that going because it is such a
long-term process; once I get that going I will relax and be able
to work.'' He says he is writing a script now, but elects not to
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   A question McKellar is always asked in connection to ``Last
Night'': What would he really do if the world were ending in six
hours?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to say, in a way,'' McKellar answers. ``I
feel closer to Patrick now, but they all come from me and I
sympathize with all of them. I don't think there's anyone in the
movie I find completely alien. So, I guess the answer is I would do
a mixture of all those things.

   NEW RELEASES: ``Tea With Mussolini'' (DVD) _ Despite a fine
cast, headed by Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and Joan Plowright (who
pitch a shutout against the two Americans, Cher and Lily Tomlin),
Franco Zeffirelli's pre-World War II recollections all seem
unconnected and, frankly, undramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' _ Not quite as groovy
as the original, but Mike Myers is a very funny, courageous star.
Who else would have the nerve to look so dorky? Those teeth! That
hair!
</P>
<P>
   ``The Barry Levinson Collection'' _ This set, priced at under
$45, includes ``Avalon,'' ``Diner,'' and ``Tin Men.'' The
Baltimore-based director made these three autobiographical movies
in his hometown. The fourth, ``Liberty Heights,'' opens in theaters
on Friday. While ``Avalon'' doesn't quite make it, ``Diner'' and
``Tin Men'' are two of the best working-class comedies around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Picture Show'' (DVD) _ Peter Bogdanovich took
Hollywood by storm with this provocative adaptation of the Larry
McMurty novel that captured the stark beauty and deep-seated drama
of growing up in a small town in Texas. Cybil Shepherd, Jeff and
Beau Bridges, Cloris Leachman, and Ben Johnson head up a terrific
ensemble cast, and Bogdanovich offers illuminating commentary.

   Testing. Please ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! ``Anywhere But Here'' Old-fashioned mother-daughter soap
opera, done as well as it can be, thanks to Susan Sarandon's
performance as the restless single mom who grows from being
perceived as an airhead by her daughter to being perceived as the
earth mother she is. Natalie Portman's offspring, often finding
herself trapped in adult-child role reversals, is in all respects a
match for her mom in heart, intelligence, and big-screen-filling
personality. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   !!! ``Dogma'' Sweet, clunky, earnest, and often very funny mix
of heaven and earthiness as demons and angels duke it out en route
from Wisconsin to New Jersey. Kevin Smith's often profane but
always sincere satire stars Linda Fiorentino as Christ's
descendant, Chris Rock as the 13th Apostle, Alanis Morissette as
God _ and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as bad-news angelic exiles
trying to blast their way back into heaven. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !! ``Finding North'' He's gay and suicidal, since his lover has
just died of AIDS. She's straight and tired of her dead-end life as
a bank teller and the daughter of disappointed parents _ but she's
not despondent. They bond. They take a trip to rural Texas, on a
sort of scavenger hunt/sentimental journey guided posthumously by
his dead lover. They bond some more. You stop caring somewhere in
there. (Unrated) (Jim Sullivan)
</P>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Light It Up'' The warmth and energies of a strong
ensemble cast (led by Usher Raymond and Rosario Dawson) carry this
well-intended film about six kids who inadvertently find their
reasonable demands on a run-down high school escalate into a siege
situation. The rigging is transparent, which is another way of
saying the film plays like a connect-the-dots TV movie. But at
least it's about something and deals in positive values, as opposed
to the usual exploitation. (R)
</P>
<P>
   ! 1/2 ``The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc'' Lots of epic
sweep and energetic battle scenes can't conceal the deficiency at
the center of this homemade take on France's legendary hero. Milla
Jovovich looks good _ too good, if you count her hairstyles _ but
she simply hasn't the acting range or depth to give us the barest
hint of Joan's spirituality or the kind of passion it ignited.
There have been worthwhile films about Joan of Arc, but this one,
directed by Luc Besson, isn't among them. (R)
</P>
<P>
   !!! 1/2 ``Train of Life'' It's 1941, and Jewish villagers in an
Eastern European town respond to rumors about deportation by
pretending to be deported. They load up on a train, some of them
impersonate Nazis, and they take off for Palestine by way of
Russia. Plausible? No, but writer/director Radu Mihaileanu (a
Romanian refugee) successfully shuffles humor and harsh reality _
and a resonant ending _ to make a Holocaust-tinged comedy that's
much better than ``Life Is Beautiful.'' (R) (Jim Sullivan)

BACALL GETS READY FOR BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first floor of the building that houses the
Manhattan Theater Club, construction workers are busily creating
this city's latest theme restaurant. It's the World Wrestling
Federation night spot where fans will eventually arm wrestle their
waiters and waitresses for the check. Just down the block, teen
sensation Britney Spears is putting in an appearance at the
headquarters of VH1.
</P>
<P>
   But upstairs at the MTC, a company of actors whose cumulative
ages add up to more than half a millennium are reinvigorating
``Waiting in the Wings,'' a Noel Coward play that had a brief run
nearly 50 years ago in London, and has began a two-week,
pre-Broadway run in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Bacall, Rosemary Harris, Rosemary Murphy, Fionnula
Flanagan, Dana Ivey, Barnard Hughes, and several other stars are
listening to director Michael Langham, whose previous credits
include ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' ``St. Joan,'' and
``Timon of Athens,'' all of which received Tony nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Cohen, the legendary producer of dozens of Broadway
hits, ranging from Richard Burton's ``Hamlet'' to ``Beyond the
Fringe,'' sits with colleague Chase Mishkin outside the door
waiting for Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old play with an elderly cast, but when the question of
age comes up, Cohen is quick to counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not running a geriatric ward,'' says the erudite Cohen.
``We're getting a play together for Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting in the Wings'' is a chestnut that's making its
American debut some 25 years after the author's death. It's set in
a rest home for retired actresses unaccustomed to waiting. Bacall
and Harris portray performers who, thanks to a long-simmering feud,
haven't spoken in decades. In this new edition, the play is being
polished up by playwright Jeremy Sams and brought to life by this
stellar cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know when they're going to break?'' asks Cohen, of a
production assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any moment, sir,'' comes the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this the old-fashioned way,'' says Cohen. ``We're
bringing it to Boston as a preview. The Boston audience closely
parallels the New York audience.'' Cohen then slips into evocative
recollections of late-night reworkings over sandwiches at Jacob
Wirth's and rewritings in suites at the Ritz. ``I brought about 25
plays to Boston over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the door sweeps open and a pride of lionized actresses
emerges. It's theater's equivalent of baseball's team of the
century. The sharp and sprightly Rosemary Harris emerges followed
by a pensive Rosemary Murphy and a smiling Fionnula Flanagan.
There's Patricia Conolly and Elizabeth Wilson. And Dana Ivey.
</P>
<P>
   Bacall, dressed in black from head to toe, as if she were still
doing those fabulous ads for what becomes a legend most, makes her
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only have 10 minutes,'' says the star who was born Betty
Joan Perske, ``and then it's back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacall is back on Broadway, a place she dominated nearly 30
years ago with her Tony Award-winning performance in ``Applause.''
Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just crazed,'' she laughs. It's that deep, throaty,
intelligent, sincere laugh we've heard so many times in films,
beginning with her startling screen debut at 20 opposite Humphrey
Bogart in ``To Have and Have Not'' (1944). ``It's damned hard work.
But that's what I've done all my life is work. What else is there?
Retire? What's that? I'm not going to enjoy going to lunch and
cocktail parties. Retire? What the hell's that about? Christ
Almighty, why should I spend my whole life trying to reach a goal
and as soon as I reach it quit? The idea isn't to stop as soon as
you can but to keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a hint of lipstick, Bacall doesn't appear to wear any
makeup and, while she has a deserved reputation as a fashion plate,
she seems comfortable wearing black slacks and a matching sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy ensemble work,'' she says, without a hint of
facetiousness. ``I don't want to be the whole cheese. It really is
fun, and if I'm ever going to do it again the time is now. I'm no
spring chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a personal reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noel Coward was a friend . . . a wonderful friend,'' she says,
between swigs of bottled water. ``Last week, they did a revival of
a TV version of his `Blithe Spirit' at the Museum of Radio and
Television History. I was in it and they asked me to talk about it.
I did. It was fun. Noel has such a gift. When Noel was writing this
one he got slightly depressed about all these women retiring to a
rest home. But there's such a wonderful rhythm to the lines and
language. And then you have us seven nuts running around. It's very
funny. And we're not interchangeable, which is one of the terrific
things about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacall pauses. ``I guess sometimes I wish I spent more time with
the children, but what can you do? Mothers are impossible. Children
are impossible. It's an impossible relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two children with Humphrey Bogart are doing well. Her son,
Steven, is a producer at NBC News, and daughter Leslie is a yoga
therapist in California. Sam Robards, her other son, whose father
is Jason Robards, is a respected actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't let me help him,'' says Bacall. ``Not even a phone
call. Leslie's always doing things to help people. She didn't get
all her generosity from me. Bogie's father was a doctor _ maybe
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   She pauses. Each time the name of her first husband is mentioned
it's as if she switches emotional channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of how young I was when all this started,'' says
the star who just celebrated her 75th birthday. ``I'd go into
Howard Hawks's office and there'd be William Faulkner one day and
Raymond Chandler the next. And there was Bogie and all his friends.
Sometimes I feel like I must be 500 years old. Suddenly I feel as
if I've lived so many different lives. Now, especially in
television, the important thing is to get a name on a parking
space. Everything's sound bites. That's what's good about being
back on stage. Solid writing. There's an intelligence in the
theater. I get letters from young children who have seen the old
movies and write and want to know why they don't have movies like
them anymore. It's very rewarding to get the letters.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you say when you write them back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Write them back?'' she asks with a huffy laugh. ``I've got
better things to do with my time than write to teenage girls. But
that doesn't mean I don't like getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant returns with a cardboard bowl of chicken soup and
a red Delicious apple. The designated 10 minutes has drifted into
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bacall stares at the container.
</P>
<P>
   She carefully picks up the plastic spoon with long fingers that
are decorated with several ornate gold rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no noodles,'' she barks, while stirring
disdainfully. ``A cardboard bowl of soup with no noodles . . . even
though I asked for chicken noodle soup. . . . I guess that's what
it means to be a stahr.''
</P>
<P>
   In that one moment, the dichotomy of Bacall crystalizes. She is
certainly proud of being who she has become and yet she also sees
the other side of herself. The Betty Joan Perske side that sees the
ironic, silly, and funny angle of Lauren Bacall's stardom.
</P>

   A few nights earlier, Bacall appeared at a star-studded New York

   ``I love Teddy,'' she says, referring to Massachusetts's senior
senator. ``Let's not denigrate liberalism. Liberals have done more
for this country than the Republicans any day. What did Trent Lott
ever do? I love Teddy because he fought the good fight against
these people. He's the only one up there who isn't afraid of being
a liberal. Since Roosevelt, the liberals have done everything to
help people in this country. And I hear Patrick (Kennedy's son) is
doing great things in Rhode Island.''

THE FABULOUS HISTORY OF THE DISMAL SWAMP COMPANY 
A Story of George Washington's Times 
By Charles Royster 
Knopf, 622 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Great Dismal Swamp, some 106,000 acres of cypress swamps on
the Virginia-North Carolina border populated by deer and otters,
bobcats and bears, and hordes of mosquitoes is today a national
wildlife refuge. But in the late 1700s it was a land speculator's
dream, where a scheme to drain the swamp for farmland promised
investors a 900 percent profit in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the colonial gentry who were lured into this ``land
of promise'' got rich _ and more than a few went bankrupt _ but the
story of the company formed to develop the swamp has provided
Charles Royster, a professor of history at Louisiana State
University, with a marvelously realized opportunity to explore a
society based on a culture of conspiculous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The initial scheme involved transporting hundreds of slaves into
camps in the swamp where they would clear the land and cut drainage
ditches _ even though it was acknowledged that the swamp's
``malignant vapours'' would kill many of them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1764, George Washington, acting for the company, had the task
of ``collecting slaves from members'' of the company. But
suggesting the skepticism of even its investors, many sent slaves
who one observer called ``the worst collection that was ever made _
they seemed to be the refuse of every one of the estates from
whence they were sent.'' Work moved slowly with the only income
coming from the felling of ancient white cedars for shingles, a
forerunner of the logging that was the final commercial enterprise
in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was only one of a number of men, including Patrick
Henry and Thomas Jefferson, whose reputations survived their
involvement with the Dismal Swamp Company. The most intriguing
figure who emerges from the story is one whose primary interest was
not getting rich quick. Dr. Thomas Walker had studied in
Williamsburg and married into wealth, but was a man, writes
Royster, ``whose blue eyes looked across many western vistas'' as
surveyor for various land companies.
</P>
<P>
   He strides in and out of the story, a true frontiersman dwarfing
the planters and politicians for whom he worked. He celebrated his
65th birthday, Royster writes, on an extended surveying mission
during the winter of 1780. It was the coldest winter in 40 years
and Walker's party was snowbound for weeks, burning fires night and
day. ``Dr. Walker, lover of tall stories and practical jokes,
allowed no gloom'' even if the weather prevented him from pulling
``one of his favorite stunts: boiling a rattlesnake in a coffeepot,
serving coffee, then pulling out the dead snake.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real action was miles away from the ``malignant
vapours'' and ``noisome exhalations'' of the swamp, in London
trading houses and on the Tidewater plantations where a
status-yearning gentry were transplanting the excesses of English
aristocracy _ and losing fortunes in the process. And this, the
story behind the story, is fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   There was William Byrd, the originator of the 900 percent profit
scheme. His estate, Westover, boasted a naked Venus that the family
claimed to be the work of Titian. When his son's widow died in
1813, an observer noted that while Byrd was ``a magnificent prince
himself, his children and grandchildren (had become) beggars.''
Mann Page's Rosewell boasted a checkerboard floor with ``tiles of
English Purbeck white stone and black Belgian marble.'' But he died
in debt, and when his grandson and heir died some 80 years later,
his widow wrote that ``to clear the estate from debt is my first
object.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Enterprising men with capital,'' writes Royster, got rich
through speculation in slaves, buying dozens at a time at a
discount, then selling them one by one at 25 to 50 percent profit.
Planters, already in debt, would have sold their tobacco crop and
used the cash not to pay off those debts but to buy slaves _ who
might end up being mortgaged, along with the land they worked, in
order to pay off those debts.
</P>
<P>
   The vast expanses of land that fueled this social economy are
beyond comprehension today. Before the Revolution, land companies
and individual speculators were obtaining royal charters granting
them land that was measured in the tens of thousands of acres in
Virginia and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was to be a Land of Eden _ as early investors
believed the Dismal Swamp would be _ it lay to the west. And that
is where many of the company's investors and their heirs headed in
the years after the Revolution, leaving disappointment and debt
behind.

THE TRADITION REMAINS VITAL AND UNPREDICTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is sometimes said that 20th-century music began at the
riotous premiere of Igor Stravinsky's ``Le Sacre de Printemps'' in
1913. But you could also claim that it began with Strauss's
``Salome'' in 1905, or Charles Ives's ``Variations on `America' ''
for organ, which was written in 1891 _ or for that matter, if we
are talking about ``modernity'' of sound, one could cite some of
the madrigals of Gesualdo, collected in 1611.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini's ``Tosca'' was probably the earliest masterpiece to
appear in this century, though not everyone thought so at the time.
The premiere came Jan. 14, 1900 in Rome, and when the opera was
played in London a year later, one critic wrote it was ``brutal . .
. demoralizing . . . induced a feeling of nausea. . . . What has
music to do with a lustful man chasing a defenseless woman or the
dying kicks of a murdered scoundrel?'' This doesn't sound all that
different from the fulminations of critics of popular culture today
_ or some of the complaints following the Boston Symphony
Orchestra's performances of Oliver Knussen's ``Where the Wild
Things Are'' a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   History (and within it, the history of music) doesn't fall
conveniently into centuries, though centuries do seem to reflect
biorhythms, the way people do. Music that bade poignant farewell to
the 19th century _ like Mahler's Ninth Symphony, first performed
posthumously in 1912, and sounded unimaginably difficult at the
time _ now speaks with particular directness to music lovers at the
close of the 20th.
</P>
<P>
   The music of the first half of our century has been seen as some
kind of battleground between Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, or
between their supporters. Schoenberg carried the implications of
Wagner's ``Tristan'' chord to its logical conclusion in atonality,
and the organization of atonality into system. He felt it was a
historical necessity to do so, and it was not a burden he carried
lightly. If there was a battle, there wasn't a winner; Stravinsky
wrote 12-tone masterpieces late in his life, and Schoenberg
``returned'' to tonality in certain of his late works _ and both
composers always sounded like themselves in whatever they wrote. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Villains of the century &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simple-minded commentary has cast Schoenberg, or his followers,
as the villains of the century. The myth goes that only the
free-spirited composers of the very recent past have escaped the
``stranglehold'' of '50s academicism by responding to the basic
elements of music (as in the school of ``minimalism'') or by
assimilating the musical achievements of popular culture (which has
been going on since medieval and Renaissance composers put ``pop''
material like dances into counterpoint with Gregorian chant; Bach's
``Goldberg'' Variations end with two folksongs in counterpoint). A
lot of the controversy came from outside the musical world;
composers themselves tend to be curious about everything that's
going on around them _ Puccini attended the Italian premiere of
Schoenberg's ``Pierrot lunaire.'' Schoenberg himslf famously
remarked that there was a lot of good music still to be written in
the key of C major; the unspoken corollary was that there is still
a lot of good music still to be written in other tonal and
non-tonal systems. A lot of argument could have been circumvented
by making the concession that technique and style are elements of
musical value, but not the only ones; talent and urgency count,
too. Twelve-tone masterpieces like Berg's ``Wozzeck'' and Violin
Concerto have entered the standard repertory, and their descendents
and successors will too, if they continue to compel the attention
of performers and of audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Most generalizations about historical periods don't hold up. It
is a commonplace to observe, for example, that the 19th century was
the golden age of the symphony, which has come under threat in our
own _ but Shostakovich and Prokofiev wrote all of their symphonies
in this century, Sibelius all but one of his. For years, it was
claimed that Puccini's ``Turandot'' (1926) was the last opera to
enter the international standard repertory. But then ``Wozzeck,''
``Peter Grimes,'' ``Les Dialogues des Carmelites,'' and
``Mahagonny'' became more familiar in the international repertory,
and part of the cherished experience of most operagoers, and each
country also produced its own national repertory of favorites
(``Porgy and Bess,'' ``The Ballad of Baby Doe,'' and ``Susannah''
are American examples). As in previous centuries, it takes time,
often decades, for the public to catch up to the musical thinking
of the most original and challenging composers. Janacek and Ives,
for example, wrote their music in the first half of this century,
but became national and international figures only in the second
half, and there's little question that some composers the 21st
century will come to value highly are little-known today. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Effects of war &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The central historical events of the 20th century, the two world
wars, profoundly affected musical development. In the most basic
sense, the wars interrupted _ or, in many tragic cases, ended _ the
creativity of gifted musicians who might have contributed more to
musical history, or changed it. Only now is some of the most
important music written during and before World War II coming to
attention. That war in particular altered American musical life for
several generations because of the arrival in this country of
composers (Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Bartok, Hindemith, Weill),
conductors, instrumentalists, and a whole support system of
managers, critics, and other members of a discerning,
public-spirited audience. This infusion of talent revived a musical
culture that had been severely threatened in the period of the
Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Some things did not change during this century. Throughout most
of it, most music remained specifically national in character and
culture even as it sought to transcend national boundaries; the
universal lies in the particular. It takes only a few bars to
recognize Bartok as Hungarian, Shostakovich as Russian; Ravel,
Poulenc, Dutilleux, or Boulez as French. The 12-tone composer Luigi
Dallapiccola sounds as Italian as Puccini. Some composers, like
Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, George Gershwin, and Leonard
Bernstein set out quite self-consciously to create an ``American''
music; other American composers, like Roger Sessions, resisted such
impulses and tried to compose in an ``international'' vein _
although, with distance, it is hardly possible to hear Sessions as
any less ``American'' than Copland.
</P>
<P>
   Also, composers continued to choose the audience they wrote for.
Some tried to write for a large public and sought popular appeal;
others pursued advanced musical thought wherever it led them, and
wrote for a small and musically sophisticated audience. What was
important was to compose from inner imperative. Problems arose only
when composers didn't want to live with the consequences of their
decisions _ when advanced composers hankered after larger
audiences, or popular composers complained about lack of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Popularity and immediate appeal are dangerous criteria for
musical quality. Some very great music has held such appeal; Verdi
is a prime example, as Shakespeare and Dickens were in literature.
It is equally certain that some very great music never did.
Beethoven's ``Wellington's Victory'' was one of the great success
of his lifetime. Today the piece is a minor curiosity _ and
audiences and dedicated performers are still grappling with the
meaning of his late string quartets. Popularity doesn't always
last, and the winds of fashion blow reputations around. Victor
Herbert, for example, would have appeared on any list of the most
successful and popular American composers between 1900 and 1920;
his music, and his brand of sentiment, now appeal only to nostalgia
buffs. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I missed out on the early days of television. I
missed out on Chrysler and Ford. This is a possibility of making
money for life,'' said Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, calling from Los Angeles, was referring to her first
foray into the Internet: her role as an equity partner and
spokeswoman for Flooz.com, an online gift-currency program that was
launched in February.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Goldberg isn't financially comfortable. She says she
does ``OK.'' But her venture into cyberspace could catapult her
into the leagues of the Internet rich. She is exchanging her
celebrity status for an undisclosed amount of stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is in the vanguard of personalities who are being
sought by Internet companies not only for their celebrity value,
but for their ``fit'' with a particular site's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Goldberg, for example, Flooz.com sees someone whose
irreverence and sense of fun are compatible with the Web site's
persona. So far, few celebs have actually been signed, and there
are still many Web sites that are waiting and watching before
moving, but word around the Internet companies is that the momentum
is beginning to build.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, while Flooz was breaking its $8 million national
outdoor and TV ad campaign promoting Goldberg, another Web company
called Estyle Inc. was trumpeting its own celebrity catch: Cindy
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   The startup company, which launched a maternity and baby
products site at address babystyle.com in May, toasted the model
and new mother as its latest board member and strategic consultant
at a party at the W Hotel's Whisky Blue here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to get into it,'' said Crawford, adding that
she had studied other Web opportunities before signing on with the
privately held Estyle for a piece of the company. How big a piece
no one would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside could be huge ... but I'm not looking to buy a Gulf
Stream or anything. This gives me a new dimension to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have started more than a year ago with ``Star Trek''
star William Shatner's radio commercials for Priceline, a Web site
that allows people to bid for airline tickets. And TV ads for
Internet companies have popped up featuring the likes of Geena
Davis and Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet sources expect Goldberg and Crawford, both of whom
see themselves as active business partners in their respective
ventures, could be the real trailblazers in a trend toward a deeper
partnership between celebrity and startup Web firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other startups, including many fashion sites, are now on the
hunt for a household name to act as a spokesman, spokeswoman or
consultant. The goal: to increase market share in an increasingly
competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   They include Beautyjungle.com, a beauty site that wants to hire
an actress or supermodel to star in its February ad campaign, and
Fashion 500, which will be launched early next year and will
include major designer brands.
</P>
<P>
   Others such as Ibeauty.com, Eve.com and Beautyscene.com all say
they are mulling the idea of teaming with a celebrity as an equity
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is very exciting, and the Internet industry has
matured,'' said Lisa Freedman, vice president of marketing at
Styleclick.com, a network of fashion sites. It just signed a deal
to be the e-commerce enabler of Daisy Fuentes.com and other
celebrity sites, and Freedman said she is studying other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all kinds of options in terms of how to
bring our celebrity contacts under our umbrella, including having
them participate as spokespeople,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities can take a company in its early stages and
catapult it into large exposure in a short time,'' said Tim Draper,
who runs his own venture capital firm called Draper, Fisher &AMP;
Jurvetson in San Francisco. It is an investor in Estyle.
</P>
<P>
   Already, executives at Flooz and Estyle said they are seeing an
increase in traffic to their site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at us very differently today than before we had
Whoopi,'' said Robert Levitan, co-founder of Flooz, citing a
traffic increase of 35 percent since the launch of the ad campaign
and what it calls its ``Whoopi gizmo'' on its site. The site
features an animated cartoon of Goldberg, promoting certain items.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, who was a co-founder of IVillage network for women,
added, ``Investors are pleased that Whoopi has given us a vote of
confidence. Consumers look at us with more legitimacy, and they
better understand our brand. This will be our first holiday season
that we are online, and we expect there will be a lot of noise out
there. Whoopi enables us to get above the noise this holiday
season. It helps us to scale faster, and we need to do it this
holiday. We have no time to wait on the Internet. Everything is
urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Estyle founder and chief executive officer Laurie
McCartney, nabbing Crawford has helped ``increase momentum'' in
only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in our traffic,'' McCartney said. ``And
while it is partly due to our increasing our styles on the site,
Crawford has attracted a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The site features Cindy's Corner, where the model dispenses
style advice on maternity and baby clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is under intense pressure,'' said Lars Kry, vice
president of marketing at Beautyjungle.com, which officially
launches next month. ``It is so important to establish yourself
with an upscale image.''
</P>
<P>
   Kry added that Beautyjungle is working with advertising firm
Badger Worldwide to develop a short list of candidates and expects
to find someone within the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like a woman who embraces the values of our customer
... a modern woman who is intelligent and who has a good sense of
humor,'' he said. ``Some celebrities really embrace the idea;
others are apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we interested in celebrities, but celebrities
have been interested in us,'' said Patty Isen, fashion director at
Fashion 500, which has had several meetings with celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give names, but said that she is focusing on
models turned actresses. She added that she is not sure what kind
of role that person will play, but options include having them
serve on the advisory board or making them part of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But hiring a big name won't necessarily mean instant success.
Industry sources say that there has to be a strong connection
between a star and the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the celebrity status will only work if it is
authentic. They have to use celebrities appropriately, and not
overuse them,'' said Judy Newman, a director at Maveron, a venture
capital fund that is an investor in Flooz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, a celebrity will only work if he or she is an
active participant in building a brand presence,'' said venture
capitalist Draper.
</P>
<P>
   Estyle's McCartney, who said she was besieged by Hollywood
agents, believes that Crawford, who gave birth 3 1/2 months ago, is
a perfect fit, who ``really resonates with our consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooz had reportedly been in talks with Lisa Kudrow and Sarah
Jessica Parker, but company officials wanted Goldberg because she
better matched the Flooz attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something magical about her,'' Levitan said. ``Whoopi
is the essence of Flooz. She is funny but smart. She's got attitude
but is dignified. She's on the edge but trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford, said McCartney, ``brings great insight into
fashion and style'' as well as ``great access to vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney added that she was also able to get access to
Crawford's personal stylist, Vivienne Turner, who suggested
featuring certain fashion styles for the pregnant woman: pashmina
shawls, a certain kind of bodyslimmer pantyhose that offers one
clean line, and V-neck cashmere cardigans, with a sexy piece of
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy also told me about these great baby massage oils and a
baby monitor that we now feature on the Web,'' McCartney said. She
added that she plans to use Crawford in Estyle's other fashion
channels as they roll out, but declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was also helpful in critiquing Estyle's advertising
mockups for its radio campaign, which broke a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us how to make the message clearer,'' McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that her venture into Estyle is ``like going to
business school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning a lot about how a company goes public, about the
different issues of stock,'' she said, adding that her role as
spokeswoman for Revlon did not allow her to get into the inner
workings of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who said she calls the Flooz office every couple of
days, said she wants to get ``incredibly involved'' with the
company and would like to get a seat on the board. Currently, she
is on the advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Goldberg, whose only other endorsement is for MCI, has
put her own stamp on the Flooz ad campaign, changing copy and
adding funny lines to most of the TV spots. The campaign broke on
11 cable networks recently, according to Jack Feuer, marketing
director at Flooz.

</P>
<P>
   Not that Goldberg isn't financially comfortable. She says she
does ``OK.'' But her venture into cyberspace could catapult her
into the leagues of the Internet rich. She is exchanging her
celebrity status for an undisclosed amount of stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg is in the vanguard of personalities who are being
sought by Internet companies not only for their celebrity value,
but for their ``fit'' with a particular site's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In Goldberg, for example, Flooz.com sees someone whose
irreverence and sense of fun are compatible with the Web site's
persona. So far, few celebs have actually been signed, and there
are still many Web sites that are waiting and watching before
moving, but word around the Internet companies is that the momentum
is beginning to build.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, while Flooz was breaking its $8 million national
outdoor and TV ad campaign promoting Goldberg, another Web company
called Estyle Inc. was trumpeting its own celebrity catch: Cindy
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   The startup company, which launched a maternity and baby
products site at address babystyle.com in May, toasted the model
and new mother as its latest board member and strategic consultant
at a party at the W Hotel's Whisky Blue here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to get into it,'' said Crawford, adding that
she had studied other Web opportunities before signing on with the
privately held Estyle for a piece of the company. How big a piece
no one would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside could be huge ... but I'm not looking to buy a Gulf
Stream or anything. This gives me a new dimension to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have started more than a year ago with ``Star Trek''
star William Shatner's radio commercials for Priceline, a Web site
that allows people to bid for airline tickets. And TV ads for
Internet companies have popped up featuring the likes of Geena
Davis and Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet sources expect Goldberg and Crawford, both of whom
see themselves as active business partners in their respective
ventures, could be the real trailblazers in a trend toward a deeper
partnership between celebrity and startup Web firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other startups, including many fashion sites, are now on the
hunt for a household name to act as a spokesman, spokeswoman or
consultant. The goal: to increase market share in an increasingly
competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   They include Beautyjungle.com, a beauty site that wants to hire
an actress or supermodel to star in its February ad campaign, and
Fashion 500, which will be launched early next year and will
include major designer brands.
</P>
<P>
   Others such as Ibeauty.com, Eve.com and Beautyscene.com all say
they are mulling the idea of teaming with a celebrity as an equity
partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is very exciting, and the Internet industry has
matured,'' said Lisa Freedman, vice president of marketing at
Styleclick.com, a network of fashion sites. It just signed a deal
to be the e-commerce enabler of Daisy Fuentes.com and other
celebrity sites, and Freedman said she is studying other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at all kinds of options in terms of how to
bring our celebrity contacts under our umbrella, including having
them participate as spokespeople,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities can take a company in its early stages and
catapult it into large exposure in a short time,'' said Tim Draper,
who runs his own venture capital firm called Draper, Fisher &AMP;
Jurvetson in San Francisco. It is an investor in Estyle.
</P>
<P>
   Already, executives at Flooz and Estyle said they are seeing an
increase in traffic to their site.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at us very differently today than before we had
Whoopi,'' said Robert Levitan, co-founder of Flooz, citing a
traffic increase of 35 percent since the launch of the ad campaign
and what it calls its ``Whoopi gizmo'' on its site. The site
features an animated cartoon of Goldberg, promoting certain items.
</P>
<P>
   Levitan, who was a co-founder of IVillage network for women,
added, ``Investors are pleased that Whoopi has given us a vote of
confidence. Consumers look at us with more legitimacy, and they
better understand our brand. This will be our first holiday season
that we are online, and we expect there will be a lot of noise out
there. Whoopi enables us to get above the noise this holiday
season. It helps us to scale faster, and we need to do it this
holiday. We have no time to wait on the Internet. Everything is
urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Estyle founder and chief executive officer Laurie
McCartney, nabbing Crawford has helped ``increase momentum'' in
only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in our traffic,'' McCartney said. ``And
while it is partly due to our increasing our styles on the site,
Crawford has attracted a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The site features Cindy's Corner, where the model dispenses
style advice on maternity and baby clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is under intense pressure,'' said Lars Kry, vice
president of marketing at Beautyjungle.com, which officially
launches next month. ``It is so important to establish yourself
with an upscale image.''
</P>
<P>
   Kry added that Beautyjungle is working with advertising firm
Badger Worldwide to develop a short list of candidates and expects
to find someone within the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like a woman who embraces the values of our customer
... a modern woman who is intelligent and who has a good sense of
humor,'' he said. ``Some celebrities really embrace the idea;
others are apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we interested in celebrities, but celebrities
have been interested in us,'' said Patty Isen, fashion director at
Fashion 500, which has had several meetings with celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to give names, but said that she is focusing on
models turned actresses. She added that she is not sure what kind
of role that person will play, but options include having them
serve on the advisory board or making them part of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But hiring a big name won't necessarily mean instant success.
Industry sources say that there has to be a strong connection
between a star and the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the celebrity status will only work if it is
authentic. They have to use celebrities appropriately, and not
overuse them,'' said Judy Newman, a director at Maveron, a venture
capital fund that is an investor in Flooz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, a celebrity will only work if he or she is an
active participant in building a brand presence,'' said venture
capitalist Draper.
</P>
<P>
   Estyle's McCartney, who said she was besieged by Hollywood
agents, believes that Crawford, who gave birth 3 1/2 months ago, is
a perfect fit, who ``really resonates with our consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Flooz had reportedly been in talks with Lisa Kudrow and Sarah
Jessica Parker, but company officials wanted Goldberg because she
better matched the Flooz attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something magical about her,'' Levitan said. ``Whoopi
is the essence of Flooz. She is funny but smart. She's got attitude
but is dignified. She's on the edge but trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford, said McCartney, ``brings great insight into
fashion and style'' as well as ``great access to vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCartney added that she was also able to get access to
Crawford's personal stylist, Vivienne Turner, who suggested
featuring certain fashion styles for the pregnant woman: pashmina
shawls, a certain kind of bodyslimmer pantyhose that offers one
clean line, and V-neck cashmere cardigans, with a sexy piece of
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy also told me about these great baby massage oils and a
baby monitor that we now feature on the Web,'' McCartney said. She
added that she plans to use Crawford in Estyle's other fashion
channels as they roll out, but declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was also helpful in critiquing Estyle's advertising
mockups for its radio campaign, which broke a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us how to make the message clearer,'' McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that her venture into Estyle is ``like going to
business school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning a lot about how a company goes public, about the
different issues of stock,'' she said, adding that her role as
spokeswoman for Revlon did not allow her to get into the inner
workings of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who said she calls the Flooz office every couple of
days, said she wants to get ``incredibly involved'' with the
company and would like to get a seat on the board. Currently, she
is on the advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Goldberg, whose only other endorsement is for MCI, has
put her own stamp on the Flooz ad campaign, changing copy and
adding funny lines to most of the TV spots. The campaign broke on
11 cable networks recently, according to Jack Feuer, marketing
director at Flooz.

<P>
   When the Spanish actress Penelope Cruz got a call that many
actors wait and wait for, it was she, at the tender age of 18, who
kept the caller waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drying my hair in the toilet, and my boyfriend at the
time told me, `Almodovar is calling.' I said, `Yes, of course,' and
kept drying my hair, thinking he was joking. Finally, I picked it
up after he'd been waiting so long, and he told he wanted me to
audition for `Kika.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz proved too young to play the title role in Almodovar's 1993
film, but the director gave her a small part in ``Live Flesh'' and
eventually offered her a major role in this fall's ``All About My
Mother,'' which debuted to great acclaim at Cannes and opened the
New York Film Festival on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   In it, the beautiful Cruz plays against type: She's a nun who's
had an affair with a drag queen, then learns she is pregnant _ and
dying of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want always to play the pretty woman,'' Cruz says in
her Spanish-tinged English. ``There is always going to be someone
more beautiful. I like to change. I like roles that people don't
recognize me in.''
</P>
<P>
   For his film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel ``All the
Pretty Horses,'' due out next spring, director Billy Bob Thornton
knew right away he wanted Cruz to play the role of a wealthy and
beautiful Mexican girl in love with drifter Matt Damon. The studio,
however, was less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy met me in L.A. one year ago, but for eight months I was
doing tests for the movie. We had to show Columbia that I had
chemistry with Matt, so I flew to Rome, and Anthony Minghella (who
was directing Damon in the upcoming ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'')
directed the audition. We were singing and dancing in that test.
Then we did more tests. Finally, Billy told me I got the part.
Imagine if I hadn't, after all that work!''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who's passing through Los Angeles between Brazil and San
Francisco, where she's shooting ``Woman on Top'' for Fox
Searchlight, adored working with Damon, whom she calls ``very
smart.'' But it was Thornton who won her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great director, actor and writer, and everyone around
him is in awe of him because he does everything, and he does it all
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old actress, who's been working nonstop since she
was 14, has had enough experience to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always very precocious,'' she says. ``I really wanted to
be a dancer, so I went to drama school and danced many hours a day.
Eventually, I had to realize I was getting sick from working too
hard, and I had to choose one career.''
</P>
<P>
   She threw herself headlong into acting. As a teen, she starred
in major European films like ``Jamon Jamon'' and ``Belle Epoque''
and landed her English-language debut last year in Stephen Frears'
``Hi-Lo Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen `Dangerous Liaisons' 14 times,'' she says. ``It's
one of my favorite movies. When he called me, he came to Madrid,
where I live, and we did only one test. The next day he told me I
had the part. So I was spoiled, because I thought it was going to
be so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Pictures president Amy Pascal describes the actress'
appeal this way: ``Penelope Cruz is very sexy, but not threatening
_ both vulnerable and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz blushes a little bit when she hears the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those things about myself,'' she says. ``I know
I've been coquettish since I was 3 years old. I like clothes and I
like seduction in general, but I am like that with everybody:
children, dogs, men and women. I admit I want people to like me _
who doesn't? But not for just the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she makes clear, she remains loyal to her Czech
boyfriend, an assistant director she met on a European film who
shares her house in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke five languages, but he had to learn Spanish after he
met me. Czech is too difficult! We are very different, but I think
that's good. That Spanish temper is too strong to have two Spanish
people together.''

in major European films like ``Jamon Jamon'' and ``Belle Epoque''
and landed her English-language debut last year in Stephen Frears'
``Hi-Lo Country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen `Dangerous Liaisons' 14 times,'' she says. ``It's
one of my favorite movies. When he called me, he came to Madrid,
where I live, and we did only one test. The next day he told me I
had the part. So I was spoiled, because I thought it was going to
be so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Pictures president Amy Pascal describes the actress'
appeal this way: ``Penelope Cruz is very sexy, but not threatening
_ both vulnerable and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz blushes a little bit when she hears the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those things about myself,'' she says. ``I know
I've been coquettish since I was 3 years old. I like clothes and I
like seduction in general, but I am like that with everybody:
children, dogs, men and women. I admit I want people to like me _
who doesn't? But not for just the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she makes clear, she remains loyal to her Czech
boyfriend, an assistant director she met on a European film who
shares her house in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spoke five languages, but he had to learn Spanish after he
met me. Czech is too difficult! We are very different, but I think
that's good. That Spanish temper is too strong to have two Spanish
people together.''

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, general counsel for
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees
public colleges.

CALIFORNIA THREATENS INSURERS OVER HOLOCAUST CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's insurance commission is expected on
Tuesday to subpoena as many as 15 European insurance companies
concerning policies written for the victims of the Holocaust and
their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings are scheduled Dec. 1 and 2 in Los Angeles and San
Francisco, where Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush wants
executives of the companies _ all of which do business in the state
either directly or through U.S. subsidiaries _ to report their
progress in complying with disclosures required by the new
California Holocaust Registry law.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to comply with the requirement, which takes effect on
April 6, 2000, could lead to the revocation of a license to do
business in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (who) believe they are not compelled to turn over their
lists should understand now that they will not long be doing
business in California should they maintain such a defiant
position,'' Quackenbush said last week. ``If there is no compliance
by April 6, we will be throwing these companies out of
California.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Holocaust Registry Law was approved unanimously
by both the Assembly and Senate in September and signed into law by
Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, on Oct. 8. It compels insurance
companies doing business in the state to disclose information about
policies sold in Europe from 1929 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   With the data, the Department of Insurance will create a
Holocaust Insurance Registry for the information and correlate the
names of policyholders with an international registry of Holocaust
victims, seeking matches.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires insurers to certify they have searched for
heirs of Holocaust policyholders and paid claims, or, where heirs
could not be found, paid a comparable amount to a charitable
nonprofit organization assisting Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The same bill was approved unanimously in 1998 and vetoed by
then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, also a Republican, is frustrated by what he
considers the languid pace of the work of an international
commission _ of which he is a member and helped create _ as it
attempts to settle claims from the era. He believes the commission,
which is headed by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
and which includes major European insurers and the World Jewish
Congress, has been compromised by the insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our position that the insurance companies on the vast
majority of issues have been obstructionists in the process,'' said
Richard Mahan, a Los Angeles-based consultant hired by the state to
help settle the claims that date to 60 or more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner does not have a whole lot of confidence in
the international commission and what has been set up for
processing claims,'' Mahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has not provided the commission the claims being
developed in California, preferring to try to settle them
separately. Insurers say this is frustrating the process.
</P>
<P>
   The potential effects of a confrontation between California and
the major insurers are enormous. Quackenbush has particular
interest in several companies with global alliances, such as
Allianz AG, a major German corporation now as well during World War
II, which operates the Fireman's Fund Insurance Companies and
employs 4,000 people in California.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview from Munich on Friday, Allianz
spokesman Nick Tewes said: ``It's too early for us to say
something.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Peter Lefkin, director of government affairs for
Fireman's Fund in Washington, said the company was ``extremely
sensitive to the implications of the California law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The authors of the law and Mr. Quackenbush are aware of the
fact that Fireman's Fund has been in this state since 1863. The
company has enjoyed a reputation as one of the state's premier
insurance carriers, but also has enjoyed an excellent working
relationship with Mr. Quackenbush.''
</P>
<P>
   Eagleburger, chairman of the International Commission on
Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, wrote to Quackenbush on Friday to
say he believes Allianz and the Italian insurance company
Assicurazioni Generali ``deserve to be exempted from subpoenas at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter says that the two companies ``have shown a
willingness to fully cooperate with the processes and funding of
the (commission). Accordingly, they deserve safe haven from the
requirements of California's legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislator who wrote the California Holocaust Registry Law,
Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, expressed less confidence in
the willingness of the European insurers to cooperate in efforts to
compensate Holocaust victims or their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurers' game plan is obvious _ delay until the
claimants, many of whom are elderly already, die or give up,'' Knox
said. ``In the meantime, for appearances' sake, they make a
pretense of cooperating with the international commission without
making any real concessions. The antidote to this strategy is to
exert the unparalleled economic leverage of California state
government over the recalcitrant insurers desiring to do business
in our lucrative market.''
</P>
<P>
   Assicurazioni Generali and other insurance companies contend
that the international commission is the proper venue for resolving
the Holocaust assets issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other insurance companies potentially affected by the California
law are AXA of Paris, which earns half of its foreign income from
U.S.-based The Equitable Companies; Baloise Insurance Group of
Switzerland; Winterthur Swiss Insurance, which has nine
subsidiaries in the United States; and Zurich Financial Services,
which operates Farmers Group Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Holocaust survivors and their relatives have
testified before Quackenbush and other state insurance
commissioners about the refusal of insurance companies to honor
claims. Lack of a death certificate is one reason given even though
they were not issued at concentration camps, Quackenbush said.

more like a global business and are now even undergoing a wave of
consolidation. A handful of mega-firms are being born, offering

OLD CHICKEN COOPS OFFER NESTS FOR ARTISTS, ENTREPRENEURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETALUMA, Calif. _ In years past, when Petaluma's chicken
ranches gave it the nickname ``Egg Basket of the World,'' millions
of chickens sprang from acres of cavernous coops.
</P>
<P>
   The poultry industry has long since flown those coops in
Northern California, leaving them weathered, dilapidated, rotting
from sun and rain. But an underground revolution is taking place on
the old chicken ranches, a quiet effort to reclaim scores of
abandoned coops and barns for a host of feather-free uses.
</P>
<P>
   Artists, artisans and fledgling entrepreneurs are renting them,
scraping off layers of excrement and using them as prized studio
space for pottery schools, yoga centers, recording studios and
other uses. Some of Sonoma County's most successful small
businesses incubated in coops.
</P>
<P>
   In short, chicken coops have become the trendy rural equivalent
of the urban warehouse studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind is blowing through the cracks and there's no
heat and the smell is overwhelming, let me tell you, you really
start to feel the inspiration of the starving artist,'' said
Jennifer Laporte, a painter who rented a coop for $75 a month _
mere chicken feed in the art world. ``There's nothing like working
in a coop to really conjure up that Van Gogh experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, some of these cool coups run afoul of zoning laws in
Sonoma County. Officials are cracking down and forcing the eviction
of some artists, entrepreneurs or their landlords who try to flaunt
regulations that limited commercial uses in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shell game,'' said Ben Neuman, head of code enforcement
for the Sonoma County Permit and Resource Management Department.
``Some of these places are very bold. I went to one where I stood
in the driveway and watched the UPS trucks coming in and out of
there every 15 minutes. We don't go out searching for violations,
but when we get a complaint we don't look the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows for certain what portion of southern Sonoma
County's artists and artisans work out of coops and barns, but it
is estimated about half of the coops are in use. Neuman said coop
and barn use makes up a ``significant amount of our workload.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenants often calculate that the benefits outweigh the inherent
risks of trying to skirt the zoning laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we did the chicken coop dance,'' said Tinalyn Marston,
founder of Pipsqueaks, a company that makes decorative children's
furniture seen in several prestigious catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Eric, started the operation out of their
garage in San Francisco, then moved to Petaluma to get less
expensive work space. And they found it in chicken coops, where
rents were about half the cost of industrial space. Still Marston
admitted there were challenged working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it like inside? The coops are really raw. You can see
sunlight through the walls. The sheep were right next door _ they'd
come into our shop and you'd hear `baa baa baa.' As for plumbing,
there was only a porta-potty and it was really disgusting. Did I
mention the flies? They were so bad they'd drop into the paint cans
and just die. We were always having to pick them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have electricity, but the water was stinky and
copper-colored so we'd always remember to bring in bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Cats would come in at night and leave paw prints all over our
chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we loved it,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the county ordered the coops closed, Pipsqueaks had
grown enough to move into a large industrial space along Petaluma's
riverfront. But the Marstons emphasized that the low overhead
during their ``coop years'' enabled them to make a profit and
expand.
</P>
<P>
   The county is investigating complaints on 65 properties where
farm buildings allegedly are being used illegally as studios,
workshops or dwellings. The officials say they have against twice
that many outfits that were operating illegally in farm buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say they deal most severely with the few landlords
they have found who rent abysmally substandard coop housing to
farmworkers or poor families.
</P>
<P>
   Another high enforcement priority are coops that house sweatshop
manufacturing setups using illegal immigrant labor.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors report recently uncovering one ``extremely
hazardous'' wood manufacturing business where ventilation was so
poor that toilet paper rolls hung from the ceiling: workers were
instructed to pull off some sheets to cover their noses lest they
choke on the thick sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   But many coop landlords and tenants counter that most coops are
used only for artists' work space, and what dangers exist are
exacerbated by the county's refusal to relax its zoning on coops _
a recalcitrance that drives the current economy underground.
</P>
<P>
   Landlords are less likely to be able to hire reputable
contractors to fix a coop being used illegally, making it more
likely that electrical wiring, heating and sanitation are
potentially hazardous, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Petaluma's chicken heyday, of course, has come and gone. In
1930, more than 4 million chickens populated the Petaluma area and
produced many millions of eggs that were shipped around the world.
But the rise of corporate farming put most family farming
operations out of business.

   PIEMONT, Calif. _ A small group of prominent Chinese-Americans,
meeting last year in Foster City, launched an ambitious national
political movement called the ``80-20 Initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Its goal is to convince Asian-Americans to swing 80 percent of
their vote and financial support to the major party presidential
candidate who pledges to support the group's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers figure that if Asian-Americans were to vote as a
powerful 80-20 block, instead of splitting their vote roughly 50-50
as they did in 1992 and 1996, politicians would listen to their
concerns. California, along with New Jersey and New York, are
special targets.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I called the movement ``quixotic, provocative and
pie-in-the-sky.'' As the presidential campaign of 2000 warms up, I
have not fundamentally changed my view, but on Nov. 7 I had an
opportunity to check up on the progress of 80-20. At a gathering in
Danville, the movement's pied piper, S.B. Woo, made a presentation
to local Asian-American political groups. Woo, a professor of
physics at the University of Delaware, is a former Democratic
lieutenant governor as well as an unsuccessful candidate for the
party's U. S. Senate nomination in Delaware. It is his strong
belief that highly qualified Asian-Americans don't have equal
opportunities at the highest positions in the federal government,
academia and the corporate world. They hit the ``glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   One remedy, he believes, is to use the Asian-American
community's growing voting strength and financial resources in ways
that will increase the chances for Asian Americans to win
significant political appointments, including a historic Cabinet
seat, as well as a greater presence on university faculties and
corporate boards and management. The way to do that, he and his
colleagues believe, is by pressuring the next president to support
their goals in return for their votes and money. Presumably, the
president, if he agrees to push the 80-20 agenda, will appoint more
Asian-Americans to major administration positions and push for
Congress to hold hearings on why well-educated Asian-Americans
continue to be excluded from top academic and corporate leadership
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-20 movement began with about 50 individuals, including
Chang-lin Tien, the former chancellor of the University of
California at Berkeley. Through a campaign carried out largely by
electronic mail and the Internet, Woo said the initiative now has
70,000 ``supporters'' with a goal of reaching 100,000 early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-20 leaders have asked all the major party presidential
candidates to pledge their support for the movement. So far, only
Democrat Bill Bradley has done so, according to Woo. Even though he
has not been satisfied with the ``tentative early responses'' of
the Republican candidates and Vice President Al Gore, Woo said, ``I
am not worried,'' in part because it is still early in the
presidential election process.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, the movement wanted to first consolidate
Chinese-American votes and political contributions with other
Asian-American groups signing on later. Woo said 80-20 now has the
support of a Filipino-American organization and a
Pakistani-American group and hopes to sign up Asian-, Indian-, and
Korean-American organizations. He also said the movement just began
a fund-raising drive and in less than 24 hours raised $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   What Woo and his colleagues do not like to discuss is the
breathtaking diversity in the Asian-American community _ and how
wildly unpredictable the voting patterns have been among
Chinese-Americans, Japanese-Americans, Filipino-Americans,
Korean-Americans, Vietnamese-Americans, Indo-Americans and other
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   One need look no further than San Francisco to be perplexed by
the political divisions in the Chinese-American and Asian-American
population, which is about one third of the city's population.
Throughout California, Asian-American votes have been split along
party and ethnic lines in sometimes confusing patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Woo said, ``I am optimistic that 80-20 will attract
more Asian-Americans, because we all want to be first-class
citizens. We have to look at things that unite us and not divide
us.''

   CLINTON-WTO _ ANKARA, Turkey _ The United States and China
struck a landmark trade agreement Monday, opening the way for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization, which oversees
the rules of the road in the global marketplace. President Clinton,
here on a state visit, said the accord, which caps 13 years of
U.S.-China negotiations, would lead to economic growth and new jobs
for American farmers, computer makers and providers of a wide range
of services from telecommunications and entertainment to banking.
It has also gone a long way toward righting badly strained
relations between the United States and the world's most populous
country, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. (Deans, Cox
News Service)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TURKEY _ ANKARA, Turkey _ President Clinton paid tribute
Monday to Turkey's growing strategic value at the crossroads
between Europe and Central Asia. He took aim, however, at Turkey's
poor human rights record, saying ``sovereignty should not be built
on fear,'' in the first speech ever given by a U.S. president to
Turkey's elected Parliament. (Deans, Cox News Service)

<P>
   CLINTON-CYPRUS _ ANKARA, Turkey _ It was ``ping-pong'' diplomacy
that brought the United States and China together three decades
ago. The quest for Mideast peace gave rise to ``shuttle
diplomacy.'' And ``baseball diplomacy'' has provided a tenuous link
between the United States and Cuba. Now, said President Clinton,
``earthquake diplomacy'' has opened a window for Greece and Turkey
to settle longstanding disputes that have been a thorn in the side
of NATO for decades. (Deans, Cox News Service)

   TEACHER-GRADES _ WASHINGTON _ Your state's efforts to improve
teacher quality are graded in a report card to be issued Monday by
the conservative education reformers in the Washington office of
the Dayton-based Thomas B. Fordham Foundation. Ohio gets a D-plus,
but other Cox states rank very high: Texas (A) ranks first; Florida

   HOMESTEAD _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate has approved a limit of
$100,000 in a home that can be shielded from creditors in a

that currently protect a home's entire value. (Malone, Cox News

   GA-FIRE _ ATLANTA _ The U.S. Forest Service brought in fire
crews from California late Sunday and was expecting more
reinforcements today to help battle two forest fires that have
charred more than 450 acres in the Blood Mountain Wilderness Area
of northeast Georgia. Two crews were enroute from Puerto Rico, and
the rest would come from ``wherever they can be found,'' an
official said. The fires are near the popular Appalachian Trail,
but hikers should not be in any danger. Some houses are near one of
the fires, but were not threatened. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TEX-BROWN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ He's one of a select club in Texas,
a state senator whose imprint is on most of the environmental
legislation passed in the last two decades. He's talked about as a
candidate for lieutenant governor. But Sen. Buster Brown's had a
tough year, defending against charges of sexual harassment in the
workplace. Last week, the Republican Party in his Southeast Texas
district, which has been sending him to Austin since 1981, turned
against him. The Lake Jackson Republican Party said he should
resign because his sexual escapades make the party look bad.

   FLA-SPACE _ MELBOURNE, Fla. _ Within a decade, rockets might use
a spaceport the way an airplane uses Hartsfield. ``We could be
competing with any number of states. It could launch and land in
Texas or anywhere in the U.S. . . . This is a major, major issue
for the state,'' said Catherine Deans, spokeswoman for Enterprise
Florida, a group formed to keep business coming to the Sunshine
State. During the heady days of Apollo, Cape Canaveral was the
undisputed launch capital of the world. Not so today. With wireless
communication demanding more satellite launches every day,
companies are contracting for blast-offs from spots around the

space policymakers will assemble for a conference, largely

UNDER CLOSER LOOK, BRADLEYCARE DOESN'T ADD UP

 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Answer me this: If your purpose is to reduce the
ranks of the 45 million people with no health insurance, what sense
does it make to throw scarce federal dollars at people who already
have health insurance?
</P>
<P>
   Or this: What sense does it make to throw more of those scarce
dollars, in the form of tax deductions for premiums, at people who
not only already have health insurance but are also filthy rich?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to BradleyCare. When the former New Jersey senator made
his proposal, he got praise (including from me) for breaking new
ground, putting the principle of universal coverage back on the
table credibly, and breathing fresh policy air into a stale,
partisan shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   As with any big idea, there were holes involving cost, coverage,
Medicare, and Medicaid. But expectation was that probing and
discussion would produce more answers and refinements that would
further improve Bill Bradley's signature new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't happened. As a result, what Bradley has dismissed as
``timid'' _ Vice President Al Gore's ideas _ now loom as sensible,
workable, and more progressive. By building on what already exists,
Gore has a way over the next decade to increase insurance coverage
to almost the level Bradley's ideas would, but at a cost that
doesn't gobble the lion's share of any budget surplus, leaves room
for investment in Medicare, and also leaves room for investment in
other national priorities.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a left-right, liberal-moderate ideological squabble.
As with so many other big issues in the '90s, it is a case where
the most progressive ideas turn out to be the most fiscally
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, the Gore-Bradley debate can be boiled down
without too much oversimplification to three issues _ cost,
coverage, and the bedrock federal entitlements, Medicare and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley's proposal doesn't cost more than Gore's because it is
more nearly universal. It costs more, at least three times more,
because it offers subsidies for everyone regardless of need, and
regardless of whether they already have insurance. More
dramatically, it costs a lot more because of a prescription drug
benefit that while stingy on the front end is open-ended on the
back end.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley proposal's fiscally dangerous assumption is that
every Medicare beneficiary over age 80 would enroll in an HMO to
get the drug benefit. But there are currently only four such
outfits in existence. What we do have reason to expect, from work
by the Congressional Budget Office, is that at least 80 percent of
Medicare beneficiaries would sign up for the drug benefit. The
difference between CBO anlysis and Bradley hope is huge. Dr.
Kenneth Thorpe of Emory University last week pegged the 10-year
cost at nearly $400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bradley's proposal would cost more because it makes
insurance premiums tax deductible for everyone and gives subsidies
on a sliding scale to people who have insurance, and not merely the
uninsured. In all, Thorpe pegs the 10-year cost of BradleyCare at
slightly more than $1 trillion, which consumes the entire projected
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign, rather than refute Thorpe, attacks him as
damaged ``Clinton-Gore'' goods. But his first-term job was working
on his field of expertise, cost-estimating. His initial projections
about the Bradley and Gore proposals came after a request from The
Washington Post, and his revised work last week came after
Bradley's people sought to persuade him otherwise. He could not
responsibly agree to their assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley's costs are supposed to be for a worthy purpose,
attaining insurance coverage for nearly all the uninsured _ which
would produce savings in acute care expenses as well as better
health.
</P>
<P>
   However, the question has arisen whether, for example, the
existence of the subsidies may cause many employers to dump
coverage, or what would be the impact of ending Medicaid as we know
it, as Bradley has proposed, on AIDS patients or low-income nursing
home patients who couldn't buy insurance with the vouchers they
would get in ``exchange.'' What more likely would be in store would
be substitution of public dollars for private ones. Thorpe figures
Bradley's proposal would add 15 million people to the insured
population, compared to 12 million in Gore's plan, which is
targeted on kids and adults with no insurance. Bradley would end up
insuring 89 percent of the population, compared to 88 percent with
Gore's plan, but would spend $700 billion more. Gimme a break.
</P>
<P>
   --Ending Medicaid as we know it is dangerous enough if you keep
in mind adults for whom it is a vital safety net. But BradleyCare
virtually demands ignoring Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   That's not responsible. Medicare will need both reform and new
money over the next decade to be ready for the baby boom
generation's retirement. Simply to assume, as Bradley does, that
because the program appears solvent under current economic
conditions until the year 2015, it doesn't need attention upfront,
is quixotic. Gore, like President Clinton, more wisely wants to
invest 15 percent of any budget surplus in Medicare's future.
</P>
<P>
   This could have been a better debate. But by going for pie in
the sky, Bradley has crashed.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Hillary flunks a pop quiz
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton stepped into the Middle East the other day with
little more in mind than making politically nice. That's impossible
in the Middle East. Hillary stepped on a large, squishy cow chip
placed beneath her unwary foot by Soha Arafat, wife of Palestinian
honcho Yasser.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Israel of murdering Palestinian women and children with
carcinogenic poison gas, which is what Mrs. Arafat did, represents
the plain vanilla of Arab rhetoric. Still, Mrs. Clinton was notably
slow in expressing indignation and, when she did, complained
starchily that the Palestinians had promised they wouldn't do that
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are still those who take words seriously, the
incident amounted to the worst sort of pop quiz for the
senator-in-waiting. Mrs. Clinton was denounced for sitting on her
hands while the equivalent of medieval blood libels were proclaimed
in her presence. Not surprisingly, Rudy Giuliani declared he would
have handled the matter promptly and with fierce eloquence.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the swirl is what the impenitent Mrs. Arafat had in
mind. A senate seat in Gaza?

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Nov. 16:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEW-PLANET (Undated) _ Astronomers report the most direct
evidence yet for the existence of a planet around another star, a
dimming of the star's light when the planet passed between us and
the star. The data allows them to calculate the mass, density, and
other characteristics of the planet. By John Noble Wilford. (900
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GRAVITY-WAVES (Livingston, La.) _ Scientists hope a new,
gigantic gravity wave detector inaugurated on Friday will open a
new window on the universe. The L-shaped detector and a recently
completed twin in Washington are called LIGO for Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. The signals of
gravity waves reaching the earth from the merger of black holes and
other cosmic catastrophes hold the possibility of deciphering
gravitational radiation as a means of penetrating secrets of the
birth of the universe and the evolution of black holes, galaxies
and other mysteries. By Malcolm W. Browne. (2180 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GARWIN-TESTBAN (Undated) _ Scientist at Work: Dr. Richard L.
Garwin, 71, one of the federal government's most widely respected
science advisers, remains optimistic despite one of the worst
defeats of his career, the Senate rejection of the nuclear test
treaty. An adviser to six presidents, including Clinton, Garwin
says he is now taking on the treaty's most vociferous public foes
one by one, writing letters, challenging their claims, suggesting
that they debate him publicly and generally trying to undo what he
regards as the trashing of the factual record. By William J. Broad.
(1990 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORPHAN-DISEASES (Undated) _ About 5,000 rare disorders are
classified as ``orphan diseases,'' and at one point stood little
chance to be cured, as drug researchers ignored them, assuming
there would be too few customers to make it pay to develop
treatments. Many of the disorders are severe or fatal, and in 1983,
hoping to encourage research, the government began offering tax
credits, research grants and other incentives to companies working
on rare diseases. Now the orphans drugs prove a boon to some
pharmaceutical companies, and some have made more than $1 billion a
year as a result. By Denise Grady. (2000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BUFFALO-DECLINE (Undated) _ As portrayed in a number of new
books, the real story of the decline of the buffalo involves a
dramatic change in climate, competition for forage and cattle-borne
disease. Another key factor, the authors say, were Indian tribes,
empowered by the horse and gun and driven to hunt buffalo for the
profits that came from hides and meat. By Jim Robbins. (1540 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: items on a
substance that works like a birth control pill on copepods, the
complexities of dirt and the composition of an asteroid. By Henry
Fountain. (690 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AUDIO-RECORDING (Undated) _ A Michigan State physicist has
devised a recording technique so lifelike that listeners almost
believe musicians are right in the room with them. By Henry
Fountain. (1525 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LEONID-METEORS (Undated) _ Experts forecast that the Leonid
meteor shower, which occurs when Earth travels through a plume of
dust particles from the comet Tempel-Tuttle, may provide quite a
show in some parts of the world, with 1,000 to 1,500 meteors per
hour arcing through the sky late Wednesday and early Thursday. By
Henry Fountain. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GIRLS (Undated) _ Girls today need not go it alone, naive or
humorless. There are sources where they can learn about their
bodies, minus the medicalese and pious homilies. At the forefront
of this female informist movement is a new book, ``Deal With It! A
Whole New Approach to Your Body, Brain and Life as a Gurl.'' Based
on a Web site, gURL.com, that three women started in 1996, the book
offers a frank, detailed and zealously nonjudgmental take on all
aspects of girlhood. By Natalie Angier. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PRESCRIPTIONS (Undated) _ When it comes to regulating
tobacco use, saving people from themselves is a tricky business,
especially when prescriptions are the means to the end. This is a
lesson that sinks in only slowly after medical school. Young
doctors think their prescriptions are sacrosanct, little pieces of
delivered wisdom. Eventually they discover their prescriptions are
just little pieces of paper. Just because you write someone a
prescription doesn't mean they will take the medication. Just
because you withhold a prescription doesn't mean they won't. The
hoary and jaded among us know that a prescription is really only a
suggestion, a word of friendly advice, nothing more. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Second of two columns on what can
be done safely in pregnancy. Not so long ago, pregnant women were
almost universally warned to avoid strenuous activity. But faced
with women's growing interest in exercise and sports and their
desire to stay in shape while a new life takes shape within them,
doctors gave exercise during pregnancy a second look. And to the
surprise of many, medical research has shown that most women can
safely continue to exercise throughout pregnancy, as long as they
make some sensible adjustments to their routines. By Jane E. Brody.
(1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEART-MONITORS (Undated) _ Heart monitors may be useful for
exercise, especially for beginners, some fitness experts contend.
By Liz Neporent. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Heroin users trying to avoid infected needles have turned in
increasing numbers in recent years to ``chasing the dragon'':
heating the drug and inhaling its fumes. But that method can cause
a rare brain disorder that can in turn cause paralysis and even
death, according to Columbia University neurologists. (350 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Vegetables taste better with age, the age of the person eating
them, that is. That's because sensitivity to bitterness declines
with age, a University of Washington study concluded. (120 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A sampling of highlight from the American Heart Association
convention. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Salk Institute researchers have found that, at least in mice,
what the body does can shape the brain's development and enhance
memory and learning.
</P>
<P>
   _ In most cases, a study shows, drunks continue to get served by
bartenders. (200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BACK-PAIN (Undated) _ Researchers in Chicago report that a
nontraditional therapy for back pain seems to work as well as more
common treatments like analgesics and physical therapy, with fewer
drugs. The treatment is osteopathic manipulation, the complex set
of musculo-skeletal techniques used by osteopathic physicians. By
Alisha Berger. (540 words)
</P>

   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science question answered: What is
astigmatism? Could surgery have corrected it in El Greco? By C.
Claiborne Ray. (300 words)

PAT STEGER, CHRONICLER OF SAN FRANCISCO SOCIETY, DIES AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL NOLTE  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pat Steger, the Chronicle's society editor and a
columnist who specialized in the life and times of the famous and
the famously rich, died Sunday of complications after cancer
surgery. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Robb Steger was one of a vanishing breed _ a reporter
who covered people active in what used to be called Society with a
capital ``S,'' patrons of the arts and the opera, diners at the
best restaurants, members of the best clubs, graduates of the best
schools and of the cotillion, ladies and gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of Steger's world _ a kind of Four Hundred whose
names regularly appeared in her column _ were part of what made San
Francisco a city. They were descendants of old money and possessors
of new, and in her columns they had style and class, feuds and
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Steger was also a consummate journalist, much admired by her
colleagues for her reporting abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was an institution,'' said William German, editor of the
Chronicle. ``She was also an excellent reporter and took enormous
pride in her own work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had the inside scoop,'' said Liz Lufkin, assistant
managing editor for features. ``It seemed like she knew everyone
and everything, and she was very generous about sharing it. We will
miss her terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown said Steger's death was ``terrible news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a wonderful person with an incredible sense of
humor,'' he said. He compared her to Chronicle columnist Herb Caen,
who died in 1997. ``We are all going to miss her,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steger moved in San Francisco's best society, she also
took a wry view of the people she wrote about.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characters in her column was a woman named
``Muffie,'' an imaginary young matron, ``attractive, young,
thirtysomething more or less,'' a divorcee who dabbled in real
estate and social work. ``Muffie's Diary'' was used to make fun of
those who took themselves too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   However, Steger also believed that there was a San Francisco
society and that it was important. ``If there is any one event in
San Francisco where there is really a there there, it is at the
opening night of the opera,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Society was her beat the way some journalists cover football,
others politics and still others the courts. She was one of the
best, a reporter who took her work so seriously that her last few
columns were written in advance to run after she had been admitted
to the hospital with a grave illness.
</P>
<P>
   Her final column appeared November 8 and was as usual breezy,
newsy and graceful. There was not a hint she was ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took her column very seriously,'' said the Chronicle's
Catherine Bigelow. ``She always made sure items matched or she
would tie them together. She often would write the column and then
toss the whole thing if a more interesting item came in. Being
timely and current was very crucial to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Steger's column was less about high society than it was about
the city. ``Everyone from the guy at the gas pump to a top CEO read
the column,'' said Stanlee Gatti, president of the city Art
Commission and San Francisco's premier events planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She chronicled the important events in our life,'' said Jo
Schuman Silver, producer of ``Beach Blanket Babylon,'' another San
Francisco institution. ``She was like our own diary, but everyone
could enjoy it. She was always loving and giving, never
mean-spirited. I'm afraid that every benefit, every type of
fund-raiser and the AIDS community will suffer now without the
mentions she always put in her column.''
</P>
<P>
   She was good for business. Allison Speer, who does public
relations for Giorgio Armani and the Emporio Armani boutiques, said
the firm ``always fought to get the ad space next to Pat's column
because we knew so many of our clients read it faithfully.''
</P>
<P>
   She also had the common touch. When unions went on strike
against the Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner in 1994,
Steger took her column to the union-sponsored Free Press, which
became probably the only strike newspaper in the world to feature a
society column.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Robb was born in San Francisco in 1932 into a family
wealthy enough to send her to the Sarah Dix Hamlin School for Girls
and poor enough so that it took vacations in Palm Springs during
the summer, when it was hot and the auto court rates were low.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hamlin School she wrote a column in the school paper
called ``Out and About.'' ``It was very popular,'' she wrote later.
``There were even blind items, like who was overeating at Blum's.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in a world on the edge of change, but still in a
time when young women invited to a black-tie dance at a local
college went to I. Magnin to buy an evening gown.
</P>
<P>
   Steger remembered that day, in a story that was an obituary for
both the I. Magnin store and a way of life. It was 50 years ago,
and she could remember the look on the saleswoman's face and the
tone of her voice. She never forgot the woman's name: Miss Irene.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the story won her an Atrium Award from the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robb went to college, of course _ to Stanford, of course.
Later she transferred to USC. Ladies of her era did not transfer
from Stanford to Southern California; it was not done.
</P>
<P>
   But Robb did it. She received a degree in telecommunications,
but women did not work in this field then. ``Breaking into creative
jobs was almost impossible,'' she said. ``There was no way. The men
always got them.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``impossible'' was not a word for Pat Robb. One day, she got
into an elevator with a man carrying a couch. ``Are you a
psychiatrist making a house call?'' she said. Someone sent the
crack to Herb Caen, the dominant columnist in Northern California.
He ran it.
</P>
<P>
   This gave her an idea. She sent items to columnists _ not Caen,
but to Paul Speegle, who wrote a similar column in the old San
Francisco Call-Bulletin. Speegle eventually hired her as his
assistant _ his legman, as they used to call such functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked as a critic, entertainment reporter, and when
the great man was not up to the task, she wrote the Paul Speegle
column. ``In those days,'' she said, ``you were grateful for the
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the day of the Call-Bulletin was rapidly fading. One
afternoon, she got a telegram announcing staff cutbacks; she had
been laid off. She ignored it, and reported to work as usual on the
theory that no one would have enough nerve to fire her in person.
She was right, but the time was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Call died, but Robb had a life. She married Wilfred Steger,
moved abroad and had two sons. By the '70s, she was back in San
Francisco, again sending items to columnists, this time to Caen,
the king of the hill here.
</P>
<P>
   People noticed, and in 1974, she was hired by the Chronicle and
asked to write a society column. ``I never read them before I wrote
them,'' she said. ``But I figured, `Why not?' I loved working at
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Steger was a natural. Every weekday for years, later three times
a week, she wrote a column, 25 years of them _ about people and
places, British royalty, celebrities, society figures, the Napa
Valley and Lake Tahoe, Trader Vic's and Moose's, black tie and
white tie, the life of a city and the death of I. Magnin.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, a part of the city died with Pat Steger. In her
farewell to the Magnin store, she wrote how in the new stores,
``the minute you walk in the door ... someone bounces up and asks,
`Finding everything you need?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I may find what I need,'' she wrote, ``but I don't always find
what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tremendous resource and wonderful to work with, ''
said Trish Donnally, the Chronicle's fashion editor. ``She was a
lady in the best sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Steger is survived by her husband; their two sons, Robert of
Half Moon Bay, Calif., and William of Los Angeles; and her brother,
Joseph Robb of Tiburon, Calif. Services are pending.

   SCI-HUBBLE-BREAKDOWN (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ NASA's Hubble
Space Telescope suffered a system failure over the weekend that
will leave it unable to transmit any pictures to Earth until the
next, much-delayed, space shuttle mission, the space agency said
Monday. By Warren E. Leary. (800 words)

   SCI-NEW-PLANET (Undated) _ Astronomers report the most direct
evidence yet for the existence of a planet around another star, a
dimming of the star's light when the planet passed between us and

other characteristics of the planet. By John Noble Wilford. (900

   SCI-GRAVITY-WAVES (Livingston, La.) _ Scientists hope a new,
gigantic gravity wave detector inaugurated on Friday will open a
new window on the universe. The L-shaped detector and a recently
completed twin in Washington are called LIGO for Laser
Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. The signals of
gravity waves reaching the earth from the merger of black holes and
other cosmic catastrophes hold the possibility of deciphering
gravitational radiation as a means of penetrating secrets of the
birth of the universe and the evolution of black holes, galaxies
and other mysteries. By Malcolm W. Browne. (2180 words)

Garwin, 71, one of the federal government's most widely respected
science advisers, remains optimistic despite one of the worst
defeats of his career, the Senate rejection of the nuclear test
treaty. An adviser to six presidents, including Clinton, Garwin
says he is now taking on the treaty's most vociferous public foes
one by one, writing letters, challenging their claims, suggesting
that they debate him publicly and generally trying to undo what he
regards as the trashing of the factual record. By William J. Broad.

   SCI-ORPHAN-DISEASES (Undated) _ About 5,000 rare disorders are
classified as ``orphan diseases,'' and at one point stood little
chance to be cured, as drug researchers ignored them, assuming
there would be too few customers to make it pay to develop
treatments. Many of the disorders are severe or fatal, and in 1983,
hoping to encourage research, the government began offering tax
credits, research grants and other incentives to companies working
on rare diseases. Now the orphans drugs prove a boon to some
pharmaceutical companies, and some have made more than $1 billion a
year as a result. By Denise Grady. (2000 words)

   SCI-BUFFALO-DECLINE (Undated) _ As portrayed in a number of new
books, the real story of the decline of the buffalo involves a
dramatic change in climate, competition for forage and cattle-borne
disease. Another key factor, the authors say, were Indian tribes,
empowered by the horse and gun and driven to hunt buffalo for the
profits that came from hides and meat. By Jim Robbins. (1540 words)

dust particles from the comet Tempel-Tuttle, may provide quite a

hour arcing through the sky late Wednesday and early Thursday. By

   SCI-GIRLS (Undated) _ Girls today need not go it alone, naive or
humorless. There are sources where they can learn about their
bodies, minus the medicalese and pious homilies. At the forefront
of this female informist movement is a new book, ``Deal With It! A
Whole New Approach to Your Body, Brain and Life as a Gurl.'' Based
on a Web site, gURL.com, that three women started in 1996, the book
offers a frank, detailed and zealously nonjudgmental take on all
aspects of girlhood. By Natalie Angier. (1500 words)

<P>
   SCI-PRESCRIPTIONS (Undated) _ When it comes to regulating
tobacco use, saving people from themselves is a tricky business,
especially when prescriptions are the means to the end. This is a
lesson that sinks in only slowly after medical school. Young
doctors think their prescriptions are sacrosanct, little pieces of
delivered wisdom. Eventually they discover their prescriptions are
just little pieces of paper. Just because you write someone a
prescription doesn't mean they will take the medication. Just
because you withhold a prescription doesn't mean they won't. The
hoary and jaded among us know that a prescription is really only a
suggestion, a word of friendly advice, nothing more. By Abigail
Zuger, M.D. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Second of two columns on what can
be done safely in pregnancy. Not so long ago, pregnant women were
almost universally warned to avoid strenuous activity. But faced
with women's growing interest in exercise and sports and their
desire to stay in shape while a new life takes shape within them,
doctors gave exercise during pregnancy a second look. And to the
surprise of many, medical research has shown that most women can
safely continue to exercise throughout pregnancy, as long as they
make some sensible adjustments to their routines. By Jane E. Brody.

   _ Heroin users trying to avoid infected needles have turned in
increasing numbers in recent years to ``chasing the dragon'':
heating the drug and inhaling its fumes. But that method can cause
a rare brain disorder that can in turn cause paralysis and even
death, according to Columbia University neurologists. (350 words)

PENTAGON NEEDS TO PROBE VIETNAM ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIAS CASTILLIO and JIM BARKER   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ More than a half-century after the Korean
War, the Defense Department is investigating the massacre of 400
Korean civilians at the No Gun Ri bridge. The Associated Press
reported that U.S. soldiers gunned down the refugees because of a
general's suspicion that North Korean infiltrators were among the
refugees fleeing a Communist onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage of 50 years, the will to investigate such a
horrendous event and determine the responsibility, no matter where
it may lie, is seemingly undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no apparent willingness to do the same thing with
the Vietnam War. Other than the My Lai massacre, the Pentagon has
never sought to probe reports of why seemingly normal American
soldiers began committing savage and barbarous atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the Veterans Administration and counselors who
work with Vietnam veterans have listened to traumatized veterans
recounting tales of participating, or watching helplessly, as some
U.S. soldiers committed butchery against Vietnam civilians and
captured soldiers of the Viet Cong. Those incidents range from
decapitation, massacre of prisoners, murders of fellow Americans,
needless slaughter of Vietnamese civilians and mutilation of their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Sara A. Haley, a counselor at Boston Veterans
Administration Outpatient Clinic, wrote in a psychiatric journal:
``Killings of POWs, civilians or fellow soldiers . . . have now
been documented by the hundreds in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Those incidents, she said, were unlike the ``isolated reported
episodes'' of previous wars in which American soldiers had
participated.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chaim F. Shatan, also a counselor for veterans, likens the
use of terror and ``dehumanization of Orientals'' during the
traumatic stress disorder resulting from either participating in or
witnessing an atrocity. The stories of these veterans are anguished
and guilt-ridden because of what they did or failed to Vietnamese
War ``as so pervasive that mass slaughter became almost as
automatic as it was in Nazi death camps.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment is included in ``Stress Disorders Among Vietnam
Veterans, Theory, Research and Treatment,'' a book edited by
Charles R. Figley of Purdue University.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, Veterans Administration counselors share
reports of treating Vietnam veterans suffering from the effects of
atrocity-induced post stop.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these veterans describe themselves as ``wanderers,''
haunted by what happened to them, unable to maintain relationships
or jobs, highly irritable, suffering from nightmares so intense
that many wake up screaming night after night, bathed in sweat and
plagued during the daytime by intense flashbacks that can occur at
any moment no matter what the activity. Some seek solace in drugs
and alcohol; a few consider suicide to end their suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the debilitating symptoms of post-traumatic stress
syndrome, which can also be induced by combat stress.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors, in treating the atrocity-induced syndrome, have
found that therapy, if it is to be effective, involves lengthy
sessions in which a close bond develops between the patient and
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   This allows veterans finally to confess their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that the primary symptoms of post-traumatic
stress disorder do not fade with time but may instead intensify.
</P>
<P>
   The question that remains to be answered is: What possessed some
otherwise normal American youths to commit unspeakable acts of
barbarism? These soldiers were not reared by their families, or
trained by the military, to kill unarmed civilians without
provocation _ or to slice off noses, fingers and scalps of Viet
Cong enemies and wear them proudly as necklaces or hang them from
staffs. (While the Viet Cong upper command deliberately
countenanced terror and mutilation as part of a modus operandi to
win the war, those acts were never part of Pentagon policy.)
</P>
<P>
   Was it the fact that Vietnam was a guerrilla war in which stress
turned too many U.S. soldiers into sociopathological killing
machines who could not differentiate between the enemy and unarmed
Vietnamese civilians?
</P>
<P>
   Was it Army and Marine officers who encouraged mutilation, such
as George S. Patton III, then a colonel and later a general, who
sent to his troops full-color Christmas cards of dismembered Viet
Cong?
</P>
<P>
   Can their behavior be blamed on the basic training they received
in which command officers stood by and ignored the racial slurs of
drill sergeants that dehumanized all Vietnamese?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answers, we need it to help heal the torn lives of
too many Vietnam veterans who were sacrificed for this nation's
worst war blunder, then whisked out of that terrible environment
and dropped back into their homes without the slightest concern by
the Pentagon as to what the war had done to their minds.
</P>
<P>
   No one counseled young, traumatized soldiers, as they left
Vietnam, to seek help if they suffered from post-traumatic stress
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   We need a Congressional investigation into U.S. atrocities
committed in Vietnam to determine what possessed so many U.S.
soldiers to go berserk and why, at the first sign of such behavior,
it was not stopped by their commanding officers.
</P>
<P>
   My Lai was not an isolated event. It was a symptom that
something vital had snapped in the minds of too many young American
soldiers and was then ignored by the generals who directed that
war.
</P>
<P>
   The massacres and mutilations cannot just be swept under the
carpet or shrugged off with the comment, ``his happens in every
war.''

 &HT;    Skiing with La Nina 
 &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;    With art 
 &HT;    By Eric Noland 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They've already begun searching the sky for clouds, squinting at
the thermometer's mercury, poring over confusing satellite images
on the Internet. All the while, ski officials hold their breath.
</P>
<P>
   As the West prepares for the novelty of a second straight winter
of the La Nina weather phenomenon, some resort operators are giddy
over the prospect of a resumed boom, while others are braced for
the prospect of continued bust.
</P>
<P>
   Peculiar snowfall patterns were experienced last winter, and
more of the same is expected this time around. That means:
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong prospect the Pacific Northwest will basically
get powder dumps normally destined for Colorado and Utah. Last
year, Colorado resorts suffered terribly in the early part of the
season, then had difficulty overcoming public skepticism when
snowfall began to catch up late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The extreme southerly tip of the precipitation band is expected
to nick Lake Tahoe and Mammoth again, producing the generous snow
depths that the resorts enjoyed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ski areas in Southern California's San Bernardino and San
Gabriel mountains will likely be left high and dry for a second
straight season, forcing the Big Bear Lake operations to fire their
snowmaking guns for all they're worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winter of 1998-99 was a La Nina, but there were leftover
puddles or eddies of warmth in the eastern Pacific (Ocean) from the
previous year's El Nino,'' said Klaus Wolter, a meteorologist at
the University of Colorado. ``If you think of it as a fever, it
takes a longer time for planet Earth to get over that heat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still trying to shake it, apparently. Jan Null, adjunct
professor of meteorology at San Francisco State University, says
that over the past 50 years for which good weather records were
kept on the phenomena, only two other back-to-back La Ninas were
recorded, ``so it's hard to draw conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   But for skiers and snowboarders in California, Null said, the
prospect is for ``Tahoe to be above normal (in snowfall), Mammoth
probably close to normal and, somewhere in the Eastern Sierra
(Nevada), a break to below normal.'' Which bodes ill for Big Bear?
Null chuckled and said, ``They can keep it open for skateboarding,
maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, even the ski resorts that foundered last
winter spent the off-season pressing ahead with their planned
capital improvements, not letting their pursuit of the
winter-sports dollar be unduly influenced by the vagaries of
freakish weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific year for improvements,'' said Lisa Bremner
of Colorado Ski Country USA, a trade organization that represents
that state's ski resorts. ``It shows the long-range commitment of
the industry. A lot of these things are many years in the works, so
you don't pull away from that after one disappointing year.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, the improvements have followed common trends:
faster, higher-tech lifts; expanded village environments at the
base of the mountains; more options for families. There are also
expanded and more exotic terrain parks for snowboarders, that
important teen-to-20s demographic that tends to be as carefree with
its disposable income as it is on an inversion maneuver in the
half-pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, it was clear that skiers and boarders simply
followed the snow. In British Columbia, Whistler Resort registered
its deepest base in 25 years _ and experienced a 37 percent jump in
skier visits from its previous five-year average. The migration of
skiers from the U.S. also was fueled by an extremely friendly
exchange rate (a U.S. buck bought more than $1.40 Canadian).
</P>
<P>
   But research by Colorado Ski Country USA also revealed that the
Rockies lost skiers to California. And why not? Lake Tahoe's six
major resorts combined for an average of 561 inches of snow, a
dramatic jump from their previous five-year average of 420 inches.
Mammoth Mountain, despite a wild ride _ early snow, dry times from
mid-December to mid-January, then more than 100 inches in the final
two weeks of January _ wound up with a robust 422 inches, up
significantly from its previous 10-year average of 387 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth spokeswoman Joani Saari wouldn't divulge the resort's
figures for skier days (one-day lift-ticket purchase by a skier or
snowboarder), saying only ``they were exactly where we expected
them to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little nervous about the whole La Nina thing,'' she
added, ``but it turned out to be a very good year. In this
industry, you hear everything, but people seem to be predicting
that it will be about the same weather pattern this year, and that
would be fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of that, Mammoth spent the summer completing the
renovation of its gondola, adding upscale accommodations (the
Juniper Springs Lodge), expanding its terrain parks and replacing
two chairlifts with a high-speed quad.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth also beefed up its snowmaking capability and is eager to
put it fully to use. As with Southern California, the resort has
been confounded by the uncommon weather of recent months _ an
unseasonably cool summer followed by an unseasonably warm October.
It needs chilly daytime temperatures to make snow in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Tahoe's prosperity last winter also gave that region
encouragement to press on with its capital improvements, a campaign
that will see $700 million spent at six major resorts over several
years.
</P>
<P>
   New this year are two high-speed six-passenger lifts at Squaw
Valley USA, a significant increase in luxury condominiums at
Kirkwood and an enhanced playground for snowboarding's lunatic
fringe _ including 13-foot walls _ at Heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults are driving many of the resort improvements across
the West. Terrain parks are springing up everywhere. Base-mountain
villages are growing, too, since this market segment tends to seek
a broad range of activities when the day's fun is done.
</P>
<P>
   But Carl Ribaudo, director of Ski Lake Tahoe, a marketing arm of
the region's six major resorts, said the changes are not being
mandated by the 20-to-30 segment alone. ``I think what you're
finding across the board,'' he said, ``is that because of the
high-speed quads (lifts), people are spending less time on the
mountain. The quad chairs go up and down, up and down; you can get
yourself pretty tuckered out. Now you're looking for something to
do _ hit the spa for a massage, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   For Southern Californians who don't necessarily require a
vibrant resort experience, the commuter options could be somewhat
limited if La Nina's footprint matches last year's.
</P>
<P>
   From December to March, the Big Bear area registered 18 inches
of snow. At least the air was cold, though, which enabled Snow
Summit and Big Bear Mountain _ also Mountain High, several miles
away in Wrightwood _ to employ their extensive snowmaking
operations to make up some of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions were considerably less than optimal _ hard-packed
runs lined by snowmaking equipment, with dirt beyond the borders.
Not surprisingly, attendance at the three ski areas was down a
combined 14.3 percent from the robust El Nino figures of the
previous winter. L.A.'s burgeoning snowboarder market prevented the
season from being much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent 65 percent of our visitors, especially in years
where we don't have a lot of natural snow,'' said Big Bear Mountain
Resort's Judi Bowers. ``Snowboarders are more forgiving. They'll
ride on just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Genevieve Gunnarson of Snow Summit said that in order to make
snow, the area needs several consecutive nights around freezing,
followed by dry days with temperatures that don't climb out of the
30s _ conditions that were nowhere to be found during a sizzling
October.
</P>
<P>
   Winter-sports enthusiasts who want to venture out of California
might be encouraged to hear that Colorado and Utah won't
necessarily experience an exact repeat of last winter's slow start.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists report that La Nina's signature is a seasonal one,
and does not have month-by-month characteristics. The University of
Colorado's Wolter said that for northern and central Colorado, La
Nina ``is actually a positive effect; it's just that last year the
early part of the season was exceptionally dry. I would almost bet
it won't be as dry this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, having completed numerous improvements during the
summer, can only hope for better fortune. One survey reported that
the state's ski attendance was down 5.8 percent in 1998-99.
(Another survey pegged it at 4.8 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the more intriguing developments for the coming winter is
a sliding lift-ticket scale at Berthoud Pass _ directly tied to
snowfall. On a day in which the area gets four inches of fresh
powder, adults will be charged the full price of $34, but if
snowfall is less than four inches (or nonexistent) the next day,
the price drops to $32. If the conditions persist the next day, it
drops to $30, where it remains until four or more inches fall.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, Winter Park has added a new base
village, Steamboat has increased its luxury lodging, Beaver Creek
has constructed a terrain park, Telluride has put in three new
lifts (including two high-speed quads) and Breckenridge has
installed a double-loading, six-passenger lift.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, Utah is coming off a surprisingly strong showing,
given mediocre snow conditions through much of the season. The
region, feeding off curiosity over its preparations for the Winter
Olympic Games in 2002, experienced a slight increase in skier days
_ 1.5 percent, but nonetheless a record, according to Kip Pitou,
president of the Ski and Snowboard Association of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge amount of spin with the Olympics. People are
finding out where we are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You mean the bribery scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Pitou laughed. ``News is news,'' he said. ``It still creates
excitement. This year, our bookings are up. We're looking to grow
the market this year. We've committed to about a 20 percent
increase for the season. I know it sounds nuts, but we've got to
get the high bar up there. We've been sitting in the dust of our
neighbors for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The ski area that has held sole title to that bar in recent
years is British Columbia's Whistler-Blackcomb, which has become a
fixture at the top of magazine rankings (Ski magazine, Skiing
magazine, Mountain Sports &AMP; Living).
</P>
<P>
   The resort is coming off a summer in which it spent $20 million
in capital improvements, the most noteworthy being two new
high-speed quads on Whistler Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the season begins to get under way, resorts throughout
the West must wait. Wait for nature to cooperate in all their grand
designs. Anticipating the degree to which that happens, they've
learned in recent years, can be alternately exhilarating and
exasperating.
</P>
<P>
   No less so this year, apparently. ``The one joker in this whole
game,'' said Wolter, the meteorologist, ``is that the La Nina might
decide to go away early next year. And then all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to predict.''

 &HT;    Newest Bush book gives governor's perspective
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (e) Entertainment and (p) Political categories.)
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A reporter and an ex-con have had their turns.
Now it's Gov. George W. Bush's turn to put his life between hard
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's version, ``A Charge to Keep,'' published by William
Morrow and written with Bush aide Karen Hughes, hits bookstore
shelves Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third Bush book spawned by his presidential campaign.
One, written by Dallas Morning News reporter Bill Minutaglio, is
still available. The other, written by ex-convict J.B. Hatfield and
including unsubstantiated allegations that Bush, many years ago,
was arrested for cocaine use, was yanked from shelves when the
publisher learned of the author's criminal past.
</P>
<P>
   For $23, Bush's book promises a ``warm, insightful, honest look
at the personal and political experiences'' that helped shape the
GOP presidential front-runner. For Texans familiar with the
governor's career and philosophy, the book is a 243-page version of
what has become Bush's stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   The book reads like what it is, part and parcel of a political
campaign. In the foreword, as he has told biographers with whom he
chose not to cooperate, Bush writes that he was disinclined to
produce a book about his life because ``I feel that many chapters
of my life story are yet to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not promise a ``comprehensive look at every event of
my life,'' but he does offer accounts of ``some of the events that
have shaped my life and some of my major decisions and actions as
governor of Texas.'' Predictably, and appropriately for a book
timed to a presidential campaign, Bush offers a one-sided view _
his side _ of his performance in government and business.
</P>
<P>
   The governor offers familiar accounts _ and no new information _
of how he wound up as a congressman's kid in the Texas Air National
Guard during the Vietnam War and how he quit drinking and left
behind his ``young and irresponsible'' years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would serve,'' he writes about his role during the
Vietnam War. ``My inclination was to support the government and the
war until proven wrong, and that only came later as I realized we
could not explain the mission, had no exit strategy and did not
seem to be fighting to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has said he knew nothing about any preferential
treatment, makes no mention of the back-channel efforts made by a
family friend through then-Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes to get
Bush a slot as a pilot in the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from contemporaries that there were openings for
pilots in the Texas Air National Guard, and I called to ask about
them,'' he writes. ``There were several openings, I was told,
because many people who wanted to go into the Guard were unwilling
to spend the almost two years of full-time duty required for pilot
training.'' He writes that he learned ``the lesson of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation should be slow to engage troops. But when we do, we
must do so with ferocity. We must not go into a conflict unless we
go in committed to win. We can never again ask the military to
fight a political war,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also recounts the oft-told story about how he swore off
alcohol after having a few too many, again, at his 40th birthday
party in Colorado. ``Quitting drinking made me more focused and
more disciplined,'' he tells readers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, as he does on the campaign trail, Bush
offers credit to his family and his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw, first-hand, that you could enter the arena, give it
your best and leave with your integrity intact,'' he writes of his
father's 1992 presidential election loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was in a moment when faith intersected with government that
Bush says his desire to run for president gained strength. At a
church service before this year's gubernatorial inauguration, Bush
listened to pastor Mark Craig talk about how America ``needs
leaders who have the moral courage to do what is right for the
right reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking to you,'' Bush says his mother told him later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no magic moment of decision. After talking with my
family during the Christmas holidays, then hearing the rousing
sermon to make the most of every moment during my inaugural church
service, I gradually felt more comfortable with the prospect of a
presidential campaign,'' Bush writes.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor also tells about the death of former
Texas Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat who may have done as much as
anyone to make Bush a credible presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we wept together,'' Bush writes of his final
meeting with Bullock before his death this year. ``He was so proud,
so eager, so convinced that I had a great chance to be the next
president. He had told friends that he looked forward to watching
me take the oath of office. Bullock, a man who had lived for years
on his sheer strength of will, realized that if it happened he
would not be there to see it. If it happens, he will have been a
huge part of making it so.''

 &HT;    Newest Bush book gives governor's perspective
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (e) Entertainment and (p) Political categories.)
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A reporter and an ex-con have had their turns.
Now it's Gov. George W. Bush's turn to put his life between hard
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's version, ``A Charge to Keep,'' published by William
Morrow and written with Bush aide Karen Hughes, hits bookstore
shelves Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third Bush book spawned by his presidential campaign.
One, written by Dallas Morning News reporter Bill Minutaglio, is
still available. The other, written by ex-convict J.B. Hatfield and
including unsubstantiated allegations that Bush, many years ago,
was arrested for cocaine use, was yanked from shelves when the
publisher learned of the author's criminal past.
</P>
<P>
   For $23, Bush's book promises a ``warm, insightful, honest look
at the personal and political experiences'' that helped shape the
GOP presidential front-runner. For Texans familiar with the
governor's career and philosophy, the book is a 243-page version of
what has become Bush's stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   The book reads like what it is, part and parcel of a political
campaign. In the foreword, as he has told biographers with whom he
chose not to cooperate, Bush writes that he was disinclined to
produce a book about his life because ``I feel that many chapters
of my life story are yet to be written.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not promise a ``comprehensive look at every event of
my life,'' but he does offer accounts of ``some of the events that
have shaped my life and some of my major decisions and actions as
governor of Texas.'' Predictably, and appropriately for a book
timed to a presidential campaign, Bush offers a one-sided view _
his side _ of his performance in government and business.
</P>
<P>
   The governor offers familiar accounts _ and no new information _
of how he wound up as a congressman's kid in the Texas Air National
Guard during the Vietnam War and how he quit drinking and left
behind his ``young and irresponsible'' years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would serve,'' he writes about his role during the
Vietnam War. ``My inclination was to support the government and the
war until proven wrong, and that only came later as I realized we
could not explain the mission, had no exit strategy and did not
seem to be fighting to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has said he knew nothing about any preferential
treatment, makes no mention of the back-channel efforts made by a
family friend through then-Texas House Speaker Ben Barnes to get
Bush a slot as a pilot in the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from contemporaries that there were openings for
pilots in the Texas Air National Guard, and I called to ask about
them,'' he writes. ``There were several openings, I was told,
because many people who wanted to go into the Guard were unwilling
to spend the almost two years of full-time duty required for pilot
training.'' He writes that he learned ``the lesson of Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation should be slow to engage troops. But when we do, we
must do so with ferocity. We must not go into a conflict unless we
go in committed to win. We can never again ask the military to
fight a political war,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also recounts the oft-told story about how he swore off
alcohol after having a few too many, again, at his 40th birthday
party in Colorado. ``Quitting drinking made me more focused and
more disciplined,'' he tells readers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the book, as he does on the campaign trail, Bush
offers credit to his family and his faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw, first-hand, that you could enter the arena, give it
your best and leave with your integrity intact,'' he writes of his

PERSONAL HEALTH: SIMPLE ADJUSTMENTS FOR A FIT PREGNANCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Second of two articles on health in pregnancy) 
(The Science Times) 
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, pregnant women were almost universally warned
to avoid strenuous activity. Running, cycling, skiing, horseback
riding, singles tennis _ all were off limits. Only walking had
widespread approval, and even that was to be limited to about a
mile a day, preferably broken up into several short sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with women's growing interest in exercise and sports
and their desire to stay in shape while a new life takes shape
within them, doctors gave exercise during pregnancy a second look.
And to the surprise of many, medical research has shown that most
women can safely continue to exercise throughout pregnancy, as long
as they make some sensible adjustments to their routines. And for
those women who were relatively inactive before conceiving and now
wish to get in better shape before baby comes, it is even safe to
begin exercise programs during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   There are now only a few prohibitions. Very strenuous
competitive activities are still ill-advised, as are contact
sports, scuba diving and vigorous exercise at high altitudes by
women who are not acclimated to thin air. Nowadays I regularly see
women at various stages of pregnancy jogging, walking, cycling, ice
skating, playing tennis and especially swimming. Swimming was my
own salvation during the last two hot months of a twin pregnancy
that ended at term on Aug. 28, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is still more work to be done to address some
residual concerns about what can happen to an unborn child when the
mother engages in vigorous activities, the benefits of remaining
active or becoming active during a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy
seem clear. Active pregnant women typically report fewer
discomforts like nausea, fatigue, backaches, swelling and shortness
of breath, as well as more energy, better weight control, improved
mood and self-esteem and an easier labor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology
lifted its previous limits on exercise during pregnancy and, based
on research, concluded that women with uncomplicated pregnancies
could exercise safely by taking pretty much the same precautions
recommended for women who are not pregnant. It's just that during
pregnancy it is all the more important to pay attention to
exercise-related advice.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Raul Artal, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the St.
Louis University School of Medicine and a fellow of the American
College of Sports Medicine, noted recently in The Physician and
Sportsmedicine, a medical magazine, that bodily changes during
pregnancy call for a certain amount of prudence. Breast growth and
abdominal expansion shift a woman's center of gravity forward,
putting an added strain on her back, and the hormonal changes of
pregnancy result in greater laxity and mobility of joints, which
can increase the risk of hip, knee or ankle injury. Those women who
experience a notable increase in joint laxity would be wise to
limit their weight-bearing activities, Artal advised.
</P>
<P>
   Two major concerns during pregnancy are getting overheated and
dehydrated. Avoid intense exertion in hot, humid weather; wear
light clothing that ``breathes''; use a small fan, if needed, to
cool down while using exercise equipment; drink plenty of plain
fluids (water, decaffeinated beverages, diluted fruit juice or
diluted sports drinks) before, during and after exercise, stay out
of saunas and steam rooms and use hot tubs and whirlpools for only
a few minutes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to moderately intense activities; you should be able to
converse while exercising. Limit workouts to 45 minutes, and stop
before you're exhausted. If exercise makes you excessively tired,
dizzy or short of breath, or causes pain (especially in the back or
pelvic area), palpitations, persistent uterine contractions,
decreased fetal movement or vaginal bleeding, stop exercising and
get medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Women with heart or lung disease should consult their physicians
before exercising during pregnancy, and according to the guidelines
established by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
some women should not exercise at all. Among them are women with
gestational hypertension, vaginal bleeding during the second and
third trimesters, premature labor during the current or a previous
pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation, incompetent cervix,
placenta previa or premature rupture of membranes.
</P>
<P>
   For some women, an exercise program should be individually
designed and carried out with extreme caution under medical
supervision. These include women carrying two or more fetuses,
those who are excessively obese or seriously underweight and women
who have insulin-dependent diabetes, seizure disorder or anemia.
But for women with gestational diabetes _ diabetes touched off by
pregnancy _ exercise can help control the problem and is
recommended by the American Diabetes Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes pregnancy becomes a motivating factor for women to
start an exercise program. But women who were previously sedentary
should stick to moderate activities like walking at a comfortable
pace or activities like swimming or cycling on a stationary bike
that do not involve weight-bearing movements. For someone who is
not in shape to begin with, pregnancy is no time to start jogging
or training intensively in a new sport.
</P>
<P>
   Strength training can be done during pregnancy using light
weights with multiple repetitions. Avoid lifting or pushing against
heavy weights, which may compromise blood flow to the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga, too, can be done during pregnancy, with certain
adaptations. According to Nancy Crum Stechert, a certified yoga
instructor in New Jersey, legs should always be apart and the
abdomen lifted in the various yoga positions.
</P>
<P>
   But the ideal mode of exercise, especially during the second
half of pregnancy, is in the water. Jane Katz, a champion swimmer
and swimming instructor at City University of New York and author
of ``Water Fitness During Your Pregnancy,'' (just published as a
$17.95 paperback by Human Kinetics,800-747-4457), points out that
water offers a big plus to a pregnant woman: buoyancy, which
provides support for body weight (if you weigh 120 on land, you'll
feel like only 12 pounds in the water) and ``reduces the amount of
perceived exertion for a given activity.'' In other words, you can
work harder and longer without feeling the strain, and in water you
can continue to exercise until the day your water breaks and you're
ready to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Water workouts are also less risky to your joints and less
likely to cause overheating in warm weather. And water is relaxing
and soothing. With words and drawings, Dr. Katz's book describes
numerous water exercises and strokes suitable for pregnant women,
44 workouts in all, with modifications appropriate to the stage of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Choose pools that are well maintained. Ideal water temperatures
are 80 to 85 degrees. Avoid water skiing and surfing. Do not dive,
jump or do strenuous wall push-offs during pregnancy. Never swim
alone.

 &HT;    Planning makes the whole ski trip perfect 
 &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)   &HT;    By Richard Irwin 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skiing is a very expensive sport. By the time you buy the fancy
new skis with microchips built in, the brilliant bindings and the
colorful, high-tech clothing, there's little money left over.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty and freedom found in skiing is addictive, and
with a little planning you can still take that ski vacation. The
trick is to go during the shoulder seasons and to ski the
lesser-known areas.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ski packages that will get a couple out on the
slopes for $1,000 a week. While that may sound expensive, these are
legitimate values when you consider that air fare is included and
these ski resorts are some of the best in the world. In most of the
packages, you also get ski-lift tickets, which often cost $50 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Canada continues to be a real bargain because of the excellent
exchange rate (currently just under $1.40 Canadian for $1 U.S.).
While winter might be prime time for American ski resorts, they're
off-season for places such as Banff and Lake Louise in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these two areas are home to some of Canada's finest skiing,
with three ski mountains _ including Lake Louise, the largest ski
resort in the country. Together, the ski areas offer 218 runs on
more than 5,000 acres of terrain, serving every kind of skier from
beginner to expert.
</P>
<P>
   Horizon Air is offering a bargain package, which includes air
fare to Calgary, five nights' lodging and a three-day
interchangeable lift ticket. The cost is only $520 per person,
based on double occupancy, from Monday to Dec. 23, Jan. 3-31 and
April 24-30. (All prices are quoted in U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Lodging is at the new Banff Caribou Lodge or the recently
renovated Banff Ptarmigan Inn. Both hotels are located in downtown
Banff, an easy walk from the town's many excellent restaurants and
shops.
</P>
<P>
   For only $100 more per person, skiers can opt to stay at
Canadian Pacific's elegant Banff Springs Hotel. This classic hotel
looks like a baron's castle nestled in the Canadian Rockies and has
been serving guests for more than a century. The grand dame has
recently been remodeled, including a marvelous new
35,000-square-foot spa called Solace.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about forking over a grand and not having any snow?
Horizon Air is guaranteeing the snow. Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 18,
the airline promises that there will be downhill skiing at the
resorts. Between Dec. 19 and April 1, it guarantees that at least
50 percent of the ski terrain will be open.
</P>
<P>
   If not, the airline will reschedule or refund the ski package.
All a skier has to do is call the snow-information line 48 hours
before departure to check the weather. For more information, call
Horizon Air Holidays at (800) 547-9308 or check its Web site at
www.horizonair.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking to ski closer to home, Daman-Nelson Travel
Inc. is offering a great package to Sun Valley, Idaho. For $445 per
person, double occupancy, the package includes round trip charter
air on Alaska Airlines to Twin Falls, charter bus to Sun Valley and
seven nights lodging at the Elkhorn Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The Elkhorn is located next to Dollar Mountain and recently
completed a thorough remodeling. Lift tickets are additional, but a
multiday ticket discount is available.
</P>
<P>
   The package is offered Jan. 15-22, Jan. 29-Feb. 5 and Feb.
19-26. For more information, call Daman-Nelson Travel at (800)
343-2626.
</P>
<P>
   If you're worried about Y2K problems, Horizon Air has come up
with some Y2K Relief ski packages to mark the new year. For $471
per person, double occupancy, the airline is offering a trip to
Montana's Big Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes round-trip air fare to Kalispell, four
nights at Grouse Mountain Lodge and a three-day lift ticket. It is
available from Jan. 6 to Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Not familiar with Big Mountain? It's one of the country's
largest ski resorts, with 67 runs and 3,000 skiable acres. Skiers
can take the gondola to the summit for fantastic views of Glacier
National Park and the Flathead Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Grouse Mountain Lodge captures the Montana spirit with
etched-glass walls in the lobby and rough ceiling timbers. The
144-room lodge sits on a golf course, which offers miles of
cross-country skiing in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   For only $70 more per person, skiers can stay at the beautiful
Kandahar Lodge, located right at the base of Big Mountain. If you
like to ski in and ski out of your lodging, this is a great place
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   As with the Canadian Rockies resorts, Horizon Air will guarantee
the snow conditions before your arrival or you will get a full
refund.
</P>
<P>
   Though it costs slightly more than our target of $1,000 per
couple, British Columbia's Whistler-Blackcomb should also be
considered. The skiing is world-class, as is the village at the
base of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   For approximately $550 per person, double occupancy, skiers can
enjoy a five-night stay with a three-day lift ticket. Visitors have
several fine hotels to choose from, with the prices varying only
$10-$20 per night.
</P>
<P>
   These bargain prices are only offered from Nov. 25 to Dec. 23.
In January, the rate rises $100 per person at this popular resort.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes nonstop air from Los Angeles to Vancouver.
Until Dec. 17, the package also includes a mountaintop breakfast
buffet with early uploading on the chair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a place closer to home, Heavenly ski resort in South
Lake Tahoe is enticing early skiers with a special package. From
Monday to Dec. 16, the package offers round-trip air, a three-day
lift ticket and three nights' lodging. The cost is $285 per person,
double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Another package covers the entire season and includes four
nights' lodging, three-day lift ticket and round-trip air. That
cost climbs to $437 per person, double occupancy. For more
information, call Heavenly at (800) 243-2836.
</P>
<P>
   Grab those skies and make your plans early. You'll be glad you
did when you're flying down the slopes with the cool, crisp air in
your face _ knowing that you didn't have to spend your last dime.

SO MUCH GOOD TV, THERE`S NO TIME TO GET A LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just to stay on top of the game, conscientious TV critics _ and
they all know who they are _ watch a lot of stuff they don't
necessarily like. This helps explain the times they've had to tell
loved ones they couldn't go out to Chez Chimichanga for the
free-range chicken burrito on a Friday night because they had to
stay home and watch ABC's TGIF lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this sort of diligence allows for easy differentiation
between Hilda and Zelda on ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.'' (I'm
still wondering why witches dress like hookers, Sabrina included.)
But it does provide a working knowledge of what's out there, and
enables us to speak semi-knowledgeably when a TV reporter from
Boston springs a pop quiz. Like George W., we may blank on who's
running Pakistan at the moment, but we sure as heck will know if
he's appearing this week on ``The Hughleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, there's some stuff we actually like to watch, rendering
this job easy to take at times. I'm told this makes us just like a
lot of other people, though I've never met any of them personally.
Everyone I run into claims only to watch Discovery, PBS and C-SPAN.
Never mind that they seem to know an awful lot about Joey
Tribbiani's roommate situation on ``Friends.'' (NEWS ALERT: Elle
Macpherson moved in last week.) They would have us believe they
come by this knowledge simply by hanging around their progeny, who
shouldn't be watching ``Friends'' in the first place, but that's
another column.
</P>
<P>
   This one is about the critic's worst fear: too much good stuff
on the air. Each new season usually brings two or three shows that
get added to one's personal viewing schedule. But this season there
are at least six new shows on my don't-miss list, and two or three
others I try to see as often as I can.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the upheaval in the Levesque household! When my wife
says it's time to go out and get a life, I frequently have to
respond, ``Honey, I'm working,'' and then return to the latest
episode of ``Snoops'' so I can figure out how Gina Gershon gets her
lips to do that turny-downy thing. The upside is that I'm
accumulating so much overtime I'll soon be able to upgrade to an
automobile with air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this commitment to quality programming at the networks
has me looking wan these days, which is good in one sense because I
like using the word ``wan.'' It's also bad because if the bags
under my eyes get any bigger the airlines won't let me carry them
on. Then again, if I have to check them at the gate and an airline
loses them and my Mom asks what happened to the bags under my eyes,
I can say with conviction, ``The airline thinks they're in
Cincinnati.''
</P>
<P>
   I digress. A glut of good shows can do that to one's attention
span. Else I wander off again, let's just get to my six new faves,
shall we?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, before we do that, let me first ask the networks to cut back
on the quality just a tad, OK? Otherwise, conscientious critics _
and we all know who we are _ will have no time to watch the bad
stuff, and we'll all lose respect for ourselves and end up cynical
and curmudgeonly in the old critics' rest home, and then we'll
never be able to recognize good stuff like . . .
</P>

</P>
<P>
   THE HOOK: Each week gets better as Rick Sammler (Billy Campbell)
and Lily Manning (Sela Ward) appear to be less and less perfect,
and their love affair affects their exes, their kids and the other
people in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now and Again''
</P>
<P>
   Fridays on CBS
</P>
<P>
   THE ATTRACTION: A strange premise makes this show an acquired
taste, but if anyone can combine a love story and an
action/adventure show, it's Glenn Gordon Caron, who gave us
``Moonlighting'' a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOOK: An exquisite tale of forbidden love between Michael
Wiseman (Eric Close) and his ``widow,'' Lisa (Margaret Colin).
Caron's choice of John Goodman to play Wiseman in the pilot was a
stroke of genius, too. Goodman's character died, but his brain
lives on in the new Michael Wiseman, a hunky government operative
manufactured to tackle assignments that might endanger the lives of
less well-equipped agents, and ordered to have no contact with his
family. Brilliant tongue-in-cheek escapism on a Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Wing''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdays on NBC
</P>
<P>
   THE ATTRACTION: Aaron Sorkin, creator of ``Sports Night,''
imbues this drama with the same crackling dialogue, the same
breakneck pace.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOOK: Some Beltway insiders panned ``West Wing'' because
they say the White House is a place of reverence where staffers
rarely speak above a whisper. Now that would be a boffo show, no? A
drop-dead cast makes Sorkin's busy, buzzy White House the most
interesting workplace of the season. And fuggedabout Warren Beatty
for prez. Martin Sheen is the man!
</P>
<P>
   ``Roswell''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdays on The WB
</P>
<P>
   THE ATTRACTION: ``Roswell'' is yet another WB show about high
school kids, but Jason Katims, creator of ``Relativity,'' gives it
a more adult slant without losing the teen angst.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOOK: She's a local girl. He's from another state. Of mind.
It's the Next ``X-Files,'' a beautiful take on the
mismatched-lovers story, with a touch of ``The Fugitive'' and just
the right measure of sci-fi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaks and Geeks''
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays on NBC
</P>
<P>
   THE ATTRACTION: A look at high school as most of us probably
lived it.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOOK: A sly willingness to go against the
political-correctness grain; a cast that looks as if it just got
out of homeroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops''
</P>
<P>
   Sundays on ABC
</P>
<P>
   THE ATTRACTION: Paula Marshall, who never got a chance to shine
in ``Cupid'' last season.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOOK: I'm as surprised as you. Thought this would be David
E. Kelley's first failure. Not as fluffy as first advertised, it's
a guilty pleasure, but also a compatible lead-in to ``The
Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides these six, I also try to catch ``Third Watch,''
``Angel'' and ``Action'' as often as humanly possible. But,
frankly, I'm exhausted. Memo to networks: This quality thing is
killing me.

proposing similar bans. In New York, City Council speaker Peter
Vallone said on Monday that he plans to propose an ordinance
similar to the ones in California. The Department of Defense has

FORECAST TOMORROW: SHOWERS OF METEORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala., Calif.)   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a slugger given a second chance after a disappointing
season, the Leonid meteor shower is back again this week, ready to
take another swat at Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are forecasting that the shower, which occurs when Earth
travels through a plume of dust particles from the comet
Tempel-Tuttle, may provide quite a show in some parts of the world,
with 1,000 to 1,500 meteors per hour arcing through the sky late
Wednesday and early Thursday. That would be better than 1998, when
at the peaks there were only 250 to 300 meteors per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's results were particularly disappointing as many
astronomers had predicted that the event could rival that of 1966,
when by some estimates 15,000 to 50,000 meteors per hour were seen.
Experts are staying away from such extravagant predictions this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the estimates are tempered a little bit,'' said Dr.
Jeffrey Anderson, an engineer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center, in Huntsville, Ala. The center is forecasting a rate of
1,500 meteors an hour, given ideal viewing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the shower's intensity is an inexact science,
Anderson said. ``We know where the comet is,'' he said. ``But we
don't have any direct observational evidence of where the tail and
the dust streams are until we pass through them.''
</P>
<P>
   The best viewing sites are expected to be in Eastern Europe,
where the peak shower should occur early in the morning. But the
timing is also difficult to predict, as demonstrated last year,
when an additional peak occurred about 12 hours earlier than the
forecast one. So meteor watchers may lose a lot of sleep, staying
up into the early hours of both Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the predicted peak will occur before
midnight Wednesday, when viewing is not at its best. Still, given
good weather, some meteors should be viewable, to the east. And
some experts say there may be a second peak about 4 a.m. Thursday,
Eastern time, when the moon will have set and viewing conditions
should be better.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonids, so named because they appear to originate from the
constellation Leo, occur every year in November. But they put on a
good show only every 33 years or so, when Earth crosses
Tempel-Tuttle's orbit through plumes of particles boiled off the
comet during close approaches to the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Because the comet orbits the Sun in a direction opposite that of
Earth, the meteors are faster-moving than most others, striking
Earth's upper atmosphere at more than 150,000 miles an hour. While
the particles pose no danger to people, burning up long before
reaching the ground, they have the potential to damage satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Amid last year's predictions of a spectacular sky show came dire
warnings that telecommunications and other systems that depend on
satellites could be interrupted. Although the risk of a collision
was considered relatively small, satellite operators took no
chances, shutting down many electrical systems and orienting
spacecraft so that solar panels and other critical components were
edge-on to the storm. No satellites were disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Operators are ``safing'' spacecraft again this year, said Dr.
Glenn D. Anderson of the Aerospace Corp., a company in Los Angeles
that advises the military and private space contractors. But things
are a bit more calm. ``It's not a panic-type situation,'' he said.
``But people are aware of it.''

 &HT;    QUAKES PROVIDE CRACK FOR GREEK, TURKISH TALKS ON LONG-STANDING
CYPRUS ISSUE
 &HT;    With CLINTON-TURKEY-1116.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ It was ``ping-pong'' diplomacy that brought the
United States and China together three decades ago. The quest for
Mideast peace gave rise to ``shuttle diplomacy.'' And ``baseball
diplomacy'' has provided a tenuous link between the United States
and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``earthquake diplomacy'' has opened a window for Greece and
Turkey to try to settle their 35-year-old dispute over the island
republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already seen some manifestation of that,'' said
President Clinton, who goes Tuesday to visit Ezmit, epicenter of an
August quake that killed 17,000 Turks and left another 400,000
homeless. ``I think it's a mood, an atmosphere that needs to be
acted upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey was rocked by another quake Nov. 12. Neighboring Greece
suffered its own serious quake in September.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries responded by dispatching emergency aid crews to
the other. Private citizens on both sides of the Greece-Turkey
divide stepped forward to send money to aid those suffering in the
rival states.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists from both countries write that the outpouring of aid
across the troubled Aegean Sea has shown that politicians in Athens
and Ankara have fallen badly out of step with their people on the
subject of trans-Aegean detente.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence then, said Clinton, that leaders of the
competing Greek and Turkish communities on Cyprus agreed just this
week to sit down in New York on Dec. 3 to try to re-start
long-stalled talks over a dispute that has divided their countries
since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the improved relations between Turkey and Greece over
the so-called 'earthquake diplomacy' and interchange,'' Clinton
told reporters en route here aboard Air Force One on Sunday. ``I
think the people of both countries, and, therefore, the political
leaders of both countries, saw each other with fresh eyes in the
agonies of the earthquakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In brokering disputes among foes, the essence of diplomacy is
often the search for common ground, even, as events in Greece and
Turkey show, shaky ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was a series of U.S.-China table tennis games, after all,
that provided a backdrop for President Richard Nixon's secret talks
with China during the early 1970s, in what became known as
``ping-pong diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The wooing of Cuban baseball stars to American teams has helped
opened a crack in the wall that has separated Havana from
Washington for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   And the hundreds of trips U.S. diplomats have made between the
State Department and the fractious Mideast over the past 20 years
has given rise to the term ``shuttle diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, said Clinton, tragic though the earthquakes have been
for thousands of Greeks and Turks, there may yet be a diplomatic
silver lining to the disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person who lost a loved one or a home to those
earthquakes knows that there was no such thing then as a Turkish or
a Greek tragedy,'' Clinton said Monday in a speech to the Turkish
parliament. ``They were human tragedies, and the world will never
forget the humanity each nation displayed toward the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has provided $14.5 million in humanitarian aid
to Turkey's earthquake victims, in addition to extensive military
assistance. On Monday, Clinton said the United States would also
offer up to $1 billion in private loan guarantees for private
reconstruction efforts.

 &HT;    CLINTON CHIDES TURKEY ON HUMAN RIGHTS, PLEDGES TO HELP IT MOVE
FORWARD
 &HT;    With CLINTON-CYPRUS-1116.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ President Clinton assailed Turkey's poor human
rights record Monday as a drag on its integration as a full partner
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future we want to build together begins with Turkish
progress in deepening democracy at home,'' Clinton said, in the
first speech ever given by a U.S. president to Turkey's parliament,
the Grand General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sovereignty,'' he said, ``should not be built on fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, aware of this country's growing
strategic value at the crossroads of Europe and Central Asia,
leavened his criticism with praise for Turkey's recent progress on
human rights. He was scheduled to go Wednesday to the city of
Ephesus, one time home of the Christian disciple John and the
mother of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, to spotlight the Christian
traditions and religious tolerance in a country that is 98 percent
Moslem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are encouraged,'' Clinton said, ``that the human rights
issue is moving in the right direction in this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's president, though, Suleyman Demirel, bluntly
acknowledged continuing troubles in Turkey. The U.S. State
Department accuses the Turkish government of widespread abuses,
including beatings and killings of detainees as well as
intimidation of journalists, human rights advocates and some
political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel said the government is taking measures to address those
ills, specifically through new laws aimed at rooting out and
punishing officials who torture detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to say that there is no torture in Turkey;
there is torture,'' Demirel told reporters in a joint news
conference with Clinton. ``But torture is not state policy. Torture
is
</P>
<P>
   a crime. And whoever commits this crime, no matter who that
person may be, that person is investigated and is penalized
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups, including the London-based Amnesty International,
counter that Turkey has not only failed to prosecute officials who
torture detainees but that it has tolerated threats against
citizens who speak out against such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Clinton accented the growing U.S. stakes in
its relationship with Turkey, a NATO ally that has become the
geographical and strategic fulcrum to a host of American priorities
since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, a country of 65.5 million people, has emerged as a key
partner in a broad range of U.S. aims. Those include U.S. efforts
to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  tap into the oil riches of the nearby Caspian Sea;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  build peace in the Balkans;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  resolve long-standing disputes in the Middle East and on
island of Cyprus;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  contain neighboring Iraq;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  help manage the economic and political transition underway
across the former Soviet Union
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  counter terrorism;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  combat the global drug trade;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and bridge the gulf between the Islamic world and the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these areas and more,'' Clinton said, ``Turkey and the
United States should be partners.''
</P>
<P>
   He thanked Turkey for providing a base for American warplanes
that patrol the no-fly zone of northern Iraq. And he pledged to
lobby for Turkey's stalled membership request in the economically
powerful European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The president also pledged to help Turkey recover from
earthquakes that killed more than 450 people Friday, on the heels
of a quake that claimed more than 17,000 lives in August. On
Tuesday, he will visit an area 60 miles east of Istanbul where U.S.
Marines set up tents to house people made homeless by the first
quake.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to go to Istanbul on Tuesday, where he will
meet with 53 of his counterparts at the annual summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   He is in the region on a 10-day swing that will take him to
Athens, Greece and Florence, Italy later in the week. He continues
on to Bulgaria and Kosovo next week, before returning to Washington
by Thanksgiving.

<P>
   It is a Darwinian law of nature that adults believe everything
was better when they were young: music, books, movies, clothes,
bagels and, of course, young people.
</P>
<P>
   But once in a while, adults are humbled. Something comes along
that they look at wistfully, or maybe petulantly, and say: ``Hey!
Where was that when I was a teenager?''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the response of many a mature woman to a new wave of
books and computer Web sites aimed at adolescent girls, on the
ever-daunting topic of being a girl. Being a teenage girl has
always meant confronting a whole new set of crises and paradoxes:
breasts that grow too slowly or too fast, periods, pimples, sexual
urges, boys with their flim-flam hands and virgin/whore complexes.
But until recently, girls mostly navigated their swelling, captious
seas on their own, sometimes not even aware of the facts of
menstruation until the day they started bleeding and went screaming
to their mothers for a Band-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, girls need not go it alone, nave or humorless. There are
sources where they can learn about their bodies, minus the
medicalese and pious homilies. At the forefront of this female
informist movement is a new book, ``Deal With It! A Whole New
Approach to Your Body, Brain and Life as a Gurl'' (Pocket Books,
$15), written _ or, more accurately, choreographed, produced and
emceed _ by Esther Drill, Heather McDonald and Rebecca Odes. Based
on a Web site, gURL.com, that the three women started in 1996, the
book offers a frank, detailed and zealously nonjudgmental take on
all aspects of girlhood.
</P>
<P>
   It is a funny book, vividly designed in today's de rigueur style
of bold colors, cartoon icons and choppy text blocks. The cover is
a two-parter, showing a young woman on the front standing with her
back to the reader, throwing open her yellow raincoat in the manner
of a flasher. Flip to the inside cover, and the flasher is turned
frontward in fetching bra and panties. Inside the book, tampons are
drawn with grinning faces; an emotional ``crush'' is shown as a
sneaker squashing a bug underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book's purpose is serious. It addresses virtually
everything a young woman might want to know about herself, and
herself in relation to others. Some of the text is written by the
three authors, based on information screened by a variety of
experts, and some consists of the comments and asides of girls.
</P>
<P>
   Girls talk about their pubic hair and the hair around their
nipples. To one alarmed query, a girl-commentator replies: ``Relax!
This is normal! It's called vaginal discharge.'' Girls talk about
the even more ``gross'' realization that their parents have sex and
sometimes even enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   The most incendiary topics are presented in clear, nonincendiary
language. If a girl is pregnant, ``Deal With It!'' lays out her
options, from the considerable challenges of life as a teenage
mother to what an abortion involves and which states require
parental notification or consent. The entire pharmacopeia of
recreational drugs is described in detail, each one's effects and
risks outlined without hellfire, brimstone or fearmongering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to give girls resources and information, but not be
preachy about anything one way or another,'' Ms. McDonald said in
an interview. ``In our way of thinking, girls are smart; they can
make choices, and what they need most is accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   The intended audience for the book is girls from ``the edge of
their teens'' to those ``who are way past them but still reeling
from the trauma.'' As such, the book covers topics that while
arguably fine for a high school senior to encounter, may be a bit
much for a reader of, say, 14. For example, one section discusses
fellatio in language far too graphic to quote in this newspaper, as
girls give each other hints on how to do it well, and how to
gracefully handle the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The authors argue that knowledge is power, and that even young
girls are smart enough to metabolize and store away information for
future use, or to simply bypass those sections that do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to frame things so that girls can understand them
and not be afraid of them,'' Ms. Odes said. ``We think it's always
better to know what you might encounter. Not telling a girl the
name of something isn't going to keep her from doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ms. Drill said, ``if they pick up Cosmo magazine, or
Playboy, they'll see the same thing.'' She added, ``At least we're
trying to contextualize it in a responsible way.''
</P>
<P>
   The specificity and wisecracking tolerance of ``Deal With It!''
demonstrate how radically the sexual education of young girls has
changed over the years. Until this century, in fact, girls were on
their own when it came to coping with their changing bodies and
desires.

   ``They may have been given facts about about childbirth, and
many young women might have seen it for themselves, in their
homes,'' said Joan Jacobs Brumberg, a professor of history at
Cornell University and author of ``The Body Project: An Intimate
History of American Girls'' (Vintage Books, 1997). ``But personal
material in letters, autobiographies and memoirs of the time
suggest that mothers were incredibly silent when it came to talking
to their daughters about sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal sex education was introduced about 1905, and with an
unambiguous intent, according to Jeffrey P. Moran, an assistant
professor of history at the University of Kansas and author of
``Teaching Sex: Shaping Adolescence in the 20th Century,'' to be
published in the spring by Harvard University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was part of a moral movement to prevent young people from
having sex outside of marriage,'' he said. ``The idea, which has
continued throughout this century, was that sex education could
influence and change youthful behavior.'' Sex education courses
often culminated with a slide show of suffering from tertiary
syphilis: skin covered in carbuncles, noses eaten away by ulcers.
``The idea was to put the fear of God in young people if they
should stray,'' Dr. Moran said. And today, he said, with the risk
of AIDS still looming, sex education classes continue to emphasize
the negatives of indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insofar as Web sites and books are now laying out all the
information that young people might need to know, and letting them
make their own decisions,'' Dr. Moran said, ``that's quite
different from having the information carefully selected and handed
down to them by authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   It was their discontent with the voices of authority that
initially drove the three young women to start gURL.com, when they
were graduate students at New York University. They had disliked
the teenagers' and women's magazines they read as young girls, with
their emphasis on boyfriends, thigh size and eye shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be absurd to say that girls don't care about what
they look like or what's in style,'' Ms. Drill said. ``But it's
insulting to think that that's all girls care about.''
</P>
<P>
   They devoted a highly caffeinated year of their lives putting
the Web site together, and by all accounts it is a success, visited
by about 800,000 people a month. Other sites aimed at young girls
are beginning to crop up, some under the aegis of groups like
Planned Parenthood or Rutgers University, but none with nearly as
keen an ear for teenage sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody approves of gURL and its ilk. Coleen Kelly Mast,
an educational consultant with Respect Inc. in Bradley, Ill., which
believes in saving sex for marriage, argues that many proponents of
giving young girls the ``whole truth'' and ``complete information''
about their bodies often present a narrow and one-sided story of
human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information they give focuses on passion and pleasure, but
it leaves the heart out of it,'' she said. ``Girls and women are
not told that all this playing with various forms of sexual
pleasure, whether with themselves or a partner, can be a hindrance
rather than a help to eventual satisfaction in marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, said that as a general matter, she had ``always felt
that lots of information is better than no information.'' But she
worries that too much information, too much peer-based schmoozing,
can raise anxieties rather than lower them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic combination is not only lots of information, but
lots of adults, and parents most of all,'' she said. ``Adults are
well positioned to provide context. Despite the stereotype of
inevitable conflict between teenagers and their parents, all our
research and experience show that parents remain very powerful
influences in kids' lives. A mother shouldn't feel that she can
give a book about the body and sexuality to her daughter and be
done with it.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the mother can sit down with her daughter, with book or
computer keyboard in hand, all the while muttering how much better
kids have it today.

   Astigmatism and Art
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is astigmatism and did it affect the work of El Greco?
</P>
<P>
   A. Astigmatism results from a misshapen cornea, the clear front
covering of the eye. A normal cornea has a smooth, round curve. In
astigmatism, the curve is elongated and greater in one direction
than in another, and the shape is often described as bulging, like
a football, rather than circular, like a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   When light rays pass through such a cornea, they are not
refracted, or bent, equally in all directions, and they are focused
on several points on the retina, rather than on one point. Vision
is distorted for both nearby and faraway objects, and what is seen
may be blurred or distorted.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is one option for correcting astigmatism. In a procedure
called astigmatic keratotomy, incisions are made in a curved
pattern to reshape the cornea. In photorefractive keratectomy, a
laser reshapes the surface.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is probable that neither one would have changed how
El Greco painted. The theory that he was astigmatic was advanced in
1913, but scientists now believe that the elongated shapes in his
paintings were deliberate, rather than the result either of faulty
vision or lenses used to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays show more realistic drawings under his final paintings,
and there is no evidence that corrective lenses for astigmatism,
which might have produced elongated images in one direction, were
available to him in the 16th century.

OSTEOPATHY PROVES EFFECTIVE FOR BACK PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ill., Maine)  (nk) 
 By ALISHA BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of every five Americans suffers from lower back pain, and
the experience can be debilitating. Often, victims cannot drive
long distances, hold their children or even walk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers in Chicago report that a nontraditional therapy
for back pain seems to work as well as more common treatments like
analgesics and physical therapy, with fewer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is osteopathic manipulation, the complex set of
musculoskeletal techniques used by osteopathic physicians. The
study, which appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine on
Nov. 4, involved 155 patients who said they had been having lower
pack pain for three weeks to six months; 83 were given osteopathic
manipulation and 72 received standard treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that most patients improved,'' said the lead
researcher, Dr. Gunnar B.J. Andersson, the chairman of the
department of orthopedic surgery at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center in Chicago, who is a physician but not an osteopath.
``There was no difference in improvement between standard care and
osteopathic care, and the patients who had received osteopathic
care had received less medication, less physical therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the patients in each group reported
being satisfied with their treatments. ``I think it's very hopeful
for patients with back pain,'' Andersson said. ``Contrary to what
many people believe, if they've had back pain for a month or more,
it won't last forever. Those who prefer traditional treatments can
get it, and those who prefer manipulation can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a definition of osteopathic manipulative treatment, or
OMT, Dr. Boyd R. Buser, associate dean at the University of New
England College of Osteopathic Medicine in Biddeford, Maine, said
it ``means more than getting your back cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are techniques as simple as kneading and stretching and
as complex as subtle motions that affect the movement of fluid from
one area of the body to the other,'' he said. ``The goal is to
lengthen abnormally shortened muscles and enable the joints to have
a more normal range of motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Buser, who was not involved in the study, said its finding about
a reduced need for medication was important because some drugs for
back pain bring adverse effects, the most common being
gastrointestinal bleeding and upset stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not deal with chiropractic care, which also
involves spinal manipulation. Dr. Robert E. Kappler, an osteopath
who contributed to the study, said an osteopath had a wider
spectrum of techniques than a chiropractor.
</P>
<P>
   Kappler cautioned: ``Manipulation doesn't work for everything.
If you have a weak back, manipulation doesn't strengthen it.
Sometimes the pain is chronic and manipulation doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   He is disappointed by the study, he said, because he believes
OMT is better than standard medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't enough patients in the study to show that,''
Kappler said, ``but it will come out in future research.''

   If there was a defining moment, a single event that foretold the
sadness to come, Eric Godek's parents do not mention it. Looking
back, they say only that he was 4 months old when they began to
notice things that worried them. He seemed to have lost the ability
to lift his head and reach for his toys, and he had begun to choke
on feedings.
</P>
<P>
   At first, their pediatrician in Peoria reassured them that Eric,
a bright, lively baby with huge brown eyes, seemed healthy. Jessica
and David Godek, new parents in their 20s, were eager to believe
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think in my heart I knew something was wrong,'' Mrs.
Godek said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 10, just after Eric turned 5 months old, the Godeks
learned that he was suffering from a rare muscle disorder, Pompe
disease, and that he had just two or three months left to live.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to save him, they found one speck of hope: researchers
at Duke University Medical Center, in Durham, N.C., were testing a
highly promising experimental treatment in which infants like Eric
were given an essential enzyme that they lacked. The Godeks
contacted the university, and were encouraged to send Eric's
medical records. He had exactly the form of the disease being
studied.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after the hope was offered, it was taken away. They
were told that although the research team wanted to treat their
son, it would not be possible, because the study was designed to
include only three babies, and the company sponsoring the research,
Synpac Inc., of the nearby Research Triangle Park had provided
enough medicine for only three. There was not enough for a fourth
baby, even though the first three had been promised a lifetime
supply if the drug worked. And Eric Godek would have been the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Pompe (pronounced pom-PAY) disease is an ``orphan'' disease, one
of about 5,000 disorders so uncommon that drug companies used to
ignore them, assuming there would be too few customers to make it
pay to develop treatments. Many of the disorders are severe or
fatal, and in 1983, hoping to encourage research, the government
began offering tax credits, research grants and other incentives to
companies working to treat rare diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The incentives, provided under the Orphan Drug Act, worked. In
the decade before it was passed, fewer than 10 orphan drugs came to
market. But since the act, 193 have been approved, nearly half of
them in the last five years. In large part because of the
government incentives, several so-called orphan drugs now make
their manufacturers more than $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act has been one of the most successful laws ever passed
by Congress,'' said Dr. Marlene Haffner, director of the office of
orphan products development at the Food and Drug Administration.
``It's just been gangbusters.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the tide of investment capital, start-up companies, new
drug applications, competition for marketing rights and
confidential business deals, it is possible for a child to be lost.
Companies competing to be first to market an orphan drug need to
move quickly, and they have no more incentive than any other drug
company to spend the time or money to enlarge a study.
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Godek found that a drug development strategy meant to
benefit patients like their son had no provision to help him in a
crisis. It rewarded manufacturers for creating new drugs, but not
for making experimental treatments available to sick people with no
other options.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Godek died on Sept. 28, and his parents were left with
piercing questions about whether his death might have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 million Americans have orphan diseases: rare disorders,
each one affecting fewer than 200,000 people. They include familiar
illnesses like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis, but also
many others like Pompe disease that few have heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work on orphan drugs is done by small- to
medium-sized biotechnology companies created to develop new
products. Some have been started by researchers who struck out on
their own, backed by investors, to commercialize discoveries made
in university laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Orphan Drug Act, these companies can get waivers of
FDA filing fees, worth $300,000 per drug, in addition to grants and
tax credits. Especially important, a company that is first to
receive FDA approval for a particular orphan drug also gets
exclusive marketing rights to it for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Companies then set their own prices; even though money from
taxpayers may have supported the development of an orphan drug, the
FDA does not regulate the pricing of the final products.
</P>
<P>
   Many orphan drugs cannot be patented, Dr. Haffner said, either
because they are natural substances or because they are old
products whose original patents have run out by the time a new use
is found for them. ``That's why exclusivity has been so
important,'' she said. ``It is stronger than a patent, because FDA
will monitor it.'' In the case of new drugs that can be patented,
the exclusive rights can come into effect before a patent does.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey Meyers, president of the National Organization for Rare
Disorders, in New Fairfield, Conn., said, ``The biotechnology
industry was built on the Orphan Drug Act. These companies realize
that if they make drugs for diabetes and high blood pressure, they
can take a tiny piece of a big market with a lot of competition.
But if they go into a rare disease, there's no competition. They
can charge anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, orphan drugs are among the biotechnology industry's
biggest moneymakers. One, a replacement enzyme, like the treatment
being studied for Pompe disease, costs $170,000 to $340,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Pompe disease, also known as acid maltase deficiency, is caused
by a deficiency in an enzyme called acid alpha glucosidase.
Normally, the enzyme helps the body break down glycogen, a complex
carbohydrate that is converted to glucose for energy. Without the
enzyme, glycogen builds up in the heart and other muscles, causing
extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder is caused by a genetic defect inherited from both
parents, and most, like the Godeks, have no idea that they are
carriers of a lethal gene until they give birth to a seriously ill
child.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are several forms of Pompe disease, varying in severity,
and researchers estimate that there are 3,000 to 6,000 cases at any
given time in the United States. The type that Eric Godek had is
rapidly fatal, because it damages the heart and the muscles needed
for breathing. But the brain is spared, and babies remain as bright
and aware as ever while they weaken and become immobile.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Duke University Medical Center announced that it would
begin a clinical trial to test an experimental treatment in three
babies with the most severe form of Pompe disease. The treatment,
injections of the missing enzyme, had been developed by Dr.
Yuan-Tsong Chen, a professor of pediatrics and genetics and chief
of medical genetics. Babies in the study would live at the hospital
with a parent for three months.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was paid for by Synpac Inc., the drug development
company in Research Triangle Park, with a parent company in Britain
and owners in Taiwan. The university had licensed Chen's technology
to Synpac. A spokesman for Synpac said it had invested millions in
the research, and had contracted the actual manufacturing to still
another company, which the spokesman declined to name.
</P>
<P>
   Duke and Synpac have competition: a Dutch company, Pharming
Group NV, is also testing a replacement enzyme in Holland, and
hoping for FDA approval. Its partner in the research is Genzyme, of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake: whichever company can be the first to prove
its treatment works and get FDA approval will also win the seven
years of exclusive marketing rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Godeks knew there was no guarantee that the treatment would
work. But they also knew that the first infant in the Duke study
was still alive, past the time when the disease would normally have
taken his life. To them, the study was Eric's only chance. Two
babies had already been chosen, but they were told that Eric might
qualify for the third spot. Another child, though, was also being
evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   They were devastated to learn that Eric would not be part of the
study after all. The other baby had qualified first. Even though
Eric had the rapidly fatal form of Pompe disease being studied,
even though he was the only additional qualified applicant, the
Godeks were told that there was not enough medicine, or enough
staff to take care of him.
</P>
<P>
   To the Godeks, that defied logic. If enough enzyme could be made
to treat three children for life, how could it not be possible to
make enough to keep a fourth alive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're in competition to get the patent and they
don't want to let anything slow them down,'' Mrs. Godek said,
shortly before her son died. ``The drug company and the investors
are making a business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews before Eric's death, Chen and an
official at Synpac declined to address those questions. They would
not explain how long it took to produce the enzyme, or say whether
enough could be made in time to treat him.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Chen said Synpac had declared that the baby could not
be treated, but Synpac officials said Chen had decided. Finally,
both Synpac and Chen blamed a third party, the company
manufacturing the drug, which they declined to name.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen said that if the drug were available, he would want to
treat Eric. ``Other than the parents, I am probably the one most
desperate to help these babies.''
</P>
<P>
   By late September, the Godek family had appealed to Synpac, the
orphan drug office at the FDA and even their United States senator,
Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who called Synpac on their
behalf, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Haffner said that the orphan drug office was also powerless
to help. The FDA can let patients have unapproved drugs for
``compassionate use,'' she said, but cannot help if the drug is not
available. If the problem had been money, she said, Synpac could
have asked the FDA for a grant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers, of the rare disease organization, said,
``Biotechnology companies, being small and not as wealthy, don't
have the money to invest in manufacturing a huge amount of a drug
before they know whether the FDA is going to approve it or not. If
it costs $50 million to make it and the FDA doesn't approve it,
they'll go bankrupt. They hold back until they get approval.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that in several cases, even when new orphan drugs were
approved and marketed, companies could not meet the demand for
them. For example, she said, new treatments for multiple sclerosis
and Lou Gehrig's disease were initially in such short supply that
patients had to enter their names into lotteries to obtain the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``American patients are not used to rationing,'' she said. ``The
rest of the world is. I think people in the United States are going
to have to get used to it. It's going to happen more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Time ran out on the morning of Sept. 28 when, after a night of
struggling to breathe, Eric Godek died at a hospital in Peoria.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Godek said that he and his wife would always
wonder whether their son's death might have been avoided. ``I'm
trying not to be bitter,'' Mrs. Godek said. ``But something has to
be done so this doesn't happen again and again and again.''

   NEW YORK _ Subhash Mandal used to finish up his daily five-mile
run feeling either exhausted or as if he had barely broken a sweat.
``I could never get a sense of how hard to push myself,'' said
Mandal, 29, an actor who lives in Queens. Then, a personal trainer
recommended that he try running with a heart-rate monitor strapped
to his chest. Mandal says his runs are now more effective because
he has an easy and accurate way to gauge his workout intensity.
</P>
<P>
   To help exercisers avoid either overdoing or underdoing it,
experts advise establishing a target training zone: 50 percent to
90 percent of maximum heart rate, the fastest your heart is capable
of beating. (A quick way to estimate maximum heart rate is to
subtract your age from 220; thus, if you are 40, your maximum rate
is about 180 and your target training zone is 90 to 162 beats a
minute. To find out for certain, consult a doctor.)
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way of determining heart rate, of course, is
taking the pulse _ placing a finger on the neck or wrist and
counting the beats. But few people can take an accurate pulse while
on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the heart-rate monitor. No exerciser should be without
one, said Gregory Florez of the American Council on Exercise, a
nonprofit group that reports on fitness and certifies personal
trainers and aerobic instructors. ``After clothing to cover your
body,'' Florez said, ``a heart-rate monitor is the single most
essential piece of fitness equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edmund Burke, director of the exercise science program at
the University of Colorado, says a heart-rate monitor is especially
important for those new to exercise, because they tend to overdo it
in the first weeks, leaving them sore and discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that an inexperienced person will intuitively work
out at the appropriate intensity,'' Burke said. ``A monitor
provides accurate feedback so you can adjust your speed
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Monitors measure pulse in one of two ways. Photo-optic models
clip onto an ear lobe or fingertip and shine infrared light through
the skin to monitor blood pumped into the vessels; they relay
information to a display that can be worn like a watch.
</P>
<P>
   But Florez says these devices are not very accurate. ``Any
relative motion between the sensor and finger will cause highly
erratic or false readings,'' he said, adding that they can also be
thrown off by variations in lighting, blood circulation and the
intensity of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The other type operates on the same principle as an
electrocardiogram. Using radio signals, it directly measures the
electrical activity of the heart. A chest strap acts as a sort of
electrode and transmits the information to a wristwatch receiver or
the display on equipment, like a treadmill or an exercise bike.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have found the sensors highly accurate, differing from
sophisticated electrocardiogram equipment by as little as one beat
per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Florez says most cardiovascular equipment in modern gyms can
receive information on heart rate, and some can speed or slow the
pace of a workout to keep the user's heart working at the proper
level.
</P>
<P>
   Personal heart-rate monitors are gaining in both popularity and
complexity. Sold at sporting-goods and exercise specialty stores,
at gyms and over the Internet, they cost $60 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   The devices are easy to use: strap the electrode around the
chest and press the start button, and the monitor begins taking the
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   A popular model, the M71ti, made by the Finnish company Polar
and sold for about $300, doubles as a sports watch, with a timer
and lap counter. It estimates calories burned, calculates target
training zones and has an ``out of zone'' alarm that sounds
whenever the heart rate wanders out of its designated training
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Polar and another company, Cardiosport, make more expensive
monitors that allow users to move workout data to a personal
computer. Cardiosport also has less expensive models, with large
readouts to accommodate those who exercise without contact lenses
or glasses. The Heartalker, by Newlife Technologies ($59 to $79),
features the voices of Kathy Smith and Denise Austin, who make
exercise videos, plus programmed workouts. Physi-Cal Enterprises
makes Mio monitors ($119), which track calories consumed and burned
and come in Swatch-like colors and designs.
</P>
<P>
   While such bells and whistles can be fun and motivating, Burke
cautions against overbuying. ``It's easy to be overwhelmed by
technology if a monitor is as complicated to program as your VCR,''
he said. ``Simplicity is better for some people.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Thomas Edison first demonstrated his phonograph to packed
houses in the 1870s, the feat seemed so remarkable that listeners
occasionally fainted. Digital recordings and stereophonic sound
have created a much less impressionable listening public, but Dr.
William Hartmann, a physicist at Michigan State University,
recaptured a little of the old magic when he played a radically new
type of recording for a jammed conference room during a meeting of
the Acoustical Society of America two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The way Hartmann recorded and played back a Mozart string
quartet in B flat seems simple enough that it is hard to believe
that the showmanlike Edison did not try it himself. But
acousticians who were there said that nothing like the
demonstration had been achieved before, and that it provided a
glimpse of a spectrum of recording techniques that could eventually
turn up in living rooms of the well-to-do and at elaborate social
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   On two channels of an eight-channel digital recording, Hartmann
managed to isolate completely the sounds of the first violin during
the original performance. He did the same with the second violin,
the viola and the cello. In replaying the quartet, he gave each
pair of channels its own speaker, built to have sound radiation
patterns broadly similar to those of the stringed instrument, and
he arranged the speakers on the floor just as the musicians
originally sat.
</P>
<P>
   The result was seven minutes of chamber music in which the audio
''image'' of the players was all but palpable, an unachievable feat
for two-channel stereophonic sound. And, the usually inevitable
distortions, created by transmitting more than one instrument
through a speaker, were absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so convincing,'' said Dr. Leo L. Beranek, the dean of
the world's architectural acousticians, who is at Acentech Inc., in
Cambridge, Mass. ``You moved around and the instruments seemed to
be coming from a live group.''
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly live musicians also sound as if they are playing
in the room where the speakers sit, since no reverberations from
the hall are preserved on the recording. Beranek said he thought
the setup could generate its own reverberations and maintain the
sense of live presence in surroundings ranging from a large living
room to the New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A sliver of the old sense of excitement is back, too, said
Anthony Hoover, an acoustician and principal consultant at
Cavanaugh Tocci Associates who led the session in Columbus, Ohio,
where Hartmann gave his demonstration. ``Not only were people
thrilled, but there was standing room only,'' Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demonstration dealt only with a specific way of
recording a string quartet, Hoover said the effort should be seen
as an exploration of the possibilities that would be opened up as
DVD technology allowed for more and more channels and speakers.
``It's very clear,'' Hoover said, ``that the industry is moving in
that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several good reasons Edison could not have recorded a
string quartet in the way that Hartmann and his students, Zachary
Constan and Timothy McCaskey, did. The project required computers
with memory capacities of a gigabyte and the ability to handle
eight channels of digitized music simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   And while the technology for isolating instruments from one
another with ``pick-up'' or contact microphones has existed for at
least several decades, mixing those sorts of recordings to produce
the realistic and pleasing sounds of classical instruments is still
far from routine.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to reproducing the three-dimensional aspects
of a string quartet, the complexity of the sound pattern radiated
by just a single violin shows what the physicists were up against.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Dr. Gabriel Weinreich of the University of Michigan,
have revealed that at sound frequencies below about 850 hertz, or
oscillations per second, roughly a G sharp an octave and a half
above middle C, a violin radiates its sound almost uniformly in all
directions. But above that point, with higher frequencies and thus
higher notes, the violin has what Weinreich calls directional tonal
color, meaning that the instrument emits sound louder in some
directions and softer in others, with patterns that are different
at nearly every frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is folded into what we call the violin sound,''
Weinreich said.
</P>
<P>
   Such complexities in each of the individual instruments meld
together in a way that depends on how they are arranged on the
floor or stage, creating the dynamic, three-dimensional, acoustic
presence of a string quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that it would be impossible to recreate every detail
of that acoustic image (a term used by analogy with visual images
of three-dimensional scenes), Hartmann focused on what he thought
were the most crucial brush strokes, like realistic painters who
convey a sense of space without reproducing every cornice, leaf and
cloud.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   He began by recording each instrument with two contact
microphones, one affixed to the instrument's body near the squiggly
``F hole'' and one near the bridge, as four Michigan State music
students played the Mozart quartet nicknamed ``The Hunt'' (K. 458).
</P>
<P>
   The acoustic vibrations picked up by the two microphones were
quite different; the relatively stiff bridge transmitted a greater
range of high frequencies, many of them corresponding to harmonics
of the principal note being played.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann experimented with different mixes of those pairs of
digital recordings that made it sound as if the right tones were
coming from the right places. But in order to do that, he had to
send the sound through special loudspeakers with two sets of
low-frequency woofers and high-frequency tweeters on the front and
one set on the back.
</P>
<P>
   On the front, one woofer-tweeter pair transmitted sound
collected mostly from an instrument's bridge and the other pair
played sound recorded from the F hole. The back pair transmitted
the F hole channel with some of higher frequencies filtered out,
since more low frequencies tend to be radiated backward in a real
instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Then the loudspeakers were arranged like the corresponding
players in a string quartet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to pick up the cello stand and put it some place,
why then the cello will be there,'' said Weinreich, who also
attended the Columbus meeting. ``The different tracks are very
clean in recording the individual instruments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinreich said the arrangement also created at least a rough
approximation of directional tonal color for each instrument.
Scaling the set-up to a larger ensemble would not necessarily
involve more channels, Hartmann said. For example, electronic
switching might allot an individual speaker to a soloist and share
the remaining speakers among the other instruments. For a symphony
orchestra, he said, ``obviously we're not going to have 100
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   If more string quartets could be recorded and those recordings
made available, Beranek said, there might already be a demand for
the system at classy social functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could just set this up and have it play,'' he said. ``It
would be very realistic and do the job just as well as live
players.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoover suggested that the work's significance might lie more
in its general approach to using multiple channels rather than in
this particular realization of a string quartet. The demonstration
could be seen as a first test of ways to use the multiple channels
that are becoming available with DVD and related technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Six-channel systems are available now, he said, and 10- and
12-channel systems are said to be in the pipeline. With the proper
placement of speakers, existing systems are good at conveying, for
example, the sound of a helicopter as it passes overhead in an
action movie. But the extra channels are often wasted on music,
which blares out of all the speakers equally.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how good the new systems improve upon Edison's
phonograph and its progeny, musicians warn that there is still no
substitute for a live performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fancy myself, within my budget, a semi-stereophile, and it's
fascinating to see how close someone can get to the old absolute
sound,'' said Dr. Robert Greenberg, a pianist and composer, who is
chairman of the music history and literature department of the San
Francisco Conservatory of Music. Still, Greenberg said, the best
live music involves ``the performance feeding off the energy coming
up from the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter,'' he said, ``if it's a Bruce Springsteen
concert or the Guarneri Quartet. If you want the thrill and
discovery of the interactive act, then it has to be live.''

SMOKE TWO AFTER DINNER AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I headed into the waiting room at 2:19 the other afternoon,
my 2:20 patient had disappeared. I knew he would be back in a
minute or two, windblown and smelling of cigarette smoke,
sheepishly tossing a crumpled pack into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Our visits follow a depressing pattern. The only thing ever
bothering him is a cough. He has asthma and recurrent bronchitis,
admits to a pack a day, probably smokes more, and is frank about
his current plans to quit: he has none. He is too stressed to try
any more. As for cutting down: ditto.
</P>
<P>
   I renewed his prescriptions for three inhalers, two blood
pressure drugs and a bottle of cough medicine. He folded them into
his breast pocket, right next to an unopened pack of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation at moments like this is to wish that a higher
authority would just take over the case. And as it happens, a very
high authority is showing a smidgen of interest in my 2:20: among
the cases on the Supreme Court's docket this fall is the question
of whether the Food and Drug Administration has the authority to
regulate tobacco the same way it does other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   I fantasized for a moment about a world where the unimpeachable
logic of the FDA came to prevail on drugstore shelves. Tobacco
products would be treated exactly like the drugs they are, no more
and no less. And, in such an orderly universe I might at that very
moment be facing the decision of whether or not to add a
prescription for menthol 100's to my patient's stack.
</P>
<P>
   Any self-respecting purveyor of health should probably be
champing at the bit for the right to make that decision. With no
more effort than a smile and a shake of the head I could get rid of
my patient's cough. Within a decade or so his risk of other
smoking-related problems would fall as low as if he had never
smoked at all.
</P>
<P>
   Multiply him by the 48 million adult smokers in the United
States, and the result would be one of the biggest health
revolutions in history.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to higher authorities, though, a revolution
by prescription is one I might just as soon sit out.
</P>
<P>
   Saving people from themselves is a tricky business, especially
when prescriptions are the means to the end. This is a lesson that
sinks in only slowly after medical school. Young doctors think
their prescriptions are sacrosanct, little pieces of delivered
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually they discover their prescriptions are just little
pieces of paper. Just because you write people prescriptions
doesn't mean they will take the medications. Just because you
withhold prescriptions doesn't mean they won't. The hoary and jaded
among us know that a prescription is really only a suggestion, a
word of friendly advice, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   My 2:20 patient is a 45-year-old man with no misconceptions
about his situation. He knows he is puffing away little pieces of
his future. He also knows that to survive his present, juggling an
unpleasant job, an iffy marriage and a set of relatives whose
various misbehaviors have him in an unending state of turmoil and
grief, he needs to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Had he more time, more money, or fewer relatives, he might
change his mind. Perhaps in a few years he will. As things stand
now, though, were he and I suddenly catapulted off into a future of
regulated tobacco products, we would both face a cascade of
unappealing choices.
</P>
<P>
   I could choose the clear insanity of treating his bronchitis and
sponsoring his smoking at the same time, with prescriptions for
three inhalers and 60 packs to last the month.
</P>
<P>
   I could choose the medically correct but remarkably cruel
extreme, cutting him off cold turkey with a shrug and a promise
that he will feel much better in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   I could choose the middle ground of slowly tapering his dose of
tobacco despite his enunciated lack of interest in such a plan.
Would he bend to the inevitable and cut down, I wonder, or would he
head for another doctor?
</P>
<P>
   Or would he run out of prescription cigarettes midmonth and head
out to the black market for more? Or would he possibly decide to
stake out a corner of that market for himself, selling out his
wares and begging a new prescription because he left the old one on
the train? Would he sell to adults, or to kids too? Would I ever
catch on?
</P>
<P>
   It's a fantasy for cigarettes, but real enough for the real
prescription drugs. Most unused medication stays in medicine
cabinets, but quite a bit finds its way to the friends and
relatives of the first owners, and quite a bit more to the black
market for prescription drugs that flourishes in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Medications are as tightly regulated here as anywhere in the
world, but even so, with the right friends, almost any pill you
want can be yours.
</P>
<P>
   A prescription pad of mine vanished a few years ago, and I had
the eerie experience, several months later, of looking at a forged
prescription faxed over by an intuitive pharmacist. It was filled
out for an antibiotic: right dose, right quantity, and right
signature in the very wrong handwriting. That was the last I ever
heard of my pad. Maybe some of the other medications it suggested
actually helped someone out.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that even if the Supreme Court upholds the FDA's
right to regulate tobacco, not much is likely to change for adults
like my patient. What the agency really wants is to keep children
and teenagers away from their first cigarettes. It long ago
acknowledged its limits in steering adults away from their
millionth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency recognizes the need for cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco products to remain available to adults,'' Dr. David A.
Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, wrote at the start of this
cycle of regulatory efforts in 1995. ``The potential disruption to
society resulting from the elimination of tobacco products would be
great, and therefore FDA does not intend to remove them from the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   That must be one of the saddest admissions of defeat ever logged
in medical history. But until we accumulate a little more wisdom in
managing the ties between human beings and the substances they
love, perhaps it is the only possible choice.

   AT RISK: In Heated Heroin, a Dangerous Dragon
</P>
<P>
   Heroin users trying to avoid infected needles have turned in
increasing numbers in recent years to ``chasing the dragon'':
heating the drug and inhaling its fumes. But that method can cause
a rare brain disorder that can in turn cause paralysis and even
death, according to Columbia University neurologists.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors, writing in the journal Neurology, reported the case
of a 21-year-old Manhattan woman who was brought to
Columbia-Presbyterian ``nearly at death's door, unable to talk or
move,'' Dr. Arnold Kriegstein, a neurologist who treated her, said
in an interview. When her sister said the woman had been ``chasing
the dragon'' every day for two weeks, Kriegstein and his colleagues
were reminded of an outbreak of the brain disorder, spongiform
leukoencephalopathy, that had killed 11 heroin users in Amsterdam
years before.
</P>
<P>
   The disease produces a spongelike pattern of fluid-filled holes
in the deep layers of the brain tissue known as white matter.
</P>
<P>
   Because the condition can be caused by a variety of toxins, and
because in the Amsterdam outbreak people who injected or sniffed
heroin from the same batches were unaffected, researchers speculate
that the culprit is a contaminant that adds its vapor to the heroin
plume when heated. After the woman was admitted, her boyfriend came
in for treatment, suffering from severe difficulties speaking and
talking. Another man who had shared a small amount of their
apparently tainted heroin agreed to be examined, and was found to
have subtle movement dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known treatment for spongiform leukoencephalopathy,
Kriegstein said, and those patients who survive have usually
suffered permanent brain damage. But because her doctors found high
levels of lactic acid in the woman's white matter _ a sign of
metabolic disruption _ they gave her large doses of vitamin E,
vitamin C and coenzyme Q, antioxidants that can help restore
cellular function.
</P>
<P>
   She gradually improved, and left the hospital after two months.
Now, three years later, she is nearly normal, said Kriegstein.
``She walks, runs, rides a bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kriegstein is a long way, however, from calling the treatment a
cure. The boyfriend received similar treatment, but had to be
hospitalized again after he returned to heroin use. He was left
with some permanent motor difficulties. The third man never
returned for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   NUTRITION: Craving Kale? A Study Explains Why
</P>
<P>
   Here's another benefit of getting older: vegetables taste
better.
</P>
<P>
   That's because sensitivity to bitterness declines with age, a
University of Washington study has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, presented at an Agriculture Department conference
this month, 329 women ages 21 to 84 were tested for their responses
to a bitter medicine and asked what foods they enjoyed and what
they actually ate. The younger the woman, the stronger the reaction
to the medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Older women reported an increasing preference for green
vegetables, whole grain foods, bitter fruits like grapefruits and
lemons and drinks like coffee and tea. ``Age was the best predictor
of healthy diets,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   UPDATE: Cardiologists Share the Latest Wisdom
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists got together in Atlanta last week for the annual
meeting of the American Heart Association. Here's a sampling of the
studies presented:
</P>
<P>
   _People who take aspirin for the heart's health may be asked to
take Tylenol as well someday. A Baylor medical school study of
rabbits on high-fat diets found that those also given
acetaminophen, the chemical in Tylenol, developed less of the fatty
streaking in their arteries. The streaking can be a precursor to
clogging.
</P>
<P>
   _Orange juice could be good, too. In a study by the University
of Western Ontario, financed in part by Tropicana, 25 men and women
with moderately high cholesterol levels had those levels improved
after they drank three glasses of orange juice a day for a month.
</P>
<P>
   _When a man has a heart attack, his wife should think about
changing her habits. Because couples generally eat the same foods
and often share habits, like smoking or being sedentary, they can
also share the risk factors for cardiac disease. A University of
Nebraska study of 170 men recovering from heart attacks found that
their wives had similar or higher risk factors like high
cholesterol levels and body-mass indexes, but were not getting the
same kind of screening and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   _Impotence does not usually lead men to think about their
hearts, but it should, said a researcher from the Minneapolis Heart
Institute Foundation. Because the blood vessels in the penis are
narrower than in other parts of the body, clogging of the arteries
can lead to impotence before symptoms of heart disease are
apparent. In a study of 50 impotent men, 20 were found to have
asymptomatic blockages of their coronary arteries. So men suffering
from this condition should ask their doctors about more than
impotence treatments, the researcher said.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE LAB: Treadmill Regimen Yields Smarter Mice
</P>
<P>
   Salk Institute researchers have found that, at least in mice,
what the body does can shape the brain's development and enhance
memory and learning.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published this month in Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, Dr. Fred H. Gage and his colleagues at Salk,
in La Jolla, Calif., compared mice allowed to run freely on an
exercise wheel with a genetically identical group of sedentary
mice. After six weeks, the two groups of mice were placed in a
series of mazes. In the easy ones, all the mice performed well. But
when the test was made more difficult, only the runners were able
to perform; the sedentary mice were unable to master the task.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that running had increased the number
of cells in only one area of the brain, the hippocampus, a deep
structure that plays an important role in learning and memory.
</P>
<P>
   What was more surprising was that when they looked for the
biochemical changes that indicate memory formation, they found them
only in the area where the new cells had been formed. ``In other
words,'' said Gage, ``the changes were not global, but were highly
specific for one region of the brain. So we're pretty sure that the
new cells are responsible for the improved performance in these
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Gage, who with colleagues turned neural science upside down last
year by reporting that the human brain continues to generate new
cells in adulthood, cautioned against generalizing his results to
humans. ``We know that there are cells that divide in the brain,''
he said. ``Now we know that what the organism does affects the
number of cells, and that these cells in turn influence behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: When Patrons Have a Few Too Many
</P>
<P>
   How can a staggering drunk get a bartender to keep serving him?
Usually he just asks, say researchers looking for ways to limit
alcohol-related injuries and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In two studies at the University of Minnesota, researchers hired
actors to feign severe intoxication and see what happened when they
tried to buy drinks. The findings were presented last week at a
meeting of the American Public Health Association in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the study's first phase, the actors _ scented with whiskey,
clothes rumpled, weaving slightly _ made 68 visits to 24 bars. They
were turned away 5 times. Once inside, each staggered to a bar
stool, asked confused questions in slurred speech and ordered a
double vodka. They were turned down 20 times and served 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   If given a drink, the actor lurched off to the men's room,
losing the drink along the way, and ordered another double vodka
within five minutes. They were served 23 times and refused 20
times.
</P>
<P>
   The study's second phase extended the trial to 336 bars,
restaurants, liquor stores and grocery stores: 79 percent of the
businesses sold alcohol to the pseudodrunks.
</P>
<P>
   When the bartenders did rebuff requests, they usually did so
without explanation or with comments on the actors' inebriation.

   The Pill, for Crustaceans
</P>
<P>
   The marine food chain seems so basic. Little things are eaten by
bigger things, which in turn are eaten by bigger things, which are
eaten by still bigger things, until the catch of the day ends up on
a dinner plate.
</P>
<P>
   A nice concept, but like so much in life, not as straightforward
as it might appear. Take the relationship between diatoms,
single-celled algae that are a large component of plankton, and the
tiny crustaceans known as copepods that feed on them.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a simple case of the more the merrier, of copepods
getting fat and happy when they gorge on diatoms. Rather, as
Italian scientists report in the journal Nature, chemicals in the
algae can act like a birth control pill, sharply reducing the
number of copepod eggs that hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, studying copepods in the northern Adriatic Sea,
showed that as few as 12 percent of eggs hatched during blooms of
diatoms that occur over several weeks each winter. During times of
more normal diatom concentration, as many as 90 percent of eggs
hatched.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers point out that copepods reproduce successfully
when they dine on other plankton that contain powerful neurotoxins.
They suggest that the crustaceans have developed a defense system
against these poisons but have been far slower to evolve a means of
coping with a toxin that affects the developing embryo.
</P>
<P>
   The Complexities of Dirt
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the food chain is not so simple, but here is something
that is: dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong again. As any gardener knows, soil has structure, due
largely to the presence of decaying organic matter, or humus.
Scientists know that this structure is highly complex, and that the
shape of humic substances (the organic electrolytes resulting from
decay) can affect how well soil retains carbon (which can be used
by plants) and pollutants or pesticides. A denser, coiled shape has
some advantages over a looser, elongated structure.
</P>
<P>
   It had been assumed that coiled structures were formed under
acidic conditions, and elongated structures under alkaline. But a
research team, using an X-ray microscope at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory to perform a kind of high-tech soil analysis,
has shown that things are even more complicated than that.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, writing in the journal Science, show that the
structure of these substances depends on a variety of other
factors, including whether they formed in soil or in river water,
and the chemical and mineral makeup of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsday Beanbags
</P>
<P>
   When scientists got a look at photos of Mathilde, an asteroid
encountered by the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft in
1997, they were puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid, about 30 miles in diameter, had several large
craters, presumably a result of collisions with other objects. But
unlike similar craters on the Moon, Mathilde's have no rims or
debris, signs that material was ejected when it was struck.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing researcher and colleagues, writing in Nature, suggest
why this is so. Rather than being solid rock, Mathilde is probably
a rubble pile, a porous agglomeration of smaller rocks. When struck
by an object, the asteroid's low density causes material to be
compacted, not ejected. The effect is something like punching a
beanbag chair.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who developed the theory after conducting
simulation experiments in which they fired projectiles at samples
of porous material, say it could explain why material from porous
asteroids seldom reaches Earth in the form of meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   It might also mean bad news for those who are thinking about
ways to save Earth if a large asteroid is ever found to be on a
collision course with the planet. Current thinking is that such a
doomsday rock could be diverted by a huge explosive device,
delivered by a rocket. But the new theory suggests that some
asteroids might be able to absorb the blow and just keep coming.

NO-COMPETE CONTRACTS CAN PLAY HAVOC WITH TELEVISION NEWS ANCHORS
</HEADLINE>
 (Texas points ATTN) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tracy Rowlett is a talker by trade, a connoisseur of words and
oral prose, of high-minded phrases and playful puns. When he talks
of communication between anchor and viewer, and this he does a lot,
what he really means is connecting, which makes one wonder if he's
feeling a sense of disconnection about now.
</P>
<P>
   It's Day 224 since Rowlett, 56, last delivered the news from
behind the anchor desk of Dallas-Fort Worth's No. 1 television news
operation at WFAA-TV. To better understand his recent frustration,
imagine doing a job you love dearly nearly every day for 25 years.
Now imagine it's gone.
</P>
<P>
   At least now he takes comfort in knowing that the end _ and
beginning _ is near.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlett will make his first appearance at his new on-air home,
KTVT, at the stroke of midnight Jan. 1, anchoring the station's
special Y2K coverage, injecting the local TV news race with a shot
of fresh competition from an old face.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlett will officially end this waiting game, which dates back
to April 6 when he signed off from WFAA, leaving for vacation,
never to return after a bitter contract dispute. His disagreements
with the ABC network affiliate have been well chronicled in the
print media and not necessarily in favor of his former employer,
depicted as The Evil Empire. It hasn't helped balance the public
opinion scales that WFAA executives declined to comment for this
story and others.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Rowlett said, the decision to leave ``wasn't about
money. It was merely about a fair contract. Contracts, you must
remember, are written to the benefit of the company. And they
insisted on contracts, on non-competes, and so forth. And all I was
asking for was just that they wouldn't fire me without cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounds simple enough. But the phrase ``without cause''
turned out to be the unyielding bone of contention on both sides.
WFAA wanted the freedom to fire for any reason, like failing to
attract key age demographics, such as young viewers. Pushing 60,
Rowlett saw it as career suicide.
</P>
<P>
   And economic suicide, too, since his major financial motivation
in what could be the last decade of his career was to sock away
enough money to make certain that his 13-year-old son, Michael, is
taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Born severely autistic, Michael ``will never ever be able to
earn a dime on his own,'' Rowlett said. ``I need to make enough
money so that I can support him for the rest of his life. So I just
couldn't let them do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Rowlett's loyalty to WFAA even more astounding. He
was willing to remain at the station with a four-year contract at
no major salary increase _ but without the standard clothing
allowance; in effect, a decrease in salary _ if WFAA had merely
agreed to his wishes about the ``without cause'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   When WFAA General Manager Kathy Clements-Hill returned with what
would be the station's final offer, it was a four-year deal with a
slight bump in salary where the ``without cause'' stipulation was
taken out the first two years, to be reinserted for the final two.
It made Rowlett wonder if they had plans to send him out to
pasture, particularly if his ratings softened.
</P>
<P>
   With NBC-owned KXAS also in the hunt for Rowlett, CBS-owned KTVT
had the quicker draw, going to the network and returning with a
reported $1 million annual salary over seven years. Nowhere is
there a ``without cause'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   Ties severed, this set up the legal fight over the validity of
non-compete clauses. WFAA wanted Rowlett to stay off the air until
July, which would have stretched his wait to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terribly frustrating and disappointing,'' Rowlett said.
``I didn't expect them to be turning cartwheels about this. I
understand that it's a business. But at the same time, I consider
upper management at Belo (WFAA's parent company) to be friends of
mine. At least they would treat me respectfully and with some
degree of compassion. But I felt they were taking a very punitive
stance. We had no choice but to file the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a court-appointed arbitrator to rule whether a
non-compete clause, a station-protection device preventing Rowlett
from starting at a competing station until July of next year, was
binding. The compromise struck was that he could appear on-air in
January, which means that until then the Rowlett voice couldn't be
heard on any airwaves in Fort Worth-Dallas; nor could his image be
in any way connected to KTVT. (The ruling is so specific that we
couldn't conduct an interview with Rowlett or take photos of him at
WFAA, and executives there ``went ballistic,'' Rowlett said, when,
during a recent live report from the KTVT Dallas studio, he nearly
walked into the camera shot by accident.)
</P>
<P>
   There was verbal mud-slinging between Rowlett and Clements-Hill
in the print media. There was a purchase of KTVT by CBS followed by
a housecleaning that included the firing of some 60 staffers, three
of them on-air personnel. (Rowlett characterizes this as a ``body
count,'' a way to streamline KTVT to the staff size of CBS stations
in comparable markets.)
</P>
<P>
   Now it's down to business. Rowlett is in the odd position of
fighting the station he helped build to national prominence. Those
who say Rowlett doesn't stand a chance in turning around the
fortunes at KTVT should note that WFAA was ranked a distant third
in the market before he signed on as anchor in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, KTVT is not only the fourth horse in a five-horse race,
but its newscast has a reputation for using sensational stories and
animated, giggly anchors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`ve been in this business too long to think that any one
person can turn around a news station,'' Rowlett said. ``It takes a
team effort. We have good executive producers, a good news director
and reporters. So it's a matter of everyone getting on the same
page.''
</P>
<P>
   KTVT has talent, such as co-anchor Karen Borta, reporter Steve
Pickett and reporter/anchor Rene Syler. And since August, Rowlett
has been the station's hands-on managing editor, working directly
with reporters on their writing and story development. Knowing that
the station must change from top to bottom, he wants to establish a
tone and mood for the station's on-air style, to give it a cleaner,
more cerebral look and approach. He's stressing the kind of
enterprise stories that come from basic, hit-the-pavement
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give people good newscasts that are well paced and
have substance to them,'' he said. ``That alone changes the mood of
the broadcast. If people today tell us they're fed up with
sensationalism in broadcast news, and they trust us as journalists
less each day, then it behooves us to listen to them and put on a
product that is responsive. There's nothing fancy here. No
gimmicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowlett said he's not overly dismayed at where KTVT currently
sits in the market. ``I've been here long enough that I can see the
potential. I feel we can be competitive, and to be competitive, I
don't mean that Channel 11 has to march up to No. 1 in the next
year or so. I don't think that's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't sit back forever and say, `Isn't it great we're
out there trying?' We'll have to have some success. And we will.''

LARRY KEITH ROBISON: JUSTICE DELAYED, BUT PERHAPS NOT DENIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly, one tortured legal step after another, the relatives of
Bruce Gardner are inching toward justice.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling last week by state district Judge Everett Young that
Larry Keith Robison is mentally competent to be executed for
killing the Fort Worth man in 1982 brings the final curtain of a
17-year tragedy one act closer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, relatives of five victims are waiting for the end of
this passion play. Although Robison was only tried for the shooting
death of 33-year-old Gardner, he savagely killed Rickey Lee Bryant,
Gloria Ann Reed and her son, Scott, and Earline Barker the same
bloody August day.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was just hours away from lethal injection on Aug. 17
when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary stay,
ordering a competency hearing to determine whether Robison
understood that he was to be put to death for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Robison's mother, his attorneys and death-penalty opponents have
long professed that mental illness should exempt Larry from his
jury-imposed sentence with the needle. Make that twice jury-imposed
sentence. Two different juries seated before two different judges
determined that Robison was sane when he committed the crimes, sane
when he was convicted and sane when he was sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony last week by five mental health experts, including
three hired on Robison's behalf, along with Robison's own apologies
to the victims' families led Young to the right decision: Larry
Keith Robison clearly understands the consequence that awaits him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the judge's ruling last week was not the end of the story.
Attorneys for Robison _ or more accurately, for his mother, who has
fought doggedly to keep her son's death penalty from being carried
out _ say they plan to appeal Young's competency ruling, saying
that more tests are needed and that Larry only said what he said
because he doesn't want the world to think he's mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that a mother would want to do everything
possible to save the life of her son, but another round of appeals
is nothing more than a stall tactic. Drag it out long enough, and
one could expect Robison's lawyers to attempt to argue that
delaying the execution is in itself cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court shut down that avenue last
week when it refused to consider whether the execution of prisoners
nearly two decades after taking up residence on Death Row is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals from Florida and Nebraska Death Row inmates who claimed
that delayed executions _ one for 20 years, the other for almost 25
_ violated their Eighth Amendment rights were rejected. Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote one of the most common-sense concurrences to
ever come out of the high court: ``I am unaware of any support in
the American constitutional tradition or in this court's precedent
that a defendant can avail himself of the panoply of (appeals) and
then complain when his execution is delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Death-penalty opponents have been working overtime on Robison's
case, citing how ``barbaric and capricious'' the act of capital
punishment is. In truth, the death penalty is the least arbitrary
and capricious punishment assigned in the American criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   The law is relentless to the point of obsessiveness in finding
reasons to set aside a death sentence. If it weren't, this country
wouldn't have killers sitting on Death Row decade after decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, fewer than 500 Death Row felons have seen
their sentences carried out. More than 2,000 have had their
sentences vacated. A Death Row prisoner is more likely to have the
sentence overturned, commuted, a new trial ordered or a pardon
granted than he is to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   So don't talk to the families of Bruce Gardner, Rickey Lee
Bryant, Earline Barker, and Gloria Ann and Scott Reed about how
``capricious'' capital punishment is in this country.
``Capricious'' may be used to describe whatever evil and
inexplicable urge drove Larry Keith Robison to slaughter five
people on Aug. 10, 1982 _ but please don't insult the memories of
the victims by using it to describe justice, no matter how long it
might be delayed.

SLEEPING WITH THE BABY IS A HOT BED OF DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a simple question: When it's time each night for new
parents to get some much-needed shut-eye, is it OK to bring baby
into the bed?
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a simple answer. The family bed is, in fact, a
hotbed of discussion among health and mental-health experts,
government officials and parents.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the debate are pediatricians and child
psychologists who argue that co-sleeping, as the practice is
called, is a bad idea, fostering a range of emotional problems and
physical risks for children. The most recent and serious criticism
of the family bed came in late September when the federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission issued a warning to parents not to allow
children under age 2 to sleep in their beds. Co-sleeping, the
commission said, increased the risk of infant death.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the issue are, again, more pediatricians
and child psychologists _ and parents _ who won't roll over and
accept the commission's statement. These experts argue that the
family bed is not only safe but also helps babies develop a sense
of trust, intimacy and self-assuredness. Foremost among these
family bed proponents is University of Notre Dame anthropologist
James McKenna, who this week will discuss his 18 years of research
on mother/baby sleep patterns at the annual meeting of the American
Anthropological Association in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is often theoretical, sometimes statistical and at
times overly personal. But it's a discussion with practical
implications for every new parent who simply wants to do what's
best for baby. Whatever that may be.
</P>
<P>
   BAN THE BABY
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission's September statement
reignited family bed debate because of the link it proclaimed
between co-sleeping and infant deaths. The commission based its
findings on a study of infant deaths from 1990 to 1997. During that
time, 515 children died while sleeping in their parents' beds. In
121 of those deaths, a parent _ or another child in the bed _
accidentally smothered the child. The other 394 deaths occurred
when the children became trapped in the bed structure or were
suffocated by bedding.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Melissa Garretson, a pediatrician with the Fort Worth-based
Cook Children's Medical Center network, agrees with the
commission's warning. She says she urges all new parents to
establish separate sleeping areas for their baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have them in a separate bed for risk of
suffocation,'' Garretson says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides obstruction of air passages, Garretson says, it's
possible for babies to rebreathe their own air and be unable to
lift their heads on a soft mattress designed for adults.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to physical risks, those who oppose the family bed
point to developmental problems, such as separation anxiety and
lifelong dependence, that can result in children who are raised
sharing a bed with their parents. Garretson also says that parents
invite bad habits in a shared bed by waking up and responding to
everything the baby does, and offers this argument: If every time
you made a noise during the night, your favorite person woke up and
held you and comforted you, ``why would you sleep through the
night?''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate bed, Garretson says, babies break that habit of
waking up. ``Usually you have a baby who learns how to self-calm
and learns to sleep all night, and everybody gets a good night's
sleep,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   BRING THE BABY IN
</P>
<P>
   Jenny and John McAllister of Arlington, Texas, are the parents
of two children: Matt is 2 years old and Jake is about 3 months
old. The McAllisters didn't intend to have a family bed, but when
their first child was born, it just happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few nights of trying to do the crib thing, we decided
this was easier,'' Jenny said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband were concerned about the possible problems
associated with co-sleeping, ``but for us it was more comforting to
have (Matt) close at hand,'' she says. ``We were able to get him
back to sleep quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   The safety commission's September warning didn't worry her,
McAllister said; it just made her look again to be sure they were
taking all the necessary precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense is the biggest key to making co-sleeping work,''
McAllister said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she feels her child is safe in the family bed, and she
and her husband are making an informed decision, knowing the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (co-sleeping) is wonderful,'' she said. ``We did what
felt the most natural and the most right and what seemed to work
for our son the best.''
</P>
<P>
   For many families, the family bed does seem to work best. One
1988 study of sleep habits in New York and Cleveland showed that 19
percent of Anglo families, 59 percent of black families and 26
percent of Hispanic families practiced co-sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United States, the family bed is even more common.
In Japan and other Eastern countries, co-sleeping is the norm _ in
fact, according to the Couple to Couple League, a Catholic group
that studies family planning and fertility, children sleep with
their mothers in 90 percent of cultures around the world.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, the Notre Dame anthropologist, is one of co-sleeping's
most vocal proponents. His studies of mother/baby sleep patterns
show that co-sleeping babies cry less, sleep more and are often
placed in safer positions when they sleep.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna has spoken out against the warnings issued against
bed-sharing, saying they're not based on science and make parents
who want to sleep with their children feel guilty unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Another group supports co-sleeping for quite different reasons.
Mary Kouba and her husband are coordinators of the North Texas
chapter of the Couple to Couple league.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted nursing suppresses ovulation and delays the return
of fertility after birth, which aids in family planning. The Couple
to Couple League encourages this unrestricted nursing. Co-sleeping
makes nursing easier during the night, so it happens more often,
Kouba says _ which makes it a good tool for delaying fertility.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Koubas' four children started out sleeping in their
parents' bed, Kouba said. They stayed there until they were 18
months to 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience was that having the babies in bed with us made
our nighttimes less stressful,'' Kouba said. (MORE)

<P>
   NOTHING TO LOSE SLEEP OVER
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the decision about co-sleeping, like most parenting
choices, is up to each family.
</P>
<P>
   And that decision may be based on personal experiences of what
works _ and sentiments about what feels right.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while the Koubas find co-sleeping relaxing,
Garretson points out that having a baby in bed can put a dent in
sleep quality for new parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the adjustment time it takes to get used to
sleeping with your spouse,'' Garretson says. ``It takes just as
long to get used to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Babies will make noise, or parents will move and wake the babies
up _ ``It's kind of that vicious cycle of everybody waking
everybody up,'' Garretson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Omar Gomez, a pediatrician at an office of Cook Children's
Physicians' Network, said probably half of his patients practice
co-sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people don't really think about all the risks, so
you have to bring it up,'' he sais. ``It does go on, so parents
have to make an informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said most families' habits won't change. For those who do
want to practice co-sleeping, he just urges common sense and says
it doesn't hurt to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to do what they're going to do,'' he said.
``So we should do what we can to make it a little safer.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   Safety steps if you choose the family bed:
</P>
<P>
   --Use a firm mattress, and make sure the child is sleeping on
her back or side. It's easier for children to rebreathe air if they
can't lift up their heads, sais pediatrician Melissa Garretson. A
firm surface limits that risk. Babies and young children should
never sleep on waterbeds.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't use big pillows or heavy blankets. And never put your
baby on a pillow _ he could roll off or suffocate.
</P>
<P>
   --Never put a baby in bed with another young child. The bed
becomes more crowded, and toddlers move and squirm more during
sleep. A toddler also doesn't understand that babies can't defend
themselves against suffocation or overlying, so they don't have a
natural need to protect the baby.
</P>
<P>
   --Never allow a baby to share a bed with an adult who is under
the influence of alcohol or medication. These substances increase
the risk of rolling onto the baby and make it harder for the adult
to wake up at the baby's distress. ___
</P>
<P>
   Tips for transitioning out of the family bed:
</P>
<P>
   --Try a ``co-sleeper'' bassinet that attaches to the adult bed;
the baby is still near the parents, but in a protected, separate
area.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't feel guilty. Don't think of it as ignoring the baby's
needs during the night; think of it as helping her learn how to
sleep through the night. In a separate bed, ``as children learn how
to sleep, they learn how to self-calm, and then learn how to put
themselves to sleep,'' pediatrician Melissa Garretson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once (children) are really verbalizing, you can talk to them a
little bit,'' Gomez said. Instead of reassuring them physically by
inviting them into your bed, ``you can reassure them with words
that you're going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   --Gomez suggests developing a routine before bedtime by the time
children are 18 months to 2 years old. Read them a book, tell them
a story _ do something to make going to sleep alone a little
easier.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Blustery conditions will persist Tuesday across the northeastern
states and into New England as a strong area of low pressure over
the Canadian Maritimes continues to draw cold air to the south.
Snow showers will develop in the northern mountains of New England
where moisture from the Atlantic is drawn inland and is forced to
rise over the hilly terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, isolated snow showers will also develop downwind
of Lakes Erie and Ontario on Tuesday, but there will be little, if
any accumulation. Winds will remain over 30 mph along the northeast
seaboard, which will make it feel more like December than November.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, cool breezes from the north will continue in the
Southeast. High pressure will promote abundant sunshine, which will
offset some of the cooling resulting from the winds. Farther west,
much of Texas will remain unseasonably warm with afternoon readings
reaching the 70s and even the low 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty clouds will develop across the Dakotas and into the
western Great Lakes ahead of a weak front. It will remain rather
cool in this region. Temperatures will rise once again to
exceptionally warm levels for this time of year across the central
Plains under ample amounts of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Rain will accompany an area of low pressure and move into
northern California on Tuesday. Farther north, showers are likely
in coastal sections of Washington and Oregon, while snow showers
develop in the northern Cascades. Meanwhile, southern California
and the deserts of the Southwest will remain warm and dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Late Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   While cold air swept across the Northeast on Monday, a late
blooming hurricane named Lenny with central winds near 100 mph
churned eastward through the Caribbean Sea about 200 miles south of
Jamaica. November hurricanes are not rare in the tropical Atlantic
Ocean. Since official records began in 1886, at least one hurricane
has been observed on each day of the month. Only four November
hurricanes have crossed the coast of the United States during the
last century. The most recent was in 1985 when Hurricane Kate made
landfall on the Florida panhandle on Nov. 21.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FRIENDS AND FOES GATHER AT COMDEX
 &HT;    Moving in (a) national and (f) financial categories.

   LAS VEGAS _ Back in the nation's capital, Microsoft Corp. has
been branded by a federal judge as an abusive monopolist. But here
in this gambling capital, host this week to a huge computer trade
show, Microsoft is widely seen as a high roller that's trying to
beat the odds in the courts and in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are like everybody else in this cut-throat industry,''
said Alan Jones, president of SCM Microsystems, a Silicon Valley
firm that sells ``smartcard'' security devices. ``Microsoft is
seeking every advantage they can get. The difference is that they
are so big that they can't help but run afoul of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   As the world's largest software company, Microsoft is attracting
lots of attention at the 20th fall Comdex, the world's largest
computer show, which formally opened on Monday. Not all of it is
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   A banner the size of a football field, tied to the side of a
parking garage near the Las Vegas Convention Center, where half the
exhibits are housed, reads: ``Scott McNealy Doesn't Want Your
Money.''
</P>
<P>
   McNealy, head of Sun Microsystems Inc., tangled with Microsoft
in the landmark antitrust case over its Java software. McNealy, who
argues that his rival should be barred from acquiring other
high-tech firms for the next five years, recently acquired Star
Office, a full-featured applications suite that competes with
best-selling Microsoft Office. The Sun suite can be downloaded for
free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy has been tapped as one of eight industry leaders who are
giving keynote speeches here. But his address on Wednesday is
unlikey to attract the standing-room crowd of 8,000 that came to
hear Microsoft chairman Bill Gates speak and show off his wares for
90 minutes on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over America there are entreprenuers working in their
garages and lawyers working in the 20th floor office, both doing
what they do best,'' Gates quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said that since U.S. District Court judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson issued his blistering findings of fact in the antitrust
case, people have told him that what ``Microsoft has done benefits
consumers,'' and ``instead of doing less innovation in Windows, we
should be doing more innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has built one of the largest pavilions at Comdex,
mainly to showcase its Windows 2000 operation system, scheduled to
be released in February. It is far cry from the tiny booth that
Gates staffed in 1979, when 4,000 people came to the first Comdex a
year before Microsoft signed a deal with IBM to provide an
operating system for a new line of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not distracted by the (antitrust) case at all,''
reported Jefferson Brand, a Microsoft engineer demonstrating
Biztalk, software designed to smooth e-commerce. ``We moving
forward on all fronts as fast as we can,'' Brand added, echoing the
company line.
</P>
<P>
   But at the far end of the exhibit hall, Carey Brooks of ATI
Technologies, a Canadian-based video card maker, voiced a more
skeptical view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been concerned over the power of Microsoft,'' he
said, ``We have to jump through hoops to satisfy them. They're
quite controlling in dictating their terms to everyone else in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some exhibitors and attendees sought to duck the antitrust
controversy, perhaps in response to Microsoft's power. Others
advanced their views in cautious and nuanced terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in this business is really free of Microsoft,'' said
Brooks McChesney of Bizfinity, a firm that is partnering with
Internet giant Cisco Systems to run business-to-business Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought them to be really tough guys,'' McChesney
added. ``But that's the way the world works. And we don't want the
government telling us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another frequent theme was sounded by James Kraskowski, a
Sony executive. ``I want to see when Microsoft stock splits
(again),'' he said. ``That's all I'll say about it.''

`SLEEPING WITH EXTRA-TERRESTRIALS': REASON IN AN AGE OF ANGELS AND
ALIENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 (DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As America slouches toward the year 2000, Wendy Kaminer suggests
in her new book, reason is on the run, and superstition,
pseudoscience and spiritual mumbo jumbo are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a case of members of the Heaven's Gate cult
committing suicide to join a flying saucer hiding behind the
Hale-Bopp comet. It's not just a case of worshiping at the shrines
of Princess Diana and Elvis, or of Nancy Reagan's consulting
astrologers about her husband's White House schedule. According to
polls cited by Ms. Kaminer, 93 percent of the population believes
in angels, 49 percent believes the government is concealing
information about UFO's, and more than 25 percent believes in
reincarnation and the possibility of communicating with the dead.
Rationality is condemned as left-brain thinking by New Agers,
shrugged off as a male-based trait by vociferous feminists and
dismissed as phony objectivity by radical postmodernists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaminer has addressed such issues before in ``I'm
Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional'' (1992) and ``It's All the
Rage'' (1995), and the debt to those earlier books remains very
much in evidence in ``Sleeping With Extraterrestrials.'' At the
same time ``Sleeping'' reads like a hodgepodge of essays, loosely
cobbled together around the theme of ``irrationalism and the perils
of piety,'' a capacious subject that allows Ms. Kaminer to wander
off on extended (and sometimes only tangentially relevant) riffs
about the drug war, crack babies and therapeutic feminism.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaminer's lame excuse for this incoherence is that she has
tried to adapt to the cyber-age Zeitgeist, which encourages
spontaneous, nonlinear thinking. ``While I continue to compose my
sentences,'' she writes, ``I have changed the way I conceive of my
books. I digress. I imagine each chapter as an autonomous essay,
because I know that people no longer read books about ideas
sequentially.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the decline of rationalism, Ms. Kaminer
persuasively makes the point, as she has before, that ``popular
psychologies assume the authenticity of subjective experience'' _
an outlook that discourages the demand for facts and corroborative
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The therapeutic culture shaped by the recovery movement is
profoundly irrational,'' she writes. ``It seeks truth not in debate
but in revelation. It values bolstering people's self-esteem over
challenging their ideas. It assesses proposed truths partly by the
passion with which they are held and partly by their alleged
therapeutic effect. True beliefs are those that help you `heal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Given this mindset, Ms. Kaminer argues, books like ``The
Celestine Prophecy,'' ``Embraced by the Light,'' ``A Book of
Angels'' and ``Conversations With God'' _ which variously depict a
world without tragedy and random accidents, a world in which people
can control their lives and death can be transcended _ are readily
embraced by readers reluctant even to question the basis for such
sentimental optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celestine Prophecy'' goes so far as to suggest that reason
is an outmoded human tool: it suggests, Ms. Kaminer writes, that
people will one day simply ``intuit'' the answers to global
problems. Other books and inspirational speakers cloak their more
fanciful assertions in the jargon of pseudoscience. Deepak Chopra
buttresses his theories with allusions to physics and biology, and
Marianne Williams cites Einstein, Bohr and Heisenberg in her own
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kaminer does a succinct job of situating current New Age
beliefs in context with the American tradition of ``positive
thinking'' (from the ``mind cure'' movements of the 19th century
through Norman Vincent Peale's more recent appeals), and she makes
a compelling argument that the self-absorption embodied by such
beliefs can create a complacent body politic. She contends that
``the habits of unreason'' encouraged by pop spirituality books _
not to mention the ``childlike craving for authority'' nurtured by
many recovery movement gurus _ can lead to passivity and a
reluctance to grapple with the social realities of the world around
us.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Kaminer sees it, the current ``smorgasbord of religions
and newly spiritualized pop psychologies'' are evidence of a 1990s
``religious and spiritual revival'' fueled by widespread,
nonsectarian anxiety about social change and a declining faith in
government. Prayer groups and Bible study groups have proliferated,
she observes, religion-based television shows like ``Touched by an
Angel'' have gained new popularity, and both the religious right
and communitarians on the left have begun to call for a
``remoralization of public policy debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the relationship between religion and public policy
raises important questions _ as the recent vote by the Kansas Board
of Education to discourage the teaching of evolution makes all too
clear _ Ms. Kaminer's discussion of these matters is undermined by
her own willful suspicion of all forms of faith and her beleaguered
conviction that nonbelievers are routinely vilified.
</P>
<P>
   She writes that agnostics and atheists are regarded as ``only a
little more virtuous than many prison inmates'' despite a 1994
survey that showed that 74 percent of Americans agree that someone
who does not believe in God ``can be a good or ethical person.''
While she is happy to brandish other poll results that serve her
purposes, she discounts this particular finding by arguing that
``many people are loath to admit their prejudices to pollsters,
even prejudices that are widely held.''
</P>
<P>
   The passages of this book dealing with politics and religion
tend to be peppered with gross generalizations and debatable
assumptions. In one chapter, for instance, Ms. Kaminer writes that
calls for private school vouchers may be part of an effort ``to
censor secular humanist materials in public schools and
re-establish official school prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an accurate description of the voucher movement,''
she argues, ``it could fairly be said to promise the elevation of
faith over reason in the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such speculative statements, as bereft of the sort
of supporting evidence she accuses New Age gurus of eschewing,
diminish the credibility of Ms. Kaminer's more rigorously argued
observations.

 &HT;    Depot's competition Dekor to sell online
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two former Home Depot executives plan to launch their
rival concept late next year.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Inglis and Herb Biggers, co-founders of a year-old company
called Dekor, recently told a trade publication they would start
selling products through stores and a Web site within 12 months. On
Monday, Biggers declined to discuss details of the home improvement
business, citing the competition with their former employer.
</P>
<P>
   According to National Home Center News, Dekor will sell paint,
wallcoverings, countertops and other remodeling products. The
stores will also offer installation and design services, according
to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis and Biggers left Atlanta-based Home Depot in 1996. Home
Depot filed a lawsuit against them and two other former employees
this summer, alleging that Inglis was cherry-picking experts from
Expo Design Center in Atlanta to launch a copycat chain. The
lawsuit was settled in September.
</P>
<P>
   At Home Depot, Inglis was a board member and executive vice
president. He is now chairman and chief executive officer of
Marietta-based Dekor, which is located off of Powers Ferry Road.
Biggers is president of Dekor.

WITH THE JACKAL'S DAY LONG GONE, FORSYTH TAILS THE PHANTOM OF THE
OPERA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For a writer who has donned the cloaks and wielded the
daggers of assassins and spies, mercenaries and hoodlums for some
30 years, Frederick Forsyth seems almost to be running scared.
</P>
<P>
   That is not altogether surprising. Forsyth, now 61, is about to
publish his newest book. In it _ possibly to the consternation of
some of the 50 million fans who bought his thrillers from ``Day of
the Jackal'' in 1971 to ``Icon'' in 1995 _ Forsyth has found love.
Not physical love, but a palette of far more tender emotion to
which he was drawn, most surprising of all, by Andrew Lloyd Webber,
the high priest of sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by a dinner conversation with that British composer,
Forsyth has written a sequel to the musical ``Phantom of the
Opera'' based on the single tantalizing question: What happened to
the Phantom after the curtain went down?
</P>
<P>
   In the musical _ based on a novel written in 1911 by Gaston
Leroux, a little-known French author _ the monstrous Phantom simply
disappears into the labyrinthine bowels of the Paris Opera.
Forsyth's new book, ``The Phantom of Manhattan'' (Thomas Dunne
Books, St. Martin's Press), to be published next week in the United
States and Britain, pursues the idea that the character somehow
escaped to New York to begin a new, hidden life.
</P>
<P>
   That alone should be enough to distinguish this slender 177-page
volume from Forsyth's earlier work. But as the story unfolds, the
reader rapidly sees many other differences. Strikingly, the single
anonymous narrative voice familiar to Forsyth's fans is replaced by
a variety of narrators, from a dying mistress of the ballet to a
cocky, young New York reporter and from the Phantom himself to a
hashish-smoking, thoroughly evil aide.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure, Forsyth includes an imagined conversation
between a priest and his God: a foray into theology that he fears
may give offense to some readers. (He describes himself as a
``lapsed Protestant'' with a belief in a deity but no conviction
about church ritual.)
</P>
<P>
   In creating what he called in an interview a ``romantic
novella,'' he said he was ``extremely apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a part of old Fred that hasn't been shown yet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of this hidden Forsyth, masked in the past as
effectively as the Phantom, has been just as difficult to reveal:
his agent and publishers, he said, had ``deep misgivings'' about
the new book, and its creation was more troublesome than his
thrillers had ever been. The book went to six partial revisions,
compared with Forsyth's usual practice of revising his original
manuscript only once before publication.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he said, he is concerned that readers who want more
of his hallmark derring-do will be disappointed, while others
looking for romantic themes will not be drawn to a name associated
with anything but the subtleties of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be jeered at, or it could be accepted,'' he said,
adding that readers might ask, ``Where's the spy?''
</P>
<P>
   The new book is ``set in 1906 on the streets of New York,'' he
said. ``There are no silenced automatics. So they may think they
have picked up the wrong book. I think everybody accepts that this
is a question mark. So will it just die within a week?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four publishers turned down `Day of the Jackal,' so who knows?
The arbiter is Joe Public. You can hype just so much. But if it's
worthless, it'll die.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he plans to go back to thrillers. Of the two projects
he is currently considering, he said somewhat enigmatically, one is
a work of fiction about a love affair set partly in the late 18th
century and partly in the late 20th. The other is a collection of
moments and memories _ not an autobiography or formal memoirs, he
insisted _ from four decades of his life ``in some weird places,''
from Biafra during the Nigerian civil war to East Berlin at the
height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth chose to be interviewed in the coffee shop of an upscale
West London hotel where, like the best of his undercover agents, he
drew no second glances as he strode briskly through the lobby. Even
his drink order seemed incongruously remote from his sinewy heroes
and millionaire-author public image: ``A pot of tea, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth gave up thriller writing after the publication of
``Icon,'' set largely in Russia after the Cold War. Of course, the
world's momentous shift away from ideological division has stripped
many a writer of a stock in trade, and in Forsyth's case there was
a feeling that he had gone as far as he could with a genre that had
had its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting jaded,'' he said. The themes were becoming ``a
bit samey,'' and he fell prey to existential thoughts. He
celebrated his 61st birthday a few weeks ago, and, he said, the
questions pushed in again: ``What are you going to do? You're
three-quarters of the way through life with a quarter to go. Do you
really want to go on doing this?
</P>
<P>
   ``And I really would like to try something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, he said, returning to the theme, the end of the
Cold War removed the Soviet Union as a prime ingredient of the
espionage thriller, and he is not sure the literary world has
discovered a convincing replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem is: find a good villain,'' he said.
``Villains are harder to invent. Heroes are two a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth estimated that some 60 million people have paid to see
Lloyd Webber's ``Phantom of the Opera,'' and so it must have been
quite a delicious encounter when the writer with 50 million in
sales _ and no great fascination with musicals _ and the composer
with even more in audience numbers chatted over dinner some two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but the conversation strayed to `The Phantom
of the Opera,' and he said the question that had always intrigued
him is what happened to them afterward,'' Forsyth said, referring
to the Phantom and his operatic love. After thinking about the idea
for a while, ``I said I would do it as a novella.''
</P>
<P>
   After some background research in New York, Forsyth worked on
the book in the winter of 1998. Although the novella marked a
change of style and substance, one constant remained: his favorite,
much-used typewriter.
</P>

   ``I'm computer-illiterate,'' he said, ``I write on a typewriter
with two forefingers. I don't see any reason to abandon the winning
system. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that lingers is whether his followers will think
the same when they measure the new Frederick Forsyth against the
old.

TRUST IN ECUADOR LEADER FADES OVER SECRET FUNDS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ President Jamil Mahuad has come under criticism
for accepting secret campaign contributions from a now-jailed
Ecuadorean businessman whose bank received vast sums of emergency
aid from Mahuad's government.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is the latest twist in a financial-sector meltdown
that has hurt hundreds of thousands of depositors and sent the
economy into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   It has also convinced many Ecuadorean voters that their
political leaders are beholden to wealthy donors. Some people are
demanding major reforms to Ecuador's loose campaign finance and
banking laws. Others are calling for Mahuad to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahuad put the decisions of his government up for sale,''
wrote Cesar Montufar, a columnist in the Quito daily El Comercio.
``He mortgaged the nation and flouted the idea that government
should be independent from private business interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The key figure in the scandal is Fernando Aspiazu, the top
executive and main shareholder of Banco del Progreso, Ecuador's
second-largest private bank until it closed in March.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiazu, who was arrested last month on charges of tax evasion,
announced from his jail cell that he gave $3.1 million to Mahuad's
1998 campaign war chest. That amount is nearly one-third of the $10
million Mahuad is believed to have spent to get elected in this
small Andean nation of 12.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides raising ethical questions about relying so heavily on a
single donor, the contribution was never registered with electoral
officials even though disclosure is required by law.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech this month, Mahuad acknowledged that he
accepted donations from Aspiazu but said the banker received no
special favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never made any promises to (Aspiazu) or to any other
campaign contributor,'' Mahaud said. ``If he thought that because
he made a donation to the campaign that he could make certain
demands in the running of the government, he was totally
mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts insist that Mahuad's handling of the banking
crisis clearly helped Aspiazu and other powerful bankers at the
public's expense.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles took hold shortly after Mahuad took office in
August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Falling prices for oil, Ecuador's leading export, and a 1995
border war with Peru created a huge fiscal deficit and slowed
growth. The Asian economic crisis spread to Latin America and
spurred capital flight. And flooding from the 1997-98 El Nio
weather pattern ruined hundreds of businesses, which defaulted on
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts also blame poor government supervision of the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   For example, until recently, bankers could channel up to 60
percent of loan portfolios to ventures they controlled. Many gave
themselves credits and wrote them off as bank losses, according to
Wilma Salgado, an economist and U.N. consultant in Quito, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Several major banks collapsed, and others were set to go under.
But instead of allowing weak banks to fail, as some economists
recommended, the government tried to save them by extending huge
sums in emergency credits.
</P>
<P>
   The government has not revealed how much Aspiazu's Banco del
Progreso received, but banking experts believe it was a
multimillion-dollar sum.
</P>
<P>
   For a handful of banks, the cash injections were not enough, and
the state took over their operations altogether. Today, 65 percent
of the Ecuadorean banking system is run by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The government's most drastic action was to declare a weeklong
bank holiday in March and to order the partial freezing of
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profession is totally disgraced. It's better not to admit
that you are a banker,'' said Santiago Bayas, a vice president at
Banco del Pichincha in Quito.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial move was the creation of the Deposit
Guarantee Agency to vouch for 100 percent of deposits. In effect,
the government agency lets the owners of failed banks off the hook
and makes taxpayers pick up the entire tab for reimbursing
depositors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is assuming all of these costs, and that means the
Ecuadorean people,'' Salgado said. ``No one asks what the bankers
did with the money or why their banks failed.''
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that Banco del Progreso was rife with
irregularities. One foreign economist described the bank as ``a den
of massive corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In his TV speech, Mahuad said that $550 million of the bank's
$800 million in credits were funneled to businesses and phantom
corporations controlled by Aspiazu. In one case, the sister of
Aspiazu's chauffeur was listed as the recipient of a huge loan. But
when reporters tracked her down, she turned out to be a seamstress
who knew nothing about the money.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing criminal charges, several bankers fled the country.
Aspiazu was finally jailed last month on accusations that he
withheld about $13 million in taxes from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Until the jailed banker revealed his $3.1 million donation to
the Mahuad campaign, many Ecuadoreans could not fathom why the
government waited so long to move against Aspiazu.
</P>
<P>
   According to political scientist Fernando Bustamante, Mahuad
needed the money from Aspiazu to compete with Alvaro Noboa, his
opponent in last year's election and one of Ecuador's richest men.
Noboa is also believed to have spent about $10 million in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Once in office, Mahuad named a handful of bank executives to top
posts in his administration, making it more difficult to adopt
tough measures when the crisis unfolded, according to Juana
Ordonez, assistant editor of Gestion business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mahuad's first superintendent of banks, the
government's financial sector watchdog, was a former lawyer for
Aspiazu.
</P>
<P>
   All told, rescuing the banking sector may end up costing $2
billion, a figure that outstrips the country's annual tax revenue,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the policy has helped to paralyze Ecuador's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ecuador's deep troubles, Mahuad had been considered an
honest, well-meaning public servant and seemingly a sharp contrast
from the nation's two previous presidents who were enmeshed in
corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Mahuad's job-approval rating has slipped to 14 percent.
There have been rumors of a military coup, while a number of
politicians have suggested that Mahuad step down.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez of Gestion described the campaign finance scandal as
``the beginning of the end of Mahuad's credibility.''

<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ The wanton slaughter of millions of bison in
the 19th century by white hide hunters, abetted by a military
intent on subjugating Indians, is probably the most famous
conservation horror story in United States history.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this tale, a growing number of scholars and
historians say, is that it is not true. As portrayed in a number of
new books, the real story of the decline of the buffalo involves a
significant change in climate, competition for forage and
cattle-borne disease. Another major factor, the authors say, were
Indian tribes, empowered by the horse and gun and driven to hunt
buffaloes for the profits that came from hides and meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most people don't consider in their `Dances With Wolves'
version of history is that Indians were involved in the market,''
said Dr. Dan Flores, the A.B. Hammond professor of Western history
at the University of Montana. ``They were cashing in on buffalo in
the 1840s as their principal entree into the market economy, and
very few species are able to survive when they become a
commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   White hunters who killed buffaloes by the millions in the 1870s
and 1880s played a major role in the demise, said Flores, but only
as the coup de grace. ``The hide hunters are not off the hook,'' he
said. ``They share the burden of the final mop-up. But without
their involvement, the buffalo would probably have only lasted
another 30 years.'' That is because their numbers had been so
greatly reduced by the other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The buffalo studies are part of a continuing debate about the
role of Indians in Western history. In ``The Ecological Indian''
(W.W. Norton, 1999), for example, Shepard Krech III, an
anthropologist at Brown University, argues against the romantic
image of the Indian as the first environmentalist. When Indians had
had the means and the motive, he says, they abused nature for
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, whose work on buffalo has appeared in The Journal of
American History and elsewhere, is writing a book on bison under
contract with Yale University Press. And Dr. Drew Isenberg, an
assistant professor of history at Princeton, has a book called
``The Destruction of the Bison: An Environmental History,
1750-1920,'' which will be published by Cambridge University Press
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone subscribes to the new wave. Dr. Vine Deloria Jr., a
professor of history at the University of Colorado at Boulder and a
member of the Standing Rock Sioux, finds the revisionism
preposterous. ``It's nonsense,'' he said. ``The Indians did not
make any appreciable dent in buffalo numbers in the Northern
Plains. It's anti-Indian stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians were involved in the buffalo market, scholars generally
agree. Their acquisition of horses and guns made buffalo hunting
much easier. As steamboats started plying the Missouri River into
the heart of buffalo country in the 1840s, hide hunting by the
Kiowa, Blackfeet, Sioux and other Plains tribes soared.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, there was a way to haul the bulky robes back
East, where they became popular as a covering during cold weather
travel and for leather goods. Indians found they could trade the
robes for firearms, lead balls, gunpowder, blankets, textiles, pots
and pans and whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg estimates that before the 1840s, 60,000 Plains Indians
were killing half a million bison a year for sustenance. After the
robe trade began in the 1840s, that total went over 600,000 a year,
``clearly into unsustainable range,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While white hunters killed more buffaloes (their total
throughout the West is estimated at four million), Flores argues
that Indians concentrated their killing on buffalo cows, which had
more tender meat and were much easier to skin and treat, resulting
in severe damage to the herds' reproductive capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental factors play large roles in newer histories of the
West. For example, Flores says that the study of tree rings, or
dendrochronology, suggests that Indians were so effective in
decimating the buffalo because climate had already weakened and
diminished the herds.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1500s to the mid-19th century, a period known as the
little ice age, tree rings show that the climate in the West was
much colder than normal. That favored the grasses buffaloes eat,
and they flourished. When a long, widespread drought ended the
little ice age in the mid-1800s, the grasses changed and the bison
population crashed just as the tribes began market hunting.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Flores said, buffaloes began having to compete
for forage with horses that were brought by the Spaniards to North
America in the 1500s and later went feral. By the 1800s, Flores
estimates, two million horses were sharing the range with the
buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Flores and the others also differ from their predecessors in
their use of Indian sources. Many bands of Indians, for example,
kept a record of events, often symbols painted on bison robes. The
Northern Plains tribes kept winter counts of buffaloes on buffalo
hides, while the Kiowa, in the south, kept calendars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symbol for `many buffalo,' a circle with a dot in the
middle, appears numerous times from 1800 to 1840 in the Kiowa
calendars,'' Flores said. ``But after 1840 it appears only once.''
</P>
<P>
   Such counts are crucial to the debate over who or what killed
off the bison, but all sides agree that estimates are a tricky
business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, historians estimated bison numbers at 40 million to
60 million, sometimes as many as 75 million. But Flores has tried
to calculate how many buffaloes the range could support by
analyzing 1910 census data on cattle, and has concluded that in
good years the range could hold only 20 million to 24 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the little ice age, at the time of the Civil War, buffalo
numbers may have been as low as 10 million to 12 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his calculations have been criticized by Deloria, who says
that comparing fenced-in livestock with free-roaming buffaloes is
an inappropriate comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calvin Luther Martin, who taught history at Rutgers and
lived with Eskimos for two years on the Alaskan tundra, also
disagrees. Martin, the author of a new book on Indian life, ``The
Way of the Human Being'' (Yale University Press), argues that to
judge Indians by contemporary environmental standards ``is patent
foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were caught between two different worlds and two
different realities, Martin said. ``They don't translate into each
other,'' he said, adding that Indians had no concept of being
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   And the claim that competition with horses would have affected
the buffalo has also been criticized by Dr. Valerius Geist, an
ecologist who is an emeritus professor of environmental science at
the University of Calgary in Alberta. Geist, author of ``Buffalo
Nation: The History and Legend of the North American Bison,'' noted
that bison had evolved on the prairie with other large mammals.
``Flores is a historian playing ecologist,'' Geist said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the new bison scholarship also casts doubt on another
major tenet of buffalo history: that the destruction of the herds
was a conspiracy between the United States Army and hide hunters
who did the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was a conspiracy by any means,'' Isenberg
said. ``The army was happy to see hide hunters, but they were not
commanding them to kill bison.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores traces the notion of a conspiracy to the memoir of a
Texas buffalo hunter named John R. Cook, called ``The Border and
the Buffalo.'' According to the book, the Gen. Philip H. Sheridan,
the Indian fighter, urged the Texas Legislature not to pass a law
that would protect the buffaloes remaining there and instead to
create a bronze medal for the hunters ``with a dead buffalo on one
side and a discouraged Indian on the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores said he had found no record of Sheridan's speech to the
legislature and believed it was apocryphal. The notion of a
conspiracy, he said, has become fact through repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said he had recently discovered letters in which Sheridan
wrote that he was concerned about the demise of the buffalo. After
hearing in October 1879 about the killing of thousands of buffaloes
by hide hunters near Miles City, Mont., Sheridan sent a telegram to
Washington, saying, ``I consider it important that this wholesale
slaughter of the buffalo should be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg denies that the new work on the buffalo is anti-Indian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's romantic to imagine Indians as always living in harmony
with nature,'' he said. ``But they are people who did many things
right and who also made mistakes. If you want to see them as a real
people and not a romantic notion, then you have to look with a
clear eye at these kinds of things. None of us have any animus
toward Indians.''

 &HT;    Lowe's disappoints some on Wall Street with latest earnings news
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of Lowe's Cos. took a hit Monday after the
retailer released a mildly disappointing earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street focused on a slip in sales at some stores, even
though Lowe's beat expectations with a 38 percent increase in
fiscal third-quarter profit. The stock dropped as much as 9 percent
before recovering to close at $54.93 3/4, down $2.93 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's, the second-largest home improvement retailer, was
impacted by underperforming stores and extra costs related to an
acquisition in the spring. Analysts said those factors should not
impact Home Depot's third-quarter earnings, which are expected to
be released today.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's posted a profit of $168.7 million, or 44 cents a share,
up from $121.9 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Lowe's
was expected to earn 42 cents in its fiscal third quarter,
according to a survey of analysts by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Results in the year-ago quarter were restated to include the
purchase of Eagle Hardware &AMP; Garden in April.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's said earnings would have been higher, but the company
incurred $8 million in costs to accelerate the integration of the
Eagle chain. That reduced earnings about a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 19 percent to $3.91 billion. Sales growth was hurt by
weather in the Southeast and sluggish Eagle stores in the West.
Lowe's noted that sales were helped by expanding installation
services and special orders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the stock tumbled because investors were
preoccupied with sales at stores open at least one year, which rose
6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street was expecting better `same-store' sales,'' said
analyst Dan Wewer of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. Investors are
closely watching the Eagle stores, which dragged down overall sales
growth, because Lowe's is using them to gain a foothold in the
western United States.
</P>
<P>
   New stores opened by Home Depot and HomeBase in the West are
taking market share from Eagle, analysts said. But Lowe's said in a
conference call Monday that it expects those stores to recoup sales
in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Lowe's continues to improve operations. Significant
gross-margin improvement compensated for the sales disappointment,
analysts noted. And expansion plans call for more stores in Home
Depot markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare Lowe's to Home Depot, typically Lowe's is not
as productive but they are getting better and better,'' Wewer said.
``Lowe's is getting as good as it can be at No. 2.''

PRAY FOR SUPREME COURT WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If students lead prayers over a loudspeaker to a
captive audience at a public high school football game, are they
exercising the First Amendment right of freedom of religion or are
they violating the constitutional barrier that separates church and
state?
</P>
<P>
   How could officials assure the prayers are non-sectarian and
avoid the imposition of religious conformity upon a secular event,
without unacceptable government intervention? Students are likely
to reflect their own specific church-going background, not some
vague notion of generic piety.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, of course, may be that student-led prayer is simply
a sneaky way around the high court's 1992 ban forbidding school
officials to deliver such messages themselves. Protecting the great
principles of the Constitution against selfish special interests
requires constant vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court had little practical choice but to agree to
hear the case at hand, which is an appeal from a lower court ruling
that the policy of the Santa Fe Independent School District in
Galveston, Texas, encouraging student-led group prayers at football
games was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   School prayer, in one form or other, has been a raging political
question since the high bench ruled in 1962 against permitting
organized prayer in public schools. The court declared that the
official teacher-led school prayers that used to be commonplace
were too intimidating and coercive, particularly for impressionable
young minds.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the courts have tried to differentiate between prayer
that is acceptable and prayer that is not, with only limited
success. The First Amendment protects the free exercise of
religion; what it does not allow is the ``establishment'' of one
religion. The freedom is for all religions, not just for one faith
that dominates another.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the religious right on conservative politics
has kept this argument high on the national agenda. On Nov. 7, the
House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on the Supreme
Court to approve voluntary prayer at high school sporting events, a
direct attempt to pressure the justices to overturn the lower court
decision in the Galveston case.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest political effort to make a religious
end-run around the court and the Constitution. Ronald Reagan
supported a constitutional amendment to return organized prayer to
the public schools, which is still alive in a congressional
committee somewhere. The House has been flirting with a
constitutional amendment to allow the posting of the Ten
Commandments in public classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court never acknowledges political influence upon
its deliberations, but it has clearly been affected by the
appointment of conservative justices the past 20 years who believe
organized religion can help to combat moral decline.
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to fine-tune this complicated constitutional
issue, the lower courts have made a muddle of it, ruling this way
and that way although generally limiting the role of religion in
public activities.
</P>
<P>
   Bibles have been banned from offices and schools, for instance,
but the teaching of creationism goes on.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the Supreme Court agreed only to review the
constitutionality of launching school football games with
ostentatious, inescapable prayer messages, leaving other issues
such as student prayer at graduation ceremonies for another day.
The court may find football games an easier place to draw the line
than formal, non-sporting ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The players are thinking about how to beat their opponents, and
so is the watching crowd. If God consistently plays favorites in
such moments, nobody has ever established it. The coach usually
gets the credit, or the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully the Supreme Court will reiterate its holding that
organized prayer does not belong in schools at all but in houses of
worship, in homes, in silent meditation, in solemn moments before
great occasions. A high school football stadium packed with people
of diverse backgrounds who came to watch athletes perform seems
more like an opportunity to proselytize an audience of trapped
folks than an occasion for meaningful prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision the high bench will
review declared that football is ``hardly the sober type of annual
event that can be appropriately solemnized with prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court decision will come down before the end of the
court term in mid-summer, meaning that it will be a hot topic at
both the Republican and Democratic conventions and during the 2000
presidential election. Republican candidates have tended generally
to support school prayer; Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican
presidential hopeful, joined in the Galveston appeal. Democratic
candidates, including Vice President Al Gore, have sided with the
constitutional tradition of separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is not endangered in this country; it is alive and
well. We are inundated with church symbols from every direction.
That's OK; we can ignore them if we wish. This is after all
supposed to be a very private matter.
</P>
<P>
   What we cannot tolerate in a democracy is organized religion
demanding that the rest of us take public part in a group
endorsement of views with which we might not agree. Can't we just
mind our own business and cheer on the home team?

   LIVINGSTON, La. _ Sprawling across snake-infested Louisiana
woodlands, a gigantic gravity wave detector that builders hope will
open a new window on the universe was inaugurated last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On hand for the ceremony were Dr. Rita R. Colwell, director of
the National Science Foundation, and many leading theorists in
astrophysics, relativity theory and related sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The L-shaped detector here and its recently completed twin in
Hanford, Wash., are called called LIGO (pronounced LIE-go), for
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Having cost
$296 million so far, it is the largest enterprise ever financed by
the National Science Foundation _ and one of the riskiest.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1970s, when it was first proposed, LIGO has met with
the skepticism of many astronomers and assaults from would-be
budget cutters in Congress and elsewhere. The signals of gravity
waves reaching Earth from the merger of black holes and other
cosmic catastrophes are expected to be so faint that LIGO may
detect nothing at all, at least in its first version.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of deciphering gravitational radiation as a
means of penetrating secrets of the birth of the universe and the
evolution of black holes, galaxies and other mysteries carried the
day, and LIGO was completed, with enough money to pay for its
operation through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kip S. Thorne of Caltech, the leading theorist on the LIGO
team, predicted that gravity waves, if and when they are detected,
would offer an entirely new way to study the 90 percent of the
universe that is hidden from observation with conventional
instruments that are sensitive to light waves, radio, X-rays or
gamma rays. He urged cooperation between gravity-wave specialists
and other astrophysicists in identifying the sources of gravity
waves, which still hold many mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   The two LIGO detectors, separated by about 2,000 miles, were
built by the California Institute of Technology and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Leading scientists from both
universities, including Dr. David Baltimore, president of Caltech,
were among the speakers at the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   LIGO thus became the first large detector in what scientists
hope will be an international network of similar instruments on the
ground and eventually in space. Within two years, the Virgo gravity
detector, about the same size as LIGO, will be completed by an
Italian-French collaboration near Pisa, and smaller detectors are
being built in Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   If both LIGO and Virgo work as hoped, they can operate in
concert, viewing the Northern Hemisphere sky from three separate
points. This would allow scientists to calculate the direction from
which a gravitational signal reached Earth, and to determine
whether the wave coincided with some other kind of signal _ a
gamma-ray pulse, a flash of light or some other kind of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   One such signal might come from a pulse of neutrinos coinciding
with a gravity wave, said Dr. John Bahcall, a leading
astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton,
N.J. In his talk, Bahcall described gravity waves, like neutrinos,
as ``new messengers for astronomy,'' capable of probing vast and
hitherto unfathomed parts of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   A far more ambitious project than LIGO, the space-based Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA, is planned by the European
Space Agency for launching a decade from now. NASA is considering
joining a partnership with the European agency to support the
project, which is expected to cost $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   LISA would consist of three satellites arrayed at the corners of
an equilateral triangle, each separated from the other two by 5
million kilometers (3.1 million miles). The entire assemblage would
be launched into an orbit around the Sun, trailing Earth by about
20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, scientists hope, gravity-wave ``telescopes'' will
detect the collisions of black holes and neutron stars, the
explosions of certain types of supernovas, the behavior of
supermassive black holes at the hearts of most (or perhaps all)
galaxies, and even the relic gravitational ripples left from the
Big Bang, the huge explosion theorized to have resulted in the
birth of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Turner, an astrophysicist from the University of
Chicago, described the search for gravity waves as vital to the
detection of ``cold dark matter,'' invisible matter believed to
make up most of the mass of the universe. Turner described this
search as ``the greatest challenge of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The quest for gravity waves goes back many years. The General
Theory of Relativity published by Albert Einstein in 1915 predicted
that disturbances in large gravitational fields should propagate at
the speed of light as ripples in spacetime. Theory predicted that a
gravity ripple passing through a detector should alternately
lengthen and shorten spacetime within the detector, and that
supposition was the basis of several experiments.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Dr. Joseph Weber of the University of
Maryland based one of the first detectors on a huge aluminum bar
that was supposed to ring like a bell when penetrated by a gravity
wave of the right frequency. Experimenters in Australia and
elsewhere still experiment with resonant bar gravity wave
detectors, but with no luck so far.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of gravity waves remained hypothetical until 1974,
when two Princeton University physicists, Dr. Joseph H. Taylor and
his student Dr. Russel A. Hulse detected them indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   Using the huge radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the two
scientists discovered two pulsating neutron stars in orbit around
one another. After making a series of precise measurements of radio
pulses from the two stars, the physicists found that their orbital
spin rate was speeding up, showing that they were losing orbital
energy. The rate of this loss turned out to be just what would be
expected of massive stars shedding orbital energy in the form of
gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   For their discovery, Taylor and Hulse were awarded the 1993
Nobel Prize in physics.

</P>
<P>
   Physicists expect to spend about two years fine-tuning LIGO
before the system will be ready to begin a formal search for
gravity waves, but there is always the chance that one may turn up
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a good chance that LIGO, at its present level of
technology, will discover nothing at all. Fearing that the initial
search for gravity waves will turn up nothing, project leaders are
already working on an upgrade of LIGO to incorporate future
technical improvements.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about the project, the National Science
Foundation acknowledged that ``LIGO aims to take risks,'' adding
that ``as science reaches the brink of what is considered nearly
impossible measurement, it requires technological innovations that
were barely conceived of even a few decades ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Colwell quoted the late Edwin Land, inventor of Polaroid film,
in describing the worthiness of such risky projects as LIGO. ``His
requirement,'' Colwell said, ``was for a venture to be manifestly
important and nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In principle, LIGO is quite simple, although the simplicity of
its gray arms, which extend from horizon to horizon through a
wilderness domain of alligators and deadly snakes, belies its
underlying complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Each detector consists of two steel pipes 4 feet in diameter and
2 and a half miles long, at right angles to each other. Inside each
pipe is a pair of mirrors, facing each other and suspended from
flexible wires. The apparatus also contains an infrared laser, beam
splitters, and many feedback control loops.
</P>
<P>
   By adjusting the positions of the mirrors and a beam-splitter
(which reflects half the light striking it and transmits the other
half), the lengths of the laser light paths in the two pipes are
adjusted to be precisely equal.
</P>
<P>
   Normally when a beam of laser light is split and then recombined
in the two arms of the L, the perfectly matched beams interfere
with each other, preventing any light from reaching a detector. But
when a gravity wave passes through the apparatus, physicists
expect, the spacetime in one arm will be stretched while the other
is squeezed, and the differing lengths will momentarily destroy the
lasers' interference pattern, allowing light to shine on the
detector.
</P>
<P>
   LIGO has been designed to detect a difference in the lengths of
the light paths in the two arms of as little as one-tenth the
diameter of a proton.
</P>
<P>
   But such high sensitivity is bound to produce many false alarms.
Dr. Barry C. Barish of Caltech, LIGO's director, expects lots of
terrestrial ``noise'' to impinge on both the Hanford and Livingston
sites, but if the same signal is simultaneously detected at both
places, it is less likely to be noise. Only signals that arrive
simultaneously at Hanford and Livingston will be considered as
gravity wave candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The principle behind LIGO is much the same as the one used by
two American scientists, Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley,
who in 1887 built a device based on their expectation that pairs of
light beams interfering with each other would reveal the passage of
Earth through a hypothetical ``ether''_ an all-pervasive substance
providing a medium for light waves to propagate. The experiment
failed to find evidence of ether (the absence of which was later
explained by relativity theory), but interferometry has found many
other scientific applications.
</P>
<P>
   Among the young scientists inspired by Weber's gravity wave
experiments was Thorne of Caltech, who played a major role in the
development of LIGO and is now one of its chief leaders. (Thorne
has also speculated on the possibility of time travel through
``worm holes'' connecting distant points in the universe, and is
the author of ``Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous
Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists who made major contributions to the gravity
wave quest were Dr. Rainer Weiss at MIT and Dr. Ron Drever of
Caltech. These and other LIGO scientists recently acknowledged that
they never expected that it would take so long to build a gravity
wave detector with a reasonable chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When financing of the LIGO project came before Congress in 1993,
it attracted the strong support of Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
among others, who helped to win it congressional support. But many
scientists opposed it on the grounds that the money could be better
spent on other things, particularly since LIGO's chances of finding
anything seemed so uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Dr. J. Anthony Tyson, an astrophysicist at Bell
Laboratories, polled 70 astronomers and astrophysicists and found
them overwhelmingly opposed to LIGO.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about the project today, Tyson replied: ``My
personal attitude as an experimental physicist is, look, the
money's been spent, right? Don't haggle over it, just go and give
it your best shot. Put the best equipment you can into it, the
cleanest laser, the cleanest mirrors, the best vacuum, and run for
a while and see if there's anything out there. I think that's
Barish's plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who proved the existence of gravity waves in 1974, hopes
for great discoveries from LIGO, but expects them to take years.
Asked in an interview whether he was confident of early success for
the costly project, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``No. I would say that in the first go, with the initial
detectors, nobody's very confident. If nature is really kind to us,
LIGO might see something in the near future, but I think it's
unlikely. But I'm optimistic that with the next generation of
interferometers installed in LIGO, maybe five years down the road,
we'll see something.''
</P>
<P>
   The event most likely to be detected in the next five years,
Taylor said, is the collision of two black holes. More subtle
effects might be detected from the violent, asymmetric collapse of
a Type II supernova up to 50 million light-years away, a spinning
neutron star that wobbles, or perhaps a very faint gravitational
echo of the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary stakes are high in the hunt for gravity waves, but
``for all of us, the completion of LIGO is the realization of a
dream,'' Barish said. ``We're not at the end yet, but the odds look
better than ever of opening a new window on the universe.''

FALLING CURRENCY, BANKING CRISIS HAVE ECUADOREANS TOTING BAGS OF

   QUITO, Ecuador _ In Ecuador, it requires just $60 to become a
millionaire. That amount buys an inch-thick wad of bills totalling
1 million sucres.
</P>
<P>
   The country's currency, the sucre, has plummeted in the past
year from 6,400 to the U.S. dollar to nearly 17,000 per dollar,
because of a banking crisis and the worst recession since the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The largest denomination bill is the 50,000 sucre note, which is
worth less than $4.
</P>
<P>
   To cut deals, business people tote around briefcases or garbage
bags stuffed with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look like you have a lot of money, but it now costs 5
million sucres for a refrigerator,'' said Marcelo Almeida, manager
of Credicentro appliance store in Quito.
</P>
<P>
   Lida Quiroz, a money-changer in Quito, recalled that after a
recent day of trading, her pile of sucres was so heavy that she
enlisted her sister to help haul away the money in a duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the inconvenience, cash remains the most popular form of
payment because of a deep distrust in banks.
</P>
<P>
   But to prevent a run on deposits, the government temporarily
froze all accounts in March and imposed a 1 percent tax on bank
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Many Ecuadoreans stopped writing checks, closed their accounts
and hid their money at home, a practice nicknamed ``the mattress
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional financial institutions ``no longer have any
prestige,'' said Marco Bedoya, who runs the Tienda Latino Americana
souvenir store in Quito.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, Ecuador has avoided a return to the
out-of-control hyperinflation that bedeviled much of Latin America
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   During the waning years of the Sandinista revolution in
Nicaragua, for example, $1 bought 6 million Nicaraguan cordobas.
Lacking the paper to print new bills to keep up with the
devaluations, the Sandinistas simply stamped extra zeros in black
ink on old bills.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadoreans suggest that doing business would be easier with a
higher denomination sucre note, but a Central Bank spokesman said
there are no immediate plans to print new bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should make a 1 million sucre bill,'' said Quiroz, the
money changer. ``That would be excellent.''

   AMMAN, Jordan _ Khalil Attieh is a member of Jordan's
Parliament, an accomplished civil engineer and one of Amman's
wealthiest construction contractors. He builds bridges, drives a
sleek beige Mercedes-Benz and lives in a three-story mansion.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a Palestinian refugee.
</P>
<P>
   When Israelis and Palestinians began to discuss the fate of
refugees last week in negotiations aimed at reaching a final peace
treaty, they were not talking just about people in impoverished
camps.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Jordan's 4 million citizens are of Palestinian
origin.
</P>
<P>
   They are the engine of Jordan's thriving merchant class. With
money made from businesses here or brought with them from the Arab
Gulf, they built some of Amman's swankiest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean they plan to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be a Palestinian success story, but I cannot forget my
Palestinian roots,'' said Attieh, a stocky, rotund man who grew up
in the Hussein refugee camp, a few miles away from his mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing would prevent me from having two houses, one here and
one in Palestine,'' Attieh said.
</P>
<P>
   Except maybe the Israelis. They want to limit the number of
refugees allowed to return to the country of 5.6 million. Bringing
back hundreds of thousands of refugees to Israel, they argue, would
threaten its Jewish identity. Letting them move to the West Bank
and Gaza would be too big a burden on the Palestinian
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the possibility for half a million (refugees) to
show up on the doorstep of the Palestinian Authority,'' said Reuven
Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, however, want nothing short of the right to decide
for themselves whether to return or remain in their host countries,
even if most of them never make the move to the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force a solution,'' said Sari Nasir, a Palestinian
sociologist at the University of Jordan. ``It has to come
naturally. To stay here or settle somewhere else has to be their
decision, individually.''
</P>
<P>
   Many may decide to stay put. A few miles away from Attieh's
villa, Yousef Awwad, who used to live in the Wahdat refugee camp,
has moved in to a government-subsidized home in a working-class
development neighborhood called Manara.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with 3,500 single-family homes built along spacious
streets, Manara stands in stark contrast to the miserable
conditions in Awwad's camp. A house with a mortgage has given him a
sense of permanence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my final destination,'' Awwad said. A photograph from
his younger days showed him dressed in a Palestine Liberation Army
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Funded in part by the Jordanian government and the United States
Agency for International Development and aimed at low-income
Jordanians, developments like Manara have quietly helped to house
thousands of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of settling refugees here, however, remains a very
sensitive topic. Last month, Jordan's energetic young king,
Abdullah II, visited Baqa'a, the country's largest camp, and told a
cheering crowd of refugees that they were an ``integral part'' of
Jordanian society.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, a government official emphasized that the
king's words were not meant to undermine the refugees' demands to
return to Palestine or to receive financial compensation for
property lost there.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the king may have been responding to the
hard truth that most refugees are not likely to go back to the
farms and orchards they left in what is now Israel. And while they
are living in Jordan, they have a very real need to have the same
rights as any other citizen for as long as they remain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Jordan granted citizenship to Palestinians living here.
They can vote, run for Parliament and hold top government
positions. In 1991, Taher al-Masri, Jordan's 77th prime minister,
was a Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians also complain of being excluded from the
country's traditional bases of power. They are discouraged from
joining the army and the police. They are under-represented in
government ministries. And when it comes to getting into state-run
universities, Jordanian applicants have a better chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the law, I am Jordanian,'' said Palestinian
Hamadeh Farouneh, considered by some a firebrand in Jordan's
Parliament and who has called for assimilation of refugees into
Jordanian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here there are discriminatory practices and tribal values
which prevent Jordanians with Palestinian roots from occupying
leadership positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, King Abdullah has taken pains to make
Palestinians feel at home. He earmarked $140,000 to build sports
clubs in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   He allotted $50 million to pave roads and lay sewer pipes there.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the king reserved 100 places at the country's
state universities for the sons and daughters of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But these moves have left some Jordanians with a sense of
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settling Palestinians in Jordan was a mistake from the very
beginning,'' said Ahmad Abbady, a Jordanian member of Parliament
who believes Palestinians should not hold Jordanian citizenship or
be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a country of very limited resources,'' he said.
``Sharing everything _ every piece of bread, every tank of water _
it means we (Jordanians) will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians insist that efforts to turn them into
Jordanians will not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts in the past to erase their identity and make them
into something else have failed,'' said Nasir, the Palestinian
sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `I'll give you money, you sit here and become
Jordanian, forget Palestine.' This will never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In Awwad's living room an embroidered Palestinian flag hangs on
the wall. He can recount stories that his father used to tell about
his family's life in Kufr Anna, their village near Tel Aviv. But he
doesn't think he'll ever return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more Jordanian than Palestinian,'' he said, slowly
choosing his words. ``Since I enjoy all the benefits of a Jordanian
_ a passport, a right to speak _ yes, I am a Jordanian. I was
forced to make this choice.''

CLINTON GENTLY CHIDES TURKEY ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ President Clinton praised Turkey's democratic
progress in a speech to its Grand National Assembly on Monday even
as he gently nudged the country to strengthen its adherence to
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day of a state visit here, Clinton was clearly
trying not to offend his hosts. Even as he raised the delicate
issue of human rights violations, Clinton reassured Turkish
lawmakers that he was doing so as a friend and that the United
States has grappled with such problems itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind, I come from a nation that was founded on the
creed that all are created equal,'' Clinton said. ``And yet when we
were founded, we had slavery, women could not vote, even men could
not vote unless they owned property.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I know something about the imperfect realization
of a country's ideas. We have had a long journey in America, from
our founding to where we are. But the journey has been worth
making.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke about the need for greater tolerance of free
expression, police were arresting scores of people staging an
unapproved protest of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who won applause for his restrained remarks, made no
mention of a State Department report released this year that
complains of ``serious human rights abuses'' in Turkey, including
killings and torture by Turkish police and security officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel said Monday, speaking to reporters:
``It is impossible to say that there is no torture in Turkey. There
is torture. But torture is not state policy. Torture is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with the country's leaders, Clinton highlighted
Turkey's strategic importance because it straddles both Europe and
Asia. Turkey is ringed, he noted, by neighbors such as Iran, Saddam
Hussein's Iraq and Yugoslavia _ countries that are ``either
actively hostile to democracy and peace, or struggling against
great obstacles to embrace democracy and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Turkey's role in ensuring regional peace all the more
important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pessimist might foresee a dark future,'' Clinton said. ``A
Middle East with the peace process shattered. Saddam's aggression
unchecked. Democracy collapsed in the Caucasus in Central Asia.
Extremism and terror spreading across the region. More violence in
the Balkans. Military coups. Unstoppable nuclear tensions in
Pakistan and India.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said there is another more optimistic vision _ ``one
that requires a strong Turkey playing its rightful role at the
crossroads of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also strongly backed Turkey's effort to join the
European Union, and commiserated with Turks about the deadly
earthquakes that have struck the country in recent months.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Cold War ended, we have learned something quite
wonderful,'' Clinton said, speaking of the American ties with
Turkey. ``We have learned that our friendship does not depend upon
a common concern with the Soviet Union, and that in fact, in the
post-Cold War era, our partnership has become even more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   With a light rain falling, Clinton led a wreath-laying ceremony
Monday morning at the mausoleum for Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the
revered founder of the modern Turkish state. And Clinton was
honored at a state dinner at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear friend, President Clinton, I see you as someone who
has contributed greatly to world peace,'' Demirel said in
presenting a state award to the American president. ``You have also
contributed to ensuring closer ties between Turkish and American
peoples.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Relieving long-standing tensions between Turkey and Greece is
one of the prime goals of Clinton's trip. After attending a
security conference in Istanbul on Wednesday and Thursday, Clinton
will visit Athens to urge the Greeks to set age-old animosities
aside.

<P>

   Clinton hailed plans by the two factions in Cyprus to begin
talks in New York next month. ``I believe a negotiated settlement
is the best way to meet the fundamental interests of all the
parties, including real security for all Cypriots and an end to the
island's division,'' he said.

<P>
   With historical artifacts all around him in this ancient land,
Clinton urged Turks to continue their struggle for reform or risk
following the fate of failed civilizations past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must never forget that Turkey is built on the ruins of many
ancient civilizations that once were every bit as optimistic as we
are today,'' Clinton said. ``To avoid their fate, we must back up
our words and our hopes with deeds.''

PUERTO RICAN OFFICIAL SAYS CLINTON OKS VOTE ON VIEQUES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Puerto Rican official said Monday that President
Clinton has agreed to submit to the voters of Vieques a proposed
compromise designed to end a seven-month standoff between the Navy
and Puerto Rico over future bombing on the island's target range.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Aguilar, press secretary for Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro
Rossello, said the governor and the president agreed during weekend
telephone negotiations to put the issue to a vote by the 9,300
residents of Vieques, probably in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the voters on Vieques approved a resumption of target
practice on the firing range, the Navy would be able to keep its
timetable of using Vieques in early December for final combat
training by a Navy-Marine battle group led by the aircraft carrier
USS Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   The battle group is scheduled to sail for the Persian Gulf on
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar, speaking in a telephone interview from San Juan, said
the referendum will probably be conducted on the island of Vieques
after Thanksgiving and within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be asked to endorse one of at least two proposals.
None of the ballot propositions has been drafted yet.
</P>
<P>
   But Aguilar said the options would include proposed resumption
of routine Navy bombardment on the 899-acre live fire target range
that has been used to train Atlantic-based forces since 1941 and a
yet-to-be drafted White House proposal to reduce live fire
training, provide multimillion dollar economic assistance and have
the Navy withdraw within three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in discussions with the president to determine
what alternative will be presented to the people of Vieques,''
Aguilar said. ``We are in the process of dialogue _ not of
negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   James Fallin, spokesman for the White House's National Security,
declined immediate comment on Aguilar's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dialogue continues,'' Fallin said.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Pentagon official said the Clinton administration,
with the support of the Navy, has been weighing a proposal to
submit a proposed compromise to the voters of Vieques for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Clinton
administration officials are hopeful that substantial economic
development assistance, land turnovers, phased Navy withdrawal and
promised clean up of hazardous sites would be enough to rally ``a
silent majority'' of residents of Vieques to support limited
resumption of training by Navy-Marine Corps battle groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been giving thought for some time to the idea that
residents of Vieques should be given a voice in their future,'' the
official said, adding: ``We believe there is a good deal of wisdom
in that approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that Clinton administration officials believe
that ordinary residents of Vieques would support a proposal for
continued Navy operations that included such incentives.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy proposal floated on Capitol Hill in October called for
$55 million in economic assistance over three years, a sum that
would work out to almost $6,000 in assistance for every man, woman
and child living on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello and other Puerto Rican political leaders have opposed
any resumption of Navy and Marine Corps bombing on Vieques in the
aftermath of an April 19 mishap. A Marine pilot mistakenly targeted
a range observation post with two 500 pound bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The accident killed Navy contract security guard David Sanes
Rodriguez, 35, and injured four other civilian employees on the
range.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the range has been closed. Dozens of protesters have
camped on the site to prevent any resumption of target practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes we have reached a critical point where
we should have civic consultation with the U.S. citizens on Vieques
who will be affected by any decision,'' Aguilar said. ``The
president agreed with this approach completely; he also believes it
is an important step in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar said that the governor came away from two lengthy
weekend telephone calls with the president convinced that Clinton
will not order resumption of live fire training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello has threatened to seek a federal court injunction if
the White House orders _ or the Navy resumes _ live fire training
on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also declined to discuss published reports
that Clinton would propose substituting inert bombs and shells for
the explosive ordnance that has alarmed local residents because of
the noise and fears that the chemicals in the high explosives may
be contributing to a higher rate of cancer on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials, led by Defense Secretary William
Cohen, urged Clinton at a White House meeting last Thursday to
immediately reopen the target range on Vieques to enable final
combat training by the Eisenhower battle group. Clinton, who left
Sunday for a 10-day trip to Turkey, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Italy and
Greece, returns to the nation's capital on Nov. 24 just in time for
the Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is scheduled to return from a trip to South America on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns 22,000 acres of the 33,000 acres on the
picturesque Caribbean island located eight miles east of the main
island of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,300 civilian residents live on a swathe of land
located about 10 miles from the beach-front target range where Navy
and Marine aviators based aboard aircraft carriers rehearse bombing
operations before deployment overseas

   CLINTON-WTO _ ANKARA, Turkey _ The United States and China
struck a landmark trade agreement Monday, opening the way for
Chinese membership in the World Trade Organization, which oversees
the rules of the road in the global marketplace. President Clinton,
here on a state visit, said the accord, which caps 13 years of
U.S.-China negotiations, would lead to economic growth and new jobs
for American farmers, computer makers and providers of a wide range
of services from telecommunications and entertainment to banking.
It has also gone a long way toward righting badly strained
relations between the United States and the world's most populous
country, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. (Deans, Cox

   CLINTON-TURKEY _ ANKARA, Turkey _ President Clinton paid tribute
Monday to Turkey's growing strategic value at the crossroads
between Europe and Central Asia. He took aim, however, at Turkey's
poor human rights record, saying ``sovereignty should not be built
on fear,'' in the first speech ever given by a U.S. president to
Turkey's elected Parliament. (Deans, Cox News Service)

   CLINTON-CYPRUS _ ANKARA, Turkey _ It was ``ping-pong'' diplomacy
that brought the United States and China together three decades
ago. The quest for Mideast peace gave rise to ``shuttle
diplomacy.'' And ``baseball diplomacy'' has provided a tenuous link
between the United States and Cuba. Now, said President Clinton,
``earthquake diplomacy'' has opened a window for Greece and Turkey
to settle longstanding disputes that have been a thorn in the side
of NATO for decades. (Deans, Cox News Service)

of northeast Georgia. Two crews were enroute from Puerto Rico, and
the rest would come from ``wherever they can be found,'' an

tough year, defending against charges of sexual harassment in the
workplace. Last week, the Republican Party in his Southeast Texas
district, which has been sending him to Austin since 1981, turned
against him. The Lake Jackson Republican Party said he should
resign because his sexual escapades make the party look bad.

   FLA-SPACE _ MELBOURNE, Fla. _ Within a decade, rockets might use
a spaceport the way an airplane uses Hartsfield. ``We could be
competing with any number of states. It could launch and land in
Texas or anywhere in the U.S. . . . This is a major, major issue
for the state,'' said Catherine Deans, spokeswoman for Enterprise
Florida, a group formed to keep business coming to the Sunshine
State. During the heady days of Apollo, Cape Canaveral was the
undisputed launch capital of the world. Not so today. With wireless
communication demanding more satellite launches every day,

AN AMERICAN DARES TO FILM ISLAM'S STORY IN IRAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAFGH, Iran _ As an Emmy-winning documentary film director, Rob
Gardner has called ``Cut!'' in many far-flung locations, from Egypt
to Antarctica. But none of his previous ventures have called for
quite the tact and daring required for his current project, as the
first American filmmaker to be allowed to work in Iran since the
Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where Islamic hard-liners still gather to shout
``Death to America!'' on major anniversaries of the revolution,
Gardner has chosen the one topic that oddsmakers in Iran and
elsewhere might think most likely to detonate in an American
filmmaker's hands: the history of Islam as a faith, a culture and a
civilization, with pivotal sequences in the story re-enacted by a
cast of 150 Iranian actors and extras.
</P>
<P>
   In this desert town 350 miles southeast of Tehran, Gardner, 53,
has gone a step farther. For a three-part series titled ``Islam:
Empire of Faith'' that is on the PBS schedule for next fall, he has
been filming sequences that involve the life and death of Muhammad,
the Muslim prophet, a subject so sensitive that the merest hint of
a slight, however unintentional, could sink the project in a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In Bafgh, as in five other Iranian towns where Gardner has
filmed, power still resides with the mullahs, or Muslim clerics,
men with a network of eyes and ears to scan for any hint of
apostasy. Although much in Iran is changing under a reform movement
headed by Muhummad Khatami, a Muslim cleric who was elected
president in 1997 on a pledge to curb the clergy's powers, almost
every day brings word of some new miscreant's arrest on allegations
of ``insulting Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   If this suggests that Gardner and his American crew have to
operate in a climate of rigid conformity, the reality is otherwise.
About the only stifling thing on the set in Bafgh has been the
heat, which was pushing toward 100 degrees on a recent morning as
the Iranian cast recreated the scenes in AD 632, when word of the
prophet's death in Mecca reached his distraught followers in
Medina, a Muslim holy city in what is now Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In Medina, Muhammad raised the army that conquered Mecca,
setting the stage for the rapid sweep by Arab armies that
eventually carried Islam across Arabia, westward through North
Africa, Sicily and Spain, and north and east as far as modern
Turkey, Iran and Central Asia. The PBS series will begin with the
life of Muhammad and end with the reign of Suleiman the
Magnificent, the 16th-century Ottoman emperor whose era many
historians regard as one of the most glorious in the Islamic story.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, Gardner, shielded from heat and dust by a flowing
turban, shot and reshot the mourning scenes in an old caravanserai,
a mud-walled structure once used as a staging post by camel trains
crossing the desert. With women in flowing robes and face masks
wailing in a recess, a small army of ferocious-looking men, in
white robes and turbans, each with a luxuriant beard and mustache,
waved curved swords in the air in a trance-like dance of grief.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks, Americans and Iranians alike relaxed and chatted
over glasses of sugary tea and Coca-Cola, still available here
after 20 years of American economic boycotts. With the atmosphere
more like that of a party than a film set, Gardner chuckled at a
visitor's suggestion that the project, involving more than 40 days
of filming in Iran, was the filmmaker's equivalent of a high-wire
act _ exhilarating, but poised at the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 30 years of filming, I've never experienced the same degree
of simpatico,'' said Gardner, who is based in Baltimore. ``The more
connected we've become with the people here, the higher the comfort
level has become. We haven't had a single problem with the mullahs;
in fact, they've leant over backward to help us out. I think
they've concluded that we can help carry the message of Islam to
the world, and as long as we are doing it in a way that's sensitive
to their beliefs, they're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If that seems strange to Americans, I guess it's
because, psychologically, we are forever referencing the hostage
crisis of 1979,'' the seizure of the United States Embassy in
Tehran in the early months of the revolution, and the 444 days of
captivity for American diplomats that ensued. ``In the American
consciousness, it was the worst thing the Iranians could have done.
But to make this project work, all of us on this project have had
to get past it, and we have.''
</P>
<P>
   When they came to Iran last fall to scout locations, Gardner and
his wife, Char, 53, an assistant producer on the $1.5 million
project, were struck by the fact that filming costs in Iran,
lowered by the Iranian rial's steep devaluation against the dollar
since 1979, were lower than in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel and
Turkey, other countries they considered. The abundance of
eye-catching Iranian locations _ desert sand dunes blue-tiled
mosques _ was another attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple were also impressed by the talent in the Iranian
film industry, which, like other creative endeavors, has had
greater latitude _ not yet free of Islamic strictures, but far more
so than before _ since President Khatami's election. American
moviegoers have had a taste of the new Iranian cinema from feature
films like ``The Children of Heaven,'' Majid Majidi's story of a
brother and a sister struggling to survive poverty, which was among
the nominees for best foreign film at this year's Oscar
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Getting approval to film from the Ministry of Islamic Guidance
and Culture _ despite its forbidding name, a stronghold of
Khatami's reformers _ was simple. Morteza Shayesteh, the project's
Iranian co-producer, said officials had issued a permit without
seeing a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked my opinion, I told them it would offer a positive
view of Islam, and they took my word,'' he said. ``These days,
there aren't official prescriptions for filmmakers anymore. It's up
to us _ we have to decide what we can do, and also what we can't
do.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the Gardners faced more serious obstacles in Washington.
Under American sanctions, imposed at the time of the embassy
seizure and reinforced later to punish Iran for its alleged support
of international terrorism, the filmmakers needed a Treasury
Department exemption to bring computerized American filmmaking
equipment to Iran and to pay Iranian costs. The exemption was
granted only after after Gardner enlisted the support of Sen.
Barbara A. Mikulski, the Maryland Democrat. ``The initial reaction
was, `Hey, Iran's a terrorist state, you can't film there,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Iranians working with the Americans, there is delight at
what they see as a major breach in what Khatami has called ``the
wall of mistrust'' between the two countries. Majid Mir-Fakhraei,
48, the art director, has been crucial to the project's success,
finding remote locations, designing a credible seventh-century
wardrobe for the actors, recruiting stuntmen to ride horses and
camels in battle scenes and hiring 40 Bedouin men and women from
Iran's only Arab-majority province, Khuzhestan.
</P>
<P>
   But Mir-Fakhraei said Iran was the real winner. ``We have been
waiting a very long time for this,'' he said, looking like an
American filmmaker in jeans, sleeveless jerkin and baseball cap.
``It's very important for us to work with Americans, because in my
thinking the cinema belongs to them. We are learning so much _
about their new camera systems, their techniques, their working
attitudes _ that will make our cinema so much stronger in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most joyous endorsements came from extras and stuntmen
who enveloped a visitor during a filming break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very good, very good,'' a beaming Zabihpour Zabiholam, who
specializes in camel riding, said in English. Switching to Persian,
he said that Iranians longed for what Khatami calls ``a dialogue''
with America. ``A dialogue is what we want,'' Zabiholam said, ``and
inshallah'' _ an Arabic word meaning ``with God's grace'' _ ``we
will have it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Raw optimism is a trait not usually associated with longtime
makers of atom bombs, advisers of presidents and heralds of doom.
</P>
<P>
   But something like that emanated recently from Dr. Richard L.
Garwin, one of the federal government's most widely respected
science advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In his office at the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan,
his shirt pocket bulging with pens and papers, Garwin gave no hint
that he had just suffered one of the worst defeats of his career
and was deep into mounting a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, sipping coffee at a table strewn with papers and file
folders, often smiling and seemingly relaxed, he radiated a kind of
easy confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do these things,'' he said with a shrug. ``And if you keep
at it for a long time, sometimes you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Garwin, 71, has been at such things for a long time indeed,
nearly a half century. The onetime boy wonder and now celebrated
physicist has acquired an astonishing number of victories, awards,
patents, discoveries, plaudits and honorary degrees, not to mention
a few painful bruises.
</P>
<P>
   His current battle centers on the nuclear test ban treaty, which
President Clinton signed three years ago and the Senate rejected
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Garwin, a test ban advocate, takes it personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' he said of the rebuff.
</P>
<P>
   He rued what he considered a lost opportunity to bind other
states into forgoing nuclear blasts, as Washington is doing
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can get in restraining other people is gravy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Backers see the ban blocking new nuclear states and arms races.
Critics see it as a dangerous mirage, undermining the reliability
of old arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Garwin, chairman of the State Department's advisory board on
arms control for more than six years, has worked quietly but hard
on the treaty's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no need for new types of nuclear weapons,'' Garwin
said. ``So to keep every other country and its brother from having
nuclear weapons is a good deal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Garwin's detractors, while praising his scientific skills as
exceptional, say he can be narrow and bullheaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a very flexible thinker,'' said Dr. John M. Deutch, a
test-ban opponent and former director of central intelligence, now
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``He arrives at his
judgment and sticks to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Deutch added, Garwin is an exemplar of what a
public-spirited scientist should be. ``He's informed and presents
his views forcefully. We need more people like Dick Garwin, not
fewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Garwin's famously sharp tongue is often bemoaned by the
assailed, and in the case of the test ban's defeat he is quick to
lay much blame on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has a lot of people who are not very
knowledgeable about such things,'' said the adviser to six
presidents, including Clinton. ``Administrations have increasingly
focused on politics and public relations rather than on reality,
and that's true whether it's national security or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvanized by the Senate's action, Garwin is taking on the
treaty's most vociferous public foes one by one, writing letters,
challenging their claims, suggesting that they debate him publicly
and generally trying to undo what he regards as the distortion of
the factual record. His dream is that the treaty will emerge again
in the Senate, and this time get a fair hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there's a relatively small chance of success,'' Garwin
said. ``I don't have anything more important to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The holder of 43 patents and a rebel physicist long proclaimed a
genius, Garwin is doing everything he can to promote the end of
nuclear bomb innovation, hoping to lower the odds of fiery
destruction. It is a calculus he has pursued all his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lawrence Garwin was born in Cleveland on April 19, 1928.
His father was a high school teacher during the day and a
projectionist in a movie theater at night. The boy, a tinkerer,
helped his dad repair projectors and build audio amplifiers for the
movies, newly with sound. In college, he worked nights as a
projectionist himself.
</P>
<P>
   By 1949, Garwin had acquired a PhD in physics from the
University of Chicago, a mecca for such pursuits. He was 21. His
mentor was the great physicist Enrico Fermi, who had fled from
Italy after wining the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938 and had then
worked in New Mexico, helping to build the world's first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fermi said Garwin was the only true genius he had ever met,''
recalled Dr. Marvin L. Goldberger, one of Fermi's students, who
went on to head the California Institute of Technology and, in
Princeton, the Institute for Advanced Study.
</P>
<P>
   For the summer of 1950, Garwin was invited by Fermi to Los
Alamos in New Mexico to ponder nuclear arms design. Garwin, a
faculty member at Chicago, quickly proved himself. In 1951 and
1952, he helped give birth to the world's first hydrogen bomb, a
weapon roughly a thousand times more powerful than its atomic
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shot was fired almost precisely according to Garwin's
design,'' Dr. Edward Teller, a widely acknowledged hydrogen bomb
pioneer, later said.
</P>
<P>
   Garwin was hooked on the atom. The bond was loose, however, as
befitted his increasingly nomadic style. To some extent, he gave up
a promising career at the frontiers of physics for wider pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he joined the research side of the International
Business Machines Corp. but made a deal by which he could also
consult for Los Alamos and Washington and hold a physics
appointment at Columbia University. The IBM arrangement lasted for
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower, waging a tense arms race with
the Soviet Union, in 1958 proposed a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
as a way to tame the world's nuclear fires. Just as new jets cannot
be made without test flights, new kinds of nuclear arms usually
must be detonated repeatedly in fiery blasts to spot flaws and
ensure potency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Garwin was in Geneva for the government in 1958 as experts
debated the ban's merits. Ever a number cruncher, he made detailed
calculations of how well sensors in deep rocks might detect faint
rumbles from distant nuclear blasts hidden beneath the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't able to obtain it,'' Garwin said of the treaty,
adding that the big hurdles turned out to be more political than
technical. Critics had fanned apprehensions by saying the ban
threatened to favor the Soviets if they cheated and pulled ahead
surreptitiously.
</P>
<P>
   A partial ban in 1963 did limit blasts, ending those in space,
the seas and the atmosphere, and restricting the rest to areas
beneath the earth's surface. In the Nevada desert, the ground shook
repeatedly and the United States soon amassed 32,000 weapons in
dozens of varieties.
</P>
<P>
   By 1978, Garwin, largely unknown to the public, his advisory
work usually cloaked in military secrecy, began to lobby for a
complete ban. That August, he wrote to President Jimmy Carter to
address a new fear: that a ban would hurt arsenal reliability,
saying careful inspections and repairs would ``provide continuing
assurance for as long as may be desired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 ended all treaty talk
in the Carter administration, and the test ban issue lay dormant
until after the Cold War. In 1993, Clinton resurrected the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Garwin was appointed to top panels. And as a longtime federal
adviser, he helped critique a $4 billion-a-year plan in which
computer simulations and other advanced methods were to ensure the
potency of nuclear arms in lieu of explosive blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatic to a fault, Garwin praised the big programs but said
the government also needed to focus on simple things like being
able to easily remanufacture bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, as Senate Republicans prepared to reject the treaty,
having balked at holding hearings for more than two years, they
called in Garwin to testify. He was one of the only scientific
backers of the ban in a sea of hostile witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying late in the day on Oct. 7, after many senators had
left the Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Garwin called for a
``balanced assessment'' and zeroed in on one point. No cheater, he
said, could ever get away with secretly testing a hydrogen bomb,
and he stressed that such explosions were the main things that
counted in war.
</P>
<P>
   A successful ban, he said, ``limits greatly the destructive
power that can be wielded by newly nuclear states.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Garwin added pointedly, ``would make a big difference
in the threat that could face the United States or our allies, even
if nations overtly or clandestinely pursue nuclear weaponry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rejected the treaty on Oct. 13, and almost
immediately Garwin begin to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, his desk at the Council on Foreign Relations
was littered with papers from the Senate battle. Garwin, a senior
fellow at the council, often seemed perplexed ashe discussed
treaty opponents, shaking his head like a teacher not quiet sure
what to do with backward students.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are politically against the treaty,'' he said,
and are eager to build up American arms and strength by detonating
nuclear blasts. He added that the opponents, by accident or design,
tended to be highly selective in their facts.
</P>
<P>
   He especially faulted the testimony of Dr. James R. Schlesinger,
a former secretary of defense and energy and director of central
intelligence, whose views against the treaty were given great
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger told the Senate that in the absence of testing,
``confidence in the reliability of the stockpile will inevitably,
ineluctably, decline'' and ``is declining today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, Garwin said, visibly upset. Weapons are being
inspected more frequently, and longevity estimates are actually
rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to the nuclear weapons people at the laboratories,
they have as much confidence in the stockpile as they ever did,''
he snapped, ``and probably more.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to comity, he agreed with Schlesinger on a need for
plants to rebuild old bombs. Such plants, Garwin said, had been
neglected in the rush to develop flashy gadgetry and fast
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Schlesinger called Garwin ``a good fellow and a
useful citizen, even though I don't always agree with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Much of what he's said over the years is
interesting, some is persuasive, and some is overly enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Senate defeat, Garwin says he remains hopeful for
the test ban. He pointed to a number of military, technical and
political long shots he had helped turn into successes over the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astoundingly influential'' is how Lew Allen Jr., a former
National Security Agency director, characterized him in 1996 when
Garwin received a top Central Intelligence Agency award for helping
pioneer the nation's fleet of spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   His goal now, Garwin said, if not to alter the political views
of treaty opponents, is at least to get them to stick to the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyhow,'' he said, smiling again, ``I'll change how they
testify.''

`KING ARTHUR' AND `LE BOURGEOIS GENTILHOMME': SEMISTAGED, FULLY
REALIZED

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How many semistaged performances of semi-operas does
it take to add up to a satisfying whole? In the case of the
presentation of Purcell's ``King Arthur'' by William Christie and
Les Arts Florissants on Friday evening at Alice Tully Hall, one was
sufficient. And although the same cannot be said of Lully's
``Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' which was added on Saturday evening,
that production made for a pleasant bonus.
</P>
<P>
   To identify these works simply by composers distorts their
nature if not the musically oriented productions here. For these
are rich, barely classifiable mixtures of ``straight'' theater,
dance and song. Each boasts a dramatic text by an illustrious
author: Dryden in ``King Arthur,'' Moliere in ``Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result they are difficult and expensive to produce, and
although Christie has staged ``King Arthur'' complete in London and
Paris, here, as in 1995 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he
offered a spare but elegant semistaging. In an informative
preconcert lecture on Friday he called these productions buskers'
versions. ``They're done on a shoestring,'' he said, ``and I'm
unabashed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As well he might be. In ``King Arthur,'' in particular, with
direction and choreography by Ana Yepes and a condensation of the
text by Jeremy Sams, this semistaging in civilian dress held the
eye better and conveyed the spirit of the work more than many an
overblown production at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Christie led a band of 16 from the harpsichord. Nine singers
took the solo parts and made up the chorus, and two actors, Satara
Lester and Patrick Cremin, metamorphosed into a variety of
characters. It all worked well here, since Dryden's players are
relatively few, and the text and music unfold in a steady balance,
so that compressing the text leaves a more or less continuous flow
of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme'' was a different story, since
Moliere spins out a variety of characters, central and peripheral,
in this comedie-ballet, and the music is concentrated in the dance
finale, the ``Ballet des Nations.'' With few tunes in the first act
(actually, the first three acts, quickly skimmed here before
intermission), Sams' text resorts to joking about the lack of
music, promising more later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lester and Cremin were valiant in trying to convey all the
characters, often in quicksilver succession, and Cremin was
delightfully obtuse as the doltish title figure. But the attempt to
mark characters by sharp accents rendered much of the text
incomprehensible, and to any music lover who knew the qualities of
the musicians onstage, all this compromised theatricality could
only prove frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   The music making was everywhere superb, as is to be expected
from Christie and his French forces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although ``King Arthur'' can be heard in all its glory in an
Erato recording by Les Arts Florissants, the smaller-scale
performance here in no way disappointed. (And to have repeated the
stagy touches of the sneezes and the wind machine in the Chorus of
the Cold People might have been too predictable, in itself enough
to steer Christie away.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the singers, who, shamefully, were not individually
identified in the program, Gaelle Mechaly stood out charmingly in
several roles in ``King Arthur,'' including an irresistible
Philidel and Cupid. Francois Fauche (not even mentioned in the
programs) was as moving as the Cold Genius in ``King Arthur'' as he
was entertaining as the Mufti in ``Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,''
ultimately losing control of a recalcitrant fake mustache.
</P>
<P>
   And Iain Paton, with his pliant tenor voice, sang lovely solos
by Lully and anchored the chorus on both nights.
</P>
<P>
   The little dance troupe _ with Ms. Yepes joined by Georges
Keraghel and, in ``Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,'' Nick Nguyen _
overachieved, and the actions of the physically deft and game
singers fed nicely into a persuasive whole.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday especially, a viewer was left wondering what could be
better than a Christie semistaging. Only one thing sure: a Christie
staging.

JUDGE KAYE SAYS HIGH COURT HOLDS NO APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Judge Judith Kaye of the New York Court of
Appeals said on Monday that even if a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy
surfaces in the 14 remaining months of the Clinton administration,
``nothing could budge me'' away from her job as New York state's
top judge.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington to accept the prestigious William H. Rehnquist
Award for Judicial Excellence, Kaye suggested the question is moot
regardless of her personal wishes because there is no immediate
prospect of a vacancy among the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the running,'' she told a news conference. ``There
is no `running.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation in September that Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg might leave the court after she underwent surgery Sept. 17
for colon cancer. But Ginsburg had recuperated sufficiently to take
her seat Oct. 4 on the high court's traditional opening day. Since
then, Ginsburg has not missed a day of oral arguments at the court.
</P>
<P>
   As chief judge, Kaye, 61, wears two hats. She is chief judge of
the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. And she
presides over the New York State Unified Court System, with 363
courthouses, 1,200 paid judges and four million new cases a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could budge me out of the two seats I now occupy,''
Kaye said. She recalled that in 1993, there was media speculation
that she was on President Clinton's short list to fill the vacancy
of departing Justice Byron White.
</P>
<P>
   She had just come into her position in what she described as a
period of ``tumult'' in New York's legal system. She was referring
to the 1992 arrest of her predecessor Sol Wachtler after a bizarre
episode in which he assumed an alternate identity and threatened a
woman with whom he had carried on an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said she let it be known that she was not interested in
going to Washington at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would betray a lack of character to be a
candidate for another office,'' she said. Clinton ultimately gave
the nod to Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored annually by the National Center for State Courts, the
Rehnquist award is bestowed annually on a jurist who displays
excellence in integrity, ethics, creativity, decisiveness, sound
judgment and other qualities. Kaye received the award Monday night
at a banquet at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Warren, president of the Williamsburg, Va.-based center,
praised Kaye as a ``judicial innovator.'' He cited her work in
widening juror pools by abolishing many exemptions to service,
upgrading court facilities to make jury service more appealing and
establishing childcare centers at courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has in so many different ways re-engineered court
processes, not only to make them more efficient but more
effective,'' Warren said. Kaye has helped to ease the system's
staggering case burden by establishing special drug-treatment
courts that help addicts ``find some way out of the revolving
door'' of the criminal justice system, and domestic violence courts
to address spousal and child abuse, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye told reporters the courts must do more to earn the respect
of average people who pass through them, especially the 600,000
state residents who are called for jury duty. ``Frankly, we've been
lazy,'' she said. Efforts to ``spiff ourselves up'' by, for
instance, fixing up court restrooms or emphasizing courtesy among
court personnel are only a beginning, she said.

MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL FIGHT GOES FROM COURTS TO HALLS OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROMAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Environmentalists scored a major victory last month
when a federal judge found that West Virginia coal companies were
violating federal law by filling streams with mine waste.
</P>
<P>
   That victory may be short-lived if some members of Congress get
their way.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from West Virginia and Idaho have been working hard to
have a provision included in the final federal budget to continue
allowing mountaintop removal, a practice blamed for polluting
streams and damaging wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The group, headed by Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, says that if the court's ruling is not reversed,
thousands of mine workers could lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court ruling is wrong-headed. It jeopardizes your jobs. It
jeopardizes your hometowns. Your futures have been put on the
line,'' Byrd told mine workers last week at a rally on the Capitol
steps.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue is the disposal of valley fill _ rock, soil and
trees blasted off mountaintops to expose deposits of coal for
miners to extract. Industry advocates say West Virginia's landscape
is so mountainous that mine operators have no choice but to dump
the rubble into stream-laced valleys and hollows.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say operators need to find new ways to get rid
of the waste, such as filling abandoned underground shafts.
Mountaintop removal, they say, causes too much damage.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute illustrates the tension between concerns for the
environment and the need for jobs, a fight in which state and
federal regulators so far have sided with miners.
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that it only wants to continue a practice
permitted for years by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency and
Army Corps of Engineers. All three agencies must grant various
permits for mine operators to fill streams with mine rubble.
</P>
<P>
   In general, regulators have relaxed standards as mountaintop
removal has become a more common method of strip-mining, said
Stephen Brown, a history professor at the West Virginia University
Institute of Technology. ``When these laws were enacted, the
current ... techniques used to mine (coal) hadn't been
envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress toughened anti-pollution laws 22 years ago, the
number of miles of West Virginia streams mine operators have been
allowed to fill each year has tripled. An analysis of state records
by the The Sunday Gazette-Mail, a Charleston paper, found permits
to fill 71 miles of streams in 1997, up from 20 miles in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after environmentalists filed the lawsuit in 1998
seeking to ban mountaintop removal, the EPA and Corps of Engineers
tightened their restrictions but continued issuing permits to mine
operators.
</P>
<P>
   What Byrd and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, along with House
members from West Virginia, want is to void a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Charles Haden so that regulators can once again sign
off on valley fills.
</P>
<P>
   When Haden last month ordered the industry to comply with the
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Clean Water Act,
Byrd and others began painting doomsday scenarios for West
Virginia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Haden then put his order on hold until the case is heard in an
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entire economy is at risk here,'' said Chris Hamilton, vice
president of the West Virginia Coal Association. ``We're talking
about the loss of 50,000 jobs. From that economic picture you can
see what devastation (this ruling) might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalist say predictions like Hamilton's are
exaggerating the impact mining has on the state's economy, which
ranks as one of the poorest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They worry the industry scare tactics will give Byrd the
momentum he needs to move his proposal through Congress and onto
President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which initially supported Byrd's
proposal, backed away two weeks ago after Haden granted a stay on
his order. The White House now opposes the senator's effort to
overturn the ruling by tacking a rider onto a spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a number of anti-environmental riders that remain
(unresolved).
</P>
<P>
   We have made it very clear that they're unacceptable,'' said
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's ``suggestion of finding a way to legislate what the court
is doing now is something that we don't support,'' Lockhart said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, is
a Clinton ally who defended him during the impeachment trial early
this year. This is the sort of alliance the industry hopes will pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   If Byrd gets his way, environmentalists say Clinton and the West
Virginia delegation will send the wrong message to industry across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this rider were to make it through, our congressional
delegation would be viewed as writing the book on how to circumvent
environmental legislation,'' said Rick Eades, a hydrogeologist for
Citizens Action Group of West Virginia.

 &HT;    Hokies gain ground after Tennessee loss; FSU on topBy Tony
Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee's 28-24 loss to Arkansas on Saturday was the opening
Virginia Tech needed. The Hokies moved into the No. 2 spot behind
Florida State in the Bowl Championship Series rankings released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (7-2), No. 2 last week, dropped to fifth. That loss,
plus Virginia Tech's 43-10 beating of Miami, moved the Hokies to a
solid No. 2. Virginia Tech is expected to finish no worse that
second if it wins its final two games, against Temple (2-7) and
Boston College (7-2).
</P>
<P>
   The rankings are determined by totaling four components: a
team's average position in the two major opinion polls, media and
coaches; its average position in eight computer polls; a point
total derived from a formula to determine strength of schedule; and
its won-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   The lower the total score, the better the ranking. The top two
teams in the final rankings, released Dec. 5, will play for the
national championship Jan. 4 in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (10-0), ranked No. 1 in all but one of the polls
used in the formula, can lock up one of those spots by beating No.
4 Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (9-1) is ranked fourth in both major polls but moved
past Florida (9-1) into the No. 3 spot from No. 6, on the strength
of its 41-15 win over previously unbeaten Kansas State. The
Cornhuskers have one game left, against Colorado on Nov. 26. A win
would put them in the Big 12 championship game against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is .59 points behind Nebraska but should make a big jump
if it knocks off Florida State. If it beats Florida State and then
wins the SEC championship game _ the opponent probably will be No.
6 Alabama _ Florida might have to hold its breath to see if it has
done enough to hold off Nebraska for the other Sugar Bowl slot.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (7-2) is No. 13 but has a good chance to jump into
the top 12 with Penn State and Michigan State, No. 11 and No. 12,
respectively, playing each other on Saturday. To qualify for an
at-large BCS bid, a team must have at least nine wins and be in the
top 12 of the BCS rankings.

FORBES, BRADLEY BEGIN NEW ADS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The airwaves of New Hampshire are getting a little more crowded
as Republican Steve Forbes begins running three new ads Tuesday and
Democrat Bill Bradley's ``It can happen'' advertising campaign
starts broadcasting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is the last major presidential candidate to try to reach
New Hampshire voters through television. His campaign declined to
release any details about his commercial or answer questions about
how often it will air, preferring to make that announcement Tuesday
in New Jersey and Washington. But sources said the ad is strictly
biographical, to be followed later with an issue ad on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Adweek magazine recently reported that the theme of Bradley's
advertising campaign is ``It can happen,'' suggesting he can beat
Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination and win the
general election, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an outside Republican group began running an
advertisement Monday in New Hampshire and Iowa warning Forbes not
to run negative ads. The Republican Leadership Council, a moderate
group with strong ties to Texas Governor George W. Bush, said
Forbes hurt the GOP with negative advertising during the 1996
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I see he just might start again. . . . That's just
going to help the Democrats,'' the ad says. ``Someone needs to tell
that Steve Forbes that if he doesn't have anything nice to say _
don't say anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad brought a quick reproach from the New Hampshire
Republican chairman, Steve Duprey, who called on the group to pull
the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``While their goal is commendable, it is misguided since Mr.
Forbes has neither done nor said anything to violate our 11th
commandment,'' Duprey said. The so-called ``11th commandment'' of
the GOP is that candidates should never to speak ill of a another
Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the forums and debates Mr. Forbes has appeared in, he has
compared his plans with others in a very dignified and appropriate
manner,'' Duprey said. ``It is wrong for the RLC to start warning
candidates when they have done nothing to deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's new round of ads are about Social Security and taxes,
with a third that is strictly biographical. The two issue ads do
not refer to any other candidate or any other campaign's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Young, a senior adviser to Forbes in New Hampshire, said
the RLC is ``carrying water'' for Bush, and praised Duprey for
calling for the ad to be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   RLC director Mark Miller said the group produced the ads before
even waiting to see Forbes' spots because it is in the party's best
interests to avoid negative attacks in the primary season. The
group plans to spend $100,000 to air the ad, and has other spots
ready to air if Forbes' ads are negative enough to merit more
reaction, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side of the primary, former Labor Secretary
Robert Reich endorsed Bradley Monday at Saint Anselm College. Reich
said the Clinton administration had gotten the national economy
back on track but that hard choices on broadening access to health
care and battling poverty remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no doubt that were'' Gore ``elected, he
would make an excellent president, but given the challenges ahead,
Bill Bradley's commitment, his dedication, and his vision make him
to my mind an even better president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the endorsement, Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said:
``I hope this means Mr. Reich will educate Senator Bradley's team
on Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, all programs that
Bradley's agenda threatens to dismantle, imperil or change.''

US-CHINA TRADE DEAL EXPECTED TO OPEN DOORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ The United States and China have agreed on a
major trade deal meant to lower commercial barriers between the two
nations and advance China's hoped-for admission into the World
Trade Organization, President Clinton announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a relationship-building trip to Turkey, the president also
expressed enthusiastic support for Turkey's entry into the European
Union, a move he said would bring Islamic Turkey more fully into
the family of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Both China and Turkey have come under severe criticism for human
rights abuses. Turkey's rejection by the EU so far has been based
in part on its failure to stop the use of torture and protect
freedom of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made economic engagement a key part of his
foreign policy, suggested in a series of remarks Monday that
bringing the two nations closer to the West commercially would
ultimately encourage reform in human rights and other areas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with China ``is a profoundly important step in the
relationship between the United States and China,'' the president
said in comments to US Embassy employees in Ankara. ``The trade
agreement is part of a broader agreement, designed to bring China
into global systems on issues from nonproliferation to regional
security to environmental protection to human rights,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Clinton tweaked
Turkey on its record on human rights and freedom of expression, but
he encouraged them with an acknowledgement that the United States,
too, has had a spotty history on personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind, I come from a nation that was founded on the
creed that all are created equal. And yet, when we were founded, we
had slavery, women could not vote, even men could not vote unless
they owned property,'' Clinton told the generally receptive group
of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know something about the imperfect realization of a
country's ideas. We have had a long journey in America, from our
founding to where we are,'' Clinton added. ``But the journey has
been worth making.''
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening trade ties with China is opposed by an unlikely
coalition of human rights activists, isolationists, and trade
protectionists. Turkey is also a favorite target of human rights
organizations and the Council of Europe for alleged use of torture,
extrajudicial executions, and repression of both the Kurdish
minority and those critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to say there is no torture in Turkey. There
is torture,'' Turkish President Suleyman Demirel bluntly admitted
to reporters. ``But torture is not state policy,'' he said, and
those who torture are ``penalized accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was much gentler, saying that while ``there is still far
more to be done'' before Turkey meets the standards set by the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Turkey is making progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there has been a renewed and clear
determination of the Turkish government to take a stand against
torture and to generally increase protection of human rights,''
Clinton said at a joint news conference with Demirel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no say over whether Turkey gets into the EU, but the
high-profile endorsement was important to the Turks from a public
relations perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials were crowing Monday about what
they presented as five important foreign policy advances in the
past few days: the trade agreement with China; progress in
negotiations over Nothern Ireland and the divided island of Cyprus;
a tentative deal to pay some $1 billion in back dues to the United
Nations; and solidifying American-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has truly been an important day for American foreign
policy,'' said National Security Adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade agreement with China, which, among other things,
lowers tariffs and gives American business more access to the
world's single biggest market, is sure to be met with objections in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers oppose giving China permanent Most Favored Nation
status on human rights grounds, and there has been more recent
irritation with China over a spy scandal involving nuclear weapons
secrets. In 1992, Clinton himself criticized former President
George Bush for bestowing the trade benefit on China, but he
reversed himself soon after he was elected president. Most Favored
Nation status lowers all tariffs on imports to the lowest rate
given any nation.
</P>
<P>
   The trade pact cannot go into effect without congressional
approval of a permanent, normal trading relationship with China.
The status has been granted on a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
   Berger declined to predict whether Congress would give it
approval, or to say whether a ``no'' vote would kill the package.
``I hope it will have broad support,'' he told reporters in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would eliminate China's subsidies of its exports,
cut duties on imported goods from an overall average of 22.1
percent to 17 percent, allow American companies to provide consumer
financing for auto purchases, and expand importation of foreign
films to China.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Berger would characterize which nation made
greater concessions to arrive at a deal. It would be politically
troublesome at home for the Chinese to appear to cave into the
United States on trade after the US bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade during the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The pact does not automatically bring China into the WTO, a
membership China dearly wants, but it does bring the Asian nation
one step closer to joining the trade club.
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to attend an upcoming session of the trade
organization in Seattle as an observer.

 &HT;    Florida policymakers to go over Cape's commercial possibilities
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Florida's Space Coast was born from the
1950s Cold War race to reach orbit. During the heady days of Apollo
in the 1960s, the east coast of the Sunshine State became the
world's launch capital.
</P>
<P>
   Not so today.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the world of wireless electronics _ cell phones,
television, the Internet and more _ demands more satellites. To
send their hardware to space, companies now find cheaper contracts
for launches around the globe, including French Guiana in South
America and an oil rig in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials from all levels of government and economic
development are trying to protect their $4 billion space industry.
One key is to shifting Air Force-run Cape Canaveral from a
government bureaucracy to a commercial friendly enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept focusing on government rockets, and we did
commercial as we could. We probably rested on our laurels,'' said
Greg Moore, former director for legislative affairs for NASA at the
Kennedy Space Center. ``We were fat, dumb and happy for a long
time,''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, now senior director of space programs for Enterprise
Florida, which helped replace the state's commerce department, will
be among the industry representatives and policymakers gathered
today in Melbourne for the Florida Space Launch Symposium. The
topic is how the Cape can keep its share of the growing commercial
space market.
</P>
<P>
   Through 2009, nearly 1,500 satellites will be launched. Teal
Group Corp., a defense and aerospace market analysis company in
Virginia, estimated it would take more than 850 launches over the
next decade to propel more than $100 billion of satellites into
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the U.S. will not be able to meet the
demand for launches within the next 10 years,'' said Marcos
Caceres, Teal Group space analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of every 10 satellites are made in the United States. But
even with commercial launches comprising a majority of the Cape's
schedule, less than one-third of the world's commercial launches
take place in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer alone in this business, '' said Adrian
Laffitte, director of the Atlas rocket program. ``We have to thrive
to be competitive. If we don't, we might have to go outside the
Cape. I don't think they want us to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Until four years ago, when commercial customers began finding
alternate liftoff sites, Florida held an unchallenged grip on
sending up expendable launch vehicles (ELV) like the Atlas rocket.
</P>
<P>
   But cheaper and more efficient sites, primarily the European-run
Arianespace near the equator in South America, have cut domestic
business. On top of that, government payloads at the Cape take
priority because tracking and telemetry for the launch range is
operated by Patrick Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Arianespace, they take one customer at a time,''
said Rick Blucker, chief of plans and programs for the 45th Space
Wing. ``If you come here, you have to wait in line.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bureaucracy comes antiquation, another problem space
advocates are trying to fix.
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts have left engineers with old equipment. Firing a
rocket one day then the Space Shuttle another means pulling cords
from a box much like a telephone operator from Mayberry would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the vacuum tube era,'' Blucker said.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 billion upgrade is under way, but some users complain it's
taking too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're headed toward working like an airport,'' said
Laffitte, the rocket manager and one of today's panelists. ``But
it's not fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The big market looming in the future is the reusable launch
vehicle (RLV). In theory, it could use a spaceport the same way an
airline uses Hartsfield. That's why groups in Texas, Oklahoma, New
Mexico, Idaho and other states are salivating at the prospect of
creating launch pads and landing strips for spaceplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Several RLVs are being developed. One of the potential prizes is
Lockheed Martin's VentureStar, a rocket that launches vertically
and lands like an airplane. The prototype, the X-33, is undergoing
testing with suborbital flights scheduled for next summer. However,
damage to a liquid hydrogen tank was discovered last week during
tests at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed projects VentureStar will be operational by 2004,
though others are more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that any of the proposed RLVs will be
competitive within the next five years,'' declared a Teal Group
report from June. Teal projects it will be 5 to 10 years before
reusable rockets start impacting the marking and ``at least another
10 years before RLVs will be able to consistently offer the type of
prices necessary to begin to seriously expand the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, a satellite costs about $10,000 a pound to be launched
into orbit aboard an ELV _ costly especially if the launch fails.
On Monday, Japanese space officials destroyed an H-2 rocket loaded
with a satellite that would have been used for weather forecasting
and air traffic control. The launch and payload cost $229 million.
</P>
<P>
   But a spaceplane that could take-off and land once or twice a
week might create a demand volume that would cut cost by 90
percent. One day, such a plane might take tourists into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get launches affordable,'' Moore said, ``who knows what
people will launch.''

troublesome at home for the Chinese to appear to cave into the
United States on trade after the US bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade during the war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The pact does not automatically bring China into the WTO, a
membership China dearly wants, but it does bring the Asian nation
one step closer to joining the trade club.
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to attend an upcoming session of the trade
organization in Seattle as an observer.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The decades-old debate over school prayer finally
cycled back to the Supreme Court on Monday in the form of a
singularly American question, one that has as much to do with
culture as with either religion or law: Does it violate the
Constitution for one student to lead others in prayer before a
public high school football game?
</P>
<P>
   The court announced Monday that it would hear a small Texas
school district's appeal from a federal appeals court's ruling that
barred the highly popular and deeply entrenched practice of pregame
invocations. Despite the 1998 ruling, the student-led prayers have
continued in the Santa Fe Independent School District, near
Galveston, under the authority of a defiant federal district judge.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Texas, along with eight other states, filed a brief
urging the justices to hear the district's appeal; Gov. George W.
Bush was the only governor who signed the brief, with the other
states being represented only by their attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe district, which has about 4,000 students, had also
sought review of another portion of the appeals court's decision,
dealing with student-led prayers at graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in New
Orleans, ruled that students could offer prayers at graduation as
long as the prayers were nonsectarian and nonproselytizing. The
school district complained that this limitation would require
school administrators ``to engage in official discrimination based
on religious viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices did not accept that portion of the appeal, although
if they decide that students can pray at football games, they may
be hard pressed to avoid entirely the question of what the students
can be permitted to say.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has never addressed the question of
student-led prayers at graduation, a practice that has grown up in
the aftermath of a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Lee vs. Weisman,
which held that public schools could not invite members of the
clergy to lead prayers at graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe district's prayer policy was ``deliberately
designed to circumvent Lee through the use of student surrogates to
deliver prayers before a captive audience that school officials can
no longer deliver themselves,'' the lawyer for the two families who
had challenged the district's prayer practices told the justices in
the case on Monday, Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe,
No. 99-62. One family is Mormon and the other is Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Supreme Court has decided to look only at football
games, and not at commencements, the question is what relevant
differences, if any, the justices might find in the two settings.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer at graduations, at least clergy-led prayer, violates the
constitutional separation between church and state, because
students have little choice but to attend their graduation and
should not be made to feel like outsiders there by a religious
observance that is not their own, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for
the 5-4 majority in the 1992 case.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates of prayer at football games argue that an
after-school athletic event, where attendance is purely voluntary,
is not nearly as weighty as a high school graduation and that the
analysis of the 1992 decision is inapplicable.
</P>
<P>
   But in barring the football-game prayers, the 5th Circuit saw a
different polarity. While student-led commencement prayers were
justified by ``the singular context and singularly serious nature
of a graduation ceremony,'' the appeals court said, football games
did not merit such solemnizing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that football is so important in Texas ought to
be a reason for saying that prayer sanctioned by the government is
not appropriate,'' the Rev. Barry Lynn, a lawyer who is executive
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
said in an interview Monday. On the other hand, he continued, ``the
court might see it as `just' a football game, and this might be a
school-prayer case they can give away by resolving narrowly.''
</P>
<P>
   The court has accepted this case at a time of heightened ferment
over religion in the public schools across a range of issues, from
the question of publicly financed computers in parochial schools _
a case the court will hear next month _ to the issue of ``school
choice'' and vouchers for parochial school tuition, which many
people think the justices will need to address in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Religion in the schools has also become a presidential campaign
topic, with Steve Forbes, a candidate for the Republican
nomination, calling for the posting of the Ten Commandments in
every classroom. The Supreme Court declared that practice
unconstitutional in a 1980 decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were these other developments at the court Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Federalism
</P>
<P>
   Adding another important federalism case to a growing list, the
justices agreed to decide whether Congress had the constitutional
authority to make arson of a private residence a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   A 1970 law prohibits the malicious damage or destruction by fire
of ``any building'' or other property ``used in interstate or
foreign commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The law's application to private homes has been in doubt for
years, particularly since a 1995 Supreme Court decision, United
States vs. Lopez, made it clear that Congress could not exercise
its authority to regulate interstate commerce over activity that
did not have a substantial connection to commerce _ in that case,
carrying a gun near a school.
</P>
<P>
   In the case on Monday, Jones vs. United States, No. 99-5739, a
man who was convicted under the federal arson law of throwing a
Molotov cocktail into a cousin's house in Fort Wayne, Ind.,
challenged the constitutionality of applying the law to those
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, found that
there was sufficient connection with interstate commerce because
the house was connected to an interstate gas line, carried a
mortgage from an out-of-state lender, and was insured by an
out-of-state insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   If the justices find those connections too insubstantial, they
may avoid striking the law down by finding that, as a matter of
statutory construction, Congress did not mean the law to apply to
private homes.
</P>
<P>
   Religious Meetings
</P>
<P>
   The court let stand a ruling by the federal appeals court in New
York that a self-described atheist could not be required, as a
condition of probation following a drunk-driving conviction, to
participate in Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's philosophy, involving acknowledgment of a
``power greater than ourselves,'' makes the meetings ``intensely
religious events,'' the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in
ruling that required participation violated the separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County Department of Probation appealed the ruling,
which awarded $1 in damages to Robert Warner, the man who brought
the challenge. The case was Orange County vs. Warner, No. 99-24.

MITCHELL SIGNALS SETTLEMENT NEAR IN IRA ARMS SQUABBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Giving the clearest signal yet that
he has fashioned a compromise to break the deadlock over IRA
weapons that has stalled the peace process in Northern Ireland,
former US Senator George Mitchell indicated Monday he would wrap up
his diplomatic rescue mission here this week.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the 10-week effort to save the Good Friday
Agreement he brokered in April 1998 said Mitchell would not have
given such an upbeat public assessment unless he had been assured
that Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was prepared to take the
compromise to his party council for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise calls for the Ulster Unionists to drop their
longstanding refusal to form a local government that would include
two cabinet members from Sinn Fein, the political allies of the
Irish Republican Army. The unionists had been demanding that the
IRA first begin turning in weapons or declare unequivocally that
its war to force a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Trimble is prepared to risk his leadership of the biggest
party in Northern Ireland on assurances from both Sinn Fein and the
IRA that arms ``decommissioning'' will begin within weeks of the
local government being formed. Sinn Fein and the IRA are expected
to make conciliatory statements over the next two days to
strengthen Trimble's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the parties now understand each other's
concerns and requirements far better than before, and are committed
to resolving the current impasse. I am increasingly confident that
a way will be found to do so,'' Mitchell said, emerging from Castle
Buildings at Stormont to make a rare public statement during a
process he has insisted remain low key.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who two weeks ago was prepared to leave here without
having convinced British unionists and Irish republicans to cut a
deal, was smiling broadly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is an unforeseen hitch in a carefully orchestrated
series of confidence-building statements this week, Mitchell will
probably issue a final report Thursday and return to the United
States, where he is anxious to get back to his family and
Washington law practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell has been extremely cautious, and his remarks were being
widely interpreted as a signal that he has concluded that the
impasse has been broken. Mitchell made his remarks after meeting
Monday with Trimble, then with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and its
chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a car arrived at Mitchell's offices carrying
the Roman Catholic leader in Ireland, Archbishop Sean Brady, and
two Belfast priests who have acted as go-betweens with the IRA, the
Rev. Alec Reid and the Rev. Gerry Reynolds. Reid arranged the 1988
meeting between Adams and moderate nationalist leader John Hume
that is considered the beginning of the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' statements remained guarded. Trimble said
only that Monday marked ``the beginning of the process.'' Ken
Maginnis, the Unionists' security spokesman, was more upbeat,
saying, ``We're moving, hopefully, toward a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reg Empey, the Ulster Unionists' chief negotiator, stressed
that any deal was a two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   ``If unionism is to deliver an exclusive executive,
republicanism must deliver decommissioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who canceled a visit to Boston this week because the
talks had dragged on so long, said he was encouraged by Mitchell's
assessment. He said disarming could happen only if the agreement is
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This review and the Good Friday Agreement are about making
politics work,'' said Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Sources predicted that events would unfold this way:
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein is expected to make a statement deploring violence,
and the IRA is expected to follow with its own statement. The two
statements are aimed at giving Trimble the political cover he needs
to convince his skeptical and divided party that it should take its
historical enemies in the republican movement at their word.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 27, Trimble is expected to seek the endorsement of the
approximately 800-member party council for his decision to
compromise on the party's ``no guns, no government'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line unionists were already attacking Trimble, accusing him
of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Trimble has given in on every issue,'' said Peter
Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionists, who oppose the
political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the newly-appointed British secretary of state
for Northern Ireland, has been urging the Ulster Unionists to test
the republicans at their word, saying they can walk away later if
the republicans break their promises.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said the parties that support the Good Friday Agreement
and the British and Irish governments agree that the formation of
the local government and the creation of cross-border authorities
representing mutual interests on the island ``should be established
at the earliest possible date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also common ground that decommissioning should occur as
quickly as possible,'' Mitchell said, and it should be overseen by
a commission led by retired Canadian General John de Chastelain. At
Mitchell's request, de Chastelain later called on loyalist and
republican paramilitary groups to designate representatives to work
out the logistics of disarming with his commission. The IRA is
expected to address that issue this week.
</P>
<P>
   De Chastelain said that if progress is made quickly, the
decommissioning of weapons could be completed by the target date of
next May.

 &HT;    Lowe's bombing suspect faces federal charges
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _A 51-year-old Greensboro man, allegedly trying
to extort $250,000 from Lowe's Companies Inc., has been charged
with bombing two of the chain's stores and trying to bomb a third.
</P>
<P>
   George Rocha is also charged with mailing threatening letters
and interfering with interstate commerce, according to the arrest
warrant released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Identified as a former electronics store technician, Rocha made
his first court appearance in Greensboro Monday before a U.S.
magistrate. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal agents arrested Rocha at his home Friday
without incident.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged in the Sept. 22 bombings at Lowe's home
improvement stores in nearby Asheboro, N.C., and Salisbury, N.C.
The Asheboro blast seriously injured one woman. Six days later, an
unexploded bomb was found at a Lowe's store in Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   All three devices were ``fairly sophisticated,'' potentially
lethal pipe bombs, said Richard Fox, special agent in charge with
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Fox added that investigators believe Rocha acted on his own and
that no further arrests are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents said that, on Sept. 22, Rocha wrote Lowe's
corporate headquarters in North Wilkesboro, N.C., threatening to
``keep bombing your 500 stores until you pay $250,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's received two identical letters Sept. 23, a day after the
two bombs went off. The letters said the bombings were in
retribution for a May 1 accident at Lowe's Motor Speedway in
Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's is a corporate sponsor at the track, where the May
accident killed three spectators and injured eight others.
Investigators concluded, however, that the bombings were not
connected to the speedway accident. In fact, Rocha was motivated by
his arrest in July 1998 at a Greensboro Lowe's for allegedly
producing price labels and affixing them to merchandise, the
warrant said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged then with obtaining property under false
pretense. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 20 days in jail
and 12 months' probation and fined $100.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents credited Internet investigators for helping bring
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving another two threatening letters last week,
Lowe's wired $250,000 to an account in the Baltic state of Latvia.
The company acted out of concern for the safety of employees and
customers and to aid authorities in tracking down the suspect,
Lowe's spokesman Brian Peace said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the bank account was opened over the Internet,
using a fictitious name and driver's license. The address listed on
the account was for a Dunkin Donuts in Winston-Salem, N.C.
Investigators obtained an e-mail message that it said Rocha sent to
Paritate Bank, which identified itself as a European bank with
on-line banking services. Working with telephone company officials,
investigators traced the e-mail to Rocha's phone number in
Greensboro.

 &HT;    CCE announces strategy to fend off losses
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coke isn't a bargain-basement soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   And if it's sold that way, it will hurt the long-term financial
performance of Coca-Cola Co. and its bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   That message came through loud and clear Monday from Coca-Cola
Enterprises, the system's largest bottler. Atlanta-based CCE held a
conference call with industry analysts and large investors to
explain its strategy in the wake of recent price increases and a
pummeling on Wall Street, where its stock has fallen 38 percent so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, CCE is shifting its strategy from one based on
boosting case sales to one that relies more heavily on selling
higher priced products to increase profits. Some of the revenue
from the higher prices will then be used to support more intense
marketing and brand-building efforts to try to differentiate its
products from the competition, the company told analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This better be very effective marketing because it has to
overcome a natural tendency on the part of consumers to resist
purchasing more soft drinks when the price goes up,'' said Marc
Cohen, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ``If they are effective, both
Coke and the bottler should be able to obtain their financial
objectives. If there is any hitch in the marketing execution, then
they may be finding themselves scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. already has announced plans to launch a new
marketing campaign for its flagship Coke Classic brand early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   CCE has raised North American supermarket prices by more than 4
percent this year, with further increases expected next year, even
though they will cut into the growth of case sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, starting in the fourth quarter, analysts said,
Coca-Cola Co. will be charging CCE about 5 percent to 7 percent
more for concentrate, which the bottler uses to make and distribute
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But profits will rise substantially during the next two years,
CCE executives told analysts, for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ When the supermarket price increase works its way down to
CCE's bottom line, it will more than offset the effect on case
sales, which will grow at a slower rate.
</P>
<P>
   _ The company will be focusing more of its efforts on the higher
priced beverages sold in vending machines and coolers that yield
greater profit margins than supermarkets do.
</P>
<P>
   The overall strategy will boost earnings per share by about 50
percent next year and another 50 percent in 2001, CCE officials
told analysts. For 1999, the company expects to earn 25 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, earnings per share will rise substantially even though
CCE predicted that North American case sales will increase
considerably less than what the company had predicted previously.
CCE now expects North American case sales to rise 3 percent to 4
percent next year, instead of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a silver lining in the drop in case sales because CCE
can reduce its capital expenditures, such as those for trucks and
additional production lines. It can then redirect some of that
money into repurchasing its shares for what it believes to be a
bargain price now, as well as reducing its debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the moderation in case-sales growth for CCE could postpone
the day when Coca-Cola Co. reaches its long-term goal of 7 percent
to 8 percent annual growth in worldwide case sales, some analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Caroline Levy of Schroder &AMP; Co. said she expects it to
be 2001 before Coca-Cola Co. produces worldwide volume growth of 7
percent to 8 percent. Some other analysts think the company may
start hitting that target in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Volume growth is key to stock price appreciation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts feel CCE stock is undervalued right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the conference call will mute investor
skepticism ... but the stock price should definitely go up,'' said
Marty Romm, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ``I don't
see any reason why the stock is down where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   CCE rose 25 cents Monday to close at $22.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. rose 75 cents to close at $58.25.

   DAM-FISH (Undated) _ A panel of scientists assembled by the
federal government says punching holes in four Snake River dams in
southeastern Washington is the best way to help endangered salmon
there. But that conclusion drew unmerciful fire in the region and
in the halls of Congress. So this week federal fisheries managers
will tell Pacific Northwesterners, in effect: ``OK, you figure out
what to do.'' They will offer a menu of other, equally unpleasant
alternatives that, among other things, have the potential to cause
a faceoff between Washington and Idaho over water rights.

   AUTISM-SPECIAL (Undated) _ Special package: Autism is a
mysterious brain disorder that affects between 1 out of 500 and 1
out of 1,000 children. Scientists cannot agree on the incidence,
except to say it appears to be growing. No one knows exactly why.

 &HT;    Rollins, UPS team up
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Parcel Service and Rollins Truck Leasing Corp.
have agreed to swap two business units.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based UPS said Monday it is buying Rollins Logistics and
will fold it into the fast-growing UPS Logistics Group, which
manages shipping, warehousing and inventory management for business
clients.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the delivery giant is selling its UPS Truck
Leasing unit and a 9,000-vehicle fleet to Rollins, based in
Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the two companies also signed a
co-marketing agreement in which each will be the preferred provider
of services to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes just days after UPS completed the biggest initial
public stock offering ever, issuing 109.4 million Class B shares at
$50 each, for a total value of $5.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the offering was aimed at creating a class of
public shares that could be used as currency in future
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But UPS spokesman Norman Black said the Rollins deal doesn't
involve stock and didn't depend on the public offering to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that had been in the works for quite a
while and just happens to be the first deal to occur after the
offering,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Black said UPS had decided last summer to put the truck leasing
unit up for sale. The decision to buy Rollins' logistics unit arose
during negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   UPS didn't disclose how much it's paying for the Rollins
logistics unit, which has about 100 clients, or how much it's
getting for the truck leasing unit.

CHINESE STOCKS SURGE IN HONG KONG ON NEWS OF TRADE AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-U.S.-TRADE and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Shares of Chinese and China-related companies surged
here Monday as investors concluded that a landmark trade agreement
between the United States and China _ and the competition it
promises _ would help Chinese companies more than hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's ``red chip'' index, which tracks
the performance of Hong Kong-based, Chinese-controlled companies,
soared 9.8 percent after the news broke in midafternoon that
American and Chinese negotiators had achieved a deal in Beijing
after six days of talks. The H share index, which tracks companies
based in mainland China, jumped 9.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's broader Hang Seng index rose 2.64 percent, to close
at 14,564.79 _ its highest close in more than two years. Shares
also rose strongly on the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen,
though not as spectacularly as China-related stocks in the Hong
Kong market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the trade agreement, which removes a major
barrier to China's entry into the World Trade Organization, would
strengthen Chinese companies, simply by exposing them to
competition. Although few details of the agreement have been
disclosed, officials said it would open China's telecommunications,
banking and insurance industries to American companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China joins the trading world, its companies are going to
be forced to change,'' said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan
Stanley, Dean Witter here. ``Deregulation in the United States was
beneficial even for incumbents, because it made everybody more
innovative and efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is far from conventional wisdom in mainland China.
Indeed, a main reason this trade agreement took so long to reach
was that some Chinese government officials feared that the
country's state-owned corporations _ many of them bloated relics of
a command economy _ would be thrashed by more nimble rivals from
the United States or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears have not gone away. But Xie said they were
outweighed by the prospect that foreign companies could help
Chinese companies as partners or investors. One of the
oft-mentioned candidates for such a partnership, China Telecom
(Hong Kong) Ltd., recorded an 8.5 percent increase in its shares.
</P>
<P>
   China Telecom is a prime example of a company that could be
transformed by China's entry into the World Trade Organization. As
the dominant player in China's burgeoning mobile phone business, it
would be an instant candidate for an alliance with a European or
American cellular carrier, when outsiders are allowed to own stakes
in Chinese telecommunications providers.
</P>
<P>
   As if to dramatize that point, one of Hong Kong's leading
telecommunications providers, Hutchinson Whampoa Ltd., announced a
$1.2 billion joint venture Monday with Global Crossing Ltd., the
operator of a worldwide fiber optic network. The new venture, to be
called China Crossing, will build a high-speed fiber optic voice
and data network, initially in Hong Kong but later aiming at the
mainland China market.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that Chinese fears of foreign competition
are overblown. American companies have stumbled in China in
businesses as diverse as insurance and beer, and not always because
of trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obstacles to making money in China are not just those that
have to be removed as part of WTO accession,'' said Richard
Margolis, a regional strategist at Merrill Lynch here. He cited
issues like pricing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the Chinese companies that benefited from Monday's
announcement are on the frontier of technology or communications.
Two old-style shipping companies, Cosco Pacific and China Shipping
Development, recorded 12 percent and 13.69 percent increases in
their shares, respectively, because of hopes that the trade pact
would expand the amount of cargo flowing between the United States
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Xie said the agreement also raised the odds that several major
Chinese state-owned companies would be able to issue shares in the
Hong Kong market in the next year. Beijing hopes to raise more than
$20 million by offering shares in flagship companies like China
National Petroleum Corp. and the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about the slowing pace of economic change in China had
cast doubt on the sale of those shares. One company, China National
Overseas Oil Corp., was forced to scuttle a planned offering last
month. But China's agreement to open its markets could allay some
of those fears, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only hint of concern in Hong Kong Monday had to do
with the future of this former British colony. Hong Kong has built
a booming economy as a middleman between a closed China and the
world. If China joins the club of trading nations, some experts
said Hong Kong could lose its role.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a notice for change,'' Xie said. ``Hong Kong has to
reinvent itself. It's not that we won't be a middleman anymore, but
we'll have to be more creative about it.''

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR SCHOOL-PRAYER CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a case involving
what has emerged as one of Texas' most emotionally charged issues
this fall _ prayer and Friday night football.
</P>
<P>
   Whether organized, student-led prayer before high school
kickoffs can co-exist with the Constitution may finally be settled
in June, when the nine justices are expected to make a decision on
a four-year-old lawsuit out of Galveston County. It will be the
first major school prayer-related decision by the court in eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled they're going to hear it,'' said Richard Ownby,
superintendent of the Santa Fe school district, where the lawsuit
began in 1995. ``We hope that they find that our policy allowing an
invocation at a football game is legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision early
this year declaring student-led prayers at football games
unconstitutional, the otherwise humdrum opening ceremonies at many
games took on far more meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Student rebellions, outraged small towns, clandestine prayers
and the opinions of Gov. George W. Bush and Congress all surfaced
during the latest battle between supporters of prayer at school and
defenders of the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school football is not a trivial matter in Texas to begin
with,'' said Frank Colosi, a Fort Worth attorney active with the
American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit. ``There is
also the tendency to use schools as a testing ground to push
certain political issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU filed suit against the Santa Fe district on behalf of
two families, one Mormon and one Catholic, who objected to a litany
of practices in their public schools, including prayer before
football games. The families have remained anonymous, citing a fear
of community reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The initial U.S. district court ruling allowed organized prayer
at football games as long as it was ``nonsectarian and
non-proselytizing.'' The students and the school district appealed
to the 5th Circuit Court, which covers Texas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling announced in February, a panel of justices from the
5th Circuit Court declared any kind of organized prayer at public
school football games unconstitutional. Unorganized prayers in
places such as the locker room or field are constitutional,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe school board's current policy is to allow a
student, elected by other students, to speak before a football game
with whatever religious or secular message they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school district has attempted to stake out a position of
neutrality with respect to matters of religion,'' said Lisa A.
Brown, a Houston lawyer who represents the district. ``The school
district is treating religious and non-religious speech in the same
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the policy contend that student-led or not, the
prayer is still sanctioned by the school district and has the
effect of excluding minority faiths, who may not have the same
opportunities to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you start allowing prayer at school events, it
becomes a very slippery slope,'' said Anthony Griffin, the
Galveston attorney representing the parents. ``That opens up the
schools to prayer at every event, over the loudspeakers every
morning. I'm not sure the Court wants to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative groups advocating prayer in schools agree.
Kelly Shackelford, chief counsel for the Liberty Legal Institute in
Dallas, said he is a tad worried how the Supreme Court might rule
on the issue and considers Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra
Day O'Connor the critical votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not very good odds,'' Shackelford said. ``It's a
significant issue. There has never been a case of whether the
government is supposed to ban religious expression by a private
citizen. It's a dangerous step and I hope they don't start down
that road.''
</P>
<P>
   Most urban districts in Texas haven't had prayer at football
games in several years, but it remains a thorny issue in many other
districts. A number of suburban and small districts have skated
around the appeals court ruling, but many canceled all prayer until
the legal issue is settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved that the Supreme Court'' is going to look at the
case, said Debbie Thomas, president of the Northwest school
district board. ``I hope that they will overturn the decision and I
hope they will allow prayer at football games. If they do not, and
it remains the law, we will continue to obey the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is further complicated by a ruling this year by the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals that said student-led prayers at
school functions in Georgia are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did feel that given the conflict on this issue, that at some
point, they were going to need to take a case and address
student-initiated speech,'' Brown said. ``We hope at the end of the
day that we have a ruling that provides guidance to school
administrators and school board members.''

IN BEIJING, TRADE PACT ELICITS JOY, CAUTION, INDIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-U.S.-TRADE and related stories.) 
(mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Many Chinese were pinching themselves Monday
afternoon, filled with disbelief that, after more than a decade of
false starts, China had actually taken the plunge into the
international economy, signing a landmark trade agreement with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly gray afternoon in Beijing, many people were
ebullient when they first heard the news. For most people, it
raised the prospect of new opportunities to make money as well as
new chances to consume. The agreement drops many current
restrictions on trade and investment and reduces import taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's signed?'' said Li Dayong, 29, who works for an American
pharmaceutical firm. ``That's great! I'm thrilled! We've been
wanting this for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some took a macro view, welcoming the treaty as a sign of bigger
things: China's new economic muscle, an immutable commitment to
further economic reform and a renewal of relations with the United
States, which had been ravaged by the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in May.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijingers also seemed keenly aware that there will be
individual winners and losers along China's new path. Most are
paying careful attention to the micro view, calculating what the
trade agreement _ which is widely expected to lead to World Trade
Organization membership _ means for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news. I had planned to change my Daewoo for a
better car soon and now I'll buy an imported American one,'' said
Xu Yiang, a stock investor, referring to the Korean car he now
owns.
</P>
<P>
   Xu said he also plans to change his investment strategy, buying
telecommunications stocks that he deems likely to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But Luan Wenqiang, a worker at Beijing Light Truck Co.,
predicted that the agreement would drive him out of his already
tenuous job. ``Our factory is already in bad shape,'' he said.
``Most workers are on leave and are called back only when there is
work to do. This will open China to better and cheaper U.S. trucks.
I don't believe we will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, duties on imported vehicles will drop
dramatically, from the current rate of more than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the hundreds of millions of Chinese who farm the land or
work as low-wage laborers in small cities and towns, Monday's
triumphant treaty was a big bang in another universe _ although
many will probably feel its effects.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen migrant workers interviewed in Beijing said they
had never heard of the trade organization, which has had only
fleeting recent mention in the press despite the frantic
negotiations here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with my life,'' said a middle-aged man, a
worker in a small machine factory, strapping a huge box of cabbage
to the back of an ancient bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The new treaty will certainly bring both new investment and
intense competition to China and the outcome will vary from
industry to industry. But many corporate leaders seemed to relish
the challenge of being able to compete in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy to hear about this,'' said Duan Yongji,
the chairman of China's giant Stone Group, a computer company.
``Everyone knows that entry will make the country more open and
that will bring more competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we shouldn't need a greenhouse to protect us. And we also
hope that entry will open more opportunities for collaboration and
cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Duan added that, at a personal level, he was relieved to hear
the government renew its vows, so to speak, to principles like
economic overhaul and engagement with the West. The Chinese
government has often appeared lukewarm on such concepts.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing's business districts, many owners of small businesses
likewise focused more on the opportunities of Monday's deal than
its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign companies have opened offices here in the last five
years _ even though their activities were extremely circumscribed
by Chinese law _ gambling that this huge economy would one day
open. On Monday, people dared to imagine the payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Li Dayong, an American drug company employee, said that until
now his company had not been able to import many of its medicines
to China. ``Now I think it should become easier to bring foreign
medical products in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dai Liming, 35, well dressed in a sweater vest and suit, saw
only possibilities when he heard the news. Dai, who works as a
representative for a domestic trading company, predicted that ``the
deal will bring my company new opportunities for foreign trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But others offered more sober assessments, noting that many of
China's service industries _ from insurance to the Internet to
personal banking _ are young and ill prepared to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already facing fierce competition from foreign
companies in some areas and if further concessions are made in the
insurance sector we'll be facing a grimmer future,'' said Lu
Youquan, manager of Antai Life Insurance Co. in Shanghai. ``Their
management is more efficient and their marketing skills more
aggressive. Nineteen ninety-nine has already been a bad year for us
_ we're losing clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lu said that he holds out hope that membership in the
World Trade Organization might give the economy a boost, and that
his company's business might improve despite the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this makes the cake larger,'' he said. ``If it does,
then everyone _including us _ can have a larger share.''

TALKS REVIVED ON NAZI-ERA SLAVE-LABOR COMPENSATION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ An improved offer from the German government and the
agreement of new companies to make payments have revived talks on
compensating Nazi-era slave laborers, opening the way for a round
of potentially decisive negotiations in Bonn that begin on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said this month that the talks had been
postponed because leading companies and the government were not
ready to raise a proposal to pay $3.3 billion made last month in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief German mediator, Otto Lambsdorff, said on Monday
that the government had increased its offer by $555 million,
putting the total at $3.85 billion. He added that it was now up to
the corporations involved to raise their sums by similar amounts or
more.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a large engineering and automotive company,
Robert Bosch, said it would join the approximately 50 corporations
that have agreed to make payments toward compensating people forced
to work by the Nazis. Of the companies, most have declined to be
named, presumably because they would rather not be associated with
the use of slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 17 blue-chip companies, including Allianz, Bayer, BMW,
Commerzbank, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens, have stated a willingness
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides said there were signs that if the
government and businesses were able to raise the total to close to
$5.55 billion, or 10 billion marks, a settlement might be possible
at the Bonn meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a renewed determination to try and resolve this on
both sides,'' said Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat of
the United States. But he added that a further meeting after Bonn
would probably be needed to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   German corporations, concerned about their image in the United
States, are eager to find a reasonable settlement soon, and the
government wants to enter a new century with what is almost
certainly the last major Holocaust-related negotiation behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very good about Robert Bosch's coming in, and we sense
that an offer of 10 billion marks might bring an agreement,'' a
spokesman for the corporations, Wolfgang Gibowski, said. ``But
right now, I do not see that the companies I represent are able or
willing to go higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are taking a guarded approach, in part apparently
because they feel they made a mistake at the last round of talks in
Washington by immediately putting their best offer on the table.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the corporations had been encouraged to
push hard for a settlement by improved assurances from Washington
that an accord would provide them with protection from further
suits. At the same time, about 15 additional companies have come
forward since the Washington talks, meaning that the financial
burden fund would be spread wider.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War II, the German government has paid $80 billion
in war reparations, mostly to Jews who survived concentration camps
or fled. But German companies have never previously pooled their
resources to offer significant compensation to forced laborers,
generally non-Jews deported to Germany from Central and Eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have payments been made to a far smaller group of slave
laborers who were put to work in concentration camps and were
mainly Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from New York who is representing people who have sued
German companies for compensation, Edward Fagan, said here on
Monday that he was dropping an earlier proposal for $12.5 billion
in favor of a much higher amount. ``This case won't be settled for
$10 billion or 10 billion marks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Jewish Claims Conference, an umbrella
organization that represents several Jewish groups, said an offer
of 10 billion marks could lead to a settlement. The advanced ages
of the surviving laborers and the strong desire of the German and
American governments to avert a protracted clash, the officials
said, have contributed to pressure for an accord.

 &HT;    Union asks for election, hopes to secure AirTran agent
representation
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The International Association of Machinists said it
will seek an election to represent airport and reservations agents
at AirTran Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The giant union filed a petition Monday with the National
Mediation Board, asking it to conduct an election, said Tony
Klinakis, international representative in the Machinists'
Riverdale, Ga., office.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants to represent some 1,600 AirTran agents, about
800 of them working at Hartsfield International Airport and the
carrier's nearby reservations center, Klinakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 350 work at a reservations center in Savannah, Ga., he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are low pay, but even more so the way people are
treated,'' he said. ``Working conditions need to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran spokeswoman Cara Maruskin said the carrier was aware of
the Machinists' organizing efforts but had no immediate comment on
the plan to seek an election. The Machinists union would not be the
first at AirTran, which is based in Orlando, Fla., but has its
flight hub at Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots, flight attendants and mechanics already are represented
by unions.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, however, would become the biggest employee group
represented if the Machinists' effort is successful.
</P>
<P>
   Klinakis said the union had been organizing ``off and on'' ever
since AirTran's beginnings as ValuJet. ``Turnover has been so high
it's always been difficult,'' he said. To get an election, a union
must present the mediation board with signed election authorization
cards from at least 35 percent of the workers to be represented.
</P>
<P>
   Klinakis declined to say how many cards the union has collected.
But he said it never seeks an election without cards from at least
65 percent of its members, so as to assure a good chance of winning
an election if one is called.

HIAASEN'S `KICK ASS' IS A COLLECTION OF COLUMNS WITH THAT EXTRA
PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GARY KIRKLAND   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Carl Hiaasen the term ``kick ass'' is a job description for
a metro columnist. In that case, he's got some mighty sore feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kick Ass'' is also the title of his new book from the
University of Florida Press, a collection of his syndicated columns
published since 1985. All of his royalties from the book are going
to the University of Florida College of Journalism and
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   While Hiaasen's novels, such as ``Stormy Weather,'' ``Tourist
Season'' and ``Strip Tease,'' have been best sellers, this is the
first time he's offered up a selection of his nonfiction columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in Des Moines, Iowa, who picks up this book, for them
it's not going to be that big of a jump from my fiction to my
nonfiction, because there's a lot of echoes and similarities you
can see in the columns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His co-worker at The Miami Herald, Dave Barry, described
Hiaasen's fiction as the ``Bunch of South Florida Wackos genre,''
which also accurately describes the real life people Hiaasen writes
about in his columns. South Florida facts are stranger than
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crooked city commissioner, whose wife had an affair
with his defense lawyer during the trial, who then filed an appeal,
based on the affair _ or as summed up by Hiaasen, ``His wife was
doing with his lawyers what he was doing to the city of Miami all
these years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that edge, his sarcastic wise guy take on events, that puts
the spice in a Hiaasen column.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a boxer gives a twist of the wrist to add snap to a
punch, Hiaasen's power comes from powerful combinations of words,
like describing former Reform Party presidential candidate Ross
Perot as ``looking like a wall-eyed prairie dog on crystal meth.''
</P>
<P>
   And of state Sen. Alberto Gutman, who was under indictment when
he was re-elected, Hiaasen concluded, ``thanks for sending another
thief back to Tallahassee'' and suggested Gutman could be replaced
by ``any pimp off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't write with such venom just to be mean. Hiaasen has
this strange idea that public officials should be honest, even
though he's made a career writing about those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is to stay mad, to stay outraged. Even though it's
the umpteenth time you've seen one of your elected officials led
off in handcuffs it should be just as shocking, it should be just
as appalling as it was the first time,'' he said. ``There's no
excuse for the betrayal of the public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   And giving up isn't an option, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't walk away from it. If everybody who felt this way just
walked away, then you're turning it over to the heathens, turning
it over to the people who don't care about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, for example, was supposed to be a public watchdog of the
health-care industry and was convicted of Medicare fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``How else do you treat someone who steals, someone who reaches
into your grandmother's pocketbook and steals money? He's no better
than a purse snatcher, except he's got a nice suit and an office in
Tallahassee,'' Hiaasen said.
</P>
<P>
   As Hiaasen talks, it's quickly apparent that writing isn't a job
but his passion. His goal in pointing out the politicians on the
take, the land rapers and corrupt building inspectors is to grab
people's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute worst sin you can commit as a writer is to be
boring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting their attention is the first step to getting them to
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get enough people reading, though, you will get them
thinking. You will maybe make them sit down and write that one
letter to a congressman or to the county commission or to the
mayor. That's not changing the world, but that's how you start,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kick Ass'' readers will find little evidence of Hiaasen
committing that worst of journalistic sins. Editor Diane Stevenson
sorted through more than 1,300 columns to find those that stand up
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stuff brings back funny memories, in the dark
sense of funny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In looking over the work, did Hiaasen think he'd changed as a
writer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't think I've mellowed ... when I start to
mellow, I'm bailing out,'' he said. ``I'm not doing the readers any
favors by turning into some wise old sage.''
</P>
<P>
   If feasting on a collection of columns makes readers hungry for
a little fictional dessert, ``Sick Puppy'' is coming in January _
the villain is a lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a complete whore, of course, he'll lobby for anybody.
He's not a one-industry lobbyist, he's an equal opportunity
whore,'' Hiaasen said. ``He's right out of how many columns I've
written? That guy, I didn't have to go very far to find him.''

 &HT;    CLINTON HAILS CHINA WTO DEAL AS BOON FOR U.S. CONSUMERS,
INVESTORS
 &HT;    (800&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ President Clinton hailed the landmark trade
accord U.S. negotiators struck Monday with China as a boon for
American workers and investors, saying the deal would boost the
American economy and generate new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's agreement, one of the most sweeping in U.S. trade
history, set the stage for China to join the 135-nation World Trade
Organization (WTO), which sets the rules of the road for the global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement capped 13 years of intensive negotiations that
weathered some of the darkest moments in modern Sino-American
relations and the bump-and-grind of China's particularly rocky
journey away from the failings of decades of state-run industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was also seen as concrete evidence that U.S.-China relations
are at least partly back on track after a series of setbacks _
including allegations of nuclear spying by Beijing and the
inadvertent U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pact, though, Clinton said, lies an epic
battle to broaden U.S. companies' access to China, home to
one-fifth of the world's people and one of the fastest-developing
economies in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today China embraces principles of economic openness,
innovation and competition that will bolster China's economic
reforms and advance the rule of law,'' said Clinton, who is here on
the first leg of a 10-day swing through southeastern Europe. ``The
agreement will create unprecedented opportunities for American
farmers, workers and companies to compete successfully in China's
market, while bringing increased prosperity to the people of
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, though, that the accord would treat various
sectors of the economy very differently.
</P>
<P>
   It would help out highly educated workers in such service
industries as telecommunications and banking, these experts said,
while pushing out textile workers and others in lower-end
manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest gains are going to be in the service areas . . .
where the restrictions (on sales to China) have been extreme,''
said Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also opens vast new opportunities for U.S.
investment in providing Internet services to China, said Lardy.
Internet business is an area expected to mushroom in the coming
decade as more and more of China's burgeoning middle class goes
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. cattle raisers and soybean farmers should benefit from
China's promise to widen its market to American foodstuffs. And
U.S. cotton and rice producers should be aided by China's promise
to end export subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said, though, that the agreement gives U.S.
manufacturers a green light to expand operations in China's
low-wage market and export the output back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That, said trade expert Alan Tonelson, could cost thousands of
Americans their jobs over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts American workers in basically every core
manufacturing industry that you can think of _ electronics,
computers, increasingly aerospace, machine tools, those very
industries that make up the backbone of a modern manufacturing
economy and that create the best jobs,'' said Tonelson, research
fellow with the U.S. Business and Industry Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based association represents companies threatened
by increasing imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement is not about opening the Chinese market to
U.S.-based businesses,'' Tonelson said. ``The agreement is about
keeping the U.S. market open to the exports of Chinese factories
owned by the Fortune 500.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to concerns by organized labor, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshevsky insisted on a number of
safeguards. A so-called ``import surge mechanism,'' for example,
allows for a 12-year adjustment period during which the White House
may limit the flow of Chinese goods when spikes in U.S. imports
threaten large numbers of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's accord cleared away the last major impediment to
China's entry into the WTO. It must still settle outstanding issues
with the European Union and a host of developing countries, but
White House officials expect that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a WTO deal with China has been a major goal for
Clinton, who journeys to Seattle Nov. 30 to open a new round of WTO
negotiations. Expected to center on expanding market access for
agricultural goods and such services as finance, telecommunications
and technology, the Seattle trade negotiations are expected to last
for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rhongi were near
agreement over China's admission into the WTO last April. During a
visit to the White House by Zhu, however, Clinton confided that
Congress was too irritated over Beijing's alleged spying to support
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over China's entry into the WTO also reflects
the wider national debate over how closely to wed the U.S. economy
with those of developing nations around the world. In these
nations, wages are a fraction of U.S. levels and enforcement of
labor laws and environmental regulations tends to be lax.
</P>
<P>
   China has an added dimension. It's harsh record of stifling
political dissent _ etched in the Western mind by the bloody 1989
crackdown on student demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square _
and muzzling the press has prompted human rights groups to call for
economic sanctions against China, not increased trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself criticized U.S. engagement with China when he
first ran for president in 1992. He reversed himself his first year
in office, however, and has since become an aggressive proponent of
strengthening economic, political and even military ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by international laws of supply and demand as much, if
not more, than by policy decisions, China's trade with the United
States has been booming since Beijing's late paramount leader Deng
Xiaoping set the country on a path of global trade and market
reforms in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   This year the United States is on track to import more than $70
billion worth of telephones, computers, toys, shoes, clothing and
other merchandise from China, which will buy less than $15 billion
worth of U.S.-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   That makes China roughly 5 percent of total U.S. two-way trade,
expected to top a record $2.1 trillion this year, based on Commerce
Department figures through July.
</P>
<P>
   That would amount to a $100-billion increase over last year's
level, almost all attributable to growing imports to feed a hungry
U.S. consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   While critics say the rising imports from China and other
nations is undercutting American workers, the White House argues
the opposite, contending that U.S. exports have fueled as much as
half of the overall growth that has powered the American economy
through the longest expansion in its history.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the White House claims, growth in exports of U.S.
goods and services has created 1.3 million new jobs for Americans,
as unemployment has fallen from 6.9 percent to 4.3 percent.

IT'S OFFICIAL: 49ERS HIT BOTTOM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BOB PADECKY   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Sunday it became official. The 49ers finally hit
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you may have thought the 49ers hit bottom last week when
they lost to the Steelers. Nah. That was Trump Tower compared to
this. The 49ers lost to the Saints on Sunday. Oops, check that.
They got smoked by the Saints. They were taunted by the Saints.
They were beaten the way your momma beats the rug on a clothesline
by the Saints. They suffered every humiliation except maybe trying
to run after the Saints tied their shoelaces together. And we're
still not sure of the shoelaces until we see the films.
</P>
<P>
   All ridicule is now possible. All ridicule is now permissible.
No word is too tasteless, no opinion too absurd, no scenario too
foolish. That's because nothing can be as obscene as the following
sentence: The Saints beat the 49ers by three, count 'em, three
touchdowns! Nothing you can say or do will ever make the hair on
the back of your neck stand up any straighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to wait until I gathered my thoughts,'' said coach
Steve Mariucci, ``I wouldn't be saying anything to anyone today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mariucci had to be thinking the unthinkable. After what
happened Sunday, the 49ers might finish 3-13 this season. Who can
they beat? Everyone on their schedule has to look like a monster
truck to them right now. Even pathetic Cincinnati on Dec. 5th?
Sure, why not? If Billy Joe Tolliver can play like a Hall of Fame
quarterback Sunday, then so can Cincy's Jeff Blake in December. And
that game is in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers made Billy Joe Tolliver look like Billy Joe Montana.
Tolliver is the NFL poster boy for the nameless, faceless, totally
forgettable quarterback. He couldn't be more anonymous if he was Al
Gore's speechwriter. Yet he went 12 of 15 for 242 yards Sunday. He
ran for two touchdowns, which matched his total in the 75 previous
games he had played in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci probably wishes he had Tolliver. That would mean, of
course, a quarterback upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints beat the 49ers by three touchdowns! Even Eddie
DeBartolo Jr. wouldn't make that bet. Nor would anyone else. In the
15 times the Saints have beaten the 49ers over their 32-year
``rivalry'', New Orleans has never won by such a large margin.
Never. Just getting beat by the Saints is a news bulletin to a team
tethered to five Super Bowl trophies. But by 18 points, when the
Saints were on a seven-game losing streak, when they had lost 17 of
their last 21, well, this is throwing kitty litter on those five
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to get on a team early and dominate them or we'd hang
in there and find a way to win it at the end of the game,'' said
linebacker Ken Norton Jr. ``Now, it's like we are out of it in the
first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Saints! That just can't be repeated enough. Through
the years, no matter how iffy the season was for the 49ers, there
always was the Saints. You always felt good about coming here, both
on Bourbon Street and inside the Superdome. New Orleans always was
a mood enhancer.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the 49ers lost badly only to good teams. Now
they lose badly to bad teams. It's enough to make you run and hide.
The 49ers have. They played most of the game as if they were scared
of their own shadow. ``Who are these guys?'' Saints fans had to be
asking themselves. They were no streaks or post patterns. Steve
Stenstrom's longest pass was 18 yards. The 49ers ran Charlie Garner
and they ran Charlie Garner and they were hoping maybe the Saints
would get bored to death and Garner could break one. Hardly the
stuff acceptable to Super Bowl legends. Ah, then again, that wasn't
the worst of it, as dreary as that sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were rubbing it in on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you do it a little bit after everything you have been
through?'' asked 49ers safety Tim McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   As the outcome became more and more certain, by the second
quarter actually, as the 49ers offense was reduced to field goal
attempts, the Saints players began to let it out. All those years,
all that frustration, recent as well as past, surfaced. It was like
a blood-letting to relieve spiritual toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had beaten this team quite a few times,'' McDonald said,
``and now they had us down and they were letting us know it. I
can't tell you the number of times I was kicked, grabbed, poked
with some words being offered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were beating on a lame dog and they saw no reason to
apologize. The 49ers will have to get used to that. A lot of teams
are looking forward to payback. The 49ers are bottom feeders now,
that's how far they have fallen, and bottom feeders always get the
worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have seven games left,'' McDonald said. ``This could
get embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   It already is embarrassing. Sunday saw to that. The 49ers are
waaaaaay past embarrassing. They now have entered the funky realm
known as Groundhog Day for Losers, in which every game seems like
the last one played. Each Sunday teams treat the 49ers the same way
and it doesn't matter anymore even if one of those teams is New
Orleans, the team that has played so poorly over the years its fans
were the first to put a paper bag over their heads to hide their
shame. It is wearing apparel, one might think, that just might
catch on quite soon in San Francisco.

more,'' Davis said. ``We now have the technology where we can
easily imagine leaving behind much of what we think of as human
life. But at same time, we're realizing we have ways of relating in
our past that have actually been some really good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Expect your entire house to be wired and smart, something that's
being vigorously promoted by sages such as Michael Dertouzos, the
head of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachussetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Besides your refrigerator, you can hook up your security system,
heating controls, entertainment system and more to your computer
and let them do the grunt work for you. Speaking of smart, that dog
of yours will literally have its eyes light up, if it's like the
AIBO robot dogs Sony has been selling recently (at an eye-popping
rate, despite a $2,500 price tag).
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, Dertouzos said, half a billion
human-operated machines and countless computers in appliances,
sensors, controllers and the like will be interconnected. The
result will be some very smart trash cans, toilets and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have already begun to make our shopping life easier,
however haphazardly. Sometimes those intelligent agents are little
pieces of software that you commission to go out on the Internet
and find good deals for you.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents, for instance, will compare prices for, say, a
DVD player sold at various online sites, then tell you which site
has the best price. Entire volumes, such as ``The Bot Book,''
detail the hundreds of shopping and other agents you already use.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``suggestion software'' at shopping sites such
as Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Once you buy something from Amazon, the software will compare
your purchase history with those of other people who bought the
same books or music or videos. The next time you visit there, the
software will suggest you try other books or music or videos bought
by those people who share your purchase history.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the same nature happens with some online and
telephone-based pharmacy companies, which use sophisticated
software to note your medical history and drug requirements.
</P>
<P>
   When you dial in, the software automatically pulls up your
account, showing the person handling your order your medical and
purchasing history, status of prescriptions and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes, moving forward and back simultaneously, are also
afoot. That morning newspaper you read (maybe even this one) won't
come on newsprint someday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, this paper and others are available on the Internet
(www.dailynews.com) and an increasing number of people say they
prefer to get their news through that medium, despite the current
annoyances of reading online on poor-resolution monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait. Soon enough, you'll have more portable and powerful
alternatives, some of which are already hitting the market, such as
the electronic devices now being sold by Rocket Books and its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility being readied for market is electronic
``paper.'' The paper uses electric current to flip tiny half-black,
half-white balls of ``digital ink'' embedded in the page. The ink
creates a very high-resolution page that can be endlessly updated
and changed. No more stacks of newsprint waiting for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Reading, in general, has made a comeback, thanks to the Net,
though researchers at Sun Microsystems and elsewhere have found
that we read in very different ways, hopscotching through
information from link to link.
</P>
<P>
   Reading shorter bites of information, with bullet items, many
crosslinks and other organizing options, makes for a much more
intensely read Web page compared to one written in the style we're
used to seeing on the printed page, the researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
   Back, too, is writing, thanks to e-mail. In the past year, for
the first time, we sent more e-mail than snail mail, as techsters
refer to sending a note through the U.S. Postal Service. That trend
will only increase in geometric proportions as the network of
people who have access to e-mail expands.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happening. Most wired people likely would say they
send more notes to friends, lovers, family and others with e-mail
than they ever used to when their main option was taking pen to
paper, then finding envelope, stamp and mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing of e-mail is a healthy thing,'' said Bart Kosko,
author of the just-released ``Fuzzy Future.'' ``People do
communicate with more people than they ever did before. You can hit
so many more people with e-mail.'' But this welcome renaissance for
reading and writing may be short-lived, and Kosko blames, yes,
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the e-mail revolution will last,'' said Kosko,
an information scientist at the University of Southern California.
``There will be (voice-activated controls) in and out, and then
you'll see the end of writing again, especially when there are
(computerized intelligent) agents to clean it up. It creates what I
call a moral hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosko isn't the only one issuing a cautionary note about our
technological future. As attractive as the past is to some people,
the reality is that it it was fraught with its own problems _
disease, war, famine. Despite rosy scenarios, future technology is
as likely to create as many problems as it solves.
</P>
<P>
   We are already yearning for things we have lost. Davis points to
the cultural scavenging of current youth culture, which ransacks
everything from medieval vampire/Gothic culture to the polyester
hippies of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of focusing our creative energy rather than
spiralling into a dystopian future,'' Davis said. ``We're at a
point where people are starting to realize some of the things we've
lost in our rush for this new technology. I do sense a return
toward the re-embedding of technology in the body of the world and
of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is truly back to the future. &QL;

CONGRESS WILL LEAVE INTERNET WINE SALES FOR ANOTHER YEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress will apparently adjourn for the year
without advancing a crackdown on Internet alcohol sales, leaving
the issue on the shelf until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But both the wine industry and liquor wholesalers, while
disagreeing on what they want in a final measure, agree
congressional action is likely next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel like we are losing any momentum here,'' said
David Dickerson, spokesman for the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of
America, a main advocate of clamping down on direct-to-consumer
sales. ``We feel like the congressional support is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers won an initial victory last May when the Senate
overwhelmingly adopted a provision that would allow states to use
federal courts to pursue out-of-state shippers who illegally send
alcohol into a state. Wholesalers argued the boom in Internet
shopping had spurred a rash of illegal shipments straight to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate proposal, offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., was
added to a contentious juvenile justice measure. That bill got
bogged down in disputes over gun control, preventing the Senate
liquor sales bill from being reconciled with a House version more
acceptable to the wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, thoroughly aired both in committee and on the
floor, grants federal court jurisdiction but prevents the law from
being used in the interest of ``mere economic protectionism.'' The
wine industry believes that language could help them in future
court fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a bill we can live with,'' said Simon Siegl, head of
the American Vinters Association.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers lobby is opposed to the interstate commerce
language. Siegl and others representing the wine industry believe
they are in a better position to prevail if the Senate takes up the
House bill or holds a Judiciary Committee ``markup'' on separate
legislation, particularly since Silicon Valley has weighed in
behind the House version.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House bill is not too bad,'' said Bobby Koch, chief
lobbyist for the Wine Institute. ``Further improvements can be made
on the Senate side.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintners believes the Internet presents a future growth
opportunity for them, particularly for smaller wineries which don't
have sufficient production to interest large wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   When the juvenile justice measure stalled, legislative allies of
the wine industry took precautions to prevent the Byrd provision
from being quietly tacked on to any of the remaining spending
measures moving through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This provision is extremely harmful to our nation's family
wineries as well as to consumers who are unable to purchase wine
through the wholesale-distributor network,'' wrote Rep. Mike
Thompson, D-Calif., in a letter urging President Clinton to veto
any measure containing the Byrd bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important, it is inextricably linked to larger issues
related to e-commerce and requires a context other than the
Juvenile Justice or an Appropriations bill,'' said Thompson, who
represents a prime grape-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry believes its hand is strengthened as the fight
is prolonged and lawmakers learn more about the Prohibition-era
liquor distribution system that remains in existence .
</P>
<P>
   ``As each month clicks off and this issue remains unresolved, if
you are the wholesalers, you probably begin to wonder if this is a
smart effort,'' said Koch.
</P>
<P>
   But the wholesalers remain secure of their strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just like the old adage, we didn't lose the game, we
just ran out of time,'' said Dickerson. ``Luckily, we are going to
have another inning.''

 &HT;    Georgia firefighters get help for 'man-caused' blazes
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Major wildfires that have burned more than 1,400 acres
in northeast Georgia's ruggedly beautiful Blood Mountain Wilderness
Area were ``man-caused,'' an official with the U. S. Forest Service
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether the fires were set accidentally or
deliberately,'' said Dennis Daniel, district ranger with the Forest
Service in Blairsville, Ga. ``It could have been somebody smoking
out game or campers careless with fires or cigarettes. But there
has been no lightning that could have caused them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten more 20-person firefighting teams from as far away as Puerto
Rico and California, including two specially-trained ``Hot Shot''
crews, began arriving Monday to assist the 40 firefighters who
battled the blaze over the weekend, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Three fires started at about the same time Saturday afternoon in
the 7,800-acre Wilderness Area, which sprawls across Georgia's
Lumpkin-Union county line. Two fires, which have since merged,
started within half a mile of each other and a third started about
a mile away, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, fire engulfed a stretch of one of the state's
most popular hiking areas on Blood Mountain, which, at 4,450 feet,
is Georgia's highest point on the Appalachian Trail. The fires
forced officials to close a stretch of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so beautiful up there and now all of that's burning,''
said George Case, who owns Blood Mountain Cabins and Country Store
on Georgia Highway 19-129 between the small mountain communities of
Turner's Corner and Choestoe. Case said his property and five homes
across the highway were in no immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can see the smoke and the fire's moving this way,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters with the state Department of Natural Resources, the
Georgia Forestry Service and county firefighters were stationed
near private properties closest to the fires, including the
Walasi-Yi Center, a backpacking store and hiker hostel where the
Appalachian Trail crosses Georgia 19-129, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to box up our stock,'' said Dorothy Hansen,
co-owner of the center. ``The fire has crested Blood Mountain and
is coming toward us. The firefighters tell us they're trying to
stop it before it gets to the highway, which is really their last
line of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   One fire burned to within half a mile of about 40
privately-owned homes in the Wilderness Area near Lake Winfield
Scott and heavy smoke was affecting residents of Turner's Gap
farther south, Daniel said. Homes in the Miller's Gap community
could be at risk if the fire changes course or spreads, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fires are in federally-designated wilderness, strict
regulations ban the use of motorized firefighting equipment such as
bulldozers or backhoes. The Forest Service received permission to
use leaf blowers to keep burning leaves under control and chain
saws to protect private property. Helicopters are dumping water on
the blaze and dropping supplies to firefighters who must walk,
carrying their equipment, to remote areas where the fire is
burning.
</P>
<P>
   Strong northwest winds and dry forest conditions are hindering
firefighting efforts, Daniel said. Although drought conditions in
the area are not severe, northeast Georgia's rainfall total for the
year is more than 2 inches below normal.
</P>
<P>
   The ruggedness of the Wilderness Area also makes firefighting
difficult, Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all steep, rocky and bluffy out there,'' he said.

23-4 MARTINEZ EXPECTED TO REAP SECOND CY YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Only a handful of pitchers in baseball history have won
the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards in the same season,
and the last starting pitcher to do so was Boston's Roger Clemens
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   It could very well happen to another Red Sox starting pitcher
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, who won the National League Cy Young award in
1997, will add the AL bookend Tuesday when the announcement is made
by the Baseball Writers Association of America. He will be the
third man to win Cy Youngs in both leagues; Gaylord Perry was the
first, and Randy Johnson became the second Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who went 23-4 in 29 starts, is a shoo-in for the
pitching honor; the suspense will come in two days, when the AL MVP
is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the man for whom the award is named, had only two
200-strikeouts seasons in his glorious career (200 exactly in 1904
and 210 in 1905). Martinez is working on four straight _ 222, 305,
251, and 313.
</P>
<P>
   In leading the Sox to the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for
the first time since 1915-16, Martinez has won acclaim for bringing
back the electricity to Fenway Park. Clemens was worth the price of
admission every time he pitched in his '80s heyday. Likewise, all
eyes are on Martinez, sometimes even if he's just sitting in the
dugout. His excellence under immense pressure is much appreciated
by the Fenway Faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Martinez is personally responsible for a large
rise in attendance among Hispanic fans, who haven't come to Fenway
in such numbers since the days of Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, himself an award winner as the AL Manager of the
Year, saw NL Cy Young winners Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John
Smoltz up close in his days as a coach with the Braves. Williams
said of Martinez, ``I've never seen a ballpark come to life like it
does when this kid pitches. It's so good to see. Just the
excitement and electricity he creates.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is a team man, and Williams appreciates that more than
anyone. During the season, the manager scratched Martinez from a
start because he arrived late to the park. Some feel that was the
turning point of the season for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship is one of respect,'' said Williams. ``He's a
very intelligent young man. He loves to play the game. He's a
tremendous asset to our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``His leadership is exemplified when he takes the ball. And we
learned to build on that. Maybe the individual who pitches the day
before him or the one who pitched the day after benefits. He has
been so successful for our team that it makes our pitching staff
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's the best? Clemens, Martinez, or Maddux?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't compare pitchers,'' said Williams. ``But considering
the innings, strikeouts, and magnitude of the games, I don't think
I saw a pitcher have a year like Pedro Martinez did.''

POLL SHOWS HUGE UNDECIDED VOTE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, viewed as a competent leader
who can keep the economy humming, leads challenger Tom Ammiano,
seen as a champion of the little guy who understands voters'
everyday concerns, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-Channel 2 found
that 43 percent of those surveyed would vote for Brown and 33
percent would back Ammiano if the election were held now.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, both Democrats, face a Dec. 14 run-off election.
They were the top vote-getters in the Nov. 2 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that 24 percent of the voters surveyed had not
made up their minds with a month left before the Dec. 14 election.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown had an edge in the poll, more people have a positive
impression of Ammiano, a two-term member of the governing Board of
Supervisors who now serves as its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they personally like Tom Ammiano more than Mayor Brown,
but they don't necessarily like him more than Brown to be mayor,''
said pollster Del Ali, who heads Research 2000 of Rockville, Md.,
and conducted the poll for the Examiner and KTVU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of those surveyed rated Ammiano favorably
compared with 30 percent who gave him an unfavorable rating. As for
Brown, he was viewed favorably by 36 percent of those polled and
unfavorably by 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said in the issues that usually decide elections _
leadership, the economy and jobs _ ``Brown comes out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that people think Ammiano is honest and will
fight hard for the disadvantaged, but they are most concerned that
he would not accomplish things if he is elected mayor and that he
would have a hard time working with others at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ali predicted a vigorous campaign ahead that could be won
by Ammiano, whose unprecedented, last-minute write-in campaign
landed him in second place in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone poll, conducted this past Nov. 9-11,
surveyed 627 registered voters in San Francisco. It has a margin
for error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll painted a revealing portrait of how voters see the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the poll found, is most capable of encouraging economic
development in the city, and far outshines Ammiano in protecting
and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano got high marks when voters were asked who best
understands the issues affecting the city's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Brown largely has the support of corporate San Francisco in his
re-election bid, has been a pro-development mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has pumped millions of extra dollars into the
city's budget. That has allowed Brown to provide pay increases to
city workers and expand services _ more money for parks, bus
service, child care, street cleaning _ all without raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the growth in San Francisco has resulted in more
traffic congestion and skyrocketing housing prices. Brown has vowed
to tackle both problems if he is re-elected to another four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has been criticized by big business in San Francisco for
his suggestions to impose a city income tax on the rich, a tax on
stock transfers and to make businesses pay more for public transit
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He also has pushed hard for a minimum wage law in San Francisco
that would boost salaries to $11 an hour plus benefits for
thousands of low-paid workers whose employers hold contracts with
the city or lease city-owned property.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano contends that higher wages and better benefits would
generate more spending power and also ease the burden on social
services and health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also supports a living wage law, but said Ammiano's plan
goes too far and could bankrupt the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who is seen as even more liberal than Brown, hopes to
court the conservative vote by focusing on his good-government and
anti-corruption positions.
</P>
<P>
   Voters view Brown as far more moderate than Ammiano, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 53 percent of the people thought Ammiano
would do a better job of instilling honesty and integrity at City
Hall. Just 33 percent believe Brown would do that.

   VASTOGIRARDI, Italy _ At the Bar Sport, the cafe that serves as
this village's bachelor clubhouse, a government notice promising
financial aid to families with children is posted on the wall _
more as an inside joke than as a community news bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Di Benedetto, 40, the unmarried cafe owner, nudged Orazio
Izzi, 46, a regular, and said: ``What about him? He's been engaged
to the same woman for 22 years.'' Both men are confirmed bachelors,
and they are targets of the new mayor's war on singles.
</P>
<P>
   Aghast by the number of adult men and women who show no desire
to marry or have children _ 50 men and 20 women in a village of 823
people _ Mayor Vincenzo Venditti has threatened to levy a tax on
unmarried people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real problem, a serious problem,'' he said earnestly
as a group of single men grinned sheepishly behind him. ``We risk
losing everything, our culture, our traditions, our schools. It is
useless to ask for economic investment if we cannot keep our
village alive to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vastogirardi, a small village in the hills of Molise, a region
in southern Italy, is in many ways typical of rural areas
throughout Europe, where migration from small towns and falling
birthrates are producing a devastating demographic shift. The
population of Vastogirardi, known for its delicate hand-made
cheeses, has shrunk by two-thirds in the last 30 years as younger
people defected to better jobs and bigger towns. The only bank
closed down years ago, there is no movie theater, two of four
churches have closed, and the local priest commutes from a town 12
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far this year I have performed only two weddings, and six
funerals,'' said the priest, Father Erasmo. ``Nobody seems to
idealize the family anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only one baby was born in Vastogirardi.
</P>
<P>
   Birthrates are low all over Western Europe, but Italy and Spain,
Roman Catholic countries, have the lowest of all: an average of 1.2
children per woman, slightly lower than in Greece and considerably
lower than the rate of 2.1. in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are objective reasons why Italy's birthrate is so low:
State aid to families with children is lower in Italy than in
France or Germany. There are also cultural differences; studies
show that in Italy women who work outside the home still bear the
brunt of domestic chores.
</P>
<P>
   Marzio Barbagli, a sociologist at the University of Bologna,
explained that Italian men had not yet adjusted their expectations
to accommodate working wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If women work at the office and also do everything in the
home, something has to give, and that tends to be a second child,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But sociologists are puzzled by a phenomenon that in Italy seems
to unite two clashing impulses: a new generation's yearning for
sexual freedom, and financial independence, mixed with an atavistic
reliance on parents for housing, food and doting companionship.
Scholars have written entire books on ``mammoni,'' Italian sons who
are so dependent on their mothers for care and pampering that they
never leave home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is my fault,'' Ada Marracino, 70, said as she readied
lunch for her husband and two children, a son and daughter who are
both in their mid-40s, unmarried and living at home. ``These
children just don't count the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Alfredo, smiled sadly. ``It used to be the kids who
would look after the old people,'' he said. ``Around here, it is
the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Vincenza, 43, is the village pharmacist. She
studied in Rome, then decided to return to her village 16 years
ago, where the family lives in a narrow apartment inside a
crumbling 1,000-year-old fortified stone hamlet above the village.
Now, only one other family lives there year-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resented the way big cities eat up your time,'' she
explained. ``Here, I have time even to be bored.'' She said she
felt no social or family pressure to wed. ``I don't feel I have to
get married, just to be married,'' she said firmly, adding,
``Though lately, I have been thinking more about having children
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in social mores throughout the West are felt even in
remote Vastogirardi. There is little stigma left to premarital sex,
or spinsterhood, though divorce is still considered mildly
scandalous. The mayor would be delighted if some women chose single
motherhood, but few have.
</P>
<P>
   The disproportion between single men and single women, moreover,
is attributed to the environment. Numbingly boring for many women,
Vastogirardi is in many ways a bachelor's paradise: it offers
hunting, fishing, a soccer field, wine-making and a clubby local
cafe. Some of the same married men who lecture their single friends
on the need to settle down, at times sound ready to trade places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be free to stay out late, play music with my
friends and go hunting,'' Filippo D'Aloiso, a city council member,
said wistfully as he sat in the dining room of Izzi's camping
ground, sampling the home-made pasta, made by the mother of another
local bachelor. ``But I have a child. I have to make sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   Venditti figures that unless something dramatic is done to
increase birthrates quickly, the village nursery school will have
to close down. To give locals work, he wants to start a cooperative
dairy and export local cheeses. ``The town can provide the cows and
the fields,'' he said, ``but I cannot produce the babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are not enough children to fill the elementary
school: first and third grades are taught together, as are fourth
and fifth graders.
</P>
<P>
   There is no middle or high school. Venditti, who actually lives
in Isernia, a town 21 miles away, so his teen-age children will not
have to take a bus to school, concedes that his tax on singles will
probably be ruled unconstitutional, but he said he had to serve
notice to the town, and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are 20 years too late,'' Stella Scocchera, scolded him
furiously. Mrs. Scocchera, who has taught kindergarten since 1976,
is convinced that she will be out of a job within two years. She
blames local residents who have taken the easy route and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at the last kindergarten class of
Vastogirardi,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if some of these oafs do get married,'' she added,
pulling at Izzi's sleeve. ``They will never have enough children to
make up a real kindergarten. You can't do a ring-around-the-roses
with only two kids.''

   OVERTIME-POLICE (Los Angeles) -- After six years fighting its
biggest lawsuit ever, Los Angeles city officials are nearing an
agreement to pay police officers a record $40 million to settle an
overtime dispute stemming from the riots. Facing prospects of Y2K
trouble and the Democractic Convention next August, city officials
are preparing to settle the federal lawsuit that claims the city
paid officers months late for overtime earned during the 1992
riots. It also claims officers often are given compensatory time
off instead of overtime pay, but are not allowed to use it in a
timely manner. By Dominic Berbeo. (Will move on the ``n''

MOUNTAINTOP REMOVAL FIGHT GOES FROM COURTS TO HALLS OF CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROMAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Environmentalists scored a major victory last month
when a federal judge found that West Virginia coal companies were
violating federal law by filling streams with mine waste.
</P>
<P>
   That victory may be short-lived if some members of Congress get
their way.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from West Virginia and Idaho have been working hard to
have a provision included in the final federal budget to continue
allowing mountaintop removal, a practice blamed for polluting
streams and damaging wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The group, headed by Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, says that if the court's ruling is not reversed,
thousands of mine workers could lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court ruling is wrong-headed. It jeopardizes your jobs. It
jeopardizes your hometowns. Your futures have been put on the
line,'' Byrd told mine workers last week at a rally on the Capitol
steps.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue is the disposal of valley fill _ rock, soil and
trees blasted off mountaintops to expose deposits of coal for
miners to extract. Industry advocates say West Virginia's landscape
is so mountainous that mine operators have no choice but to dump
the rubble into stream-laced valleys and hollows.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say operators need to find new ways to get rid
of the waste, such as filling abandoned underground shafts.
Mountaintop removal, they say, causes too much damage.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute illustrates the tension between concerns for the
environment and the need for jobs, a fight in which state and
federal regulators so far have sided with miners.
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that it only wants to continue a practice
permitted for years by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency and
Army Corps of Engineers. All three agencies must grant various
permits for mine operators to fill streams with mine rubble.
</P>
<P>
   In general, regulators have relaxed standards as mountaintop
removal has become a more common method of strip-mining, said
Stephen Brown, a history professor at the West Virginia University
Institute of Technology. ``When these laws were enacted, the
current ... techniques used to mine (coal) hadn't been
envisioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress toughened anti-pollution laws 22 years ago, the
number of miles of West Virginia streams mine operators have been
allowed to fill each year has tripled. An analysis of state records
by the The Sunday Gazette-Mail, a Charleston paper, found permits
to fill 71 miles of streams in 1997, up from 20 miles in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after environmentalists filed the lawsuit in 1998
seeking to ban mountaintop removal, the EPA and Corps of Engineers
tightened their restrictions but continued issuing permits to mine
operators.
</P>
<P>
   What Byrd and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, along with House
members from West Virginia, want is to void a ruling by U.S.
District Judge Charles Haden so that regulators can once again sign
off on valley fills.
</P>
<P>
   When Haden last month ordered the industry to comply with the
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Clean Water Act,
Byrd and others began painting doomsday scenarios for West
Virginia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Haden then put his order on hold until the case is heard in an
appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entire economy is at risk here,'' said Chris Hamilton, vice
president of the West Virginia Coal Association. ``We're talking
about the loss of 50,000 jobs. From that economic picture you can
see what devastation (this ruling) might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalist say predictions like Hamilton's are
exaggerating the impact mining has on the state's economy, which
ranks as one of the poorest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They worry the industry scare tactics will give Byrd the
momentum he needs to move his proposal through Congress and onto
President Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which initially supported Byrd's
proposal, backed away two weeks ago after Haden granted a stay on
his order. The White House now opposes the senator's effort to
overturn the ruling by tacking a rider onto a spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a number of anti-environmental riders that remain
(unresolved).
</P>
<P>
   We have made it very clear that they're unacceptable,'' said
presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's ``suggestion of finding a way to legislate what the court
is doing now is something that we don't support,'' Lockhart said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, is
a Clinton ally who defended him during the impeachment trial early
this year. This is the sort of alliance the industry hopes will pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   If Byrd gets his way, environmentalists say Clinton and the West
Virginia delegation will send the wrong message to industry across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this rider were to make it through, our congressional
delegation would be viewed as writing the book on how to circumvent
environmental legislation,'' said Rick Eades, a hydrogeologist for
Citizens Action Group of West Virginia.

LOBBYING BUSINESS IS GOING GLOBAL

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When lobbying became a serious profession a few
decades ago, the ground rules were pretty basic. About two dozen
members of Congress decreed the way most issues were decided, and
an effective lobbyist had to cultivate a personal relationship with
at least one of them to have any real influence.
</P>
<P>
   But now lobbying has turned into a well-ordered global business,
with the influence game taking on a decidedly corporate look.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the rest of the government changed in myriad ways
in a quarter-century, and the transformation has only accelerated
with the more recent explosion of information and technology. The
capital's government affairs and public-relations businesses are
changing, too, suddenly engaging in a flurry of consolidations and
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of megafirms are being born, offering clients a full
buffet of services under one roof _ everything from public
relations, traditional lobbying, research, polling and direct-mail
canvassing to specialists who deal with drumming up grass-roots
support for issues.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most significant acquisition came this month,
when Shandwick USA bought Cassidy Cos., one of Washington's largest
and most successful public-affairs groups. The acquisition, which
was valued at $70 million to $80 million, instantly gives Shandwick
a big presence in Washington, where it was virtually unknown only a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This and the other giant firms being created have a foothold not
just in Washington, but in London and Brussels, Belgium, and
elsewhere, reflecting the new global character of regulation and
legislation, especially in the area of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on is akin to an arms race, with everyone trying
to beef up their arsenals,'' said Anthony Podesta _ the brother of
White House chief of staff John Podesta _ who is the chairman of
podesta.com, a medium-sized lobbying firm that specializes in
high-technology clients and is being eagerly courted by some larger
firms. ``The trend toward consolidation is a very strong one, as
public relations and advertising have come to realize the benefits
of adding a government relations component.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acquisitions have already been made and others are in the
works in what is colloquially known here as ``K Street,'' a
designation that connotes the whole industry of public affairs in
much the same way that ``Wall Street'' is shorthand for the
financial trade.
</P>
<P>
   Shandwick, strictly a public-relations company, is, in turn,
owned by the Interpublic Group, a huge New York-based advertising
company.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic, along with two other global advertising companies,
the WPP Group and the Omnicom Group, now constitute the three
giants offering one-stop shopping in Washington for corporations
and interest groups seeking coordinated lobbying and public
relations campaigns. Omnicom and WPP have been steadily making
acquisitions and are said to be seeking more.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy's founder, Gerald Cassidy, a Washington lobbyist for
more than 20 years, has seen changes both sudden and gradual. In
the early days, the barons of lobbying were people like Thomas
Corcoran, a New Deal-era adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and
Clark Clifford, who began as an aide to Harry Truman and went on to
serve as defense secretary in the Johnson administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system revolved around 25 people who had the power
to get things done,'' Cassidy said in an interview in his office _
not on K Street but three blocks south on 13th Street, near the
White House. ``You had to know those people and establish your
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974, in the wake of Watergate, the caste-ridden
seniority system was scrapped in response to the demands of the
flood of newly elected reformers in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was suddenly a diffusion of power,'' Cassidy said. ``The
power moved away from the chairmen. At the same time, more issues
were being decided in Washington, and that was accompanied by an
explosion of staff here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election in recent years of increasing numbers of
legislators who vowed fierce resistance to the Washington culture,
public affairs professionals learned that they could influence
lawmakers more effectively by whipping up sentiment beyond the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Public affairs and lobbying began to merge in campaigns in
lawmakers' home districts _ campaigns that mobilized prominent
citizens, editorial writers or simply those affected economically
to weigh in on an issue.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Cassidy recalled a campaign his company waged
beginning in 1992 to keep the proposed Sea Wolf class of nuclear
attack submarine alive. After President Bush canceled the project,
Cassidy was hired by the manufacturer, General Dynamics, whose
Electric Boat Division made the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to change the debate,'' he said. ``At one point we
identified every single supplier from around the country and
brought them all to Washington for a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Those suppliers were then sent directly to their members of
Congress, not the committees that dealt with military
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassidy company also sought support from unions and oversaw
letter-writing campaigns, paid retired admirals to speak in local
districts and arranged meetings with as many editorial boards as
were willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The first tangible result was that Bill Clinton, then a
presidential candidate, came out in favor of the Seawolf. The
project was saved and is still alive, in spite of periodic raids by
congressional budget-cutters who argue that it is superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cassidy was ranked first among Washington lobbying
and public-relations firms in the amount of business it does,
edging out the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP;
Hand. Verner Liipfert is one of a handful of firms that specialize
in lobbying and constitute the other major wing of this business.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big ones are Patton, Boggs, whose partners include the
well-known lobbyist Thomas Boggs, and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP;
Feld, home to Robert Strauss, the former Democratic National
Committee chairman, and Vernon Jordan, former head of the Urban
League and prominent presidential friend.

DEGRAAN AN EXECUTIVE VP, HEIGHTENING GILLETTE SUCCESSON RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Edward F. DeGraan has been appointed to a new post at
Gillette Co., its board of directors confirmed Monday, a move that
makes him the apparent front-runner in the race to eventually
succeed Michael C. Hawley, 61, Gillette's chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston razor giant declined to comment on the issue of
succession, and the 56-year-old DeGraan, who joined Gillette in
1968, will continue as executive vice president, one of four men
who hold that title.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's global business environment, the issue of
succession has become more crucial than ever. While Gillette has
often looked inside to promote executives, an ever-changing
marketplace and higher turnover at the top make it important for
corporations to have succession plans in place.
</P>
<P>
   The new duties that DeGraan is set to assume Jan. 1 could
seemingly make him the second most powerful individual in the
company after Hawley, who rose to the top jobs seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that when Gillette's board eventually
decides on Hawley's successor, it will likely choose from among the
company's four executive vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gillette has a world-class management team,'' said company
spokesman Eric A. Kraus Monday. ``The board of directors is
continuously evaluating management succession, and there are a
number of internal candidates with outstanding qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, DeGraan will be responsible for managing all of
Gillette's product lines and all new product development.
</P>
<P>
   ``By placing management of all the company's product lines under
a single reporting structure, we can take even greater advantage of
the synergies inherent in the development, manufacture, and
strategic development of our products,'' Hawley said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, DeGraan supervises Gillette's grooming and
Duracell battery lines, which accounted for about two-thirds of
Gillette's overall 1998 sales of $10.06 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Executive vice president Archie Livis, who now manages Braun,
Oral-B, and stationery products lines, is also set to take on a new
assignment Jan. 1, developing strategic growth initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   At the Harvard Business School, associate professor Michael
Watkins studies succession at large companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making sure you're grooming multiple candidates and keeping
some ambiguity until very late in the game'' are often the keys to
making the right choice for a chief executive, said Watkins, a
co-author of a recent Harvard Business Review article titled ``The
Successor's Dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguity is needed so potential candidates can be tested and
groomed almost until the last minute, Watkins said. Ensuring that
succession works may be one of the most important jobs a board of
directors and chief executive must face, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, when Livis' current duties will be added to
DeGraan's, one of the strategic initiatives Livis may pursue is
what Gillette should do with some of its underperforming Braun and
stationery divisions, which are made up of such brands as Paper
Mate, Parker, and Waterman pens.
</P>
<P>
   For the most of the 1990s, Gillette turned in robust sales and
profit gains. But in the last two years, Gillette has faced two
issues: economic and currency problems in some of its overseas
markets, and the drag that the Braun and stationery divisions has
placed on its strong razor, grooming, oral care, and Duracell
battery businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As Gillette has grappled with these problems, the value of its
stock has plummeted. On the New York Stock Exchange Monday,
Gillette shares fell 3/8 to close at 35 1/16, far below a 52-week
high of 64 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Gillette's core products for hair removal, oral
care, and portable power represent nearly 90 percent of company
profits, Hawley suggested recently that Gillette will consider
selling or discontinuing any lagging category or product line.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it likely Gillette could exit the stationery business
and some Braun household appliance lines, such as coffee makers and
toasters.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for Braun's electric shavers and toothbrushes have been
much stronger, and Gillette would likely hang on to those lines.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to move to the next level and put problems behind it,
Gillette announced a sweeping reorganization 14 months ago. Part of
that plan included cutting Gillette's work force by 11 percent over
a 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gillette's management team was realigned into two
distinct functions: global business management and commercial
operations. Each of those functions was headed by two executive
vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   DeGraan and Livis were put in charge of manufacturing and
product development. On the commercial operations side, Robert G.
King, 54, was given responsibilities for the Western Hemishpere and
Jorgen Wedel, 51, for the Eastern Hemisphere. Neither King's nor
Wedel's duties are expected to change as a result of DeGraan's and
Livis' new assignments.
</P>
<P>
   While Gillette declined to comment about succession, having a
designated successor can be vital for a company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Gillette chairman and chief executive Colman M. Mockler
died suddenly at 61, only weeks after Alfred M. Zeien had been
chosen as president. Gillette's board appointed Zeien to the top
job a short time later, and Zeien held the titles of chairman and
chief executive until he retired this past spring.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Hawley was appointed president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's title has remained vacant since Hawley assumed
the top jobs in April, and spokesman Kraus said Gillette has ``no
plan at this time to name a president.'' In the last decade, the
title of president has been occupied only about half the time,
Kraus added.
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Hawley would seemingly be in no hurry to retire. That
would give him and the board some time to deal with succession.
</P>
<P>
   And it is possible that Hawley could stay on after his 65th
birthday, as Zeien did.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's board approved several incentive packages to induce
Zeien to delay his retirment. Zeien was 69 when he retired earlier
this year.

   Corporations and interest groups that use such law firms find
they usually have to assemble a team of other agencies to handle
public relations, polling and the like.

   It is a matter of debate whether that is better or worse than
the all-under-one-roof approach. But Verner Liipfert, with
high-profile partners like the former senators Bob Dole and George
Mitchell, led the successful campaign to persuade Congress to block
federal anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Cassidy, Shandwick gets a collection of companies
that billed more than $40 million in 1998, as well as a group of
prominent political figures, including Jody Powell, President Jimmy
Carter's press secretary, and Michael Boland, a former aide to the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   It was once customary for Democrats and Republicans to lobby
separately, but that custom first broke down when Ronald Reagan was
elected while the House was still ruled by Democrats. It has pretty
much vanished with the advent of a Republican Congress and a
Democratic White House. The Cassidy group, carefully cultivating
its bipartisan influence, has become a model for other Washington
firms that combine prominent Democrats and Republicans under one
roof.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella of Cassidy companies includes the Cassidy lobbying
operation; Boland &AMP; Madigan, another lobbying firm; Powell Tate, a
public-relations firm; Frederick Schneiders Research, which offers
opinion and polling services; and Bork &AMP; Associates, which does
law-related public relations.
</P>
<P>
   While Interpublic is now an instant Washington presence, Cassidy
is suddenly connected with a company that has offices in 52
countries. The newest development in the lobbying field, experts
say, is the expansion of the European Union's effect on issues.
</P>
<P>
   To Howard Paster, the Shandwick-Cassidy merger is only the
latest round in a trend that began a decade ago, when Hill &AMP;
Knowlton gobbled up the lobbying firm Gray &AMP; Co. Paster, a former
head of congressional liaison for the Clinton administration, now
heads Hill &AMP; Knowlton, the second-largest public relations firm
both in the United States and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hill &AMP; Knowlton is owned by WPP, which also owns the advertising
giants Ogilvy &AMP; Mather and J. Walter Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hill &AMP; Knowlton acquired the Wexler Group, a lobbying
firm with a Democratic heritage, a year after it took over Timmons
&AMP; Co., a Republican-oriented lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom has acquired such Washington public relations outfits as
Fleishman-Hilliard and Porter Novelli and Ketchum PR. Omnicom is
looking to bolster its lobbying capabilities through acquisitions,
industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to podesta.com, another firm being sought for
acquisition in Washington is Barbour, Griffith &AMP; Rogers, a
Republican lobbying firm headed by Haley Barbour, the former head
of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paster, who spent several years trying to sway Congress as the
chief lobbyist in the Clinton administration, said that ``while
having real smart Washington people still helps greatly, it's
important to understand how changes have driven influence away from
the center.'' Lawmakers are moved, he said, by plausible coalitions
put together by professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kamber, head of the Kamber Group, which has special
expertise in labor-related issues, said the future probably means
more and more mergers. Companies have to grow to please their
stockholders, he said, and ``realistically what's happened is that
the easiest way to grow is acquire someone with clients _ it's much
faster than building up new clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamber said that in the current atmosphere of mergers, he
constantly asks himself if he can thrive as an independent or
merely survive, which means he would be looking to merge his
50-person firm with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the answer is really unclear to me,'' he said.

STUDY SHOWS BENEFIT OF SUPPLEMENT TO ARTHRITIS SUFFERERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A dietary supplement made from crab, lobster, and
shrimp shells protects arthritic joints against deterioration,
according to a three-year European study discussed Monday at a
major rheumatology meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The study marks one of the first times that a large, rigorous
human study has verified the effectiveness of an ``alternative''
therapy that has developed a wide following through nonscientific,
word-of-mouth recommendations. Health food stores and drug stores
sell the supplement, glucosamine sulfate, for 80 cents to $1.30 per
1,500 &UR;  &LR; milligram dose.
</P>
<P>
   The finding also provides one of the first hints that any
treatment can alter the inexorable course of osteoarthritis. The
joint-destroying malady afflicts at least 21 million Americans and
causes more disability than any disorder except heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Before-and-after X-ray pictures of 212 osteoarthritis patients
showed that 22 percent of those taking a daily 1,500 &UR;  &LR; milligram
glucosamine pill had deterioration in their knee joints, compared
to 38 percent of patients who unknowingly took a placebo, or dummy
pill.
</P>
<P>
   Pain, stiffness, and physical function improved somewhat in the
glucosamine patients over three years, while they worsened in the
placebo group, said Dr. Jean-Yves Reginster of the University of
Liege in Belgium. He will formally present the results Wednesday at
a session of the American College of Rheumatology.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how glucosamine sulfate might prevent the cartilage
that lines and cushions joints from wearing away. One US study
presented Monday suggests one form of glucosamine may block nitrous
oxide, a chemical that breaks down cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   The European study was funded by a manufacturer of glucosamine
sulfate, an Italian firm called Rotta Research Laboratory. But
arthritis experts said its findings were nonetheless credible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study meets the test that alternative-therapy studies
need to meet in order to merit attention,'' said Dr. William J.
Arnold, a Chicago rheumatologist.
</P>
<P>
   The Arthritis Foundation, a nonprofit research and service
group, said the study suggests that glucosamine sulfate ``relieves
symptoms and helps to prevent damage to joint cartilage'' in
osteoarthritis patients. The supplement ``can be considered a
viable option'' along with traditional treatments such as pain
medicines, anti-inflammatory drugs, and exercise, the foundation
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of glucosamine's emerging respectability is that
the National Institutes of Health is about to launch a $6.6 million
arthritis study of glucosamine sulfate and another widely used
dietary supplement, chondroitin sulfate.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of osteoarthritis patients are already taking
glucosamine supplements every day, leading arthritis specialists
say. Some doctors are even taking it themselves to prevent
arthritis, although experts said there is no evidence at all to
suggest that glucosamine can prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence does not indicate that glucosamine is a cure
for arthritis, despite a popular recent book, ``The Arthritis
Cure,'' whose title made that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc C. Hochberg of the University of Maryland said about
half his osteoarthritis patients take glucosamine supplements
because they believe it helps them ``modestly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If patients want to take glucosamine, I say fine,'' Hochberg
said in an interview. ``If they see no effect in 12 weeks, I
recommend they discontinue it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Felson of Boston University Medical School, who also
suggests glucosamine to some osteoarthritis patients, called the
results noteworthy. ``There have been smaller, more obscure studies
on glucosamine that have suggested the same thing, but they have
not been as well-done,'' Felson said.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with glucosamine in this country, specialists said,
is that the substance is considered a nutritional supplement and
not a drug. Thus, the US Food and Drug Administration does not
regulate what is actually in commercial preparations, which may
contain widely varying doses of glucosamine or even none at all, as
well as other adulterants.

 &HT;    FLORIDA, TEXAS PROTECTION FOR DEBTORS IN JEOPARDY AFTER SENATE
VOTE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Florida and Texas would lose their status as havens
for rich debtors, if a new provision for the nation's bankruptcy
laws prevails.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly last week to set a limit of
$100,000 for home equity that would be shielded from creditors in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   If enacted, the measure would override the Florida and Texas
state constitutions. Both have given their residents unlimited
exemptions for their homes for more than a century. Such protection
has given the states a reputation as sanctuaries for wealthy
deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous cases, an Ohio businessman, Marvin Warner, spent
28 months in prison for his dealings in the collapse of an Ohio
savings and loan. Yet he was able to settle on a $2.2 million horse
farm near Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Burt Reynolds was allowed to keep his $1.17 million home
in Hobe
</P>
<P>
   Sound after claiming $10 million in debts in his 1996
bankruptcy. Former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn retired to a
multi-million-dollar home near Jacksonville despite owing millions
when his New York law firm went belly up.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, Texas, millionaire T. Cullen Davis, once a defendant
in two murders at his mansion, was able to avoid paying alimony to
his ex-wife by claiming the homestead exemption in bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bad publicity of such cases, the unlimited
protection for homes has long been considered sacrosanct by its
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the side that (debtors) shouldn't be allowed to delay,
defraud or hinder creditors'' by moving to Florida, Daniel Bakst, a
West Palm Beach, Fla., bankruptcy attorney, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said he opposed changing the state laws for
residents who have bought homes with the understanding that they
would have unlimited protection. The exemption extends to a
half-acre in a city or 160 acres in rural area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the state make those changes,'' he said. Federal courts
could help by tightening rulings on debt avoidance, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the limits would affect only a few homeowners, however.
A U.S. General Accounting Office study of bankruptcies in Florida
and Texas found that 1 percent or less involved equity of $100,000
or more.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the revision still faces major obstacles, including
the opposition of a political odd couple.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, has teamed with
Florida Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, to reverse the vote by their
colleagues. Together they have argued that states, not the federal
government, should set bankruptcy rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws reflect the core values and traditions of our
states,'' said a letter circulated last summer by Hutchison,
Graham, and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, Iowa and South Dakota are the other three states with
unlimited bankruptcy protection for home equity. Other states vary
from offering no exemption to more modest ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``A one-size-fits-all order from Washington is not the right
answer,'' said Hutchison in a column released Monday for Texas
papers.
</P>
<P>
   An aide said that Hutchison would ``do whatever it takes,''
including leading a filibuster, to stop the $100,000 limit if it is
included in the final bill. The measure is part of a major
bankruptcy reform bill that has passed the House, whose version
would allow states to opt out of the homestead limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to attempt to complete its version on
Wednesday. A final House-Senate compromise would then have to be
forged, probably next year.
</P>
<P>
   (trim line)
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to change the law in the Florida state legislature have
consistently failed, despite support from two strong lobbies, the
banks and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a proposal to cap the homestead exemption at $250,000
was
</P>
<P>
   defeated. And two years ago, the Constitution Revision
Commission
</P>
<P>
   considered a $500,000 cap before scrapping the idea altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Florida House voted to allow creditors to collect
when
</P>
<P>
   someone has ``fraudulently'' put money into his or her home
right before
</P>
<P>
   filing for bankruptcy. But the Senate did not take up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be thrilled to see something happen at the
congressional
</P>
<P>
   level,'' said Deborah Lawson, a lobbyist for a coalition of
businesses
</P>
<P>
   who support curbing the exemption. ``It would prohibit these
people who,
</P>
<P>
   in our opinion, thumb their nose at people they owe money to.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes to the homestead exemption have been opposed by Florida
</P>
<P>
   doctors' groups, among others. Rep. Johnnie Byrd, R-Plant City,
the
</P>
<P>
   majority whip in the Florida House of Representatives, said the
</P>
<P>
   unlimited cap should be maintained to protect Florida's large
population
</P>
<P>
   of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd objects to a cap because it must be constantly adjusted,
forcing
</P>
<P>
   Congress to decide the reasonable value for a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I do not like is the federal government doing a one
size
</P>
<P>
   fits all approach to things,'' Byrd said. ``There's certainly
abuses of
</P>
<P>
   anything. Does that mean we want to create more bureaucracy?''
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate bill passes, it would affect Florida homeowners
</P>
<P>
   involved in only bankruptcy. The exemption would still protect
all homes from
</P>
<P>
   other court orders, such as judgments in lawsuits.

ANALYSIS: TRADE DEAL A VICTORY FOR ZHU AND OTHER REFORMERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Though the immediate effects of China's
landmark trade agreement with the United States may be mixed, the
deal is a major victory for Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, an advocate
of reform who has been under fierce fire from conservative
opponents in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to office in March 1998, Zhu promised to shut down
the bulk of China's nonperforming state-run industries within three
years. Those efforts, however, have been stymied, first by
President Clinton's rejection of Chinese trade concessions last
April, then by the wave of nationalism fired by NATO's bombing of
the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Zhu has a new quiver of arrows for his campaign. Once China
enters the World Trade Organization, he and other reformers will be
able to point to international guidelines when challenged by
officials suspicious of openness and market-based competition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade deal fell apart in April, Zhu's influence had
been in decline as he faced criticism that he tried to give too
much away.
</P>
<P>
   Under attack by conservatives led by his predecessor Li Peng,
who is now legislative chief, Zhu offered to resign twice last
spring, political insiders say. Yet President Jiang Zemin, who
political analysts believe uses Zhu as a lightning rod for
criticism, has both assumed more control over reform efforts
himself and protected Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's trade deal is expected to breathe new life into the
reform process. Overall, several economists said, more open trade
will have a broadly beneficial effect on China's economy, even if
it causes greater unemployment as a result of factory closings.
</P>
<P>
   Various sectors of China's economy will be affected differently
by the agreement. The auto and oil sectors will be forced into a
painful restructuring, while apparel and textiles will gain access
to exports. But, economists and political analysts say, the overall
effect of liberalizing trade will inevitably spur long-term
economic growth and benefit reformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unquestionably, it strengthens the hand of Zhu and other
reformers,'' said Qu Hongbin, an economist at the Bank of China
International. ``On the macro-level, this is a major plus for
China.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jiang regards better relations with the United States as
one of his major achievements, Zhu is even more closely identified
with the pro-American sentiment that favors greater openness _ best
characterized by entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Since China's leadership decided 13 years ago that it would seek
membership in the trade body, the issue has been when and on what
terms. With China's economic growth slowing, some conservatives
have argued that a wrenching restructuring might better be put off.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have countered that China badly needs a boost in
foreign investment. Membership in the trade organization would also
give a palpable boost to China's investment environment, which has
soured in recent years as many foreign businessmen grapple with
thorny obstacles to making money here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with Monday's deal, change is not expected to come
overnight. Despite the agreement for the gradual opening of China's
capital markets _ banking and insurance, for instance _ many
obstacles remain in financial services. A major restraint is the
continuing central control on China's currency, the yuan, also
known as the renminbi, or ``people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The yuan cannot be freely traded for dollars or other
international currencies because China's leaders fear their
financial system is not yet strong enough to bear sudden, heavy
inflows or outflows of currency. For banks, that makes doing
business difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we are allowed to make loans in renminbi, we have
first to borrow renminbi from Chinese banks and the spread is too
thin to be profitable,'' said Julia Wang, chief representative for
the National Bank of Canada in Shanghai. ``Obviously, entering WTO
is a step forward, but it is only one step that Chinese banks have
to take.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Chinese officials spoke about the possibility
of making their currency freely convertible by 2000, but after the
Asian financial crisis of 1997 they started saying it would be many
more years away.
</P>
<P>
   For foreign investors already in China, its move toward
membership in the trade body is seen as a mixed blessing. An
executive at General Motors in China said recently that, in his
view, an international company's enthusiasm for China's entry could
probably be measured in inverse proportion to the size of its
investment in China.
</P>
<P>
   The larger the investment, the more negative a foreign business
here is likely to feel about greater competition. General Motors
has invested more than $2 billion in China, a large chunk of it in
an auto-assembly plant in Shanghai that began manufacturing a new
version of the Buick for the China market.
</P>
<P>
   Since the auto sells for about $36,000, it will not be
competitive once steep import duties are reduced. Monday's
agreement calls for the reduction of auto import duties to 25
percent, from 80 percent to 100 percent, by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors with smaller investments to date, however, are
more likely to benefit from the gradual opening of trade barriers.
So will efficient Chinese companies, which generally favor faster
reform and freer trade.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and petrochemical industries may be adversely affected,
though they have already been subject to a certain level of
international competition. Import tariffs have been so high that a
vast business in smuggling oil has blossomed over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the China International Capital Corp.,
an investment bank that is a joint venture between the government
and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, on the effects of possible
membership in the trade body, four major international suppliers
exported 14.9 million tons of light diesel oil to China in 1998.
But Chinese customs only recorded 6.7 million tons legally entering
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, widespread smuggling has also helped domestic
firms to prepare for the realities of WTO membership,'' wrote Shawn
X. Xu in the report. ``In order to evade import tariffs and
value-added tax, smugglers have been importing large amounts of
foreign goods through illegal channels and selling them
substantially below market prices.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another part of the economy that is likely to be heavily
affected by trade organization membership is agriculture. By
phasing out import quotas and licenses and reducing import tariffs
slightly, compliance with the trade body's regulations will
dramatically open China's market to agricultural imports. Xu
estimates that agricultural imports will double in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   A large unanswered question is how well China's government would
be able to carry out the trade body's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the government could rely solely on administrative
means to push reforms through,'' wrote Xu. ``However, absent a
credible backup or threat, the stick might not be as effective as a
carrot, for people do not believe in the government's ability to
enforce its policies.''

FEDERAL JUDGE VOIDS HANCOCK LOBBYIST'S CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Three years after former Beacon Hill lobbyist F.
William Sawyer was convicted of mail fraud for treating state
legislators to rounds of golf, a federal judge Monday tossed out
the conviction, calling it ``a legal error of fundamental
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent US Supreme Court ruling that clarified the
federal gratuities law, US District Judge Edward F. Harrington
concluded that it wasn't illegal for Sawyer to send a $183 check to
a Cape Cod golf club for a game with legislators while he was
working as a lobbyist for the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said Sawyer's guilty plea to federal mail fraud in
November 1996 was invalid because prosecutors failed to prove that
legislators performed any official act because Sawyer picked up
their golf tabs and it was entirely possible that he was merely
acting out of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer spent one year on probation and was fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a person to be branded a felon for an act which is not
criminal corrupts the very heart of due process,'' wrote
Harrington, who expunged the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's ruling is also at the heart of a related case
involving former state Rep. Francis Woodward, who chaired the
Insurance Committee and was convicted of fraud and bribery in 1996
for accepting about $7,400 in free meals, golf games and a trip to
the Super Bowl from Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock held a hearing in July and
has yet to rule on Woodward's request to vacate his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Thomas R. Kiley, who represents Sawyer, said, ``Bill
has been fighting for his name for a long time. For Bill Sawyer and
Frank Woodward, who are really salt of the earth people, to be
poster boys for the notion of corruption is just so hellacious that
the real fight has been to vindicate their names.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled unanimously last April that jurors
couldn't convict Sun-Diamond Growers of California of giving $5,900
in illegal gratuities to former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy
because there was no evidence that the gifts were linked to any
official act.
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded that it isn't enough for prosecutors to show
that gift-givers wanted to curry favor with officials in a position
to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the court said, prosecutors have to tie the gift-giving
to an official act performed or about to be performed.
</P>
<P>
   In Sawyer's case, he wasn't charged under the federal gratuities
law. But Harrington concluded that the Supreme Court ruling still
applies.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer was convicted in 1995 of conspiracy, bribery and fraud,
but the case was overturned by a federal appeals court that said
jurors should have been instructed that, to find Sawyer guilty,
they had to find he intended to corrupt legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The case was resolved without a second trial when Sawyer pleaded
guilty to a one-count information charging him with mail fraud. The
underlying charge was that he used the mails to violate the
Massachusetts conflict-of-interest law, which prohibits giving
gratuities to influence officials.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington concluded that the state gratuities law was modeled
after the federal law and therefore the recent Supreme Court ruling
applies.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney John M. Griffin declined to comment on
Harrington's ruling or on whether prosecutors will appeal the
decision.

<P>
   Q -- There are two sets of rules in this company. One set is for
the owner's son, and the other set is for the rest of us. He comes
in late, leaves early, does practically no work, and walks around
like he is our boss. I enjoy my work and the people here, but none
of us know what to do about this spoiled brat. H.E.
</P>
<P>
   A -- One of the most effective ways to undercut morale,
satisfaction, and productivity in a family business is to allow a
family member to wander in, pretend to be working, strut around the
office, and then head for the golf course. Not only is this type of
behavior doing a disservice to the company and its employees, it is
doing a disservice to junior too.
</P>
<P>
   Although it typically makes sense to deal directly with people
who are creating difficulties for you, the odds are that you will
get nowhere if you go directly to junior. You can certainly try,
but in this type of situation, you really need to look for his
parent, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   The action that you need to take depends upon the owner's
managerial style and objectives, along with your working
relationship with him or her. If the owner is truly
business-minded, equitable and communicative, you should meet and
discuss the situation in businesslike terms. Perhaps you could
suggest another department where junior may fare better.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if the owner's style is autocratic and
dictatorial, of if his or her son's behavior is typical of the
antics allowed by employed family members, then junior's behavior
is here to stay. In this case, you need to decide if you can ignore
junior and focus on your work and career, or if his behavior is so
upsetting that you need a permanent vacation from this family.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- I was working on a challenging and interesting assignment
when my manager pulled the project and gave it to someone else.
Then he gave me this awful assignment that has been hanging around
here for months. I am working on it now and I am very annoyed. What
do you suggest I do? S.K.
</P>
<P>
   A -- There can be good reasons to change an individual's
assignment midstream, but in such cases, there is a need for
communication, discussion, and a clear mutual understanding of the
need for the change. When a project is yanked away and the employee
is then handed a project that is actually a plight, it is not
surprising to find serious resentment.
</P>
<P>
   You are the best person to determine if your manager's actions
were an insult or a compliment. On the one hand, it is possible
that your manager was upset with your work and decided to grab the
project and punish you. On the other hand, your manager may have
believed that your original project was a little too easy for you
and that it should go to a less skilled employee, while the more
challenging project that has been stalled for months should be
given to you.
</P>
<P>
   You and your manager need to sit down and discuss exactly what
transpired here. It may also be helpful to try to set some ground
rules regarding midstream project changes in the future. Your
manager needs to realize that when something is pulled, it is part
of human nature to pull back, literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- There is one employee who reports to me who keeps asking me
when he is going to be promoted. He has been with the company for a
few years, but, frankly, he is a long way from being promotable. I
keep telling him that we do not have any supervisory positions open
now, but I am tired of having him ask me so often. How should I
handle this? G.L.
</P>
<P>
   A -- If he is a long way from being promotable, then the fact
that you have no supervisory positions open right now has nothing
to do with his question.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like he is under the mistaken impression that if he
keeps asking to be promoted, sooner or later you will say yes. The
reality is that if he truly wants to be promoted, he needs to spend
less time asking about promotions and more time performing
effectively on the job and upgrading any of the skills that are
required for advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Without making any commitment about future promotions, you
should provide him with some specific guidance regarding the
performance criteria, work behaviors, training, and leadership
experiences that are essential for those individuals who would like
to be considered for promotion. He also needs to be advised that
constantly asking to be promoted is a behavior that works against
one's chances of actually being promoted.

BAY STATE ECONOMY BOOMING, REPORT SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Venture capital money is pouring in to Massachusetts
Internet-oriented companies and their employment rosters are
exploding, but the state seems to face a mounting problem of
keeping small startups here to grow, according to a new state
report.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest yearly report on what it calls the ``innovation
economy,'' the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative indicates the
Bay State is a better place to start a small company than to grow
it into a big one, in large part because of the difficulty finding
enough well-trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts ``e-commerce'' companies that make software and
equipment for companies to do business over the Internet attracted
$514 million in venture capital last year, or 15 percent of all US
venture investment, putting the Bay State second only to
California. In the first half of this year, that level of
Massachusetts-commerce investment soared to $819 million, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the state is doing so well, reaching virtually
full employment, job growth in nine key innovation-oriented sectors
slowed to 2.7 percent last year from 3.5 percent in 1997. Nearly 1
in 11 positions for skilled production workers are going begging
because new hires are so hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see a human-resources constraint on our
ability to expand and grow,'' said Joseph D. Alviani, executive
director of the collaborative, a quasi-public state agency that
promotes high-tech growth. ``I don't know how this economy could
support growing big, big companies, because I don't know where they
would get the people to staff them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that Massachusetts faces ``near-zero work force
growth,'' particularly in increasing the pool of people with
college degrees or specialized training to do high-tech
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one-sixth of the state's colleges, for example, now
offer ``e-commerce'' courses, a sector that ``is becoming
increasingly important to the Massachusetts economy,'' said
Patricia M. Flynn, dean of Bentley College's graduate programs and
chairwoman of a 25-person study advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   While the report's focus is more descriptive than prescriptive,
officials said it serves as another reminder the state needs to do
a better job improving education at all levels, from kindergarten
to graduate school, and make housing more available and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Just over one-third of Massachusetts adults have a college
degree, or 33.5 percent, compared to a US average of 23.9 percent.
The percentage of Bay State adults who have graduated college has
nearly tripled since 1970, while the US percentage has roughly
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most glaring weaknesses of the state's economy, the
report indicates, is an inadequate number of ``technically skilled
workers'' to fill jobs being created by rapidly growing high-tech
companies that may have to look west or south to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The report focuses on nine sectors of the economy that account
for 24 percent of non-government jobs in Massachusetts and 35
percent of total private-sector payroll: Software and
communications services; computer and communications hardware;
post-secondary education; health care technology; textiles and
apparel; defense contracting; financial services; ``innovation
services'' such as engineering and consulting; and ``diversified
industrial support,'' including high-tech machines and plastics.
</P>
<P>
   It also compares Massachusetts to five other ``leading
technology states,'' including California, Colorado, Minnesota, New
York, New Jersey, and Texas, finding Massachusetts is doing well
above average in attracting federal research funds and winning
patents, and enjoys higher pay for most jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --As of late 1998, Massachusetts counts at least 490 e-commerce
companies employing more than 18,500 people, numbers that almost
certainly have increased since then.
</P>
<P>
   --Massachusetts led the five other technology-rich states in
patents, with 56 issued per 100,000 people in 1998, up from 42 a
year earlier. Health care technology accounts for 28 percent of all
Massachusetts patents, followed by industrial equipment and
machinery, computers, semiconductors and components, and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   --A total of 110 ``gazelle'' companies _ publicly traded firms
whose sales have grown an annual average compound rate of 20
percent for four years _ are based in Massachusetts, up from 80 in
1995 and 51 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   --At $171 per capita, 1997 federal health research expenditures
in Massachusetts were three times as high as New York, four times
as high as California, and 13 times as high as New Jersey. Overall
federal research and development spending at Massachusetts
universities and teaching hospitals reached $1.7 billion in 1997,
but other states are showing signs of catching up.
</P>
<P>
   --Boston ranks number 5 among the 50 ``most wired'' US cities,
according to a Yahoo! index that includes Internet users and hosts
per capita and on-line business registrations.

TRADE PACT REVEALS RIFT AMONG GOP CANDIDATES ON CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's agreement to support
China's membership in the World Trade Organization on Monday laid
bare the deep divisions among Republican candidates for president
on the nature of relations between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona
gave qualified endorsements of the trade deal, saying that bringing
China into the global trading scheme would help moderate its
economic and political behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the more conservative candidates for the Republican
presidential nomination condemned it, accusing the administration
of ignoring gross human rights violations in its eagerness to
expand commerce with China.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, applauded the trade agreement, although aides
said that Bradley would reserve final judgment until he had had a
chance to study its terms. Both candidates are seeking a way to
embrace free trade with China while not alienating important
Democratic constituencies _ including organized labor and some
human rights advocates _ who oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction signals that the coming political battles
on China and trade will take place largely within the major
political parties, rather than between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more heated debate will be within the Republican Party,''
said Gary Bauer, a Republican presidential candidate and vehement
opponent of the trade deal. ``There will be a Reagan wing making my
argument, and the trade wing _ the Bush wing _ unfortunately siding
with Clinton and Gore on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in a statement that he has consistently supported
membership of China in the world trading organization, a position
also advocated by his father, former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome news of an agreement that will open China's markets
to American products and help introduce American values into
China,'' the governor said. ``The agreement should give American
farmers, ranchers and businesses access to China's growing market,
and help introduce American values along with American products. An
agreement with China should also open the door for Taiwan's
admission to the WTO, which is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's view, which is largely shared by fellow conservative
candidates Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes, is that China's record on
trade, human rights, weapons proliferation and threats to Taiwan
has worsened over the past several years. He said that the
administration should have sought significant changes in the way
Beijing does business before agreeing to sponsor its membership in
the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a millionaire magazine publisher who is largely
financing his own campaign, said last week in a speech on China
policy that he strongly opposes allowing China to join the global
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear,'' Forbes said in an address at the Nixon
Library in Yorba Linda, Calif., ``Yes to Taiwan in the WTO. No to
China. Beijing hasn't earned it and we shouldn't give it. Period.
It is time for our government to reward freedom and democracy _ not
force and demagoguery _ and let us never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not directly address the China trade pact Monday.
But an aide said that Bradley supports China's membership in the
WTO as long as it has to meet the same legal and economic
requirements as any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley believes it is better to have China inside WTO
subject to universal rules rather than outside cutting unilateral
deals,'' said Kristin Ludecke, a Bradley spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, supports the administration's position on trade
with China. But he is also trying to finesse the issue because of
the fervent opposition of the AFL-CIO, which has endorsed his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney blasted the agreement as a
``grave mistake'' and accused the administration of being
``disgustingly hypocritical'' in claiming that trade deals help to
moderate Chinese behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman, Christopher Lehane, said in response to
Sweeney's criticism, ``Al Gore has made absolutely clear _ as he
did at the AFL-CIO convention last month _ that all future trade
agreements he would negotiate as president would include labor,
environmental and human rights agreements as part, and they would
be enforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, who is seeking the Reform Party's presidential
nomination, has long opposed what he considers one-sided trade
deals that hurt American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the latest administration capitulation to Beijing at
the expense of working American families and for the benefit of
transnational corporations,'' Buchanan said in a statement. ``It is
a cave-in, pure and simple, to a regime that even today persecutes
religious minorities and aims nuclear rockets at the United States
of America. I will fight it with everything I have right through to
November 2000.''

   CHINA-U.S.-CONGRESS (Washington) _ The Clinton administration
and business groups prepared an intense campaign Monday to win
approval in Congress for China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, facing opposition from conservatives who object to
almost any dealings with China and liberals who say the trade pact
would be bad for workers. Members of both parties said the deal
would most likely be approved in the key battleground, the House,
based on the solid bipartisan majority that granted China a
one-year extension of favorable trading terms earlier this year. By

   CHINA-U.S.-CANDIDATES (Washington) _ The Clinton
administration's agreement to support China's membership in the WTO
laid bare the deep divisions among Republican candidates for
president on the nature of relations between the United States and
China. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona
gave qualified endorsements of the trade deal, saying that bringing
China into the global trading scheme would help moderate its
economic and political behavior. But the more conservative
candidates for the Republican presidential nomination condemned the
deal, accusing the administration of ignoring gross human rights
violations in its eagerness to expand commerce with the world's
most populous nation. The two Democratic candidates, Vice President
Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, applauded the trade
agreement, although aides said that Bradley would reserve final
judgment until he had had a chance to study its terms. By John M.

GUCCI PURCHASES CONTROL OF YVES SAINT LAURENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the latest step in the mounting consolidation of the
European fashion and luxury-goods industries, the Gucci Group NV
said Monday that it would buy Sanofi Beaute from the French
billionaire Francois Pinault for about $1 billion to gain control
of Yves Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci's share price rose by more than 4 percent after the
company said it had reached a deal that would give it control of
Saint Laurent's cosmetics, perfume and ready-to-wear garment
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci said only the haute couture line of Yves Saint Laurent,
which accounts for about $5 million of Sanofi's $696 million of
annual sales, would remain with Artemis SA, a holding company
controlled by Pinault, where it will continue to be run by Yves
Saint Laurent and his longtime associate, Pierre Berge.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents the first major step by Gucci's chief
executive, Domenico De Sole, to fulfill his ambition of creating a
powerful luxury group of many brands that is large enough to
challenge the industry leader, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.
</P>
<P>
   To advance that plan, De Sole agreed earlier this year to
acquire Yves Saint Laurent from Pinault, who had bought it for
about $1 billion. That agreement came after Gucci stopped LVMH's
hostile-takeover attempt. To thwart the bid by LVMH and its
acquisitive chairman, Bernard Arnault, De Sole had earlier agreed
to sell a large stake in Gucci to Pinault and to incorporate Yves
Saint Laurent into the Gucci Group.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering by Gucci and LVMH has at times come down to
something of a personal feud between Arnault and Pinault, and
Monday LVMH announced a new round of acquisitions to broaden its
portfolio, saying it had reached agreement to buy Phillips, a
British art auction house, and Zenith, a Swiss luxury watchmaker.
Earlier this year, Pinault, an enthusiastic art collector, bought
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal appeared to represent a compromise with Berge, the
38-year partner of Yves Saint Laurent, who had blocked the deal,
originally expected in late July, by insisting that he maintain
control of Yves Saint Laurent's haute couture and ready-to-wear
fashions.
</P>
<P>
   But under Monday's terms, De Sole said that Gucci takes ``full
control of the trademark, the name and operation of the company,''
including the Rive Gauche ready-to-wear collection as well as
perfume licenses for brands like Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels, Oscar de la
Renta and Krizia.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole said it was a ``significant milestone for Gucci in
establishing itself as a leading luxury-goods group.''
</P>
<P>
   Berge, in a telephone conversation, said he was ``very
content,'' with the agreement. ``For one thing, haute couture will
stay in France,'' he said. He added that he was confident of
Gucci's ability to further develop Yves Saint Laurent's product
lines.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole said Gucci would run Yves Saint Laurent as a wholly
owned subsidiary, appointing as managing director Mark Lee, an
American manager who has been responsible for Gucci's worldwide
ready-to-wear merchandising. It was in part Gucci's timely move
from accessories into ready-to-wear garments, notably in key
markets like the United States, that cushioned the group from the
Asian economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, in a statement, said it would apply the formulas at Yves
Saint Laurent that De Sole used to reinvigorate Gucci itself, such
as a ``major store rollout program'' in key luxury-goods markets
and a shift from licensing arrangements to in-house development of
shoes, leather accessories and ready-to-wear garments.

POLL SHOWS HUGE UNDECIDED VOTE IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown, viewed as a competent leader
who can keep the economy humming, leads challenger Tom Ammiano,
seen as a champion of the little guy who understands voters'
everyday concerns, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the San Francisco Examiner and KTVU-Channel 2 found
that 43 percent of those surveyed would vote for Brown and 33
percent would back Ammiano if the election were held now.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, both Democrats, face a Dec. 14 run-off election.
They were the top vote-getters in the Nov. 2 general election.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that 24 percent of the voters surveyed had not
made up their minds with a month left before the Dec. 14 election.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown had an edge in the poll, more people have a positive
impression of Ammiano, a two-term member of the governing Board of
Supervisors who now serves as its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they personally like Tom Ammiano more than Mayor Brown,
but they don't necessarily like him more than Brown to be mayor,''
said pollster Del Ali, who heads Research 2000 of Rockville, Md.,
and conducted the poll for the Examiner and KTVU-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of those surveyed rated Ammiano favorably
compared with 30 percent who gave him an unfavorable rating. As for
Brown, he was viewed favorably by 36 percent of those polled and
unfavorably by 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said in the issues that usually decide elections _
leadership, the economy and jobs _ ``Brown comes out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that people think Ammiano is honest and will
fight hard for the disadvantaged, but they are most concerned that
he would not accomplish things if he is elected mayor and that he
would have a hard time working with others at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ali predicted a vigorous campaign ahead that could be won
by Ammiano, whose unprecedented, last-minute write-in campaign
landed him in second place in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The random telephone poll, conducted this past Nov. 9-11,
surveyed 627 registered voters in San Francisco. It has a margin
for error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll painted a revealing portrait of how voters see the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the poll found, is most capable of encouraging economic
development in the city, and far outshines Ammiano in protecting
and creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano got high marks when voters were asked who best
understands the issues affecting the city's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Brown largely has the support of corporate San Francisco in his
re-election bid, has been a pro-development mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has pumped millions of extra dollars into the
city's budget. That has allowed Brown to provide pay increases to
city workers and expand services _ more money for parks, bus
service, child care, street cleaning _ all without raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the growth in San Francisco has resulted in more
traffic congestion and skyrocketing housing prices. Brown has vowed
to tackle both problems if he is re-elected to another four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has been criticized by big business in San Francisco for
his suggestions to impose a city income tax on the rich, a tax on
stock transfers and to make businesses pay more for public transit
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He also has pushed hard for a minimum wage law in San Francisco
that would boost salaries to $11 an hour plus benefits for
thousands of low-paid workers whose employers hold contracts with
the city or lease city-owned property.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano contends that higher wages and better benefits would
generate more spending power and also ease the burden on social
services and health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also supports a living wage law, but said Ammiano's plan
goes too far and could bankrupt the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, who is seen as even more liberal than Brown, hopes to
court the conservative vote by focusing on his good-government and
anti-corruption positions.
</P>
<P>
   Voters view Brown as far more moderate than Ammiano, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 53 percent of the people thought Ammiano
would do a better job of instilling honesty and integrity at City
Hall. Just 33 percent believe Brown would do that.

BUSH ALLOWS A FEW PERSONAL GLIMPSES IN AUTOBIORGAPHY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pleas for mercy trickled in from around the
globe as Gov. George W. Bush pondered whether to use his powers to
temporarily halt the execution of Houston pickax murderer Karla
Faye Tucker. Two days before her date with the death chamber, even
one of Bush's own daughters weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   She announced that she was against the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner-table declaration made Bush's heart ``a little
heavier,'' but he didn't change his mind. Tucker was executed. As
for his daughter, Bush told her she ``had a right and a
responsibility to make her own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote, a rare peek into Bush's private home life, is
contained in his autobiography, ``A Charge to Keep.'' It is one of
only a handful of passages in the 253-page book that offer new
insights into a politician whose life has already been written
about extensively. But even at that, Bush did not identify which of
his twin teen-age daughters made the remark.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to unveil the book on Wednesday and has said
that he will give his share of the proceeds to charity. It is being
published by William Morrow &AMP; Co. and will retail for $23.
</P>
<P>
   The book is billed as a look at the experiences that led Bush
into the 2000 presidential race. It combines a series of
well-rehearsed campaign speeches with observations about his
governing approach, his opponents, his famous parents and even his
pets, which include a six-toed cat named Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   Understating an obvious difference between the style of his
reticent father and his own more open approach, Bush writes: ``I
respect his humility and try to emulate it in my private life. In
the public arena, though, if you don't define and promote yourself,
someone else will define you.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most poignant moment in the book is Bush's
recollection of his sister, Robin, who died of leukemia just before
her fourth birthday. Bush, then 7, recalls being at Sam Houston
Elementary School in Midland and seeing his parents drive up. He
was sure he saw his sister in the car too, ``her small head rising
barely above the backseat of my parents' green Oldsmobile.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned otherwise as he greeted his parents. Robin had died,
they told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-six years later, those minutes remain the starkest
memory of my childhood, a sharp pain in the midst of an otherwise
happy blur,'' Bush writes.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written with longtime press secretary and adviser
Karen Hughes, does not contain any bold new pronouncements or deep
insights into what makes the governor tick. It mentions the hot
topic of abortion just once, and quotes Bush giving his standard
line: ``I hope someday unborn children will be protected by law and
welcomed in life.''
</P>
<P>
   He also avoids a detailed discussion on guns. ``Guns are an
issue in Texas, as they are in America,'' he writes. ``I believe
law-abiding citizens should be allowed to own guns to hunt and to
protect themselves and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 53, acknowledges in the book that he needed to quit
drinking, which he did at age 40. He said alcohol ``magnified
aspects of my personality that probably didn't need to be larger
than they already were.'' But the governor expresses disdain for
journalists who want to pry too far into mistakes he made as a
young man.
</P>
<P>
   Many, he writes, ``worship at the altar of public confession,
demanding that candidates tell all. They want to conduct a public
strip search, throwing out a question here and a rumor there,
hoping it will bare another layer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Bush portrays his tenure as governor so far as
successful, though he acknowledges that the failure of his 1997 tax
overhaul package was a setback. He recalls a ``most dramatic and
most disappointing'' moment when state senators ``one by one'' told
him they couldn't vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   Another dramatic moment came as he waited for Tucker to die
after he declined to grant her a temporary reprieve. It was ``the
longest 20 minutes of my tenure as governor,'' Bush writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Charge to Keep,'' a title inspired by a Methodist hymn, does
not hold itself out as an exhaustive or even objective look at
Bush's record, background and outlook. Mindful of the lesson not to
let others define him, Bush writes that he decided to write the
tome after discovering that other people were doing their own
biographies of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to tell my story from my own perspective,'' he
writes in the book's forward. ``Plus, in our family, even the dog
has written a book.''

IN THE END, IT'LL STILL BE BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These people who have no use for George W. Bush and are beside
themselves over his early success in the 2000 presidential race
must be absolutely furious: Every time it looks as though Bush
might have made a ruinous misstep in his campaign, he steadies
himself and continues his inexorable march toward the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-bashers first figured that the media's persistent
questions about rumors of past drug use would derail the Texas
governor's campaign. After that storm blew over with no apparent
damage, the anti-Bush crowd pinned its hopes on the so-called pop
quiz that was sprung on Bush by a Boston TV reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dodged that bullet, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Republican front-runner's detractors are touting a poll
suggesting that Arizona Sen. John McCain has erased Bush's
once-sizable lead in New Hampshire. According to the poll, the Bush
lead over McCain has shrunk to a percentage that falls within the
poll's margin of error _ which means that the race is a statistical
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   This development, some Bush-bashers are saying, represents a
serious threat to the aura of inevitability that has been the
hallmark of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Bush's opponents _ and some of the allegedly neutral
pundits _ are saying. Here's what I say: Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   The poll may or may not reflect reality, but all it means in any
case is that New Hampshire voters are taking a close look at McCain
_ as well they should, considering that he's been spending darn
near enough time in the Granite State to run for governor there if
his presidential bid falls through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, has not made campaigning in New
Hampshire a top priority as yet. It stands to reason that his
comparative inactivity in the state would translate to lower poll
numbers. Voters in the New Hampshire primary _ traditionally the
nation's first each campaign season _ expect to be courted, coddled
and cajoled by would-be presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bush starts paying more attention to this demanding segment
of the electorate, his poll numbers are certain to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of argument, though, let's assume that Bush doesn't
bounce back in New Hampshire. Let's assume that McCain is on a
roll, that the former prisoner of war has made such a favorable
impression on the people of New Hampshire that he will surge to
victory in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Good for McCain. Such a scenario would be nice for him; it would
make a terrific anecdote for his next book. But it wouldn't change
the inevitable outcome of the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will not be the Republican nominee for president in 2000.
That honor will go to Bush, without or without the media's
preoccupation with innuendo and trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. John McCain is a great American, an
excellent senator and a perfectly respectable candidate for
president of the United States. But he does not have the widespread
appeal or the resources to defeat Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There is no downplaying McCain's integrity, courage and
sincerity. But as a presidential candidate, he's a Johnny-one-note.
To hear him tell it, campaign finance reform is the answer to every
question, the solution to every problem.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may well believe that, but he is hanging his hopes of
becoming president on an issue that has never captured the
imagination of the public _ and never will.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, is not merely the presidential money-raising
champion of all time; he's the candidate who is most in touch with
the interests and concerns of most Americans. As the campaign
progresses, voters will see that Bush's vision for the future of
the greatest nation on earth is both compelling and well-defined.
</P>
<P>
   The next big hope for the Bush-bashers, of course, is the
expectation that he will self-destruct in the upcoming debates with
McCain and other Republican candidates. Here's a word to the wise:
Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   And if he should happen to stumble, Bush will do what he always
does: He'll steady himself and keep on going.

CHURCHILL: GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CENTURY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. BURKE   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The world waits for Time magazine to anoint the
``Man of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Realists might suggest Hitler, Stalin or Mao, the three monsters
who together made the 20th century the bloodiest era of human
history.
</P>
<P>
   Others might suggest a real hero like Franklin D. Roosevelt, the
man who, according to his supporters, saved American capitalism
during the 1930s and then saved Western civilization during the
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers, especially conservatives, would instead choose
Winston Churchill as the true savior of Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But the case for Churchill is not straightforward. Indeed,
contemporaries regarded Churchill as the Patrick Buchanan of his
day _ renowned as a writer and orator but reviled as a blundering
egotist and political turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   A Conservative by birth and tradition, Churchill switched to the
rising Liberal Party in 1903 and was rewarded accordingly. At the
Board of Trade, he pushed social programs and cuts in defense
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted to the Home Office, he became a law-and-order man,
personally supervising (with photographer in tow) the harsh police
repression of striking miners, anarchists and militant
suffragettes.
</P>
<P>
   Next, at the Admiralty, Churchill repudiated his earlier views
and boosted defense spending almost 60 percent between 1910 and
1914. Thus he soon possessed an imposing array of battleships,
which throughout World War I remained safely in port _ except for
the inconclusive Battle of Jutland _ while the flower of British
manhood perished in France.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anxious as ever for action, Churchill persuaded the
Cabinet to accept his plan for the Gallipoli campaign, which turned
out to be one of the worst defeats in British military history. His
idea was to send a fleet through the Dardanelles straits, capture
Constantinople and thus remove Turkey, Germany's ally, from the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was typically Churchillian, with grandiose planning
and sloppy execution, so that more than half of the 489,000 men
committed to the operation were killed or wounded before the final
withdrawal in late 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill paid a political price, but after a spell in uniform
in France he returned to the Cabinet before war's end.
</P>
<P>
   There he argued, unsuccessfully, for a full-scale British attack
on the new Bolshevik regime in Russia. He argued, successfully, for
fighting Irish rebels with government hit squads (the infamous
Black and Tans).
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of wartime coalition politics and the return
of the Conservatives to power, Churchill switched parties again and
was rewarded with the Exchequer. There he supervised the return of
the pound to the gold standard at its prewar valuation, which
turned out to be one of the worst economic defeats in British
history. The export trade collapsed, and the British economy sank
into a decade-long depression, with considerable labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   During the General Strike of 1926, Churchill loudly advocated
repression. The working class never forgave him.
</P>
<P>
   Out of office but not out of parliamentary politics during the
1930s, Churchill made more enemies with his loud preaching against
``appeasement'' _ especially appeasement of the nationalist
movement in India. (He was outraged when the governor general
released Mahatma Gandhi from jail.) Viewing the Nazi threat,
Churchill demanded a major arms buildup. But his program would have
left Britain with a glut of obsolete arms at the onset of war.
</P>
<P>
   The program actually implemented by Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain, with its emphasis on sophisticated radar and
state-of-the-art fighter planes, won the Battle of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chamberlain had to pay the political price after Hitler
reneged on his promises and took over both Czechoslovakia and
Poland. Ironically, his fall came on account of Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the Admiralty at the onset of hostilities,
Churchill staged a disastrous attack on Norway _ a minor Gallipoli.
</P>
<P>
   The war-coalition parties, not knowing where else to turn, chose
the belligerent Churchill as prime minister. For the next two
years, he kept the nation's spirits alive with his magnificent
oratory while the Germans rampaged throughout Europe and the
Japanese ran roughshod over Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Britain was saved when the Japanese stupidly bombed Pearl Harbor
and their German allies stupidly declared war on the United States.
Thereafter, the British were a distant third in Big Three
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At war's end, Poland, the country for whose independence Britain
had gone to war, lay under the Soviet heel. After Yalta, Churchill
found himself making the same defensive statements that Chamberlain
had made after Munich.
</P>
<P>
   British voters decided in 1945 that they didn't want Churchill's
tattered dreams of imperial glory but instead wanted to march to
the Labor Party's ``New Jerusalem'' under the Beveridge Plan of
cradle-to-grave security. In late 1942, Churchill declared, ``I
have not become the king's First Minister in order to preside over
the liquidation of the British Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   By that standard, his life could be considered a total failure.
He avoided becoming a vassal of the Nazi empire only to become a
vassal of the American empire, while the once-mighty British empire
lay in ruins.

CONDO TO LET: CHECKING IT OUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sally Sweet, who owns Wise Vacation Rentals in Killington, Vt.,
cleanly identifies the core of the issue. ``When 14 people rent a
vacation condo,'' Ms. Sweet said, ``they pick one person to do the
work, and that person wants to be a hero when they all arrive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to help that point person be a hero, not a goat,''
she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweet, as luck would have it, was talking to a sometime
hero, sometime goat, the point person for a floating group of 10 to
12 picky reporters and editors who rent a house for a week in
September before a journalism conference in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone still talks about the dinner party for 24 we staged in
1998 in a vast house at Jackson Hole. Everyone also talks about the
house we took two months ago in Sundance, Utah, but for different
reasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On my desk are stacks of colorful brochures from resort areas
and states; they are dense with grids of agents' names, telephone
numbers, price ranges and seasons. I also have a raft of brochures
sent by organizations like Home From Home and Hideaways
International. There are more resources than one could possibly
master, and still more on the Web.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it's what the brochures don't tell you that can be crucial
when choosing a rental. What insights keep one from selecting a
condo that has no salt in the salt-shakers and no soap in the guest
bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   How does a nonsmoker gain confidence that a place will not have
upholstery and curtains heavy with the smoke of those who have just
rented it? Although agents know that places with spiral stairways
or cliffs next door should not be rented to families with small
children, there are other sorts of hazards: the Dumpster that is
emptied by a screeching truck at 5 a.m. and a wheezing
air-conditioner in the tropics are assassins of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   My task was to learn what can be done to improve the averages
for picking out a well-furnished, bright, clean, sweet-smelling
house from the vast number of possibilities for the ski season or
in the Caribbean, when one-week or four-day rentals are common. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A friend's experience shows what can go wrong. In ski season one
year, she borrowed a Colorado condominium belonging to a family
member. It was just what she and her husband wanted, and they had a
good time. In a later ski season, she asked the agent for a rental
unit in the same complex. It was like night and day, she said. The
second place needed painting, had soiled carpets, sad beds and the
bare minimum kitchen, resulting in a disappointing stay.
</P>
<P>
   One way of preventing this problem is the route Samuel I. and
Mabelle Adele Thompson of Martha's Vineyard take when they rent in
Barbados: they always rent direct from the owners, getting
photographs inside and out, and they ask friends who live on the
island to keep an eye out. After three winter rentals in other
houses, the Thompsons picked a new one this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked our friends to take a look,'' Thompson said, ``and
they reported, `Invite us over when you get here.' So we knew we
had a good place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adden B. Chrystie, an associate agent at Valerie Wilson Travel
in New York, believes that you should start the pursuit in company
with someone you trust. Ms. Chrystie, who specializes in vacation
rentals, said that just as one was confident of what sort of place
relatives would maintain, people in her sector of the travel
business have evaluated real-estate managing agents' standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example,'' Ms. Chrystie said, ``it makes a difference
whether the management company does cleaning and maintenance or
whether the owners do. If the owners do, and they don't enjoy
cooking, they may consider it adequate if the kitchen has four
mismatched glasses and a few dishes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said, as did Ms. Sweet, that people should learn when the
house was last redecorated and re-outfitted. ``Things get pinched
from kitchens,'' she continued. ``Finally there will be only one
frying pan, and it's scratched. Who replaces it, and how long will
it take?'' The nub of it is talking to someone who has been through
the house and its cupboards, not someone working from a description
or a diagram. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When our horde of reporters was going to Jackson Hole in 1998,
Andrew Hibbard, the agent at Alpine Vacation Rentals we talked to,
volunteered in June that Morley Manor, a new property with the
company, was in the process of being redecorated. In September it
was pretty much spanking new, with place settings for 24, three
full sets of glasses, an outdoor grille and two dishwashers to
handle the loads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This year, when we were confronted with an inadequately equipped
kitchen in a house we rented through the Sundance resort in Utah,
it dawned on me that the redecoration schedule contained a distant
early warning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other subtleties that Ms. Chrystie said were important were
these: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ As to a ski house, what does ``ski in, ski out'' really mean?
``This phrase can be used very loosely,'' she said. ``Is it over
the river and through the woods, or right there?'' The same applies
to beach areas: how much of a walk is it to the beach, across the
street or across several streets, and are there high-rise hotels in
the front rank? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Houses and condos can be linked to resorts with names famous
for luxury, but like hotels bearing such names, she said, they can
be tired behind their titles. Candid information is needed about
the condition of such places from someone who has looked into the
closets and tested the lights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Who will be available in emergencies? Anyone making a cold
call should be sure help is available 24 hours a day if the
electricity goes off, the hot tub does not work or another problem
unfolds. The most common problem the two experts reported was lack
of hot water, which invariably turned out to be a result of
successive hot showers after skiing or swimming. &QL;

NEWEST TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS TAKE CUE FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by  LANG Group )  
 
 
By DAVID BLOOM, Staff Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As your cook rustles up breakfast, you bring in the groceries
delivered to your door, skim the paper and other publications, then
read a ream of letters from far-flung friends and associates. Your
dog's eyes light up when it sees you.
</P>
<P>
   Your commute to work is only a few feet. Servants take care of
your shopping, while the pharmacist and stores you visit regularly
know your name and what you tend to like or need.
</P>
<P>
   Now this is living the way it used to be, back in the good old
days.
</P>
<P>
   Technological changes are letting us go back to revisit patterns
of living that were typical 20, 40, even a few hundred years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The morning's milk and groceries, for instance, could be
delivered through an Internet service such as Peapod or WebVan,
after your smart refrigerator's computer sensors automatically
notified the online grocer that you were out of milk and bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're changing the way we do so many things, some
mildly, some quite radically, we almost instinctively reach back to
older models to organize it and understand it,'' said Erik Davis,
author of ``TechGnosis,'' a 1998 book about the ways our oldest
practices, spiritual and otherwise, are creeping into our newest
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's happening in a big way and I think it will happen
more,'' Davis said. ``We now have the technology where we can
easily imagine leaving behind much of what we think of as human
life. But at same time, we're realizing we have ways of relating in
our past that have actually been some really good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Expect your entire house to be wired and smart, something that's
being vigorously promoted by sages such as Michael Dertouzos, the
head of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachussetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Besides your refrigerator, you can hook up your security system,
heating controls, entertainment system and more to your computer
and let them do the grunt work for you. Speaking of smart, that dog
of yours will literally have its eyes light up, if it's like the
AIBO robot dogs Sony has been selling recently (at an eye-popping
rate, despite a $2,500 price tag).
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, Dertouzos said, half a billion
human-operated machines and countless computers in appliances,
sensors, controllers and the like will be interconnected. The
result will be some very smart trash cans, toilets and
refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have already begun to make our shopping life easier,
however haphazardly. Sometimes those intelligent agents are little
pieces of software that you commission to go out on the Internet
and find good deals for you.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents, for instance, will compare prices for, say, a
DVD player sold at various online sites, then tell you which site
has the best price. Entire volumes, such as ``The Bot Book,''
detail the hundreds of shopping and other agents you already use.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the ``suggestion software'' at shopping sites such
as Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Once you buy something from Amazon, the software will compare
your purchase history with those of other people who bought the
same books or music or videos. The next time you visit there, the
software will suggest you try other books or music or videos bought
by those people who share your purchase history.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the same nature happens with some online and
telephone-based pharmacy companies, which use sophisticated
software to note your medical history and drug requirements.
</P>
<P>
   When you dial in, the software automatically pulls up your
account, showing the person handling your order your medical and
purchasing history, status of prescriptions and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes, moving forward and back simultaneously, are also
afoot. That morning newspaper you read (maybe even this one) won't
come on newsprint someday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, this paper and others are available on the Internet
(www.dailynews.com) and an increasing number of people say they
prefer to get their news through that medium, despite the current
annoyances of reading online on poor-resolution monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait. Soon enough, you'll have more portable and powerful
alternatives, some of which are already hitting the market, such as
the electronic devices now being sold by Rocket Books and its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility being readied for market is electronic
``paper.'' The paper uses electric current to flip tiny half-black,
half-white balls of ``digital ink'' embedded in the page. The ink
creates a very high-resolution page that can be endlessly updated
and changed. No more stacks of newsprint waiting for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Reading, in general, has made a comeback, thanks to the Net,
though researchers at Sun Microsystems and elsewhere have found
that we read in very different ways, hopscotching through
information from link to link.
</P>
<P>
   Reading shorter bites of information, with bullet items, many
crosslinks and other organizing options, makes for a much more
intensely read Web page compared to one written in the style we're
used to seeing on the printed page, the researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
   Back, too, is writing, thanks to e-mail. In the past year, for
the first time, we sent more e-mail than snail mail, as techsters
refer to sending a note through the U.S. Postal Service. That trend
will only increase in geometric proportions as the network of
people who have access to e-mail expands.
</P>
<P>
   It's already happening. Most wired people likely would say they
send more notes to friends, lovers, family and others with e-mail
than they ever used to when their main option was taking pen to
paper, then finding envelope, stamp and mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing of e-mail is a healthy thing,'' said Bart Kosko,
author of the just-released ``Fuzzy Future.'' ``People do
communicate with more people than they ever did before. You can hit
so many more people with e-mail.'' But this welcome renaissance for
reading and writing may be short-lived, and Kosko blames, yes,
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the e-mail revolution will last,'' said Kosko,
an information scientist at the University of Southern California.
``There will be (voice-activated controls) in and out, and then
you'll see the end of writing again, especially when there are
(computerized intelligent) agents to clean it up. It creates what I
call a moral hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosko isn't the only one issuing a cautionary note about our
technological future. As attractive as the past is to some people,
the reality is that it it was fraught with its own problems _
disease, war, famine. Despite rosy scenarios, future technology is
as likely to create as many problems as it solves.
</P>
<P>
   We are already yearning for things we have lost. Davis points to
the cultural scavenging of current youth culture, which ransacks
everything from medieval vampire/Gothic culture to the polyester
hippies of the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of focusing our creative energy rather than
spiralling into a dystopian future,'' Davis said. ``We're at a
point where people are starting to realize some of the things we've
lost in our rush for this new technology. I do sense a return
toward the re-embedding of technology in the body of the world and
of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is truly back to the future. &QL;

<P>
   _ The configuration of the beds is a basic, and should be dealt
with on the first discussion by examination of a floor plan
supplied by the agent. If a house has all twin beds, it will not
work for some groups, and the same goes for the reverse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost all rental houses clean out the leftover food, except
possibly salt and pepper, Ms. Sweet said, because no one should
have to worry about the safety of edibles. But renters need to know
what basic supplies are provided on arrival: filters that fit the
coffee pot, dish detergent, paper towels, toilet paper and trash
bags, for example.
</P>
<P>
   These things are hard to find on a late arrival. If they are not
provided, the agent should be asked what it would cost to get them
in. Most agents are also able, for a price, to deliver the edible
items on a shopping list, against the moment of arrival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Placement of the bathrooms: bathrooms off bedrooms are not
accessible to everyone at crucial times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ How often is housekeeping service provided and how extensive
is it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael F. Thiel, owner of Hideaways International in
Portsmouth, N.H., has put together a good set of starting questions
for prospective renters in a booklet, ``Villa Vacations Made
Easy.'' It focuses on renting in the Caribbean, although Hideaways,
a membership group, has properties elsewhere, including links to
many European companies. It contains both a self-evaluation form _
what are our priorities? _ and a sample lease.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet was last revised in 1996, but Thiel says that the
price ranges quoted are still valid. A Montego Bay house with a
pool, a sea view, four bedrooms and a staff is quoted at $1,800 a
week for eight people. He puts a Colorado ski house two miles from
the slopes with an outdoor hot tub, sleeping eight, at $350 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet is available for $5 from Hideaways International,
767 Islington Street, Portsmouth, N.H. 03801, or with a credit card
by telephone to (800) 843-4433. The Web site is www.hideaways.com;
membership, which costs $79 a year, is required for Web browsers to
learn the owners' names.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning-swift change in electronic communication has
sharply affected house rentals. Whereas most hotels that deal with
business travelers have hurried to install modem outlets separate
from the room telephone line, frequently in the bases of desk
lamps, some houses have not thought of this as a needed amenity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sweet said that families' need to keep up with e-mail on
monthlong summer vacations meant that data ports were in demand for
long stays. Cable television has been available in the Vermont
properties for 10 years, she said, and this sort of thing is now
comprehended in the ``basics'' of a rental house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chrystie said: ``What the families expect now is what they
have at home, and they don't want to have a vacation spoiled
because the kids can't watch their favorite videos.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting ready to pick a place at Sundance, the reporters and
editors kept asking about a data port and whether the phone would
accommodate it. On arrival we found there was not a phone in every
bedroom, as described, but that an inexpensive new phone had been
hung on a kitchen wall against a molding so a modem line could not
be inserted.
</P>
<P>
   We shifted to the outlet in the closet, using our longest
extension cords. This was not a major item, but it matched the
opinion Ms. Chrystie later voiced, ``If the resort answers, `Oh
yes, sure,' it's time to worry.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In summary, try to rent a house the same way you pick a doctor:
get hold of someone you know and get a report that satisfies your
questions. This is not like renting a hotel room, where you can
shift to another room if you find the view is over the parking lot.
This is someone's house. Be sure it does what you want. &QL;

   Colorado Canyon Area Is Newest National Park
</P>
<P>
   The United States' 55th national park was created last month
when President Clinton signed legislation creating Black Canyon of
the Gunnison National Park in southwest Colorado, about 250 miles
from Denver. It is the first new national park since Death Valley
and Joshua Tree were established in 1994. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the new park is the dramatic Black Canyon,
whose dark-gray walls of schist and gneiss were carved over a
period of two million years by the Gunnison River. The canyon
plunges as much as 2,660 feet, with one sheer drop measuring 2,200
feet. The narrowest point at the bottom is only 40 feet wide. Both
the canyon and its rims are home to a variety of wildlife,
including black bears, golden eagles and the endangered peregrine
falcon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black Canyon was established as a national monument in 1933, and
with its elevation to national park status, it acquires 10,000 more
acres. Still, at 30,300 total acres, it is the fourth smallest
national park, exceeding only the Hot Springs (Arkansas), Wind Cave
(South Dakota) and Virgin Islands National Parks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Black Canyon gets 230,000 visitors a year, most of them during
the summer. Many come for trout fishing on the Gunnison, but there
is also hiking, Nordic skiing, camping (115 sites) and rock
climbing. Facilities include a South Rim visitor center, which is
open year round and offers food and ranger programs, and a North
Rim ranger station, which is open during the summer only. Among the
hiking trails are seven primitive routes down to the river.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park's South Rim is 15 miles east of Montrose, and the North
Rim 11 miles south of Crawford. The entrance fee is $7 a vehicle a
week. Information: (970) 641-2337; www.nps.gov/blca/.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak and Hertz Expand Rental Sites
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak and the Hertz Corp. are expanding efforts to help
railroad passengers rent cars on arrival, just as air passengers
can at the airport. Since May, Hertz has established a presence in
18 railroad stations, mostly in the West, though sometimes it is
only a dedicated wall phone. At the end of October, the two
organizations announced that they would put rail-drive links into
20 more depots.
</P>
<P>
   One will be Pennsylvania Station in New York, where starting in
December, there will be a wall phone; from there, passengers will
walk about a block to 250 West 34th St. to pick up cars.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 18 Amtrak stations with Hertz connections so far, only
those in Whitefish, Mont., near Glacier National Park, and
Wilmington, Del., have counters with staff. Six of the 20 new

   Boston Show Features Recent Finds by Heade
</P>
<P>
   Martin Johnson Heade, regarded as one of America's greatest
19th-century landscape and still-life painters, was considered a
minor artist in his day and was all but forgotten after his death
in 1904. He was rediscovered in the 1940s, but many of his works
are still untraced, and it is not uncommon for one to turn up
seemingly out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston brings
together more than 90 of his works in his first retrospective in 30
years, including 32 of the more than 200 Heade paintings that have
been discovered since.
</P>
<P>
   Heade was born in Bucks County, Pa., in 1819, and studied with
his neighbor Edward Hicks, the folk artist of ``Peaceable Kingdom''
fame. Before Heade turned 20, he moved to Manhattan, where he met
leading Hudson River School artists like Frederic Edwin Church. His
art changed radically, and he soon became an inventive painter
specializing in landscapes and still lifes.
</P>
<P>
   Heade painted marshes, seascapes and inland views, concentrating
on precise rendering of light and atmosphere, and he traveled
widely, especially to South America. In Brazil, he devoted himself
to painting exotic and colorful hummingbirds in a series of gemlike
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Johnson Heade'' remains on view in Boston until Jan.
17. It will be at the National Gallery of Art in Washington Feb. 13
to May 7, and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, May 28 to
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts, 465 Huntington Ave., is open daily.
Admission is $12. Information: (617) 267-9300 or at www.mfa.org.

   A Brittany Jewel Regains Its 17th-Century Luster
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Rennes in western France can now tour the grand
halls of that city's newly restored 17th-century Parliament of
Britanny building, which has functioned as a courthouse since the
French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the building and much of the art inside were ravaged
by a fire five years ago did these treasures and the building
itself attract the attention of the Culture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Helped along by a renaissance of interest in Breton culture, the
restoration of the Parliament became the symbol for a reinvestment
in regional pride, and a far cry from the dusty court of appeals
it &QL; 
had been.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 million restoration has reclaimed 80 percent of the
damaged art. The work has revealed a sparkling limestone and
granite facade and a wealth of decorative work completed by the
legion of royal painters, sculptors and carpenters from the court
of Louis XIV, who descended upon the Parliament after its
completion in 1655.
</P>
<P>
   Of note are the ceiling paintings that adorn la Grand Chambre
and its annex: the allegorical ``Justice Extending Her Hand to
Innocence'' by Charles Errard and Noel Coypel, and Jean-Baptiste
Jouvenet's ``Triumph of Justice.'' Other works that have undergone
major restorations are Louis Ferdinand Elle's large-scale ``Justice
Imploring Religion'' in the Seconde Chambre and the sculptured wood
ceiling of the Jobbe Duval room.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the Grand Chambre and its annex will not be complete
until 2001, but other attractions, including a small chapel with
17th-century woodwork and the gilded detailing in the Salle des
Assises, are accessible. A series of Gobelin tapestries depicting
key moments in Brittany's history, which were hung in the Grand
Chambre early this century, survived the blaze, though half were
destroyed in another fire where they were being restored.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeals moved back in on Oct. 4 and tours from
Culture Ministry guides, in English on request, began Nov. 1. They
cost $5.50, at 6.3 francs to the dollar. Information: (33-2)

FLIGHT 990 PROBERS SIFT COCKPIT TAPE NOISES, VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investigators, aided by several Arabic
interpreters, pored over the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir
Flight 990 Monday to try to determine whether a criminal act caused
the plane to crash two weeks ago killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concentrating our efforts on determining from the
evidence whether this investigation is to remain under the
leadership of the National Transportation Safety Board,'' James E.
Hall, the board's chairman, said in a briefing here.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking government source said Monday that Hall and FBI
director Louis Freeh had been talking with White House officials in
recent days about which agency should head the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB would remain the lead agency in the investigation if
the cause of the Oct. 31 crash of the Boeing 767-300ER is found to
be mechanical or pilot error. But if a criminal act _ either
terrorism or a willful decision by one or more members of the
flight crew _ brought down the plane then the FBI would take over.
</P>
<P>
   The source said a decision on whether the FBI should assume
control of the investigation could come within days.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, which occurred about 60 miles south of Nantucket, has
quickly become one of the most mysterious accidents in aviation
history.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed normal 30 minutes into the flight from New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Cairo when the
plane's autopilot was switched off and it suddenly went into a
``controlled descent'': a controlled steep dive from 33,000 feet to
about 16,700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At that point electrical power to the plane apparently ceased
because the transponder, which sends information to radar, and the
flight data recorder, which monitors some 155 functions as well as
the plane's performace, stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's two engines _ the source of much of the electrical
power on board the aircraft _ were turned off from the cockpit
shutdown, a scenario that puzzled commercial airline pilots and
aviation specialists.
</P>
<P>
   When this type of aircraft is in flight it can continue to
generate electricity even if the engines stop working, said a
veteran Boeing 767 pilot, who said he was mystified as to a
possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   After descending to 16,700 feet, the plane climbed to about
24,000 feet then went into a final dive and started breaking up
before slamming into the Altantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the puzzling final minutes of the flight and the lack of
any clear-cut cause emerging from the first analyses of the two
black boxes _ the flight data and cockpit voice recorders _ Hall
was optimistic that the cause would eventually be pinpointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the quality of the cockpit voice recorder and
extensive information on the flight data recorder, I am confident
many of the questions that we have, that you have and that the
world has, will be answered,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the cockpit voice recorder is ``almost entirely in a
foreign language'' and the NTSB has added translators to assist in
interpreting the phrases, noise, even the grunts from crew members
as the plane went on a terrifying roller coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``As painstaking a process as it is to read out cockpit voice
recorders, this one is made more difficult,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Because investigators were translating the conversations and
synchronizing information on the flight data recorder and the
cockpit voice recorder to help determine a possible cause, Hall
said he was ``not prepared to answer questions on the contents of
the cockpit voice recorder.''
</P>
<P>
   One aviation specialist, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the NTSB _ which was asked by the Egyptian government shortly
after the crash to overseee the investigation _ is likely under
pressure not to blame the airline or its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things that I can think of at this point are a
criminal act or massive flight crew error,'' the specialist said.
``And this crew was the best that EgyptAir has. I am sure the
airline does not want to hear that it was a massive error on their
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Another aviation specialist, familiar with major accident
investigations, agreed, saying Hall's comment about which agency
should lead the inquiry ``was a politically required statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investigators are expected to visit Boeing headquarters in
Seattle this week to use information from the flight data recorder
on Boeing's 767 simulator to try to find out what happened on board
the 10-year-old airplane.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Hall said he would meet with Navy officials and
family members this week to discuss how to proceed with the
recovery of the remains of crash victims and wreckage from the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who knew two people who perished in the 1996 ValuJet crash
in the Florida Everglades, said he has advised relatives of Flight
990's victims to be prepared for the news that no remains would
ever be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that may or may not happen, but they need to
be aware of my previous experience in an accident of this force and
magnitude,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Rhode Island judge Monday cleared the way for death
certificates to be issued to relatives of those who died in the
crash. The certificates will state that each victim is presumed
dead, even if their remains have not been found and identified.

SHADOW CONFIRMS EXISTENCE OF EXTRASOLAR PLANETS

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dark shadow like an ink spot drifting across the face of a
star 153 light-years away has given astronomers the first direct
observations that they said confirmed the existence of planets
around stars outside Earth's solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Five years of indirect observations had yielded the detection of
more than 25 extrasolar planets orbiting relatively nearby stars.
Their presence was inferred from ever-so-slight wobbles of the
stars, presumably caused by the gravitational pull of large objects
in their orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, telescopes recorded for the first time the distinct
dimming of light as a planet crossed in front of a sunlike star, in
this case HD 209458 in the constellation Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   The direct observation was made by Dr. Greg Henry, an astronomer
at Tennessee State University in Nashville, operating remotely
automated telescopes in the mountains of southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a spectacular discovery,'' said Dr. Geoffrey Marcy of
the University of California at Berkeley, the leading seeker of
planets around other stars. ``There's just no question that the
planets we have been detecting from indirect evidence really are
planets.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, who
collaborates with Marcy, said that not only did the new findings
confirm the presence of extrasolar planets by independent means but
the observed shadow ``provides us with wonderful new information''
about the physical properties of this particular planet. Indirect
observations of a star's wobbles had yielded only gross estimates
of the planets' mass and size.
</P>
<P>
   Henry said the ``amount of dimming of the star's light during
the transit gives us the first-ever measure of the size and density
of an extrasolar planet.''
</P>
<P>
   From early calculations, the astronomers reported that the
planet was traveling a circular orbit around the star once every
3.523 days. The planet's mass is only 63 percent of that of
Jupiter, the solar system's giant. But because the planet is so
close to its star, it is extremely hot (perhaps 3,000 degrees
Fahrenheit) and the sphere of gases is thus expanded to a bloated
shape. Its radius is 60 percent greater than that of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   What the astronomers found fit neatly with recent theories,
developed by Dr. Adam Burrows of the University of Arizona in
Tucson, that predicted the puffed-out shapes of gaseous planets so
close to their stars. If Jupiter happened to be as close as that to
the Sun, it would be much more bloated. The theorists had foreseen
that such a close-orbiting planet would be at least 50 percent
bigger than Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the planet's size and mass, astronomers calculated its
density to be about 0.2 grams per cubic centimeter. This tells them
that it, like Jupiter, is a huge gas giant, probably composed
mostly of the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium. In fact, the
extrasolar planet's density appeared to be a little less than that
of Saturn, the solar system's least dense planet.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, the diameter of Jupiter at its equator is 11
times that of Earth and its mass is 318 times Earth's.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery about extrasolar planets stemmed from a
frustrating night of bad weather at the Keck Observatory on Mauna
Kea in Hawaii. When clouds rolled in on the night of Nov. 5, Marcy
and Butler spent some time going over previous observational data
and noticed the telltale signs of a star's wobble, something they
had overlooked before. It was their 19th extrasolar planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It popped right out of the analysis,'' Marcy said Monday. ``We
immediately e-mailed Henry, as we always do, exactly when and where
to look for the planet crossing in front of the star.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry took up the search on the night of Nov. 7. He noted at one
point a 1.7 percent dip in the star's brightness, a phenomenon that
lasted about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This planetary transit occurred at exactly the time predicted
from Marcy's observations, confirming absolutely the presence of a
companion,'' Henry said. ``We've essentially seen the shadow of the
planet and used it to measure the planet's size.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An effort to repeat the observations on Sunday night failed
because of rain at a telescope in northern California and rare
clouds at the Arizona telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Because the star is dropping from view at these observatories,
astronomers hope to continue research at Hawaii and other sites
around the world. One objective is to study light leaking through
the fringes of the planet's shadow, which could reveal the
composition of the planet's atmosphere and other physical
properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been waiting for,'' Marcy said, reacting to
the discovery and prospects for further research.
</P>
<P>
   The first indirect evidence for a planet around another ordinary
star was found in 1995 by Dr. Michel Mayor of the Geneva
Observatory in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Until earlier this year, only single Jupiter-size planets could
be detected around any of the stars. Then Marcy and Butler detected
the gravitational effects of two large planets orbiting Upsilon
Andromedae, 44 light-years away. It is only a matter of time, most
astronomers think, before they will be able to compare and contrast
the solar system with many other planetary systems.

AUTISM ON THE RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Evan Rosenberg was 2 years old, he didn't play like other
children.
</P>
<P>
   He spent hours gazing out the window, clapping his hands. He
didn't make eye contact with his mother. He wasn't talking. He
couldn't point to objects, or follow basic commands.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing her son couldn't hear, Wendie Rosenberg took him to an
audiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiologist said there's nothing wrong with his hearing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he said a word that strikes a chord of panic in a parent's
heart: autism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought autism meant sitting and rocking in a corner, severe
mental retardation and no skills at all,'' Rosenberg said. ``I
couldn't say the word `autism' for a year. It was like falling into
a black hole and not being able to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   That was seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Evan rushes to the door to greet visitors. He not only
makes eye contact and talks, he's doing fourth-grade-level work in
most subjects. He still has autistic traits, including a slightly
formal manner of speech, and a propensity for re-enacting
conversations to himself.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, he just blends in.
</P>
<P>
   Evan, 10, is one of an exploding population of children with
autism in Washington. He also is one of the success stories, a
child who functions almost independently in a normal, mainstreamed
classroom after years of intensive, one-on-one therapy to draw him
into the world of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   Autism is a mysterious brain disorder that affects between 1 out
of 500 and 1 out of 1,000 children. Scientists cannot agree on the
incidence, except to say it appears to be growing.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly why. But the rise is fueling an
unprecedented concern over the best way to help children with
autism, as well as intensified research into possible causes and
cures.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the California Health and Human Services Agency this
year found that the number of people with autism in California had
nearly quadrupled (up 273 percent) between 1987 and 1998, a time
when the population base increased 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have put the increase as high as 500 percent or
600 percent, said Portia Iversen, founder of California-based Cure
Autism Now Foundation and the parent of a 7-year-old autistic son.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, programs that take children with autism are
having to turn children away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years, we've never had a wait list,'' said Mimi Siegel,
executive director of the Kindering Center, an early-childhood
development program in Bellevue. ``We have always been able to
shoehorn kids in.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has gotten so acute that a group of 30 local
families has banded together to lobby for improved services and
persuaded Children's Hospital to begin a program specializing in
pediatric autism. Due to be in operation early next year, the
center will be jointly run by the hospital and the University of
Washington's Center on Human Development and Disability.
</P>
<P>
   For parents like these, the rising caseload is chilling. The
disease impairs a child's ability to form language and
relationships, and strikes at the very heart of being human _ the
ability to connect with other people.
</P>
<P>
   As one mother puts it, ``It's as though someone broke into my
home and stole my child's mind and left his helpless body.''
</P>
<P>
   Autism affects imagination, communication, social interaction
and reasoning ability, creating a spectrum of impairments. Children
may develop odd ritualistic behaviors, quirky language patterns, or
hypersensitivities to stimuli, such as sounds.
</P>
<P>
   No two children with autism are alike. Some develop high verbal
skills, but their thinking remains concrete. Others understand
language perfectly, but remain mute. Some children fixate on
objects, such as car wheels, or develop narrowly focused
obsessions, such as with weather broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some flap their hands. Some bang their heads. Some make eye
contact readily. Others seem lost in their own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Evan's success is the kind of story that parents of young
children with autism dream of and pray for, give up their jobs and
sometimes their life savings to achieve. Only about half of
children with autism respond to treatment as well as Evan did. The
problem: Researchers can't tell in advance which 50 percent will
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigerator myth: First described in 1943, autism was once
thought to be a disease of upper-middle-class dysfunctional
families. The myth of the ``refrigerator mother'' _ a parent who
failed to attach to the child _ persisted until the late 1960s,
when research began uncovering the neurological roots of the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists have identified some patterns of brain
abnormalities that may reveal the organic, biological basis for the
disease. Overall, for example, children with autism tend to have
slightly bigger heads with heavier brains.
</P>
<P>
   Many children with autism have anomalies in various brain
structures. Brain-damage studies and post-mortem analyses have
found differences in the frontal lobes, which help plan and process
complex information; the cerebellum, which is involved in motor
coordination; and the limbic system, which helps regulate emotions
and social behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The locations of the damage help explain some of the symptoms of
autism. Scientists now believe the neural connections aren't
``wired'' the same way in damaged areas, making it impossible to
deliver the right signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most social interactions require ability to process complex
sets of information, such as facial expressions, body movements,
language, all at once, and monitor our own role in the
conversation,'' said Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and
director of the autism project at the UW. ``The timing of it and
the complexity of it is too much (for children with autism.)''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still puzzling out how this process is
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does something that leaves 99 percent of the brain normal,
how does it derail so many diffuse psychological functions?'' said
Dr. Alan Unis, associate professor of psychiatry at the UW School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   And even more puzzling _ how does autism occasionally result in
``savants,'' such as the character portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in
the movie ``Rain Man''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some children (with autism) have islets of preserved, or
exceptional, ability,'' Dawson said. These so-called ``splinter
skills'' may show up as amazing feats of memory, or exceptional
abilities in math, music, drawing or the ability to decode puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's similar to a person who is blind who has more acute
hearing or ability to use touch,'' she said. ``If you're not using
certain areas of the brain involved with language and people, other
areas having to do with objects, space and numbers are exercised.''
</P>
<P>
   Autism has sometimes been called ``mind blindness,'' an attempt
to describe how difficult it is for children with autism to be able
to imagine, or ``see,'' what's going on in the minds of others, an
essential task for forming social relationships. Many children with
autism don't know, anticipate or react to what others are thinking.
This makes the world a confusing, unreadable, unpredictable place
and contributes to the child's isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Biochemical fingerprints:
</P>
<P>
   The UW, which has one of the largest autism research programs in
the country, currently has several long-term studies under way
looking at how brain structure and activity correlates with the
development of autistic traits.
</P>
<P>
   Using tools such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a way of
visualizing brain tissue, researchers are working to identify the
``biochemical fingerprints'' of the disorder by identifying which
areas of the brain are associated with different symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Tying these biochemical patterns and the source of the damage to
specific types of behavior is a complicated task, but scientists
believe it will help them develop early predictors of outcome and
better treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are particularly interested in correlating areas of
brain abnormality with outcome of interventions, Dawson said. It is
believed there are different subtypes of autism, and the goal is to
find the best form of treatment for each one.
</P>
<P>
   For families, treatment is the most pressing concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosenbergs tried many ``remedies,'' including special
``anti-yeast'' diets and vitamins from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families are so vulnerable,'' she said. ``We had a whole
biochemical work-up, spent thousands of dollars not covered by
insurance. But for him, (diet) wasn't the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they started applied behavioral therapy, a form of
intensive, highly repetitive teaching that breaks learning into
tiny incremental tasks, each one reinforced with positive rewards.
Most children learn by osmosis from their environments. Children
with autism need to be taught even the simplest things, like
responding to their names.
</P>
<P>
   The process is strict, labor-intensive and excruciatingly
time-consuming. It can take days or weeks to learn a task as simple
as pointing, years to learn language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to teach him how to nod,'' Rosenberg said. ``We had to
teach him what language was for.'' At first, Evan was oblivious.
They kept at it, 20 to 25 hours a week, month after month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intense. We lost all our privacy,'' she said. ``People
were constantly in and out. But we kept him engaged, kept him
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, Evan was making eye contact, playing with
blocks, pointing spontaneously to objects and forming words.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, people who don't know about (behavioral
therapy) think we're breaking their spirit,'' Rosenberg said. ``But
you'll never hear that (criticism) from parents whose children do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Evan continues to get 10 hours of therapy a week outside
of school, and he continues to make progress, one task at a time.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, he went to day camp without a full-time
aide for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg is heartened by his progress, and his acceptance into
the world of his typical peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started this journey, we were advised don't ever
tell anyone (your child has autism) because their expectations will
drop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Evan and his therapist, Kim Domis, are setting out
more goals, tasks and rewards in Evan's tidy upstairs bedroom. They
are working on reading comprehension as well as manners and figures
of speech. Like many children with autism, Evan understands
language at a literal level, but struggles to understand its
abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rhythm to the therapy. A question. An answer. A mark
on the board.
</P>
<P>
   The marks accumulate. The minutes go by. When he meets his
goals, he gets a reward. Every 10 minutes or so, he gets a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean to find a needle in a haystack?'' Domis
asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find,'' Evan says. He seems pleased when he gets
his answers right.
</P>
<P>
   They move on to working story problems in math. Occasionally,
Domis throws in an unexpected question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean to stay on your toes?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay attention.'' Evan looks to make sure he gets a point for
the correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   At the break, he gets to work on a jigsaw puzzle, one of his
favorite activities. Today it's a rhinoceros puzzle, a complicated
adult one with more than 1,000 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember just three pieces,'' Domis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remembering,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Evan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're welcome, Kim.''
</P>
<P>
   There are stacks of completed puzzles mounted on boards against
the wall, each assembled a piece at a time, like the neural
circuits in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   The break's over, and he's back at work. He picks up his
reading-comprehension book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that a book you can judge by its cover?'' Domis asks.
</P>
<P>
   Evan laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't judge a book by its cover,'' he says. ``Means you
can't tell what's on the inside.''

WTO CHIEF WARNS OF STEPS CHINA STILL MUST TAKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With U.S.-CHINA-TRADE and related stories) 
(mk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ While hailing the accord clearing the way for China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, Mike Moore, the trade
regulator's chief, also cautioned that several steps remained
before the country could become a full-fledged member. ``China must
still reach agreement with other member governments and we need to
complete important technical talks before China can take her
rightful place at the table of great trading nations,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bilateral agreements must be concluded with other WTO member
nations, most significantly the European Union. In addition to the
United States, China has made agreements with 12 other countries,
including Japan and Australia. However, negotiations remain open
with an additional 28 countries, making it nearly impossible for
China's membership to be cleared in the two weeks remaining before
the Nov. 30 ministerial summit in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Talks last month in Geneva between the EU and China produced no
bilateral trade deal, but the 15-country trading bloc has a new
round of talks set for Nov. 19 in Beijing to iron out differences.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deals with other WTO countries are wrapped up, the more
technical portion of the membership application begins. The terms
under which China has agreed to join the WTO, which is a list of
tariffs and other treatment it will accord goods and services, is
set out in a document called a protocol of accession. This is
considered by a WTO working party, which formalizes the details and
reports on its work over the period that China has tried to become
a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
   The legal framework for China's entry will be set out in a draft
membership treaty, which is submitted to the WTO decision-making
body, the General Council, or to a ministerial conference, which is
the ultimate arbiter for the WTO. The application must be approved
on a two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   China would be required to ratify the arrangement, and 30 days
after that is done, it would be formally accepted into the
135-country trading club.
</P>
<P>
   Moore consistently has backed backed China's 13-year effort to
join the global group. ``A door to history has been opened and now
member governments must walk through it together,'' he said on
hearing the news of the U.S-China agreement.
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted that because of the substantial work involved,
a meeting of the working party on China's accession would not be
convened until after the Seattle summit. Moore said China would
have an observer status at the ministerial gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Under the nationalist government, China was among the 23
original signers of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
predecessor body to the WTO. China's membership lapsed after the
Communist revolution of 1949. Then in 1986 Beijing renewed its
effort to join the global trading system.

RULING EXPANDS ROLE OF NONTRADITIONAL FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Letting stand a groundbreaking ruling that expands
parental rights for gays and lesbians in Massachusetts, the US
Supreme Court Monday refused to review a decision by the state's
highest court that granted visitation rights to the former partner
of a lesbian mother.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices declined to hear a challenge to
the precedent-setting ruling, which was widely viewed as expanding
the legal notion of parenting and acknowledging the place of
nontraditional families in modern life.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the state Supreme Judicial Court in June said that
a lesbian who helped raise her partner's biological son had been a
``de facto'' parent, entitling her to visitation rights after the
couple split up.
</P>
<P>
   Had the US Supreme Court chosen to review the case, its ruling
could have affected a host of family privacy matters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, by declining to take the Massachusetts case, the
SJC decision remains intact here but establishes no legal precedent
outside of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In challenging the SJC's ruling, attorneys for the biological
mother, referred to in court documents only as ``L.M.,'' had asked
the Supreme Court to rule not on the merits of the case, but on
whether the SJC had the legal authority to issue such a decree.
L.M.'s lawyers argued that the high court had no such authority,
and criticized the ruling as an example of judicial law-making.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bonauto, an attorney for the Boston-based Gay and Lesbian
Advocates and Defenders, called Monday's development ``extremely
positive.'' ``What is now clear is that the legal issue of whether
the SJC could declare de facto parenthood has been settled,'' said
Bonauto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the judges and parties will now do what they have
to do, which is the best thing for the child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The case will now return to Dukes County Probate and Family
Court, where a judge will determine custody, visitation, and
child-support arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a lawyer for L.M. called the Supreme Court's refusal
to review the decision puzzling, particularly since the court
agreed last month to examine whether grandparents are entitled to
visitation rights over the objections of the parents.
</P>
<P>
   Boston lawyer Gary Owen Todd, also noted that high courts in
several states have issued disparate rulings on the issue of de
facto parenthood, raising the expectation that the Supreme Court
would step in and resolve the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice to have the Supreme Court deal with
this issue and bring all states under a unified ruling,'' said
Todd. ``This issue is ripe for determination.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that prompted Monday's ruling involves a lesbian couple
from Martha's Vineyard who lived together for 13 years and decided
to have a child through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, while the couple was living in Maryland, one of the two
women became pregnant. When the child, a son, was born in February
1995, the woman's partner acted as her birthing coach and cut the
child's umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
   The couple sent out birth announcements naming both as parents,
and the child's last name consisted of both women's last names. The
boy tells people he has two mothers, one he calls ``Mommy'' and one
he calls ``Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the child was born, and again afterward, the two women
signed a ``co-parenting agreement'' that expressed their intent to
raise the boy together. The agreement also stated that, should the
women separate, both would retain parental status.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple broke up in May 1998, eight months after moving
to Massachusetts, the boy's biological mother denied her former
partner access to the child. The partner then filed a complaint
seeking visitation rights, as well as the right to adopt the child
and assume joint custody.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing, a Dukes County Probate and Family Court judge
ordered temporary visitation, pending trial, between the plaintiff
and the boy, citing the ``best interest of the child'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's biological mother appealed the probate court's
decision to the SJC, which backed the lower court's ruling.

SUCCESSFUL THERAPY IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The explosion in the population of children with autism has
created huge demand for therapists who can provide ``Applied
Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA), the only widely accepted treatment for
autism.
</P>
<P>
   ABA is an intensive, one-on-one form of therapy that helps
``rewire'' the brains of children with autism through repetitive
teaching and positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists with training in ABA are in such demand they've
started guarding their phone numbers to avoid disappointing parents
who stand no chance of getting their services.
</P>
<P>
   And special education preschool programs that offer even limited
ABA services are having to put students on a waiting list for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrations such as these are driving a grass-roots
organization effort by parents, who are trying to improve services
and options for children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   They are also forcing parents to do battle with insurance
companies, school districts and state agencies to try to get
services to help their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 percent of parents in the (autism) clinic are engaged
in some type of legal or adversarial interaction over their
children's educational placement,'' said Dr. Alan Unis,
psychiatrist and autism expert at the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as bad as the civil rights movement in the 1960s. If
these children don't get an appropriate education, the risk of them
spending the rest of their lives in institutional placements is
much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   ABA is widely recognized as the treatment with the most
scientific credibility for helping children with autism, said
Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the
autism project at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the prognosis for children with autism wasn't
good, Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a child is identified by age 2 or 3 and given
high-quality, intensive early intervention _ at least 25 hours of
one-on-one therapy a week for two to three years _ about 50 percent
respond really well, she said. ``They have an average IQ point
increase of 28 points,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to move a child from the mildly retarded to normal
intelligence range.
</P>
<P>
   But such interventions are costly and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our concerns is the research seems to point to certain
minimum number of hours (of treatment to be successful,)'' said
Nellie Allnutt, social services coordinator of the Developmental
Disabilities Division, King County. ``We're very concerned we won't
be able to meet what's defined as best practice for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Current funding through state and federal developmental
disability resources allows only for a few hours a week for those
children who qualify, she said. Most insurance plans don't cover
ABA.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents want more, and they are afraid if they wait to get
it, they will miss the window when their children's brains can
still be reprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Newsome is one who didn't want to wait. Newsome's younger
son Elliot, 3, was diagnosed with ``Pervasive Developmental
Delay,'' one of the disorders on the autism spectrum, about eight
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about 18 months, he wasn't doing the things we thought he
should be, like pointing to stuff,'' Newsome said. ``I'd say,
`Point to your eyes, point to your nose,' and he wouldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Newsome tried not to compare his progress with his
older brother's, figuring all siblings are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in your heart, you know it's not just a second-kid
thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome was one of the lucky ones. She was able to find a
therapist to begin doing behavioral therapy with Elliot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABA approach has been incredible,'' she said. ``It's like
a huge light bulb going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was like he didn't even know what we were saying.
He gets it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Children with autism lack the necessary neural connections to
learn automatically, but those connections can be established
through repetition and reinforcement, Dawson said.
</P>
<P>
   The technique takes advantage of the fact that the brain's
circuitry is still under construction in the early years of life.
Children born with a cloudy cataract in one eye, for example, will
develop normal vision if the cataract is removed before age 3. If
it's removed after age 3, they will remain blind in that eye
because the neural pathways that process visual information in the
brain were never stimulated. Like muscle cells that get stronger in
response to exercise, brain cells respond and adapt to stimulation
from the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome, a former Microsoft manager, is working now to help
other parents get access to behavioral therapy. Together with
several other Microsoft parents (who also have children with
autism) and professionals, she has helped form Northwest Behavioral
Associates, a non-profit program to provide educational and
behavioral support services to children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which provides therapy and school-consultation
services, is also putting together a tutor-training program to
increase the pool of people qualified to work with children with
autism.
</P>
<P>
   The group joins other established parent organizations, such as
FEAT (Families for Effective Autism Treatment), which are also
working to increase training, awareness and funding for autism
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Other institutions are responding to increased demand for
services from parents as well. Children's Hospital, for example, is
developing a new autism program in collaboration with the UW's
Center on Human Development and Disability, to provide
comprehensive services for children with autism.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which will be directed by Dawson, will certify and
train therapists. It also will provide ABA therapy, as well as
other services, including school interventions, for children with
autism.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists themselves are organizing. The Northwest Association
for Behavioral Analysis has formed a committee to try to bring a
national certification test to Washington. So far, five states,
including Florida and California, have certification standards for
behavioral therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to discriminate between the qualified and the
unqualified,'' said Michael Fabrizio, a trained behavioral
therapist in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Certification is critical for increasing insurance coverage.
Currently, many parents can't get insurance to pay for therapy
because behavioral intervention doesn't fit into conventional
categories of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a medical model where you go in and get a shot,'' he
said. ``And it's not a typical therapy model, like speech therapy,
where you get an hour a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies blanch at the thought of paying for 20 to 40
hours a week of therapy, at an average cost of $30,000 a year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for people with autism are glad to see the increased
focus on intervention in a population that can't speak for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their poor ability to communicate, (children with
autism) tend to be misunderstood and pushed aside,'' said Audrey
Horne, president of the Autism Society of America. ``But they are
treatable and educable.''

   When news broke a few months ago that Seattle would become one
of two places in the country doing federally funded research on an
experimental treatment for autism, the researchers were deluged
with calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one slots.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred families.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming response is an indication of how desperate
families are for something that works better than available
methods.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes surrounding secretin, a natural digestive hormone that may
help treat autism, have been building since two parents
accidentally discovered that the hormone appeared to help their
autistic child. In 1996, Victoria and Gary Beck of New Hampshire
went to a gastrointestinal specialist to help diagnose some
digestive difficulties in their autistic son, Parker. The doctor
injected the boy with porcine secretin, a hormone commonly used to
assess gastrointestinal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the doctor's visit, Parker's autistic traits began
improving dramatically. He went from being non-verbal before the
injection to saying words. Initially, the Becks had to fight with
skeptical doctors to get them to acknowledge that secretin might
have had something to do with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The biological explanation is not as far-fetched as it might
seem.
</P>
<P>
   On a basic level, the ``purpose of the brain is to keep the
stomach full,'' said Dr. Alan Unis, professor of psychiatry at the
University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The brain and the gut communicate with each other. ``They need
to have a common language,'' Unis said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretin, which binds to receptors in both the gut and the
brain, could form that link. It is plausible that altering secretin
levels could affect brain function.
</P>
<P>
   It has not taken much convincing for other parents. Publicity
about the Becks story has fueled worldwide demand for the hormone,
creating shortages and driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   That worried the National Institutes of Health. Although
secretin is approved for use as a one-time injection as a
diagnostic agent for stomach problems, it hasn't yet been approved
for multiple injections as a therapeutic agent. Concerned that
children were being given an untried drug with unknown results, the
NIH expedited a clinical trial to study the drug's potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle group is testing a preparation similar to that used
in the Becks' case. The preparation, derived from pigs, is about 60
percent secretin and 40 percent unknown ``pig gut'' ingredients.
Researchers are also testing a pure, synthesized version of
secretin. The purpose of including both is to rule out the
possibility that some other unknown compound in the porcine
secretin preparation is having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Each child will get one injection of secretin or a placebo and
be evaluated for effects one month later. Researchers expect to
have preliminary results in about six months. Children began
receiving the injections late last month.
</P>
<P>
   However high the hopes, experts warn that secretin is not the
first treatment to look promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autism has a terrible history of wild cures,'' said Eric
Trupin, a UW psychology professor who is also director of the child
and adolescent psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some work for a few families. None seems to work for all. Most
have not been scientifically tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very vulnerable group,'' said Audrey Horne, president
of the Autism Society of America. ``Most parents, there's not a
thing they wouldn't do if they thought it would cure their child.''
</P>
<P>
   That has led to a parade of treatments, including megavitamins,
special diets, auditory training, ``holding therapy'' and swimming
with dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Such treatments gain footholds in part because there is a
powerful ``placebo effect'' at work. Parents are often so hopeful
for results, they see them where objective observers would not.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have seen hopes raised by drugs before.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, fenfluramine, a drug that reduces the blood level
of serotonin, was being touted as a wonder drug for autism. About
one-third of children with autism have higher than normal levels of
serotonin, another chemical that acts in both the digestive system
and the brain. Initial optimism about the drug faded after studies
failed to find beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, secretin seems promising. Researchers caution, however,
that although it is tempting to hope for a pill or a shot that will
make autism go away, the reality is likely to be much more
complicated. Based on anecdotal reports, secretin seems to have
some beneficial effect in about half the families that try it, Unis
said. It may be that there is a subtype of autism that responds to
secretin.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the lack of scientific backing for many
treatments, parents have begun organizing to raise money and press
for better research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lobbying for more research funding, the Cure
Autism Now Foundation also has established a gene bank of
``multiplex'' families with more than one autistic child to help
speed the identification of genes associated with autism. In just
over three years, the bank has enrolled 465 families, creating an
unrivaled genetic data bank for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has a grandson with autism, has
co-sponsored legislation to earmark $46.5 million for autism
research. The legislation failed this fall, but autism advocates
have vowed to redouble their efforts to get the funding this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Better understanding of the disease is likely to lead to better
treatments, Horne said. ``With autism, we're just beginning to come
out of the dark ages.''

EXPERTS GRASPING FOR ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing more puzzling than autism itself is why it
appears to be on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Grasping at clues, researchers and parents have come up with a
variety of theories _ many of them at odds with one another. But so
far, the answer remains as inaccessible as the patients themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation is that there are multiple causes,
and that some interaction between genetic and environmental factors
causes brain development to go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed triggers range from milk or wheat allergies to viruses
or environmental toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Many children with autism, for example, have digestive problems,
including food allergies, a phenomenon that has given rise to the
``rogue peptide'' theory. The idea is that children who have
trouble digesting wheat gluten or cow's milk create peptides that
mimic natural hormones or neurotransmitters. When these rogue
peptides get into the brain, they interfere with normal
development.
</P>
<P>
   Other theories postulate that autism develops after something
triggers an autoimmune response in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study, for example, found that the autistic children
who had antibodies to the measles virus in their blood also had
higher levels of antibodies to their own brain tissue, particularly
to a protein found in myelin, the substance that forms the
protective sheath around nerve fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The viral connection has been fueled by anecdotal evidence from
parents whose children first showed autistic symptoms after being
immunized with measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which is usually
given between 12 and 15 months. So far, however, no scientific
studies have been able to link vaccines and autism.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report in the British medical journal
Lancet, for example, the incidence of autism in the United Kingdom
has been increasing since 1979. The MMR vaccine was introduced in
1988, but there was no sharp increase in cases of autism after
that.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the average age of onset of autism is the same for
children whether they have been vaccinated or not, further
weakening a proposed link between the vaccine and the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But parents are still worried, and researchers acknowledge the
question needs further study.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate surrounding viruses continues, there is some
definitive evidence that outside agents can cause autism.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it is known that babies whose mothers took the
anti-nausea drug thalidomide at 28 days' gestation have a much
higher incidence of autism.
</P>
<P>
   Autism also has been associated with children born to mothers
who were given drugs to control their epilepsy, said Dr. Alan Unis,
associate professor of psychiatry at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   Those examples suggest the development of autism is foreshadowed
in the earliest stages of embryonic brain development.
</P>
<P>
   There may be many more unknown agents that could cause such
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example,
have been investigating whether an unusually high incidence of
autism in Brick Township, N.J., could be related to environmental
causes, or is simply a statistical artifact. There have been 40
cases of autism diagnosed among the 6,000 3- to 10-year-old
children living in the township, a rate that is at least triple the
estimated national average.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the overall rise in the incidence of autism
nationally has been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to estimate prevalence,'' Dawson said.
``Twenty years ago, we said 4 or 5 out of 10,000. Today, we say 1
in 500 or 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if the increase in prevalence is accounted for
entirely by diagnostic methods getting better, or whether there is
an (actual) increase.'' Clinicians, however, say the increase is
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, it's becoming more common,'' said psychology
professor Eric Trupin who heads the Division of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry at Children's Hospital in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And some parents say the many competing theories don't have to
be mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autism causes such a broad spectrum (of symptoms),'' said
Audrey Horne, president of the Autism Society of America and parent
of a 31-year-old son with autism. ``There has to be more than one
cause.''

LARGEST BAY STATE HMO LOSES $26.5 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Harvard Pilgrim Health Care lost $26.5 million in the
third quarter, on track with expectations that the financially
ailing health maintenance organization would lose $100 million by
the end of the year, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While the health plan's losses are mounting, the HMO sought to
allay recent fears that Harvard Pilgrim is on the verge of
insolvency, saying it has enough cash on hand to meet its financial
obligations and that it's assets exceed liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are completely consistent with what we have been
expecting and projecting since July,'' said chief executive Charles
Baker, who joined Harvard Pilgrim earlier this year to stop
financial hemorrhaging and put together a turnaround plan to break
even by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the third-quarter losses, ``we're still going to end the
year in pretty decent financial shape,'' he said. ``We can afford
the losses we're projecting. But of course we absolutely have to
make things turn around in 2000, and we're going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of the year, Harvard Pilgrim said its
losses totaled $75.4 million _ a loss that would have risen to
$96.3 million had it not been for $20.9 million in investment
income.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's financial condition has been hurt by its
operations in Rhode Island, where state regulators last month put
the health plan's Ocean State assets in receivership. As of Sept.
30, losses in Rhode Island accounted for $33.8 million of the
health plan's overall losses in 1999, the company said. Regulators
expect to transfer Harvard Pilgrim's Rhode Island members to other
health plans before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim's unpaid claims, a measure of the money still
owed to hospitals and physicians, totaled $407 million in the third
quarter, down from $451 million in the second quarter. Meanwhile,
the health plan said it had $319 million in cash and securities
available to meet emergency demands.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim said it is ``on schedule'' with its effort to
cut costs and expects to have finished a key piece of its
reorganization plan _ negotiating simpler and cheaper contracts
with physicians _ by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tufts Health Plan also reported red ink, largely
because of huge losses in Maine. Tufts said it lost $9.4 million in
the third quarter and $26.3 million for the year so far. A full $21
million of those losses came in Maine, where Tufts has lost so much
money from spiraling health costs that it recently announced it
would withdraw from the state by April of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter losses are slightly larger than anticipated,
leading health plan officials to say the company will likely exceed
its projected $30 million yearend loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely to be a little bit more than that,'' said chief
financial officer Rich Hallworth.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with mounting losses, he said Tufts is planning premium
increases of 10 percent to 15 percent beginning this fall and
continuing through the first part of next year. It is also
renegotiating contracts with member physicians and cutting $21
million in administrative costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts reported
third-quarter profits of $16.3 million for a total gain of $36
million for the full first nine months of the year. Those figures
for the insurer include a $500,000 third-quarter loss at the
company's HMO Blue unit, which reported a total net profit of $4.3
million for the year as of Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Blue Cross and Blue Shield members increased by
35,000, helping it to an operating gain of $9.3 million during the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Having earlier gone through an internal shakeup to cut costs,
Blue Cross and Blue Shield said administrative costs were $7
million lower in the third quarter than they were in the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, concerned about recent financial troubles at HMOs,
the Massachusetts Senate Monday unanimously passed an HMO
insolvency bill that would provide protections for consumers and
HMOs themselves in the event of a health plan's failure. The House
passed a similar bill earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Given the ``ominous'' condition of the state's health plans, the
bill is ``desperately needed,'' said state Senator Bruce E. Tarr, a
Gloucester Republican.

FAMILY HIT TWICE BY DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the outside, the Brestler house looks like any number of
gracious Eastside homes for a growing family with three children.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside, it's a little different. But it's not obvious at
first.
</P>
<P>
   There are invisible alarms on all the doors here, to keep
children from wandering away. And what looks like a well-appointed
playroom is really a fully equipped behavioral therapy center.
</P>
<P>
   The Brestlers have three boys. The two youngest have autism.
</P>
<P>
   Max, 8, and Kevin, 6, look like typical children. Inside, they
are a little different. And it isn't always obvious at first.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, have ``invisible alarms'' locking away parts of their
brains. The brain disorder interferes with their ability to develop
language and form relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few years ago, the fact the Brestlers have two boys with
the disease would have seemed an almost unfathomable coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Today, researchers believe there is a strong genetic component
to autism, which is three to four times more common in boys than
girls.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are about 1-in-20 that a family with one child with
autism will have another. That's 50 to 100 times the rate expected
in the general population.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates a high genetic component to autism, said
Geraldine Dawson, professor of psychology and director of the
autism project at the University of Washington. ``We believe at
least five genes are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In studies of identical twins in which one twin has autism, the
chance of the other twin being affected is about 70 percent. In
fraternal twins _ those who do not share identical genetic status _
the chances that the second twin will also be autistic is about 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Max was first diagnosed at age 2{, Linda Brestler had no
idea she would soon face a second loss.
</P>
<P>
   But she was already worried about Kevin, still under a year, who
at 10 months had such low muscle tone he could not hold his head up
and was not crawling.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers reading the book ``Let Me Hear Your Voice,'' a
book by a mother of two autistic children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the section where her second son was diagnosed,
I threw the book across the room,'' she said. ``It was
mind-boggling, the thought I could possibly have two. I remember
rocking Kevin, saying, `Please, God, don't take him away from me,
too.'''
</P>
<P>
   But rearing Max and Kevin has given her a different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``People lose the idea they're just kids,'' Brestler said. ``You
forget, they're regular kids before they're autistic.''
</P>
<P>
   And like regular kids, Max and Kevin are as different from each
other as any two siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Dark-haired Max doesn't speak. He struggles to move his tongue
to form sounds. The shapes of words elude him. About one-third of
children with autism remain mute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you hungry, Max?'' his mother asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahh.'' Soft, plaintive. Max's way of saying yes. Even though
he doesn't talk, his receptive language _ ability to understand _
is near normal.
</P>
<P>
   Max has a shy smile, a tentative walk. He doesn't like long
hair, or the feel of grass under his feet. ``He has a thing about
textures,'' says Bridgette Tuttle, one of his therapists. He is
afraid of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Max was about 18 months old when his parents first noticed he
was losing eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was withdrawing, and we started questioning his hearing
because he wasn't responding to his name,'' Brestler said. The word
autism never entered her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told her to watch and wait. The more she waited, the
more nervous she got. Eventually, she looked autism up in a medical
dictionary. ``It was a three-line definition,'' she said.
``Everything fit Max.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year of life, they're developing seemingly
normally,'' she said. ``Then that second year, you just lose them;
it's quite devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Max is taking a break from his daily regimen of
behavioral therapy. He sits in a small rocker, fading in and out.
Occasionally, his hands dart together in quick claps. He has an
obsession with rectangles, especially videotape boxes. He likes to
hold them, turning them slowly in his hands, or incessantly
rearranging them.
</P>
<P>
   Brestler redirects him every few minutes with a question. The
questions get him out of his ``self-stimming,'' the slang parents
of autistic children use to describe the range of baffling,
repetitive behaviors that steal their children's attention away
from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, in contrast, is the lively, social one. On this day, he
hurtles across the family room into his mother's lap. The room is
strewn with soft-cover books, their bindings curled. He doesn't
read them. They are a ``self-stimming'' object, like his brother's
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his brother, Kevin was a social baby who made good eye
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``But motorwise (as a baby), he was starting to have problems,''
Brestler said. ``He presented very differently (than Max.)''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kevin is verbal, although he mainly talks to himself. He
responds to simple commands and questions, but can't engage in
conversation. He doesn't understand as much language as Max.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest things about having two children with autism
is the misconceptions people have about the disorder, Brestler
says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true, for example, that children with autism aren't
affectionate, or can't learn, or are completely out of touch with
reality, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has seen otherwise. It has taken 20 hours a week of therapy
for nearly six years, but Max finally has grasped the intent of
language, and communicates by pointing in a book of photographs to
his favorite foods and activities.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked his way up to about 10 sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `Aah uuh ooh,''' she said. ``It means `I love you.'''

   Bird-Watching in Rio
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there places in or near Rio de Janeiro where I can do
some bird-watching? I would go with a tour company that organizes
excursions of a few days or even for an afternoon, but am also
willing to venture into a parklike setting by myself. _ David T.
Lane, Norfolk, Va. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Perhaps the most convenient place for bird-watching in Rio de
Janeiro _ and one that you can easily explore by yourself _ is the
339-acre Botanical Gardens. Some 5,000 varieties of tropical plants
and trees attract more than 100 species of birds, including
flycatchers, cotingas and macaws. The gardens, on the Rua Jardim
Botanico, are about a 10-minute drive from Ipanema. They are open
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $2. Information:
(55-21) 294-6012. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A few miles to the north, the 8,154-acre Tijuca National Park
and Forest is home to toucans, parakeets, hummingbirds and other
species. For serious exploration, it's best to take a tour _ people
have been known to get lost in the woods, and muggings are not
uncommon. Jeep Tours, (55-21) 522-1620, can organize one-day
bird-watching excursions. The cost is $35 a person with a minimum
of six people. The Tijuca National Park and Forest is open daily, 7
a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Rio, there are numerous areas for bird-watching. For
instance, the forests of the 27,181-acre Serra dos Orgaos Park in
Teresopolis, a mountain resort 50 miles north of the city, is home
to toucans, parrots, hummingbirds, gray-wing cotingas and kinglet
kalypturas, among other species. Ricardo Parrini, an ornithologist
and guide charges $100 a day per person for a full-day trek through
the park. Information: (55-21) 570-3155; e-mail:
rparrini(AT)hotmail.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One hundred miles north of Rio, is the Itatiaia National Park,
which has one of the densest bird populations in South America,
with some 400 species living in its 74,131 rugged acres. Focus
Tours, based in Santa Fe, N.M., offers a three-day nature tour from
Rio for a minimum of six participants, costing $799 a person,
including transportation, meals, guide and hotel. Information:

   France's Picasso Museums
</P>
<P>
   Q. Of the two Picasso museums in France, does the one in Paris
have the more extensive collection? _ Martha P. Atkins, Providence,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are actually three Picasso museums in France, and yes,
the one in Paris has, by far, the largest collection. But the two
others _ in Antibes on the Cote d'Azur and in nearby Vallauris _
are well worth visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso, who was born in Spain, spent much of the first half of
the 20th century working in Paris. In lieu of paying estate taxes
after his death in 1973, his heirs turned over hundreds of Picasso
works to the French government. They may be viewed at the Picasso
Museum in Paris, which houses more than 250 Picasso paintings,
1,500 sketches, some 150 sculptures, as well as collages and
ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the works you'll find are ``Portrait of Olga in an
Armchair'' (1917) and ``Pan's Flute'' (1923). An exhibition of
recently acquired works _ ``From Celestine to Dora Maar, 10 Years
of Enrichment at the Picasso Museum''_ runs through Jan. 3. The
museum, at 5, rue de Thorigny in the Marais district, is housed in
an ornate 17th-century mansion known as the Hotel Sale. Admission
is $4.75, $3 for visitors between the ages of 18 and 25, free for
those under 18, $3 for everyone on Sunday. Hours are 9:30 a.m. to 6
p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursday; closed Tuesdays. Information:
(33-1) 42.71.25.21. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Picasso spent several months working in the Chateau
Grimaldi in Antibes. The chateau is now the Picasso Museum in
Antibes, which has about 300 Picasso works, including ``La Joie de
Vivre'' (1946), and a fine ceramics display. A temporary exhibition
of works by the modern French artist Roger Bissiere, will run
through January. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $4.75. Information: (33-4) 92.90.54.20.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Musee National Picasso La Guerre et la Paix and the
adjoining Musee Magnelli, are in Vallauris, about 10 miles east of
Antibes. Picasso retreated to Antibes between 1948 and 1955 with
Francoise Gilot, his companion at the time. In 1952, the artist
painted a monumental fresco called ``La Guerre et la Paix'' on the
walls and ceilings of the town's 16th-century chapel (now the
museum). The Magnelli displays a collection of Picasso ceramics and
Picasso's 1972 painting ``Hidalgo au Colombe,'' as well as works by
the abstract Italian painter Alberto Magnelli. The museum, on the
Place de la Liberation, is open daily from 10 a.m. to noon and from
2 p.m. to 6 p.m. (until 6:30 during the summer). Admission to both
is $2.50. Information: (33-4) 93.64.16.05.

   Sicily-Malta Ferries
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have information on ferryboat travel to and from
Malta, starting in Sicily? Is advance booking necessary? _ Ellen K.
Parrella, Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Island Seaway and Virtu are among the companies with the most
frequent year-round sailings. Reservations are necessary only
during the summer, when calling two weeks ahead is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Island Seaway, a Maltese company, operates from Catania and
Reggio di Calabria in Sicily. Ferries leave Catania at 7 p.m. on
Tuesday and Thursday and arrive in Valletta on Malta at 7 a.m. the
next day. A round-trip ticket costs $107. Children between 4 and 12
pay half the fare (free for those under 4). Cars cost an additional
$150. The return ferry from Valletta departs on Monday and
Wednesday at 8 p.m.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferries from Reggio di Calabria leave on Sunday, at 1:30 p.m.
and arrive in Malta at 5:30 a.m. Round-trip fare is $134; cars cost
an additional $163. Information: (39-095) 325081, fax (39-095)
7159385.
</P>
<P>
   Virtu Ferries, another Maltese company, operates faster
hydrofoil boats between the southern Sicilian port of Pozzallo and
Valletta. From Nov. 1 to March 14, the hydrofoils leave Pozzallo on
Thursday at 6:30 p.m., arriving in Valletta at 8 p.m.; on Saturday,
they leave at 8:30 p.m. arriving at 10 p.m. A connecting bus for
the Saturday hydrofoil leaves Catania at 6 p.m. From Valletta there
are hydrofoils on Thursday at 7 a.m. and Saturday at 5 a.m. There
are more frequent runs during the summer. Round-trip fare is $67.
Children between 4 and 12 pay half-price. Information: (39-06)
4817807.

   LOBBY (Washington) _ When lobbying first became a serious
profession a few decades ago, the ground rules were pretty basic.
About two dozen members of Congress decreed the way most issues
were decided, and an effective lobbyist had to cultivate a personal
relationship with at least one of them to have any real influence.
But now lobbying has turned into a well-ordered global business,
with the influence game taking on a decidedly corporate look. By

 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who is that crafty old codger with the borscht belt
patter, the one who has the audience in stitches at the Royale
Theater? No, it's not Jackie Mason (good guess, though). The
kosher-salted crowd pleaser at the Royale is an 89-year-old
furniture dealer, played by Bob Dishy, who is also the moral
conscience in a drama by the morally conscientious Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   You heard right. While it's true that Miller isn't generally a
fellow you could imagine at a Friars' roast with Henny Youngman and
Alan King, Dishy isn't pulling laughs out of the air in the
seriously imbalanced revival of ``The Price'' that opened Monday
night under James Naughton's direction. This 1968 play of
self-delusion and fraternal conflict finds the author of ``Death of
a Salesman'' and ``The Crucible'' dropping the schoolteacher's
ruler and loosening up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   This may be why the audience at the Royale, so accustomed to
somber admonitions from Miller, sounds like a laugh track for much
of the evening's first act; it is, at least partly, the laughter of
relief. When Dishy's character makes a reference to the suicide of
his young daughter, however, you can sense a ripple of confusion in
the house. When ``The Price'' settles into its earnest battle of
wills about the ownership of one family's past, literally and
metaphorically, there is the unmistakable sound of gears being
stripped.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame the playwright. As written, this atypical and
undervalued work plays shrewdly with both humor and pathos in its
account of two estranged middle-aged brothers (here portrayed by
Jeffrey DeMunn and Harris Yulin) reunited by the sale of their
long-dead father's furniture. ``The Price'' also shows a fluid
command of imagery starting with its reverberant title, and it is
refreshing in its refusal to come down firmly on the side of either
of the embattled siblings. It has a vital ambiguity, unusual in
Miller's work.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the play, however, is definitely on the stiff side,
finally turning into a back-and-forth exchange of revelations and
recriminations that inspired the critic Walter Kerr to observe
deliciously, when ``The Price'' opened 31 years ago, that the
evening relied on equivalents of ``the Erle Stanley Gardner line
`All right, I'll tell you what happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Price'' to convince in performance, it has to create a
sense of people picking at old wounds with the horrible exactitude
peculiar to members of the same family. More than most plays, even
more than most of Miller's plays, it demands an organic emotional
flow to avoid seeming like a formal debate. This production has the
misfortune to follow immediately Robert Falls' intensely felt,
vividly reconceived interpretation of ``Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither spontaneity nor a revivifying new perspective is a
hallmark of this ``Price,'' first seen at the Williamstown Theater
Festival in August. Naughton, best known as a sterling actor in
musicals (``City of Angels,'' ``Chicago''), has encouraged a spirit
of individualism in his four performers that keeps cohesion at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Yulin, who doesn't show up until the end of the first act, is
excellent, giving judiciously considered weight to Miller's
intriguing notion of bad faith, in which personality is made of
calcified layers of self-deceptions. DeMunn, whose squared
shoulders bespeak a long-nurtured defensiveness, can be very
affecting, never more so than when he is still and silent.
</P>
<P>
   But you simply don't believe that these men are brothers, with a
bottomless capacity to wound each other. Without that visceral
connection, ``The Price'' starts to seemed fueled by hot air.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's basic conceit is ingeniously simple, trading in the
regressive bad behavior that arises within families when an estate
has to be settled. The burden of a shared past takes on physical
weight in the form of the heavy Edwardian furniture that crowds the
top floor of a New York town house (designed by Michael Brown, with
a surrealist slant more appropriate to Ionesco's ``Chairs'') that
is soon to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the once wealthy father of Victor (DeMunn) and
Walter Franz (Yulin) lived passively after his financial
destruction in the crash of 1929. Victor, who stayed on to take
care of the old man, sacrificing his passion for science, is a
policeman on the edge of retirement; Walter effectively divorced
himself from his family to become a successful surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Victor is accompanied by his long-suffering wife, Esther
(Lizbeth Mackay), who sniffs a chance for material comfort after
years of scrimping. The evening's assessor, in more ways than one,
is the resonantly named Gregory Solomon (Dishy), who arrives
swathed in Yiddish folksiness and the wisdom of the ages. It is he
who will deliver the evening's baldest statements of theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price of used furniture is nothing but a viewpoint,'' he
says. ``If you don't understand the viewpoint, you don't understand
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishy's adorably conniving performance wins over the audience
early, yet the suspicion arises that what the actor is delivering
is not so much characterization as impersonation. While this might
seem appropriate to a play about how people become the masks they
adopt, Solomon is in fact the one character meant to be taken at
face value, someone Miller has described as ``yards ahead'' of the
others in his realistic acceptance of life.
</P>
<P>
   Dishy suggests a posturing operator whose lapses into physical
weakness seem less like mortal intimations than sympathy-grabbing
stratagems. The interpretive choices have clearly been made in the
name of theatrical liveliness, but they are ultimately
miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mackay is miscast as Esther, who here seems as fluttery as a
butterfly in a high wind, when what's needed is a ball and chain
type forged in guilt and affection. Yulin, on the other hand, seems
to have been destined to play Walter. The actor's natural
self-important stateliness works beautifully, and you're always
aware of the friction between the smooth surface and the roughness
of angry confusion beneath.

NEW YORK: confusion beneath.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When DeMunn is simply listening, arms folded into an insulating
shield, he is an ideal Victor. But in the heat of conversation he
falls into grating patterns of inflections and gestures that crop
up with the rhythmic regularity of ballroom dance steps.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless it is he who provides the evening with its most
eloquent moment, which occurs in the show's first minutes. Walking
across the cluttered stage with both willed deliberation and uneasy
wonder, he pauses to pick up a fencing foil, a relic of Victor's
youth.
</P>
<P>
   DeMunn's face remains the same emblem of resignation and
disappointment, but his body reflexively assumes a posture of
elegance and verve. The contrast says everything about a man who
has never come to terms with the past that has made him what he is.
That nothing else in the production quite matches this exquisite
preface makes its own comment on missed opportunities.

GOALS OF ELECTION REFORM FEARED LOST IN BUDGET FRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With anger rising over the campaign finance law
approved by voters, mangled by the legislature, and now sitting on
Gov. Paul Cellucci's desk, supporters and opponents believe many of
the law's loftiest goals _ and most serious shortcomings _ are
being lost in the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, opponents say voters have been deprived of a valid
debate on the issue since last year's ``clean elections campaign,''
when the groups supporting limits on campaign expenditures outspent
the opposition by nearly 20-1 on a ballot referendum and used
rhetoric implying that opponents favored dirty campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had overwhelming resources and waged an overwhelmingly
deceptive campaign,'' said Stephen Roop, a Democrat who led the
opposition to Question 2. ``It just wasn't a fair fight.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, supporters say Cellucci's decision to veto
$10 million for the law, along with the legislature's earlier
attempt to weaken its provisions, are an affront to voters who
decided overwhelming to limit special interest money in political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall intent is to reduce the influence of big money in
politics and level the playing field for incumbents and
challengers,'' said David Donnelly, director of Mass Voters for
Clean Elections. ``What the legislature did eviserates that.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true. But detractors say the fabled rule of
unintended consequences may prevail if Cellucci and the legislature
were to let the law stand because it makes it harder _ not easier _
for challengers to defeat incumbents by limiting what they can
spend.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the campaign finance law approved by voters would
provide public funding for up to 80 percent of a campaign to
candidates who agree to limit their acceptance of campaign
contributions and their spending. For example, candidates for
attorney general who opt to receive public funds could spend no
more than $450,000 in a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   But $450,000 may not be enough for a challenger to make his or
her case. Critics note that former State Sen. Lois Pines and
Middlesex District Attorney Tom Reilly, the eventual winner,
together spent nearly $3.8 million on TV and radio advertising
alone in their Democratic primary battle for the attorney general's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are living on Mars if they think a challenger can
break through with the kind of money provided for in the law,''
said Demcoratic political consultant Michael Goldman, who worked
for Pines the attorney general's race.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the law, while making it more difficult for
challengers to win, will make it easier to run _ encouraging
frivilous candidates and significantly raising the estimated $56
million cost of the law over a four-year election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the law says that a candidate for a seat in the
House of Representatives need raise only 200 contributions of $5
each to be eligible for $24,000 in public funds for the primary and
general elections campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cellucci's decision to veto money for the law is
based in large part on a pending US Supreme Court case that will
decide whether Missouri can continue to limit individual campaign
contributions to $1,075 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although many observers believe the court is likely to ease
federal and state limits on campaign contribuitons _ or eliminate
them altogether as a violation of free speech _ Donnelly believes
the Masschusetts law will remain standing because the $100 overall
limit on campaign contributions is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, who dislikes the new law,
said a Supreme Court decision raising or invalidating mandatory
limits on campaign contributions could cripple the campaign-finance
reform law here by vastly increasing the cost of matching privately
funded campaigns with public dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran also said that, overall, the idea that limits on
campaign contributions unfairly constrain free speech is at the
heart of much of the opposition to the Massachusetts reform law.
</P>
<P>
   ``To assume that a campaign donation is made or received with
corrupt intent is insulting to many of us in public office and to
citizens who might want to make a contribution to a candidate
because they're aligned with them on the issues,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan is one of NASCAR's 50 all-time greatest drivers. But
Irvan never got a farewell tour or retirement party, after
suffering career-ending injuries during a practice session wreck at
Michigan Speedway three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta Motor Speedway will pay a final tribute to Irvan on
Sunday, just before the start of the NAPA 500. Irvan and his wife,
Kim, will circle the track for a farewell lap in a specially
designed M&AMP;M's ``Millennium'' Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be one of the more emotional moments of the Winston
Cup season, considering what Ernie has done for this sport and what
he has been through,'' said Tom Beard, co-owner of the No. 36 team
that employed Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a pretty neat deal,'' Irvan said. ``I think I've
meant a lot to this sport. And able to do a lap, even though it's
just a show car, is something I owe to all the fans who have
supported me through the years. I know it's going to an emotional
moment for my family and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, 40, was forced into retirement after 313 races and 15
victories at stock-car racing's highest level. He posted one win at
AMS, the fall race in March 1994. All former AMS champions,
including Irvan, will be honored in a separate ceremony on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of good times racing at Atlanta, and I'm sure I'll
be thinking about some of those moments during the lap,'' Irvan
said. ``Plus (AMS) is owned by Bruton Smith, who also owns the
Charlotte track, where I used to work (as a welder). So, there are
a lot of tie-ins.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan's racing career ended abruptly after he wrecked during
Busch practice Aug. 20. Irvan, who had to be cut out of his car by
safety workers, was diagnosed later with a bruised lung and mild
head injury. He still is recovering from the concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real frustrating, because I'm so lost for a lot of
words,'' Irvan said. ``I can't even bowl, because I don't have all
of my hand-eye coordination back. Just walking up the steps is a
concern. I have got to be real careful: You don't know to pick your
foot up and not to put your foot up. It's something that no one who
hasn't been through something like this would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the continuing health problems, Irvan said it was
undecided whether he or his wife will drive the car for Sunday's
farewell lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the brain, and not a broken arm or wrist, which you can
visibly see the healing,'' Irvan said. ``Today, 99 percent of the
people that see me don't realize I've ever had a concussion, unless
they know. And if they know, they'll tell me I'm 100 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not 100 percent,'' he said. ``The doctors anticipate a
full recovery for me, but they really don't know when. My thought
process is coming back, but it is just real slow and going to take
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Irvan's most recent wreck happened five years ago to
the day that he was critically injured in a Winston Cup practice
session at the same Michigan track. Irvan was given a 10 percent
chance to live after the 1994 accident, but he staged an miraculous
recovery and returned to the circuit to win three more races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had any withdrawals about retiring, because today
I'm not capable of driving a race car,'' Irvan said. ``But I'll
probably feel like that at (February's) Daytona 500, because I feel
like I am going to be capable of driving by that time, if I elected
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I don't have any second thoughts about retiring. I've
got a lot better chances of watching my two kids(, Jordan, 6, and
Jared, 2,) grow up than if I raced again,'' Irvan said. ``Family is
a more important thing to me than Winston Cup racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan said he hopes his decision will be an inspiration to other
athletes. He said he has been monitoring, among others, the
situation of San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, who has been
sidelined with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, reality has been starting to set in with a lot of
football players,'' Irvan said. ``You see guys like (Young) who
should think about retirement, but they haven't done it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God has worked with me for this purpose. He said, `OK,
we saved your life one time, and now you can be an inspiration to
other athletes.' There is so much more to life than just sports.''
</P>
<P>
   While Irvan won't be behind the wheel, he hasn't left racing. He
and Mark Simo own a Winston Cup team that has attempted to make the
field for several races this season. Irvan plans to turn it into a
full-time team by 2001.

U.N. ACCEPTS SOME BLAME FOR BOSNIAN MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid out in a
somber, self-critical report Monday the tragic story of how the
United Nations allowed the Bosnian Muslim ``safe area'' of
Srebrenica to be overrun in July 1995 by Bosnian Serbs, who then
systematically killed thousands of its men and boys.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica became a damaging symbol of the
organization's failure at peacekeeping in a new era of brutal civil
wars, and it demonstrated the inadequacy of a system that allowed
political considerations to color military decisions when troops
were under U.N. command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever,''
the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica and other towns that the Security Council
had identified as safe areas, but then refused to authorize enough
troops to defend, led four months later to the U.S.-sponsored
Dayton peace agreement and the introduction of a NATO-led
international military force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   While blame is widely distributed in the U.N. report, the
organization's examination of its own record in Srebrenica breaks
new ground by effectively damning the diplomatic nicety of trying
to remain neutral and above the fray in civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion comes two months after Annan, taking a more
aggressive stance on crimes against civilian populations, startled
the opening session of this year's General Assembly by saying that
national borders would no longer protect leaders who abuse people
under their control.
</P>
<P>
   With his declaration and Monday's report, the United Nations is
saying that the time has come when it will have to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the
scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the
people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder,'' a
senior U.N. official said Monday, introducing the report. ``These
failings were in part rooted in a philosophy of neutrality and
nonviolence wholly unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular,'' this official said, ``the report makes clear
the inadequacy of the entire approach of the United Nations to the
Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing and mass murder, culminating at
Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan was then in charge of U.N. peacekeeping; Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was the secretary-general, in overall command.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on about 100 interviews with a range of
international figures involved in Bosnia, singles out the Bosnian
Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, as the ``architects and implementers of the attempted
genocide in Bosnia'' and criticizes all those who negotiated with
them rather than using military force against them in the early
stages of the war. It demands that they be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal lesson of Srebrenica,'' the report says, ``is
that a deliberate and systematic attempt to terrorize, expel or
murder an entire people must be met decisively with all necessary
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on Srebrenica was released on the same day that the
three joint presidents of Bosnia, speaking to the Security Council
on the fourth anniversary of the Dayton agreement, pledged to
create the first integral national institutions for Bosnia. The
country is now divided into an ethnic Serbian republic and a
federation of Bosnian Muslim and Croat areas.
</P>
<P>
   A multiethnic border patrol will be established to help curb
cross-border terrorism, smuggling and corruption. A secretariat
will be created for the joint presidency, which has had no shared
staff, and a common passport for all Bosnians will be introduced.
The three presidents have also agreed to form a peacekeeping unit
of their own to contribute to the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said that while these may seem like small steps,
it took Richard Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton accord and now
chief U.S. representative at the United Nations, six hours Sunday
night to extract agreement on them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the willingness of the three presidents _
Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim; Ante Jelavic, a Croat, and Zivko
Radisic, a Serb _ to act jointly in issuing what they call their
Declaration of New York reflects some important changes in the
political atmosphere of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnians now see their neighbors moving toward integration
in Europe and possible membership in the European Union _ a hope
that a fragmented, frequently dysfunctional Bosnian state cannot
possibly entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. officials said, the crumbling economic power and
unstable political situation in Serbia, the major republic
remaining in Yugoslavia, mean that Serbia is no longer a beacon to
the Bosnian Serb republic, which is now economically stronger in
some ways than the Serbian motherland.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said that in recent months displaced people in
Bosnia, apparently feeling more secure, have begun returning to
rural areas from which they were displaced as ethnic minorities
during the four-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this important act,'' Holbrooke said in the Security
Council on Monday, ``the presidents have taken a major step toward
consolidating the progress of the past few years _ and in doing so,
have helped Bosnia take another step toward fulfilling the vision
of Dayton: a unified, single democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Muslims now control the Srebrenica city council, though
not without considerable fears for their own safety, officials say.
Elected in 1997 but unable to venture back to the town for more
than a year, they were among the survivors of the massacres in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was then under the guardianship of 110 Dutch
peacekeepers, who were no match for the Serbs who suddenly
surrounded and assaulted the town. The U.N. report on Monday says
that the Dutch commander had asked for NATO air support on four or
five occasions but was either turned down or, finally, provided
with two patrols that dropped only two bombs and left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government, however, feared that its troops might be
taken hostage and at least on one occasion strongly opposed
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the Dutch could have been more forthright
in reporting immediately after the incident what evidence they had
that a massacre was taking place. The study also faulted French and
British commanders leading U.N. troops for their reluctance to call
on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the problem of protecting the safe areas _
Srebrenica, Zepa, Goradze, Bihac, Tuzla and Sarajevo _ was the
refusal of Security Council members, including the United States,
to authorize enough troops to do the job. Boutros-Ghali wanted
34,000; the Security Council authorized only 7,400. Later, U.S.
politicians blamed the secretary-general for the capture of most of
those enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the international community makes a solemn promise to
safeguard and protect innocent civilians from massacre,'' the
report says, ``then it must be willing to back its promise with the
necessary means.''

GORE RUNS INTO GROUNDSWELL OF MICROSOFT SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Just ten days after a federal judge ruled that
Microsoft is a predatory monopoly, Vice President Al Gore Monday
went trolling for votes on the home turf of the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be one of his more awkward moments on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   The audience of about 400 Microsoft employees had been warned
not to grill Gore about the case, but one person after another
bombarded the vice president with angry questions. Many seemed
especially put out that Clinton administration lawyers seemed so
delighted with the federal judge's devastating ruling against the
world's largest software firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Janet Reno wring her hands with glee,'' one Microsoft
employee told Gore, referring to the Attorney General. ``I was
pretty mad and angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore finally threw up his hands and said: ``I cannot talk about
the antitrust case. OK? It's a problem we can get into
theoretically, but believe me it is awkward to talk in a
theoretical level about a real case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, who has been outspoken in his
criticism of the government's case, was attending a trade show in
Las Vegas and was not at the meeting. But the session was attended
by many of those affected by the case, including programmers who
designed the Windows operating system and Internet Explorer browser
that are central to the government's case. One questioner said he
had worked at Microsoft since he was 14 years old. The employees
were told not to give their names to the press.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore anticipated a potentially hostile audience, he went
ahead with the long-planned visit because he is placing so much
importance on high-tech issues _ and campaign contributions from
high tech workers _ in his campaign. Gore presents himself as the
most technologically adept person ever to seek the presidency, a
passion that temporarily backfired when he became the butt of jokes
for saying he helped invent the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has had similar forums with five other
presidential candidates, initially insisted that the meeting be
closed as usual. But Gore felt that would look bad and pressured
the company to allow the press.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore said that the Justice Department pursued the case on
its own, he acknowledged at a later press conference that the White
House might get involved at some point if there is a deal to settle
the case.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore did his best to present himself as a sort of kindred
spirit to the employees who gathered for meeting of Microsoft's
political action committee. He displayed his technological literacy
on topics ranging from ``Moore's law'' about microprocessor speed
to the use of the ``control-alt-delete'' keys, which are used to
reboot a computer _ often when a Microsoft program refuses to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   But the questioners kept returning to the anti-trust case. One
Microsoft employee asked Gore whether it was fair for the
government to subpoena a person's e-mail and ``then some smart
lawyers can cut and paste'' it to prove a case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen that movie, too,'' Gore said. He then explained that
a federal archive law prevents him from deleting any of his
voluminous e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the White House, all e-mail _ you can't even delete it,''
Gore said. ``So I'm very sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore seemed in geek heaven during the rest of his tour of
Microsoft, visiting a gadget-filled Home of the Future and then
touring the office of Slate, an on-line publication that employed
his daughter, Karenna, for a year.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting Slate, Gore sat down before a computer to compose
a column for the magazine about his day at Microsoft. But after 15
minutes, Gore had written only two paragraphs and promised to
e-mail the rest to editor Michael Kinsley. Then Gore headed out of
the building, where he was greeted by 300 more employees. He shook
dozens of hands and asked, good-naturedly: ``Everybody got stock
options?''

ANALYSIS: CLINTON BETS THAT OPENING CHINA'S MARKETS WILL OPEN
SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: 2nd take expected to move by 8:45 p.m.) 
 (With CHINA-U.S.-TRADE and related stories)

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, the deal struck Monday between the
United States and China was one that President Clinton had little
choice but to seal.
</P>
<P>
   For a president who talks constantly these days about harnessing
the forces of economic globalization, the agreement to integrate
China into the global trading system marked the culmination of
Clinton's single biggest imprint on American foreign policy: the
use of American economic power for strategic ends. That is what
this agreement is all about, locking in China's commitment to
economic reforms and with it, he is betting, a further opening of
Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton came to that strategy in the most roundabout of
ways. He began from the other side of the China debate, denouncing
President Bush for economic engagement with a nation that had just
killed hundreds at Tiananmen Square. Soon he came to the conclusion
that every president has reached since Richard Nixon: There is
little realistic choice other than engagement.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half into his presidency, Clinton had already
reversed course, saying he would no longer link human rights or
missile proliferation or other issues to his annual renewal of
China's trading rights with the United States. Ever since, he has
been a passionate advocate of the long-term benefits of opening up
China's politics by opening up its markets _ stringing
American-built cell-phone networks from Shanghai to Tibet, letting
a hundred Internet sites bloom, insisting that if China applies the
the rule of law for Boeing, it eventually will have to apply it to
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   He has, in short, pressed the economic engagement argument to an
extreme no other president, Bush included, has ever taken. Along
the way he has learned a hard lesson: His early hopes that economic
change and political change would quickly come hand-in-hand in
China were a fantasy. In the end, he concluded that if the business
of America is business, so was much of its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, China's leaders thought nothing of
simultaneously negotiating with Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, over subjecting China to the WTO's commercial laws
while sentencing four members of the Falun Gong, the religious
group whose silent meditations have struck fear into the heart of
the Communist Party, to prison sentences of up to 12 years. The
first was good business, a way of promoting more foreign investment
into a country that needs the world's cash and technology more than
ever. The second was, in the view of China's leaders, a question of
political control. Clinton has now molded American policy to
reflect that reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be realistic about the prospects for change in
China because there are elements of the country that will never
change,'' Ms. Barshefsky said Monday. ``But what's the alternative?
Let's punish China by not gaining access to its market? Who does
that punish? I am cautious in making claims that a market-opening
agreement leads to anything other than opening the market. It may _
it could have a spillover effect _ but it may not. And we've got to
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it reflects a maturing of the China debate in the United
States that just as Clinton has come to understand the limits of
trade agreements, some of his critics have come to appreciate their
possibilities. Human Rights Watch, one of the many organizations
constantly monitoring the country, embraced the accord Monday,
sounding a note of cautious hope that Clinton's long-term bet could
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's membership in the WTO could increase pressure for
greater openness, more press freedom, enhanced rights for workers
and an independent judiciary,'' Human Rights Watch said in a
statement.

RISK FOR BOTH SIDES SEEN IN US-CHINA TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One-fifth of the world Monday bet on the free
market system.
</P>
<P>
   The US-China agreement for China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, announced Monday in Beijing, came after six days of
intense bargaining that yielded a bottom line allowing the global
economy to plow into China.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, say analysts, is risky _ for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton and the United States, the agreement
lowers the trade gate into China another substantial notch, opening
up the world's second largest economy to multinational companies
peddling financial services, telecommunications, computers,
insurance and agriculture. But it also means the United States
loses key leverage on China to curb human rights abuses, and some
critics say the United States could lose jobs, especially in
textile industries.
</P>
<P>
   For China and its 1.3 billion people, the change further exposes
the country's schism between a hunger for a free economy and a
political system that craves control. The deal calls for ripping
off the economic shackles of state-run companies, exposing its
shrouded banking system to accountants of the outside world and
shutting down pirates who steal ideas and trademarks of the West,
from copies of ``Star Wars'' DVDs to fur coats cut in the shape of
Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is betting on China.com instead of China.communism,''
said Todd Buchholz, president of the Victoria Capital investment
firm in Washington and author of ``Market Shock,'' a recent book on
global economics. ``They are saying economic growth and open
markets are more important to the future of China than maintaining
the chokehold of the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the key details remain hidden. But broad parts of the
agreement, including allowing foreign firms to immediately buy up
to 49 percent of China's telecommunications firms and as much as 50
percent in two years, paint a future that would allow US firms to
make deep inroads into what most international economists believe
will be the world's biggest market in 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now China must begin negotiations with other WTO countries, but
the US-China deal was the key roadblock. US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky, who is a political celebrity in Asia after
appearing on the front pages of major newspapers there for the past
six days, predicted Monday that China would likely join the WTO
early next year after wrapping up talks with other member nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based WTO operates like this: All member states must
give the same trade deal to each other, effectively giving all
parties ``most favored nation'' basis. Now, China's most favored
nation basis in the United States is reviewed every year by
Congress, which gives lawmakers an opportunity to press China on
prickly issues such as human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But once in the WTO, that annual review would cease. The United
States hopes that the vast influences of the global economy will
have a profound ripple effect in China, encouraging greater
openness in all aspects of Chinese life, including human rights and
military sales. This school of thought embraces the old axiom that
nations that trade don't go to war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a political gamble for the Clinton administration,
coming at a time when China has been arresting many members of the
Falun Gong spiritual movement and when the Justice Department and
Congress are investigating whether China stole nuclear secrets from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China has been gradually relaxing trade barriers for a
generation, a process that has sped up in the last three years
under the leadership of Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO agreement, which China has negotiated for 13 years, is
another step along that continuim, but it's a historic step, say
many economists and political analysts such as Buchholz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win for economic reform, and ultimately it leads to
more democracy,'' Buchholz said Monday. ``What this tells me is
that Zhu Rongji is winning the game again within China, where he's
been under tremendous pressure from the front-biting and
back-biting. . . . I predict now the fall of the Communist Party
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel P. Trachtman, professor of international law and academic
dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University, wasn't so bold, but he said China will be hard-pressed
now to back away from the free market system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big commitment to liberalization,'' Trachtman said.
``It gets them on a kind of train that will be hard to get off
of.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical benefits to many Chinese are plain. As long as the
Chinese leadership stays in the WTO and agrees to its laws, Chinese
workers, known for their amazingly high rates of savings, would be
able to invest their money with US banks, not just state banks that
give meager interest rates. Computer software engineers might land
jobs with US high tech firms. Internet access could explode as the
prices dip.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO arrangement might seem like just another impact of the
information revolution and the global economy _ except that China
with its hundreds of new skyscrapers and tens of new airports and
its cellular telephone network multiplying at dizzying rates isn't
just another nation, but one-fifth of the world.

CHARLENE BARSHEFSKY, THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT CHINA INTO GLOBAL
TRADING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 BARSHEFSKY-NYT  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first time Charlene Barshefsky found herself
sitting in the waiting room outside the office of China's
president, Jiang Zemin, her mind was suddenly flooded by an image
from a different time and a different place: Chicago in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl who lived down the street used to come over so we
could play `Digging to China,''' recalled Barshefsky, the slight,
intense woman who has been at the center of American trade policy
since 1993. ``And I kept wondering, how did I get from digging with
my mother's kitchen spoons in the backyard to negotiating with
Jiang?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Barshefsky completed her dig.
</P>
<P>
   At once jubilant and exhausted, she announced that the
13-year-long quest for an accord that would usher China into the
global trading system was over. For the 49-year-old former trade
lawyer, it is the capstone deal of her tenure in a once-backwater
cabinet post _ a post that, a decade after the Cold War's end, has
made its occupant a central player in American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as Barshefsky regularly reminds both Congress and her
White House colleagues, these days trade accords are ``the new
organizing devices for our international relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect example,'' Barshefsky said Monday in a
conversation from Hong Kong, where she was changing planes on the
way home. ``Since 1979, when we recognized China, there has been no
agreement to anchor the Chinese-American relationship in any
concrete way. I'm not sure this is an anchor, but it's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the Clinton administration has discovered time and again,
China defies diplomatic organizing devices of all sorts. Some of
Barshefsky's battles to get to this deal were not fought across the
negotiating table, but in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In April, she engaged in an embarrassing public disagreement
with her boss, the president _ who rejected her advice to take
China's trade offer in April, a decision Clinton immediately
regretted. She seethed with frustration for months as the
administration tried repeatedly to rebuild relations with Beijing,
which went into the deep freeze during the war in Kosovo. She told
Congress the other day that what set the negotiations off track
was, ``Men never ask for directions, and we mistakenly bombed the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.'' Not for the first time, her White
House colleagues winced.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the end-game began in last week _ days and
nights of caffeine-driven talks about the intricacies of American
investment in Chinese telecommunications companies and the need for
American auto companies to set up financing subsidiaries so that
ordinary Chinese can afford cars _ Barshefsky was in her element.
</P>
<P>
   Moving between the Palace Hotel in Beijing and the trade
ministry, she conducted the three-dimensional chess of modern trade
negotiations: There were the arcane rules of ``accession'' to the
World Trade Organization. Then there were the political realities
of the concessions China needed to make to get the deal through
Congress. There were also the concessions that the Chinese leaders
feared they could not make without destablizing their own economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was the difficult problem of making sure that
Clinton got the credit for an agreement very much like the one he
walked away from.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a one-woman phenomenon,'' her predecessor, Mickey
Kantor, said recently about the woman he first hired as deputy and
then helped promote after he became secretary of commerce. ``I've
never seen anyone who can operate better on no sleep, still talk in
perfect paragraphs, and just grind down the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Barshefsky found during the prolonged negotiations, in
the end the deal hinged on relationships _ relationships with
Clinton and with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese knew that Barshefsky has never had the kind of close
relationship or long history with Clinton that Kantor enjoyed. They
knew she was overruled in April. They had reason to question her
authority to negotiate one of the biggest trade deals in history.
She resolved that by bringing along as he co-negotiator Gene
Sperling, the president's top economic adviser and a man they knew
had urged Clinton to walk away from the first deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed the mix,'' she said, ``and it sent a message. And
in a negotiation, every message you send counts.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson Barshefsky learned as the daughter of Russian and
Polish immigrants who arrived in the northwest side of Chicago with
little English, but a passion for education. They were not thrilled
when she got a law degree _ ``it wasn't intellectual enough for
them,'' she once said _ but quickly she had a job at the Washington
law firm of Steptoe and Johnson that paid half a million dollars a
year running the firm's international division.
</P>
<P>
   She tossed away the cash for the chance to be Kantor's deputy,
constantly juggling trips to Japan _ where she became as popular as
a case of the plague _ with shuttling around her two daughters,
Mari, now 16, and Devra, now 11. When abroad, she would review
their homework with them nightly by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   She is married to Ed Cohen, the droll deputy counsel at the
Department of the Interior, who will not be seeing much of her
anytime soon: She heads from the China negotiation into the global
trade talks that start in Seattle in two weeks, an attempt to start
a ``Millennium Round'' of trade barrier reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday morning, going to see Jiang on her way out of
Beijing, Barshefsky said her mind once again drifted away from the
talks and back to her childhood excavations. ``I'm sure the only
thing I knew about China then was that it was halfway around the
world and that it was important,'' she said. ``It was a start.''

 &HT;    SAT won't be litmus test if Georgia commission has way
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ High school students would have to take tests at the
end academic courses and the results could help determine admission
to state colleges and universities, according to a scenario that
received support Monday from the Governor's education reform
commission.
</P>
<P>
   End-of-course testing could have a wide-ranging effect on high
school life, but the idea of linking it to college admission is one
that the University System of Georgia is already exploring in a
pilot project.
</P>
<P>
   The project is developing end-of-course tests to use in an
alternative admission policy at 10 colleges and universities and
seven technical schools for students at 11 high schools. Assistant
Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs Jan Kettlewell, who is running
this $1-million privately-funded experiment, said students would be
able to gain admission in 2001 using course-based test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the pilot project is to attempt to bring high school
and college standards and expectations into closer harmony,
Kettlewell said.
</P>
<P>
   In its discussion of end-of course tests, members of the reform
commission expressed enthusiasm for using results in admissions
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would give less emphasis to the SAT,'' Gov. Roy Barnes
said, citing complaints made about this influential
college-entrance exam that tests reasoning skills, not the content
learned in high school courses.
</P>
<P>
   It would take years before such a practice is universal. Such
tests, as the governor's education reform commission discussed them
Monday, would be given in grades 9 through 12 at the end of every
course in language arts, math, science and social studies. Passing
the tests would be required to pass each course as well as to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members said end-of-course tests would be more
rigorous than the current high school graduation exam because each
test would be given in the year in which the student learned the
subject, rather than waiting until the 11th grade. Also, the tests
could assess high-level subjects such as geometry and chemistry,
which are not on the graduation exam.

RISK FOR BOTH SIDES SEEN IN US-CHINA TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One-fifth of the world Monday bet on the free
market system.
</P>
<P>
   The US-China agreement for China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, announced Monday in Beijing, came after six days of
intense bargaining that yielded a bottom line allowing the global
economy to plow into China.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, say analysts, is risky _ for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton and the United States, the agreement
lowers the trade gate into China another substantial notch, opening
up the world's second largest economy to multinational companies
peddling financial services, telecommunications, computers,
insurance and agriculture. But it also means the United States
loses key leverage on China to curb human rights abuses, and some
critics say the United States could lose jobs, especially in
textile industries.
</P>
<P>
   For China and its 1.3 billion people, the change further exposes
the country's schism between a hunger for a free economy and a
political system that craves control. The deal calls for ripping
off the economic shackles of state-run companies, exposing its
shrouded banking system to accountants of the outside world and
shutting down pirates who steal ideas and trademarks of the West,
from copies of ``Star Wars'' DVDs to fur coats cut in the shape of
Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is betting on China.com instead of China.communism,''
said Todd Buchholz, president of the Victoria Capital investment
firm in Washington and author of ``Market Shock,'' a recent book on
global economics. ``They are saying economic growth and open
markets are more important to the future of China than maintaining
the chokehold of the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the key details remain hidden. But broad parts of the
agreement, including allowing foreign firms to immediately buy up
to 49 percent of China's telecommunications firms and as much as 50
percent in two years, paint a future that would allow US firms to
make deep inroads into what most international economists believe
will be the world's biggest market in 20 or 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now China must begin negotiations with other WTO countries, but
the US-China deal was the key roadblock. US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky, who is a political celebrity in Asia after
appearing on the front pages of major newspapers there for the past
six days, predicted Monday that China would likely join the WTO
early next year after wrapping up talks with other member nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based WTO operates like this: All member states must
give the same trade deal to each other, effectively giving all
parties ``most favored nation'' basis. Now, China's most favored
nation basis in the United States is reviewed every year by
Congress, which gives lawmakers an opportunity to press China on
prickly issues such as human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But once in the WTO, that annual review would cease. The United
States hopes that the vast influences of the global economy will
have a profound ripple effect in China, encouraging greater
openness in all aspects of Chinese life, including human rights and
military sales. This school of thought embraces the old axiom that
nations that trade don't go to war.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a political gamble for the Clinton administration,
coming at a time when China has been arresting many members of the
Falun Gong spiritual movement and when the Justice Department and
Congress are investigating whether China stole nuclear secrets from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   China has been gradually relaxing trade barriers for a
generation, a process that has sped up in the last three years
under the leadership of Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO agreement, which China has negotiated for 13 years, is
another step along that continuim, but it's a historic step, say
many economists and political analysts such as Buchholz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win for economic reform, and ultimately it leads to
more democracy,'' Buchholz said Monday. ``What this tells me is
that Zhu Rongji is winning the game again within China, where he's
been under tremendous pressure from the front-biting and
back-biting. . . . I predict now the fall of the Communist Party
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel P. Trachtman, professor of international law and academic
dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University, wasn't so bold, but he said China will be hard-pressed
now to back away from the free market system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big commitment to liberalization,'' Trachtman said.
``It gets them on a kind of train that will be hard to get off
of.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical benefits to many Chinese are plain. As long as the
Chinese leadership stays in the WTO and agrees to its laws, Chinese
workers, known for their amazingly high rates of savings, would be
able to invest their money with US banks, not just state banks that
give meager interest rates. Computer software engineers might land
jobs with US high tech firms. Internet access could explode as the
prices dip.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO arrangement might seem like just another impact of the
information revolution and the global economy _ except that China
with its hundreds of new skyscrapers and tens of new airports and
its cellular telephone network multiplying at dizzying rates isn't
just another nation, but one-fifth of the world.

UN SHOULDERS BLAME FOR MASSACRE OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations, in an unusually blunt
report, blamed itself Monday for failing to stop the 1995 Serb
massacre of thousands of Muslim civilians in the Bosnian town of
Srebrenica, saying it was wrong to rule out the use of force to
stop the Serbs and wrong to deny Muslims the ability to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage over the slaughter at Srebrenica, which had been
designated a UN ``safe area,'' heightened US and European resolve
to act and helped lead to NATO's military intervention, which led
ultimately to the end of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and an inability to recognize the
scope of the evil confronting us, we failed to do our part to help
save the people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass
murder,'' the report by Secretary General Kofi Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report makes clear the inadequacy of the entire approach
of the United Nations to the Serb campaign of `ethnic cleansing,'
'' a senior UN official told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the July 1995 massacre, NATO launched air raids on
Bosnian Serb targets. The war was over by November.
</P>
<P>
   ``That extraordinary, galvanizing event, which is one of the
great tragedies in Europe in the past half century, was also part
of the reason why the US got fully engaged,'' said Richard
Holbrooke, the US ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While 2,200 bodies from Srebrenica were recovered, the Red Cross
says that about 7,300 inhabitants are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's 155-page report, requested a year ago by the General
Assembly, dissects in detail the failed UN policy throughout the 3
1/2-year Bosnian war. It concludes that the Bosnian Muslims should
have had access to arms despite an embargo and that airstrikes and
a fighting force, rather than peacekeepers, should have been
deployed early in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said 150 Dutch peacekeepers charged with protecting
Srebrenica cannot be blamed since their repeated requests for NATO
airstrikes on the advancing Serb forces, which Annan Monday called
``clearly warranted,'' were denied by UN military commanders and
headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who headed UN peacekeeping at the time, said he was
included in the decision to deny the air support. He said it was
made to avoid an appearance the United Nations had entered the war
against Serbia, to prevent an escalation of the conflict, to
preserve the UN's humanitarian mission and to prevent peacekeepers
from being taken hostage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, with hindsight, wrong to declare repeatedly and
publicly that we did not want to use air power against the Serbs
except as a last resort, and to accept the shelling of the safe
areas as a daily occurrence,'' Annan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Without air cover, the Dutch troops, which have been sharply
criticized ever since, withdrew from observation posts under direct
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Annan says the United Nations had no warning that 20,000 Serb
troops massed near Srebrenica would attack. The Dutch troops are
blamed for not fully reporting the situation, but Annan admits the
United Nations generally failed to understand the Serbs' war aims.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said another failed policy was keeping the Muslims under
the arms embargo, which handed the Serbs an overwhelming advantage.
He said treating all sides equally amounted to ``appeasement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The community of nations decided to respond to the war in
Bosnia and Herzegovina with an arms embargo, with humanitarian aid
and with the deployment of a peacekeeping force,'' the report says.
``These measures were poor substitutes for more decisive . . .
action to prevent the unfolding horror.''
</P>
<P>
   The UN must learn several lessons from the fall of Srebrenica
``if we are to expect the peoples of the world to place their faith
in the United Nations,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Among these lessons are that peacekeepers must never again be
deployed without a cease-fire or peace agreement and UN-protected
areas must be fully defended by a ``credible military deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having served as undersecretary general for peacekeeping
operations during much of the period under review,'' Annan said,
``I am fully cognizant of the mandate entrusted to the United
Nations and only too painfully aware of the organization's failures
in implementing that mandate.''

LIGHTNING SHATTERS KSU COACH'S LIFE 
(ATTN: KAN) 
(DUPLICATION WARNING: STORY IS BEING FILED IN ``A'' AND ``S''
CATEGORIES)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Phil Bennett might never have married Nancy
Harris if he hadn't been afraid of losing her.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was an emergency room nurse at John Peter Smith Hospital
in Fort Worth, Texas. Phil was an assistant football coach at Texas
Christian University. They had dated for a year, and Nancy wanted
to know whether they had a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready,'' Phil repeatedly told her.
</P>
<P>
   Phil was sharing an apartment with Dave McGinnis _ now the
defensive coordinator for the NFL Arizona Cardinals _ and enjoying
life as a 26-year-old bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Then the young doctors at the hospital began taking an interest
in Nancy. Soon, over enchiladas and chalupas at the Original
Mexican Eats Cafe in west Fort Worth, Phil popped the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go look at a ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he bought that ring in 1982, he never imagined that ``Till
death do us part'' would come so soon. How do you live without your
wife of 15 years? How do you raise your two children without their
mother? How do you continue the transient life of a football coach
without the one who kept you together?
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bennett, 41, died Aug. 28, 17 days after being struck by
lightning while jogging in a subdivision under development near the
family home in Manhattan, where Phil is now an assistant at Kansas
State University. Three months later, the homes in the middle-class
neighborhood are all complete. But how do you build a new life?
</P>
<P>
   The worst times are at night. Sleep doesn't come easily or stay
long. Exhausted, Phil forces himself to bed at 1 a.m. but wakes
within three hours.
</P>
<P>
   When he rolls over, she's not there.
</P>
<P>
   His sentences are frequently left unfinished. He still uses the
present tense when talking about her. His tears won't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you keep saying: `Is this a dream? Am I going
to wake up? Is someone going to tell me this isn't happening?' ''
he said. ``I miss her. I'm lonely for her. I don't know how you
describe it. Maybe the word is `void.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His last memory of his wife is of her kissing him on her way out
the door. ``I love you. I'll see you tonight,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   How could he have known there wouldn't be a tonight? ___
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bennett played the same lottery numbers every week. They
included the jersey numbers of her favorite players, among them the
No. 9 of linebacker Dat Nguyen, formerly of Texas A&AMP;M University
and now with the Dallas Cowboys; the No. 48 of former Aggie safety
Rich Coady; and the No. 12 of onetime Louisiana State University
safety Anthony Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Her chances of winning a $1 million lottery _ 2 million to 1 _
were about the same as those of being killed by lightning. From
1959 to 1998, Kansas had 59 lightning fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy jogged every morning before getting the children off to
school. She ran and walked a four-mile course that her husband had
helped her lay out.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:45 a.m. on Aug. 11, Phil woke her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nance, are you going to jog?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she replied. ``I've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil was getting out of the shower when he heard a loud noise.
Unsure whether it was thunder or a military exercise at nearby Fort
Riley, he looked out the window. It was raining.
</P>
<P>
   He left his son, Sam, 11, and daughter, Maddie, 8, sleeping
downstairs and jumped in his car to look for Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   It started raining harder as he slowly traced her route. He
passed a police cruiser with its lights flashing but didn't think
anything of it. He was sure that Nancy had taken cover in one of
the newly framed houses on Meadowood Drive.
</P>
<P>
   With no sign of Nancy, Phil turned back. He drove up to the
policeman and rolled down his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer, have you seen a good-looking blonde jogging?''
</P>
<P>
   The policeman's answer was in his pause _ and in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, do you know that woman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At that instant, I thought: `What you've always been afraid of
has happened. My life has changed forever,' '' Phil said. ``It was
the most helpless feeling I've ever experienced in my life.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's address book was as thick as Phil's playbook. She never
met a stranger. Iva Houchin, a waitress at the Original Mexican
Eats Cafe, and Earl Pearson, the manager of an Albertson's grocery
in Baton Rouge, La., were among those she kept in contact with even
as Phil's job took them to TCU, Iowa State, Purdue, LSU, Texas A&AMP;M,
Oklahoma and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was because she was such a good talker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if she was gone two or three weeks, a month _
when she came back in, it was like it was yesterday,'' Houchin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nancy rarely complained, she never grew comfortable
with their migrant lifestyle. In his 20-year career, Phil has
worked at one high school and seven colleges, never staying
anywhere longer than five years.
</P>
<P>
   The move from Fort Worth took the biggest emotional toll. After
15 years away from her family, Nancy had come home again in 1997
when Phil signed on as TCU's defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But when head coach Pat Sullivan was fired after the disastrous
1-10 season of 1997, Phil was on the move to the University of
Oklahoma. Only this time, Nancy stayed behind. With Sooners head
coach John Blake on the hot seat, Phil figured that his tenure
there as defensive backs coach was a whistle-stop. He rented an
apartment in Norman, Okla.; Nancy and the children remained in Fort
Worth. They made the three-hour drive every Friday and returned
home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I sort of kick myself,'' Phil said. ``You only have so
much time, and being away from Nancy and the kids was hard on both
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Phil took an assistant's job at Kansas State, which
was 41-8 for the previous four seasons; he was promoted to
defensive coordinator the next month. Although Nancy was excited
about the opportunity to reunite their family in Manhattan, she was
sad about leaving her parents, Dr. O.T. and Mildred Harris, her two
sisters and her two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time any of them saw Nancy, she and Phil had just
returned from an Alaskan cruise with the other K-State coaches and
their wives. On the cruise, Phil and Nancy were inseparable,
watching the whales, walking hand in hand on the ship's deck and
planning their future in Manhattan. &QL;

ADMINISTRATION FACES OPPOSITION ON CHINA PACT FROM LIBERALS AND
CONSERVATIVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (With CHINA-U.S.-TRADE and related stories) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and business groups
prepared an intense campaign on Monday to win approval in Congress
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, facing
opposition from conservatives who object to almost any dealings
with China and liberals who say the trade pact would be bad for
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties said the deal would most likely be
approved in the House, the more difficult of the two congressional
battlegrounds, based on the solid bipartisan majority that granted
China a one-year extension of favorable trading terms earlier this
year. Victory in the Senate, while far from assured, is more
likely, senators said, because the Republican leadership is likely
to support it.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the supporters nor the opponents were taking the
outcome for granted, given the volatility of the relationship
between the United States and China and the political sensitivity
of trade issues heading into an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take an awful lot of work,'' said Rep. David
Dreier, R-Calif., who is chairman of the House Rules Committee and
a leading advocate of bringing China into the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would not vote on the agreement itself, but on whether
the United States should permanently grant China normal trading
privileges, which is effectively a condition of the deal. Since
1974, Congress has had to vote annually on whether to retain a
normal trading relationship with China, a process that critics of
China have used to express their displeasure with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to win greater access to the huge market in China _ and
stung by criticism that they had been ineffectual in rallying
support for past trade votes _ business groups promised an all-out
campaign to get the deal enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were asked by the administration if we could deliver the
votes,'' said L. Craig Johnstone, senior vice president for
international economic and national security affairs at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. ``We said we could and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications and financial services industries are
expected to be big beneficiaries of the trade agreement as are
American auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders have been generally supportive of a deal with
China, but were cautious in their reaction on Monday. Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said there were still
``significant questions'' about the deal's effects on human rights,
religious freedom and the economic relationship between the two
countries, and that he was reserving judgment until he could study
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Even if, as expected, the Republican leadership ultimately joins
the White House in pushing for the agreement, the proposal is still
sure to set off a bitter debate uniting some of the most
conservative Republicans and the most liberal Democrats against
centrists in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Citing what they said were human rights abuses, the spread of
nuclear and conventional arms, a lack of concern for environmental
issues and the prospect that increased trade would result in some
American workers losing their jobs, a spectrum of groups said they
would try to block or modify the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, called the deal ``a
grave mistake,'' and said that it was ``disgustingly hypocritical''
of the administration to claim to be keeping the interests of
working people in mind even as it negotiated with a regime that
routinely violates human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the trade deal by human rights advocates could
also give an opportunity to conservative Republican presidential
candidates like Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer to win support from the
right wing of their party, whose leading candidate, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, supports the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said the agreement was a ``raw
deal'' for workers and consumers because it would institutionalize
tariff advantages enjoyed by China.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that, we'd be putting our stamp of approval on
having a gangster regime coming into yet another international body
and thinking that in some way that body is going to civilize the
regime,'' Rohrabacher said, ``when in fact it's more likely that
the organization itself will be corrupted by having the world's
worst human rights violator in its midst.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they would press hard to get the
deal approved, probably in the first few months of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when Congress has an opportunity to study the
terms of this, recognize the tremendous benefits to American
industry and American workers around the country, and the
protections that we obtain for import-sensitive industries in this
agreement, that there will be broad support for it,'' Sandy Berger,
the national security adviser, told reporters in Turkey, where
President Clinton was traveling on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration won support on Monday from Human Rights
Watch, an advocacy group that said China's entry into the trade
organization ``could increase pressure for greater openness, more
press freedom, enhanced rights for workers and an independent
judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is primarily counting on business groups.
Administration officials have consulted closely with business
lobbyists to gauge support for a deal on Capitol Hill and to plan
strategy for winning approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Business Roundtable, which represents the nation's largest
corporations, has readied a plan to tout the benefits of the deal
in 71 key congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, for example, the business group has hired a political
organizer, Bill Menner, to get local businesses and interest groups
working on behalf of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Menner said he plans to turn to influential groups like the Iowa
Farm Bureau Federation and to other employers in the state, like
Diamond V Mills, a soybean processor in Cedar Rapids, and the
corporate headquarters of Roto-Rooter in West Des Moines, to make a
public case for the deal and call their members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable also plans to run newspaper advertising in Iowa
emphasizing the economic benefits the deal would bring to farmers
and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that when push comes to shove,'' Menner said, ``the
case we can make about the benefits of trade with China will carry
the day.''

LEADER OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS GIVES STATE-OF-THE-CHURCH ADDRESS 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The human rights focus of America's Catholic
bishops feeds into a historical stream of church-initiated social
action still needed by the world, Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza of
Houston told his brother bishops Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few past centuries have witnessed the display of sin and grace
as starkly as the one now ending,'' said Fiorenza, president of the
American bishops' conference and leader of 900,000 Catholics in the
Diocese of Galveston-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In a state-of-the-church address, Fiorenza decried abortion,
sweatshop labor, weapons of mass destruction, capital punishment
and other social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he led the conference in calling for an end to economic
sanctions against Iraq and questioning the ``moral justification''
of American airstrikes. With Pope John Paul II, the bishops have
opposed the sanctions since the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Political and military sanctions remain acceptable;
comprehensive economic sanctions are not,'' says the statement,
urging the United States and the United Nations Security Council to
end the economic embargo. The sanctions have harmed innocent
civilians by halting the flow of essential medicine and food,
Fiorenza said.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, he said retaining the ``Catholic identity'' of
church-affiliated universities is as central to those institutions
today as it was to Catholic schools 125 years ago when the church
established America's parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, ``there was a great effort to preserve the Catholic
mission of our schools,'' Fiorenza said in an interview. ``Those
issues are still involved in the discussion on higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   That discussion tops the bishops' agenda this week as they vote
on a proposal that will determine how much control the church will
exercise over America's 235 Catholics colleges and universities,
including seven in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The prelates are at the center of a divide between Vatican
demands and American traditions of academic freedom. They are to
vote on the matter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would require that Catholic theologians must obtain
a mandate from the local bishop in their region in order to teach
and that a majority of board members and faculty at such schools be
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics disagree over how stringently the rules would have to
be enforced, but many Catholic academics fear the proposal would
undermine academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop John Leibrecht of Springfield, Mo., said the bishops want
their institutions ``to have autonomy,'' but also want to keep such
schools in the Catholic fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we want our Catholic schools to be uniquely
Catholic in their mission, their identity and the messages they
impart to students,'' Fiorenza said.
</P>
<P>
   If two-thirds of the bishops approve the text of the proposal,
it will go to Rome for approval.
</P>
<P>
   The issue dates to the pope's 1990 decree, ``Ex Corde
Ecclesiae,'' in which the pontiff sought to strengthen the Catholic
identity of church-affiliated schools serving his worldwide flock.
The autonomy and academic freedom of colleges are recognized, but
only ``within the confines of truth and common good.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the papal decree, the Vatican instructed each nations'
bishops to apply the new rules within their countries. In 1996, the
U.S. bishops overwhelmingly endorsed a less-stringent policy widely
supported. But the Vatican rejected that policy, insisting it
should be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Many bishops could have problems with this draft, predicted the
Rev. Thomas J. Reese of New York, who has authored several books on
the bishops. He said the current proposal could make it more
difficult for Catholic bishops and academicians to keep talking
about what it means to be a Catholic institution. ``The word
Catholic will become identified with mandate and control by the
bishops,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Michael Miller, president of Houston's University
of St. Thomas, supports it. The norms to be approved by the bishops
``will inspire us to take our responsibility with the utmost
seriousness of putting into practice what we claim we are,'' he
said.

xxx In Manhattan. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They had flown back in to Dallas, but Phil had to go on to
Manhattan because of a meeting, so Nancy came by the house about
6:30 one morning,'' said Phil's brother, Jim, head football coach
at Irving High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called us on her cell phone outside our door. She was so
excited. We went downstairs and fixed coffee. She came in, and she
said: `I've only got 15 minutes. I've got to go get the kids at my
parents' in Alvarado.' About three hours later, she left. It was
nonstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was used to saying goodbye, but this time was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were standing on the doorstep and hugging and crying like
we were never going to see each other again,'' said Tory Dickey,
the wife of University of North Texas coach Darrell Dickey and one
of Nancy's best friends. ``But it just would never cross your mind
in a million years that you wouldn't.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   Phil and Nancy met on a blind date in 1981. Jim met Nancy's
sister, Suzan, when both were coaching at Alvarado. Jim told Nancy
about his brother, Phil, and she mentioned that she might like to
meet him. Jim wrote Phil's number on a piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call guys,'' Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you want to meet him you will,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, who had recently graduated from Texas A&AMP;M, called Phil,
who had become an A&AMP;M coach after he finished playing there in
1978. Nancy told him that she was visiting College Station for a
friend's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother doesn't make dates for me,'' Phil told her,
agreeing to meet her Friday night to decide whether they should go
out Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy opened the door, Phil was struck by her eyes and her
smile. ``Man,'' he said to himself, ``this could be a good blind
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's version of the story, according to Phil, is that he
greeted her with, ``Hi, I'm Phil Bennett, and I'm never getting
married.'' Phil now thinks that could be true.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy moved in with Phil shortly after their engagement in 1982.
By the time they married on June 16, 1984, Phil knew that this was
the woman he couldn't live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was a product of East Texas,'' said R.C. Slocum, who was
Phil's position coach at A&AMP;M. ``Guys back in that generation were
taught to be tough guys. His dad was a pipeline worker _ a strong,
tough kind of a guy. Then Phil had older brothers, so he had to be
tough to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy was from a different background. It was a good blend.
She was really very open and gregarious. I thought she added a lot
to Phil. Where Phil had a quick temper, she was just so smooth with
everything.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   The most painful decision of his life, Phil had to make alone.
</P>
<P>
   When he burst past the security guard into the emergency room at
Mercy Health Center of Manhattan, Phil found a team of doctors and
nurses working to resuscitate his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning had entered at the base of her skull and exited
through her feet. Ron and Laura Thornton, who witnessed the strike
from their home on Meadowood, saw it blow off her jogging shoes and
knock her 6 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was burned. Her flesh was smoking. Her forehead was badly
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Phil collapsed, crying, ``Nancy, please.''
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call to longtime friend Joanne Roberts, a former
neighbor in Baton Rouge, Phil sobbed, ``I just don't know how I'm
going to live without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone with Nancy later, Phil kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. She was brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to give her two weeks to show signs of life. He
consulted specialists from around the country, found by KSU head
football coach Bill Snyder and professional golfer Jim Colbert, a
K-State graduate. Nancy once opened her eyes and her hands
flinched, but doctors said the movement was involuntary. She was
suffering trauma, electrical shock and a lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, 13 days into the vigil, Phil had life support
terminated. Four days later, Nancy died in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   It's now life after death for Phil, Sam and Maddie, who turned 9
the week after Nancy's funeral. Phil hired Naomi Beck, a Manhattan
Christian College student, as a full-time nanny, and the family has
gone into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   They are coping.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Sam said: ``Dad, every time I hear a siren and you're
at work, I get scared. You're all I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   They miss Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Phil received a certified letter from his mortgage
company threatening foreclosure. He had mistakenly assumed that
their house payments were automatically deducted from their
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Sam has needed Nancy to fix his skates, and Maddie needed her on
picture day at school, when she went through nine outfits, trying
to find the right one to wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things a mother does that you just can't replace,''
Phil said. ``You just find a way to do them. You find a way to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first football game, Sam intercepted a pass. That night,
as Phil put him to bed, Sam burst into tears. ``I wish Mom could
have been here to see me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil still picks up the telephone to call Nancy before realizing
that she's not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things I just don't know if I can do,'' said Phil,
who has kept Nancy's closet untouched. `I've run a bunch of
marathons, but I have not worked out since Aug. 11. I just can't
bring myself to do it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, the family prays the same prayer: ``God, please
keep us together as a family, draw us closer and watch over Mom.''
It used to be Nancy Bennett who kept watch over her family. Maybe
she still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel her every day,'' Phil said. ``You just wonder: Where
does it go from here? We don't know.''

LIGHTNING SHATTERS KSU COACH'S LIFE 
(ATTN: KAN) 
(DUPLICATION WARNING: STORY IS BEING FILED IN ``A'' AND ``S''
CATEGORIES)
</HEADLINE>

By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. _ Phil Bennett might never have married Nancy
Harris if he hadn't been afraid of losing her.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was an emergency room nurse at John Peter Smith Hospital
in Fort Worth, Texas. Phil was an assistant football coach at Texas
Christian University. They had dated for a year, and Nancy wanted
to know whether they had a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready,'' Phil repeatedly told her.
</P>
<P>
   Phil was sharing an apartment with Dave McGinnis _ now the
defensive coordinator for the NFL Arizona Cardinals _ and enjoying
life as a 26-year-old bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   Then the young doctors at the hospital began taking an interest
in Nancy. Soon, over enchiladas and chalupas at the Original
Mexican Eats Cafe in west Fort Worth, Phil popped the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go look at a ring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he bought that ring in 1982, he never imagined that ``Till
death do us part'' would come so soon. How do you live without your
wife of 15 years? How do you raise your two children without their
mother? How do you continue the transient life of a football coach
without the one who kept you together?
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bennett, 41, died Aug. 28, 17 days after being struck by
lightning while jogging in a subdivision under development near the
family home in Manhattan, where Phil is now an assistant at Kansas
State University. Three months later, the homes in the middle-class
neighborhood are all complete. But how do you build a new life?
</P>
<P>
   The worst times are at night. Sleep doesn't come easily or stay
long. Exhausted, Phil forces himself to bed at 1 a.m. but wakes
within three hours.
</P>
<P>
   When he rolls over, she's not there.
</P>
<P>
   His sentences are frequently left unfinished. He still uses the
present tense when talking about her. His tears won't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you keep saying: `Is this a dream? Am I going
to wake up? Is someone going to tell me this isn't happening?' ''
he said. ``I miss her. I'm lonely for her. I don't know how you
describe it. Maybe the word is `void.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His last memory of his wife is of her kissing him on her way out
the door. ``I love you. I'll see you tonight,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   How could he have known there wouldn't be a tonight? ___
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bennett played the same lottery numbers every week. They
included the jersey numbers of her favorite players, among them the
No. 9 of linebacker Dat Nguyen, formerly of Texas A&AMP;M University
and now with the Dallas Cowboys; the No. 48 of former Aggie safety
Rich Coady; and the No. 12 of onetime Louisiana State University
safety Anthony Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Her chances of winning a $1 million lottery _ 2 million to 1 _
were about the same as those of being killed by lightning. From
1959 to 1998, Kansas had 59 lightning fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy jogged every morning before getting the children off to
school. She ran and walked a four-mile course that her husband had
helped her lay out.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:45 a.m. on Aug. 11, Phil woke her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nance, are you going to jog?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she replied. ``I've got to.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil was getting out of the shower when he heard a loud noise.
Unsure whether it was thunder or a military exercise at nearby Fort
Riley, he looked out the window. It was raining.
</P>
<P>
   He left his son, Sam, 11, and daughter, Maddie, 8, sleeping
downstairs and jumped in his car to look for Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   It started raining harder as he slowly traced her route. He
passed a police cruiser with its lights flashing but didn't think
anything of it. He was sure that Nancy had taken cover in one of
the newly framed houses on Meadowood Drive.
</P>
<P>
   With no sign of Nancy, Phil turned back. He drove up to the
policeman and rolled down his window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer, have you seen a good-looking blonde jogging?''
</P>
<P>
   The policeman's answer was in his pause _ and in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, do you know that woman?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At that instant, I thought: `What you've always been afraid of
has happened. My life has changed forever,' '' Phil said. ``It was
the most helpless feeling I've ever experienced in my life.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's address book was as thick as Phil's playbook. She never
met a stranger. Iva Houchin, a waitress at the Original Mexican
Eats Cafe, and Earl Pearson, the manager of an Albertson's grocery
in Baton Rouge, La., were among those she kept in contact with even
as Phil's job took them to TCU, Iowa State, Purdue, LSU, Texas A&AMP;M,
Oklahoma and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was because she was such a good talker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if she was gone two or three weeks, a month _
when she came back in, it was like it was yesterday,'' Houchin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nancy rarely complained, she never grew comfortable
with their migrant lifestyle. In his 20-year career, Phil has
worked at one high school and seven colleges, never staying
anywhere longer than five years.
</P>
<P>
   The move from Fort Worth took the biggest emotional toll. After
15 years away from her family, Nancy had come home again in 1997
when Phil signed on as TCU's defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   But when head coach Pat Sullivan was fired after the disastrous
1-10 season of 1997, Phil was on the move to the University of
Oklahoma. Only this time, Nancy stayed behind. With Sooners head
coach John Blake on the hot seat, Phil figured that his tenure
there as defensive backs coach was a whistle-stop. He rented an
apartment in Norman, Okla.; Nancy and the children remained in Fort
Worth. They made the three-hour drive every Friday and returned
home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I sort of kick myself,'' Phil said. ``You only have so
much time, and being away from Nancy and the kids was hard on both
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Phil took an assistant's job at Kansas State, which
was 41-8 for the previous four seasons; he was promoted to
defensive coordinator the next month. Although Nancy was excited
about the opportunity to reunite their family in Manhattan, she was
sad about leaving her parents, Dr. O.T. and Mildred Harris, her two
sisters and her two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The last time any of them saw Nancy, she and Phil had just
returned from an Alaskan cruise with the other K-State coaches and
their wives. On the cruise, Phil and Nancy were inseparable,
watching the whales, walking hand in hand on the ship's deck and
planning their future in Manhattan. &QL;

   HEART DISEASE AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   A glossary
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Atherosclerosis: A condition also known as hardening of the
arteries. It's caused by thick, hard deposits of plaque that
gradually narrow artery walls. Plaque forms when too much
cholesterol, or fatty substances, circulates in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cholesterol: A soft, fatlike substance in cells that helps
form cell membranes, hormones and tissues. Cholesterol is made in
the body, mostly in the liver, or absorbed from animal products we
eat: meat, poultry, dairy products or eggs. When cholesterol levels
in the bloodstream build up, plaque begins to form and to narrow
blood vessels. Generally, an overall cholesterol reading below 200
is desirable. People with moderately high readings, of 200 to 239,
have twice the risk of a heart attack as those with readings below
200.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High-density lipoproteins (HDL): Scientists think that this
``good'' cholesterol carries excess cholesterol away from the
arteries and back to the liver, where it is passed from the body. A
high HDL level seems to lower the risk of a heart attack, while a
low HDL seems to raise it. Generally, desirable HDL readings range
from 40 to 50 for men and 50 to 60 for women; a reading below 35 is
low.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Low-density lipoproteins (LDL): When high levels of this
``bad'' cholesterol circulate in the blood, it can slowly build up
on the walls of the arteries to the heart and brain. With other
substances, it forms plaque, which can block blood flow and cause a
heart attack or stroke. An LDL reading below 130 is desirable, 130
to 159 is borderline high, and 160 or above is high.
</P>
<P>
   Risk factors
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Age _ for men, 45 or older; for women, 55 or older.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Race. African-Americans have moderate high blood pressure
twice as often as whites, and severe high blood pressure three
times as often.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A family history of heart disease. If two ``first-degree''
relatives _ mother, father, brother or sister _ have had heart
disease before age 55, your risk rises by 53 percent; one
first-degree relative with heart disease raises your risk by 36
percent. If a first-degree relative suffered cardiovascular disease
at any age, there's an added risk of 6 percent to 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Smoking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diabetes.

 &HT;    Genetics can increase risk even in those who exercise, eat right
and don't smoke
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gary Peter's family history came calling one hot,
syrupy summer morning two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Knock. Knock.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old felt a shoulder pain as he got ready to go to
work. The day before, he had felt nauseous after a run. It was
during his morning shower that Peter's ticking genetic time bomb
really exploded. A heart attack got him, just as it had his mom and
dad. Hours later, a gurney whisked him toward emergency angioplasty
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my parents have heart disease, so I knew I was
predisposed to it,'' said Peter, a Georgia Tech professor. ``But I
didn't think it would strike at such a young age.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-10, 170 pounds, fit, active, a nonsmoker who ate a
low-fat diet, Peter was not your typical ``heart attack waiting to
happen.'' Even the paramedics and emergency room doctors thought
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were resistant to believing I was actually having a heart
attack. They didn't even turn on the siren and they drove side
streets to the hospital. My wife beat them there,'' he said.
``There were no apparent risk factors other than my genetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 58 million Americans have cardiovascular disease, and of
those, half have a family history of bad hearts hanging over them,
called a genetic predisposition. The magnitude of risk increases
for a person based on how many first-degree relatives _ mother,
father, brothers, sisters _ died before age 55 or were hospitalized
for heart disease before age 55. If two or more relatives did, risk
increases 53 percent; one relative, 35 percent. If a first-degree
relative suffered cardiovascular disease at any age, there's an
added risk of 6 percent to 16 percent of suffering cardiovascular
problems, a 1986 University of Utah School of Medicine study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetics is one of the most important predictors of heart
disease,'' says Dr. Laurence S. Sperling, cardiologist at the Emory
HealthCare Heart Center and medical director of the Emory HeartWise
Risk Reduction Program. ``The first-degree relatives of mom, dad
and siblings are most important to consider: Were they smokers or
obese? Some people can do everything right _ eat right, exercise
and not smoke, yet they still develop heart disease at a young
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point _ Peter, one of Sperling's patients. Peter says
his father was a longtime smoker and his mother had high blood
pressure. Both had elevated cholesterol, something Peter assumed he
was controlling with a good diet and exercise. However, the cause
of his heart attack was a complete blockage of a major heart
artery. A blood clot had broken off from the fatty cholesterol
plaque forming within the artery.
</P>
<P>
   Peter's overall cholesterol was 250 _ a reading of 240 or over
immediately raises a red flag for doctors, who usually order more
tests. But Peter says he didn't know his cholesterol was so high.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the first sign of high cholesterol is a serious cardiac
event, the reason why heart disease and high blood pressure are
often called ``the silent killer.'' According to the American Heart
Association, 57 percent of men and 64 percent of women who die
suddenly from heart disease had no previous symptoms. Overall,
about one-third of people suffering heart attacks die.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the luck of personal family history, individuals can
still do plenty to keep themselves from becoming a heart attack or
stroke statistic. Maybe your dad smoked _ increasing his heart
disease odds by 300 percent, or maybe your brother was obese, ate
high-fat food, and acquired Type 2 diabetes, a highly lethal
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 50 percent of risk of heart disease comes from genes and
50 percent-plus comes from environmental factors,'' Sperling says.
</P>
<P>
   These are the things you do or don't do every day, such as
smoking, taking a brisk walk or other regular physical activity,
keeping your weight under control, or gobbling potato chips at
lunch, hamburgers for dinner and never, ever turning down birthday
cake at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, yes, we know we are tempting fate by playing Russian
roulette with these diabetes and heart-disease risk factors. This
is where hospital and health care preventative heart disease
programs come in, such as the ones at Emory, Piedmont, St. Joseph's
and Northside hospitals _ Atlanta's major cardiac wellness centers.
</P>
<P>
   Emory's HeartWise program, going into its third year, not only
works with people who've suffered heart problems, but those who
don't yet feel any symptoms. Helping people with heart disease
family risk learn how to lower risk factors they can control is a
growing trend in cardiovascular care.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change your genetics,'' Sperling says. ``But you can
greatly alter your genes reaching their potential. Heart disease is
the No. 1 cause of premature death in this country, but people
still seem to be under the impression it's a disease of old men.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics belie that. Though only 1 in 10 women will
develop breast cancer if they live to age 75 (1 in 8 if she lives
past age 85), 1 in 2 women will have heart disease. And 35 percent
of all cardiovascular disease deaths are premature _ before age 75.
</P>
<P>
   At age 39, Sheryl Winn knew she was at risk because of her
weight, high cholesterol and family history. But even Winn, a
former cardiac nurse, didn't know just how susceptible she was to
ending up like her mom and dad. Her mother died following a balloon
angioplasty to open clogged heart arteries, and her father, now 74,
underwent two bypass surgeries following a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test revealed Winn had high levels of homocysteine, an
amino acid that damages arterial walls if it concentrates in the
blood. Winn's condition is caused by one of 38 genes identified as
heart disease markers. Folic acid supplements help control it. Winn
also is using her treadmill at home and has altered her meals after
a dietitian scrutinized what she ate. She's lost 43 pounds and is
trying to lose 50 more and lower her cholesterol before resorting
to prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention is the real key with cardiac disease,'' says Winn,
who teaches nursing at Emory University and lives in Dallas. ``Any
time you have a heart attack, you lose some function of the heart
muscle and you never get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn is signing up for all the HeartWise tests and consultants,
even though her health insurance is not picking up the entire tab,
a common occurrence when it comes to heart prevention costs.
Checking insurance coverage is part of the HeartWise services.
Sliding scale fees can be charged based on income, and a
scholarship fund established by patients with insurance helps those
lacking coverage. Medicare does cover most costs.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance paid for Winn's initial visits and blood work, but not
her nutrition counseling, and it probably won't pitch in for her to
join the clinic's exercise facility, she says. Winn also expects to
be left with the $500 bill to undergo an Ultrafast CT scan that
could spot plaque forming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having any symptoms now of heart disease, but I want
to know if there was some potential blockage because then I can do
something about it,'' Winn says.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing risk for heart disease is done with a complete family
history and physical examination. Patients can also be put on a
treadmill tethered to a heart monitor to test cardiac function, or
undergo an echocardiogram, where they hear the drum of their heart
and see the heart muscle. An action plan follows, tailored to each
individual through appointments with exercise physiologists,
dietitians and doctors who may prescribe drugs to treat
cholesterol, blood pressure or diabetes. Many classes are also
offered for reducing stress, quitting smoking and managing blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Three floors above the Emory heart clinic is a new workout
facility chock-full of every conceivable exercise machine to raise
a person's heart rate, along with weight machines. Yoga,
cardio-kickboxing and aerobic classes are also offered. A nurse
keeps close tabs on patients, but the facility also is used by
healthy Emory employees who pay a user fee.
</P>
<P>
   At Piedmont Hospital's Fuqua Heart Center of Atlanta, two
programs are geared toward those who've already experienced a
cardiac event: Inpatient education and 12 weeks of early outpatient
classes that include exercise, EKG treadmill monitoring,
nutritional assessment and stress and smoking cessation classes.
</P>
<P>
   A third program is geared toward prevention for those with
heart-disease risk factors or for individuals with at least three
months' time since their cardiac event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's good for people with risk factors to be in with
people who've undergone heart attacks or cardiac surgery,'' said
Dr. John Cantwell, Piedmont's co-director of preventive cardiology
and cardiac rehab. ``They learn from one another.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's Hospital offers a ``Heart School,'' open to the
public to learn how to ward off heart disease. It also sees
hundreds of people at its wellness center who haven't experienced
any cardiac symptoms and want to keep it that way, as well as those
who've undergone bypasses and heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of obese people and people with hypertension,''
says Mark Ervin, St. Joseph's wellness/rehab manager, ``but the
staff is qualified to take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heart heritage that caught up to Peter, he says he
believes he can beat, or at least stall, the disease from rapping
again on his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a scientist, I may look at it differently. I know
there's a genetic component, but it's not cancer, it's heart
disease,'' says Peter, whose cholesterol has dropped to 170 through
exercise, dietary changes and medication that's monitored through
the Emory HeartWise program. ``At least with heart disease, you
have more self-control over it. You can play a more active role.
It's a day-to-day disease. I have to be vigilant.''

xxx In Manhattan. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They had flown back in to Dallas, but Phil had to go on to
Manhattan because of a meeting, so Nancy came by the house about
6:30 one morning,'' said Phil's brother, Jim, head football coach
at Irving High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called us on her cell phone outside our door. She was so
excited. We went downstairs and fixed coffee. She came in, and she
said: `I've only got 15 minutes. I've got to go get the kids at my
parents' in Alvarado.' About three hours later, she left. It was
nonstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was used to saying goodbye, but this time was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were standing on the doorstep and hugging and crying like
we were never going to see each other again,'' said Tory Dickey,
the wife of University of North Texas coach Darrell Dickey and one
of Nancy's best friends. ``But it just would never cross your mind
in a million years that you wouldn't.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   Phil and Nancy met on a blind date in 1981. Jim met Nancy's
sister, Suzan, when both were coaching at Alvarado. Jim told Nancy
about his brother, Phil, and she mentioned that she might like to
meet him. Jim wrote Phil's number on a piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call guys,'' Nancy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you want to meet him you will,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, who had recently graduated from Texas A&AMP;M, called Phil,
who had become an A&AMP;M coach after he finished playing there in
1978. Nancy told him that she was visiting College Station for a
friend's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother doesn't make dates for me,'' Phil told her,
agreeing to meet her Friday night to decide whether they should go
out Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   When Nancy opened the door, Phil was struck by her eyes and her
smile. ``Man,'' he said to himself, ``this could be a good blind
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy's version of the story, according to Phil, is that he
greeted her with, ``Hi, I'm Phil Bennett, and I'm never getting
married.'' Phil now thinks that could be true.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy moved in with Phil shortly after their engagement in 1982.
By the time they married on June 16, 1984, Phil knew that this was
the woman he couldn't live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil was a product of East Texas,'' said R.C. Slocum, who was
Phil's position coach at A&AMP;M. ``Guys back in that generation were
taught to be tough guys. His dad was a pipeline worker _ a strong,
tough kind of a guy. Then Phil had older brothers, so he had to be
tough to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy was from a different background. It was a good blend.
She was really very open and gregarious. I thought she added a lot
to Phil. Where Phil had a quick temper, she was just so smooth with
everything.'' ___
</P>
<P>
   The most painful decision of his life, Phil had to make alone.
</P>
<P>
   When he burst past the security guard into the emergency room at
Mercy Health Center of Manhattan, Phil found a team of doctors and
nurses working to resuscitate his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning had entered at the base of her skull and exited
through her feet. Ron and Laura Thornton, who witnessed the strike
from their home on Meadowood, saw it blow off her jogging shoes and
knock her 6 feet into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy was burned. Her flesh was smoking. Her forehead was badly
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Phil collapsed, crying, ``Nancy, please.''
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call to longtime friend Joanne Roberts, a former
neighbor in Baton Rouge, Phil sobbed, ``I just don't know how I'm
going to live without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone with Nancy later, Phil kissed her.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. She was brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to give her two weeks to show signs of life. He
consulted specialists from around the country, found by KSU head
football coach Bill Snyder and professional golfer Jim Colbert, a
K-State graduate. Nancy once opened her eyes and her hands
flinched, but doctors said the movement was involuntary. She was
suffering trauma, electrical shock and a lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, 13 days into the vigil, Phil had life support
terminated. Four days later, Nancy died in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   It's now life after death for Phil, Sam and Maddie, who turned 9
the week after Nancy's funeral. Phil hired Naomi Beck, a Manhattan
Christian College student, as a full-time nanny, and the family has
gone into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   They are coping.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Sam said: ``Dad, every time I hear a siren and you're
at work, I get scared. You're all I have left.''
</P>
<P>
   They miss Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Phil received a certified letter from his mortgage
company threatening foreclosure. He had mistakenly assumed that
their house payments were automatically deducted from their
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Sam has needed Nancy to fix his skates, and Maddie needed her on
picture day at school, when she went through nine outfits, trying
to find the right one to wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things a mother does that you just can't replace,''
Phil said. ``You just find a way to do them. You find a way to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first football game, Sam intercepted a pass. That night,
as Phil put him to bed, Sam burst into tears. ``I wish Mom could
have been here to see me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil still picks up the telephone to call Nancy before realizing
that she's not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things I just don't know if I can do,'' said Phil,
who has kept Nancy's closet untouched. `I've run a bunch of
marathons, but I have not worked out since Aug. 11. I just can't
bring myself to do it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, the family prays the same prayer: ``God, please
keep us together as a family, draw us closer and watch over Mom.''
It used to be Nancy Bennett who kept watch over her family. Maybe
she still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel her every day,'' Phil said. ``You just wonder: Where
does it go from here? We don't know.''

 &HT;    Workplace a prime spot for injuries to teenagers
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About once a week, Dr. Anitha Leonard, an urgent-care physician,
treats a teenager who's been injured on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The most common problems: burns caused by steamers and fryers,
cuts caused by slicers or knives, and sprains caused by slick
floors and heavy boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Although summer is the peak season for such accidents, fall is a
good time for parents to evaluate their teenagers' working
conditions. More than 80 percent of high school students work at
some point during the school year, according to a 1998 National
Academies report on child labor. And in the fall, students are more
likely to be fatigued, as a result of being overloaded from school
and extracurricular activities, as well as struggling with cold and
flu season.
</P>
<P>
   Add a job and you have potential for trouble, doctors and safety
experts say. That's particularly true in agriculture, where
children are more likely to be helping with the harvest, according
to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.
</P>
<P>
   A NIOSH study that examined injuries between 1980 and 1989 found
that 44 percent of job-related deaths of children occurred during
the summer. But almost 25 percent took place in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 children die at work every year, many in motor vehicle,
agricultural and construction accidents. But many more _ around
200,000 annually _ are injured in more commonplace settings, such
as restaurants, grocery stores and stop-and-go markets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Leonard treated a teenager whose forearm had been
severely burned by a steamer, a scalding that required a trip to
the burn center and follow-up physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand how serious these injuries can
be,'' said Leonard, who rotates between Grady Memorial Hospital and
Children's Health Care of Atlanta at Egleston. ``And, often, I
don't think parents have any idea about the conditions their
children are working in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Castillo of NIOSH agrees. She cited an ``incredibly sad''
case in which a teenager suffocated after a trench collapsed on
him. His father, familiar with construction, had no idea his son
was working in the trench _ ``and said, if he had known, there
would have been no way he would have let him do such a dangerous
job,'' Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
   So what should parents and their children look for in a
workplace?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  First, parents should discuss the kind of work and how many
hours the youngster should be working. Federal law dictates, for
example, that 14- and 15-year-olds may not work more than 18 hours
a week when school is in session, and not more than three hours a
night on school nights.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Parents and their children should examine the workplace for
any obvious dangers. Does equipment have safety features? Is the
floor wet and slippery? How many other workers have been injured on
the job? Also, when they're hired, teenagers should be told the
specific jobs they should not be performing because of their age,
in accordance with state and federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Young workers should receive proper training in doing the job
correctly and safely. And they should be supervised _ even if they
don't like it _ to make sure they've mastered safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The employer should make the worker aware of the proper
reporting and filing procedure should the worker be injured on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Workers' Compensation provides information
and answers questions about workers' compensation benefits. For an
informational pamphlet or to ask a question, call 404-656-3818 in
the Atlanta area or 1-800-533-0682 elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There are jobs that the federal government says teenagers should
not be doing, period. They include driving a car or operating a
forklift; operating a circular saw, box crusher, meat slicer or
bakery machine; working in wrecking, demolition, excavation or
roofing; working in mining, logging or a sawmill; working in meat
packing or slaughtering; working where there is exposure to
radiation; and working where explosives are manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   And if your child is 14 or 15 years old, he or she may not bake
or cook on the job (except at a serving counter); operate
power-driven machinery; work on a ladder or scaffold; work in a
warehouse; work in construction; or load or unload a truck,
railroad car or conveyor.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    For mom, daughter, heart disease is family affair
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patty Patterson is one bad-hearted woman. Not because of a mean
streak, but a gene streak.
</P>
<P>
   Like her grandfathers and father before her, she suffered a
heart attack. Hers came at age 37, four years ago. Her father's
heart attack killed him at age 53, her father's father's heart got
him at 65, and her mother's father died at age 51.
</P>
<P>
   And her mother had surgery at age 60 for five blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reckon I got all the bad genes,'' says Patterson, who lives
in Dalton and works in the shipping department of Oriental Weavers.
``But I had no idea heart disease was hereditary. If I had even a
clue about it, I would have taken better care of myself. At a young
age is when people need to know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson's mother, Betty McPherson, never smoked and thought
she wasn't at risk. ``Then I went in for a routine checkup and
ended up getting checked into the hospital,'' says McPherson, now
69. ``My arteries are still clear. I'm trying to exercise and eat
the right things, but it is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson has undergone one heart bypass surgery and three
cardiac angioplasties, including one that left a tiny wire tube,
called a stent, to help keep her blocked artery open.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Patterson has been dealt a bad hand of genetic cards.
But what about those eight cigarettes she lights every day and the
40 pounds she needs to lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``After my first heart attack I did lose a bunch of weight, but
then I gained it back,'' she says. ``And I have cut down on
smoking. Actually, I feel better now than I have in a long time.
... I do play golf and walk on my treadmill three times a week, and
I do lots of yardwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm just a time bomb and if I don't take hold, I won't
even see 50. I know that. But you just can't think about it all the
time.''

 &HT;    Middle school years are now a pressure cooker
 &HT;    By Maureen Downey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Modern middle school is a mystery to me. I attended first
through eighth grades at St. Catherine's in Elizabeth, N.J. The
melodramatics of adolescence were kept to a minimum by a staff of
all-seeing nuns. The only rap music we heard was the sound of
rulers on knuckles when we misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
   We were indoctrinated. Instead of waiting for phone calls from
boys, we awaited our calling from The Big Guy. Today's
sixth-graders yearn to be Britney Spears. We wanted to be St.
Bernadette.
</P>
<P>
   When I see the social pressures at my 11-year-old daughter's
middle school, I think there were advantages to the school-as-jail
concept. With less leeway, we also had less stress.
</P>
<P>
   There were no status-symbol clothes from the Limited Too and the
Gap to separate the cool from the uncool. We were all sentenced to
dismal earth-green jumpers, geeky knee socks and saddle shoes.
There was no jockeying for the power table in the lunchroom: We ate
at our desks.
</P>
<P>
   A certain esprit de corps ensued; we were unified in our
oppression. Ultimately it may have been a kinder, more democratic
system.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy is easier in a small, homogenous world. My school
graduated only 38 eighth-graders. With so few kids, there was no A
and B list.
</P>
<P>
   I know that dealing with social pressure is part of life. I just
wish that lesson didn't have to come so early.
</P>
<P>
   Kids will survive trials, tribulations of social world
</P>
<P>
   By Bo Emersonc. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Middle school is a roller coaster, a time of high passion,
explosive tempers and wild mood swings. But I hope that as she
becomes accustomed to the environment, Maureen will adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's Maureen who is freaking out. Our daughter Molly
seems to approach the pitfalls of middle school with more
equanimity than her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen's haloed adolescence was a rarity. My public school
experience was closer to the norm, I think. There were hundreds in
my class, a bewildering flow chart of jocks, wonks, freaks,
greasers, techies, stoners, etc.
</P>
<P>
   You swam or you sank. Your social success or failure occurred
totally out of the view of your parents. I can't recall a single
conversation with my folks about the betrayals and back-stabbings
of daily life. I had troubles, but so did everyone, and there
wasn't much an adult could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   This is good to remember, when, as an adult, I'm tempted to fix
the world for my children. You can't create a utopia of equality
among burgeoning teens. You can't insist that no one be excluded
from the cool table at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Even, I imagine, in single-sex parochial schools, young folks
will run the gantlet of social exclusion and/or acceptance. Most
will discover that popularity is a fleeting thing.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen has, more than once, suggested that we intervene, speak
to the parents of another girl or a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   I've persuaded her to refrain. Let's work out those
misunderstandings in the Balkans first. Then we can progress to the
more complicated issues, such as who's going with whom to the
football game.

 &HT;    More TV for outdoor pandas
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You arrive in this country on all fours, don't speak a
lick of English, and what happens?
</P>
<P>
   You become a cultural phenomenon and a TV star.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo Atlanta pandas Yang Yang and Lun Lun went out in the sun for
the first time Monday, and into the glare of ABC's ``Good Morning
America,'' and NBC's ``Later Today.'' They're scheduled for ``CBS
This Morning'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was the first time Zoo Atlanta officials opened the
gates to the bear pair's outdoor habitat, the pandas spent a great
deal of time doing what things on all fours tend to do: sniff
around.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials have been trying their best, despite intense media
interest, to ease the bears' burden of celebrity since they arrived
from China 11 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very active,'' said Zoo marketing director Gail Eaton.
``They played to the cameras. Yang Yang has been initiating lots of
play, and seems to love it outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, both pandas spent lots of time climbing on
outdoor sculptures made of logs. And there were hopeful signs that
our new royal couple would do what is expected of them, one day
start a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing things that indicate a very positive
relationship,'' Eaton said. ``It's very cute.''

 &HT;    Fame fails to penetrate the soul behind `Wit'
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sunday, as workmen hoisted live Christmas trees
onto the awning of Macy's on Herald Square, a shy Atlanta
kindergarten teacher was flying into Manhattan for a quick weekend.
She was here to see a play and visit friends. By today, she planned
to be back in her classroom at John Hope Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing very unusual about that. Except that this teacher wrote
the play. And the play, her first, won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize. And
now the teacher, 38-year-old Margaret Edson _ a sort of modern-day
Emily Dickinson in a denim jacket _ is living half in the world of
phonics and penmanship, and half in the world of the famous writer.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Edson was onstage Sunday night with a New York
Times reporter and baldheaded actress Judith Light (formerly of
television's ``Who's the Boss''), who plays a brainy John Donne
scholar dying with ovarian cancer in the drama ``Wit.'' While the
conversation at this post-performance Q&AMP;A sallies back and forth
between questions of craft and technique, death and metaphysics,
Edson is telling a giggling audience how she's teaching her flock
of 5-year-old charges back home how to make the
</P>
<P>
   letter ``M.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she's been telling them this: ``I don't like just the
two bumps. I like a straight stroke down and then a bump and then a
bump.''
</P>
<P>
   She sketches the letter in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I like the two bumps to be the same size.'' Her jaw drops
open and her tongue curls up in the disbelief of an overwhelmed
child. ``And I said, `Now call me particular, but I like them (the
two bumps) to be touching.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then one of my students said: `Particulaaaaar!'''
</P>
<P>
   So now they call her Miss Particular. And Edson _ an intense,
intellectually rigorous woman who seems to hide behind her wit and
her chosen vocation _ is that. Like Vivian Bearing, her college
professor-protagonist who must submit to the pokes and probes of
her insensitive doctors, Edson has become an unwilling victim to an
inquisitive world that wants to hear all about her accidental brush
with fame.
</P>
<P>
   She's not at wit's end. But she's not exactly loving it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to have a very hard time getting a story out of
me,'' she tells a reporter over a cup of black coffee in
Virginia-Highland on Saturday, before departing for New York. ``I'm
boring. I am!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe that. Hers is one of the better literary tales of
our time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a play that was turned down by nearly every theater in
America,'' says Times culture reporter Dinitia Smith, marveling
about the work that Edson wrote in 1991while employed at a bicycle
shop in her hometown of Washington. This was before Edson got her
master's degree in literature at George Washington University,
before she became a teacher and moved to Atlanta with her partner
Linda Merrill, curator of American art at the High Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Now with talk of a movie deal in the air, with a five-city
national tour kicking off Feb. 1 in Boston (starring Light), an
original-cast production, with actress Kathleen Chalfant, early
next year in Los Angeles, and a London show scheduled for spring,
you'll be reading more about Edson and her exquisitely wrought,
emotionally exhausting drama. ``Wit'' also will be seen in Atlanta
in April, in the intimate atmosphere of the Alliance Theatre
Company's Studio space.
</P>
<P>
   ``That final moment,'' says Smith, referring to the image of
Bearing exposed in the white-hot light of death, ``beats anything I
have seen in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Her personal life is off-limits
</P>
<P>
   Edson, whose 6-foot frame lopes onto the stage in a brown velvet
skirt and jacket and cream colored blouse, has the slouchy posture
of an adolescent girl. But her dark brown eyes are that of a wise
old soul, prescient beyond her years. Like Bearing, she learned
about language beside her elderly father. By the time his middle
child was born, Peter Edson, a well-known Washington syndicated
columnist in the 1950s and '60s, was retired and living at home.
``There's a strain of writing in my family, but I wasn't aware of
it when I was growing up because nobody was doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an interior world here that keeps a discreet address.
When a reporter calls for an interview, Edson says she can't do it
on short notice, then gives in and agrees to meet for coffee.
Arriving, she smiles and apologizes for ``giving you a hard time.''
</P>
<P>
   She responds to questions about her personal life with silence,
penetrating stares, blank looks. Ask the teacher if she wants to
have children of her own, and she snaps, ``That's too personal.''
</P>
<P>
   And so she makes jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Edson says her class followed the Atlanta Braves' World Series
recently by keeping score and cutting out pictures from the
newspaper. ``That gave us good opportunities to explore feelings
and thoughts that adults cope with: disappointment, pain,
resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so newspapers really are being used in education?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the pictures,'' she quips.
</P>
<P>
   Brevity is the soul of wit.
</P>
<P>
   About the Times-sponsored talk, which has been advertised as a
forum on the impact of ``Wit'' _ ``on writing, medicine and society
at large'' _ she says, ``This is advertising copy. If the ad said,
`An obscure little play about an incomprehensible topic,' people
would not come.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the 499-seat theater is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer hasn't changed priorities
</P>
<P>
   Edson seems to have her priorities straight. ``When The New York
Times called the company manager and said, `We'd like her to do
this thing,' he said, `It has to be on a weekend, she can't miss
school.' So The New York Times is having to work around the
classroom. It was a nice feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Edson's story is that her play _ which was drawn from
her observations as a clerk in a hospital where early AZT tests
were conducted on AIDS patients _ may be her only one, a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not writing a new play,'' Edson
</P>
<P>
   says, ``I'm not sniffing around for a new
</P>
<P>
   topic either.''
</P>
<P>
   So how has her life changed since she won the Pulitzer? She
can't think of anything. No new swimming pool. No trips to Paris.
``I do have my costumes,'' she jokes about the fancy dresses she
wears to public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she has just returned from a dance class. She and Merrill
have been planting daffodil bulbs in the garden of their new
Midtown home. ``The previous owners ... were wonderful gardeners,
so we're struggling to keep up.'' After this interview, she's going
to lie on her sunny porch and take a nap. It's where she would
prefer to be _ always.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, she's been too much on airplanes. ``I have had maybe 20
speaking engagements this year. ... I'm flying a lot, so I've been
reading Shelby Foote's history of the Civil War. I'm halfway
through volume three. ... I'm looking wistfully toward the end.''
On a recent weekend, she and Merrill visited Chickamauga
battlefield near Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the theater, the evening is winding to a close. A
90-year-old woman stands up to salute Edson and says they have
something in common. ``I'm Smith '31, and you are Smith '83,'' she
tells Edson, a reference to Smith College, where Edson got her
undergraduate degree in history. In a shaking voice she tells the
playwright that she admires the play, but that she is most touched
by the fact that Edson continues to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't we all wish we had a teacher like this?'' adds the
moderator.

 &HT;    Glenn's musings compiled in book
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Glenn had just finished nearly nine days in
orbit, his first space flight since becoming the first American to
orbit the earth more than 36 years earlier. The space shuttle
Discovery had sailed spectacularly out of the sunny Florida sky,
landing with pinpoint precision on its 15,000-foot-long landing
strip at Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The crew transport vehicle, a bus-shaped truck with enormous
hydraulic legs, had pulled up to Discovery and raised its cabin
until it could nuzzle up against the orbiter's hatch. Now everybody
waited ... and waited.
</P>
<P>
   And everybody had one question: Was Glenn OK?
</P>
<P>
   At 77, Glenn was the oldest person to fly in space. Nobody was
sure how his body would hold up under earth's gravity after having
adapted to weightlessness. Could his heart take it? Could his
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   He had done well in space, happy as a puppy. ``Zero G and I feel
fine,'' he had crowed soon after entering orbit on Oct. 29, 1998,
reprising a line from his 1962 Mercury flight. He had used the line
again in a brief radio message after landing: ``One G and I feel
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So where was he? Reporters wondered as the delay stretched to
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``John Glenn: A Memoir'' (Bantam, $27) Glenn
answers the question and confirms reporters' suspicions: He was
barfing his guts out.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts who spend several days in space lose fluids as their
bodies adapt to weightlessness. When they return to earth, the lack
of fluids can make them sick. So they gulp down pints of salty
fluids just before re-entry. The salt is supposed to help the body
retain the fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn downed five 8-ounce pouches of a lemon-lime concoction he
thought he could tolerate. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it from the orbiter to the crew transport vehicle with
the rest of the crew, got unsuited, and then the stuff all came
up,'' he wrote with Nick Taylor, a New York writer.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly dehydrated, ``I was dizzy and shaky,'' he wrote. ``But
I knew one thing. I was going to walk out of there onto the runway
if it killed me.'' Eventually, Glenn climbed out and walked
unsteadily around Discovery with his crewmates.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's post-flight puke is perhaps the only event in the book
that hasn't been widely reported at one time or another. As a war
hero, test pilot, astronaut and politician, Glenn has lived a
highly publicized life.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn didn't write the book to bare his soul or correct the
public record, he said Monday from New York, where he was on a
national book tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing started about six years ago,'' he said, when
his two grandsons, Zachary and Daniel, were getting old enough to
be curious about their grandparents' youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started asking Annie and me questions about what it was
like in the Great Depression and World War II and Korea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn started carrying a tape recorder in his car, dictating any
thoughts about his past that might interest them. His musings
produced a pile of transcripts that added to bales of information
his family had collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the interest in the flight last year, as that was
building up, we decided maybe (writing a book) would be a good
thing to do,'' Glenn said. In addition to leaving a family history
for his grandchildren, he said, he thought the book might encourage
others to think about careers in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and his wife, Annie (the former Annie Castor), grew up in
New Concord, Ohio, just east of Columbus. He describes his
childhood as idyllic, with firm but doting parents and friends who
liked to roam the fields and woods. ``I never doubted even once
that I was loved,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   His father gave him his first taste of aviation when he bought
them both a ride in a WACO biplane, which was built in Troy, Ohio.
Glenn dreamed of a career in the clouds and earned his pilot's
license, but World War II set him on a path to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Navy, transferred to the Marine Corps and worked
his way into a fighter unit. He bonded with his Marine buddies, but
war was not idyllic. In his book, Glenn describes his reaction
after his first combat mission, which took his closest buddy's
life: ``I had never felt so helpless. The pent-up feelings of the
last few hours let loose, and I stood there and sobbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn survived World War II and Korea, and his later work as a
test pilot set the stage for his space career. His three-orbit
mission put Americans in orbit and laid the groundwork for future
space flights. He continued his government career with four terms
as a U.S. senator, and capped it last year with his return to
space.
</P>
<P>
   As much as flying has been a lifelong passion for Glenn _ he
still flies his own twin-engine airplane _ so has Annie. The
closest thing to a lovers' quarrel he relates in the book is her
response to his idea about flying in the space shuttle: ``What she
said, the first time I mentioned wanting to go, was `Over my dead
body.' ''

 &HT;    Pokemon phenomenon gets explained in Time
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you've been out of touch with civilization for a few
months, Time ($3.50) offers a handy guide to bring you up to speed
on Pokemon, the hottest craze since Beanie Babies. Pokemania, with
cards, video games, toys and a new blockbuster movie, has become an
addiction for some kids.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools have banned the cards, but creator Satoshi Tajiri
tells Time that Pokemon is simply everything he did as a kid rolled
into one. As a boy, he left no stone unturned in his quest for
beetles. ``Every new insect was a wonderful mystery.'' Pokemon is a
way for children to collect insects and other creatures the way he
did, Tajiri says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Overheard: Talk ($3.50) has an intriguing article on ``10
Conversations That Changed the World'' and a few other meaty
features interspersed among the movie ads and accompanying story on
the upcoming Miramax film ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' Editor Tina
Brown probably would call the shameless promotion of the film
cross-pollination; others may describe it as the blurring of ads
and editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations include Harry Truman encouraging Dean Acheson to
make a speech about the plight of Europe after World War II, a talk
that led to the Marshall Plan; John F. Kennedy's call to Coretta
Scott King offering his help after her husband was sent to jail;
and Alexander Sachs' chat with Franklin D. Roosevelt about a letter
from Albert Einstein warning of the possibility of nuclear chain
reactions using uranium that could create a powerful bomb.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The private Ryan: Vanity Fair ($3.95) is as solid as ever this
month, despite a fluffy cover story on actress Meg Ryan. (She may
appear to be the happy-go-lucky girl in ``Sleepless in Seattle''
and ``You've Got Mail,'' but she really wants to do grittier
roles.) David Margolick reports on the feud between New York Times
men Max Frankel and Abe Rosenthal, and Bryan Burrough spins an
intriguing tale about Miranda Grosvenor, a mysterious woman who
made famous men from Quincy Jones to Bob Dylan fall in love with
her after a few flirtatious telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Reconsidering Rockwell: Everyone, it seems, is jumping on the
Norman Rockwell bandwagon after decades of scorn from some art
critics. The latest is New Yorker ($3) critic Peter Schjeldahl, who
reviews the exhibit at Atlanta's High Museum and proclaims Rockwell
``a visual storyteller of genius. More than that, he was a
story-maker, a bard. He didn't illustrate Middle America. He
invented Middle America.''

MITCHELL EXPRESSES OPTIMISM THAT ULSTER DEAL IS CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ George Mitchell's mission to rescue
the Northern Ireland peace settlement, staggered last week by the
refusal of the province's largest party to endorse a blueprint
hammered out over 10 weeks of grinding talks, recovered significant
forward motion Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former U.S. senator turned Ulster mediator, made
his first public comment since the extended effort began, saying,
``I believe that the parties now understand each other's concerns
and requirements far better than before and are committed to
resolving the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am increasingly confident that a way will be found to do
so,'' he added, indicating that he expected his review to end in
success this week.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of various parties, in a demonstration staged to
restore the lapsed momentum, followed Mitchell to the podium
outside the Stormont Castle buildings, scene of the talks, to voice
positive attitudes and a desire for accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political ally of the
Irish Republican Army, said of Mitchell's statement: ``We share his
increasing confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, head of the Social Democratic and Labor Party, said,
``His confidence that we can find a way forward, to resolve this
impasse, is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Reg Empey, a senior negotiator for the Ulster Unionists,
whose rejection of an emerging deal last week had plunged the
mission into crisis, said his party ``recognizes as the events over
the weekend have illustrated, the challenges and difficulties faced
by the leadership of Sinn Fein-IRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell had called a temporary halt to discussions on Friday
morning and asked the parties to devote the weekend to reflecting
on the consequences of failure. In fact, the weekend was devoted
almost entirely to bringing pressure on the Ulster Unionists and
their embattled leader, David Trimble, to obtain party backing for
the deal brokered between them and Sinn Fein by Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   When Trimble presented the outlines of that deal to Ulster
Unionist legislators Thursday night, not enough of them supported
it to enable him to take it to the full party for the needed
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse that has held up progress in putting the April 1998
peace accord in place centers on the Ulster Unionists' refusal to
allow members of Sinn Fein into the leadership of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly unless the IRA begins disarming. The '98 agreement
only obligated the parties to try to persuade affiliated
paramilitary groups to disarm by May 2000, and Sinn Fein has
contended that the Ulster Unionist demand amounts to adding a new
condition to an agreed-upon treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As the parties praised Mitchell Monday, they in turn were
followed by John de Chastelain, the retired Canadian general in
charge of the independent commission on guerrilla disarmament,
issued his own promising assessment of the possibilities for
achieving the dismantling of arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the Mitchell review, it has produced an
atmosphere for such a dialogue. That was unthinkable until now in
the polarized politics of Northern Ireland, where sectarian
violence has claimed more than 3,300 lives in the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that has emerged from the Mitchell talks includes plans
for the naming of an IRA go-between to the de Chastelain commission
and the establishment of a verifiable disarmament timetable that
would begin at the end of January and conclude by the May deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of achieving a breakthrough in the deadlock over
disarmament that eluded negotiators in a series of marathon
sessions in the spring and summer has been replaced now by a lower
key arrangement to get to the same objective through a series of
interlocking reciprocal steps.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Mitchell laid out a choreographed sequence Monday,
with de Chastelain calling Monday afternoon on paramilitary groups
to appoint representatives to his commission and the parties
scheduled to make statements on Tuesday pledging to work together
to put the peace agreement into practice.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday, the IRA is to issue a public statement about
its commitment to the peace agreement, and on Thursday, Mitchell
will make his conclusions known, file his final report and return
to the United States.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When lobbying became a serious profession a few
decades ago, the ground rules were pretty basic. About two dozen
members of Congress decreed the way most issues were decided, and
an effective lobbyist had to cultivate a personal relationship with
at least one of them to have any real influence.
</P>
<P>
   But now lobbying has turned into a well-ordered global business,
with the influence game taking on a decidedly corporate look.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the rest of the government changed in myriad ways
in a quarter-century, and the transformation has only accelerated
with the more recent explosion of information and technology. The
capital's government affairs and public-relations businesses are
changing, too, suddenly engaging in a flurry of consolidations and
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of megafirms are being born, offering clients a full
buffet of services under one roof _ everything from public
relations, traditional lobbying, research, polling and direct-mail
canvassing to specialists who deal with drumming up grass-roots
support for issues.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most significant acquisition came this month,
when Shandwick USA bought Cassidy Cos., one of Washington's largest
and most successful public-affairs groups. The acquisition, which
was valued at $70 million to $80 million, instantly gives Shandwick
a big presence in Washington, where it was virtually unknown only a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This and the other giant firms being created have a foothold not
just in Washington, but in London and Brussels, Belgium, and
elsewhere, reflecting the new global character of regulation and
legislation, especially in the area of trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on is akin to an arms race, with everyone trying
to beef up their arsenals,'' said Anthony Podesta _ the brother of
White House chief of staff John Podesta _ who is the chairman of
podesta.com, a medium-sized lobbying firm that specializes in
high-technology clients and is being eagerly courted by some larger
firms. ``The trend toward consolidation is a very strong one, as
public relations and advertising have come to realize the benefits
of adding a government relations component.''
</P>
<P>
   Some acquisitions have already been made and others are in the
works in what is colloquially known here as ``K Street,'' a
designation that connotes the whole industry of public affairs in
much the same way that ``Wall Street'' is shorthand for the
financial trade.
</P>
<P>
   Shandwick, strictly a public-relations company, is, in turn,
owned by the Interpublic Group, a huge New York-based advertising
company.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic, along with two other global advertising companies,
the WPP Group and the Omnicom Group, now constitute the three
giants offering one-stop shopping in Washington for corporations
and interest groups seeking coordinated lobbying and public
relations campaigns. Omnicom and WPP have been steadily making
acquisitions and are said to be seeking more.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy's founder, Gerald Cassidy, a Washington lobbyist for
more than 20 years, has seen changes both sudden and gradual. In
the early days, the barons of lobbying were people like Thomas
Corcoran, a New Deal-era adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and
Clark Clifford, who began as an aide to Harry Truman and went on to
serve as defense secretary in the Johnson administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system revolved around 25 people who had the power
to get things done,'' Cassidy said in an interview in his office _
not on K Street but three blocks south on 13th Street, near the
White House. ``You had to know those people and establish your
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974, in the wake of Watergate, the caste-ridden
seniority system was scrapped in response to the demands of the
flood of newly elected reformers in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was suddenly a diffusion of power,'' Cassidy said. ``The
power moved away from the chairmen. At the same time, more issues
were being decided in Washington, and that was accompanied by an
explosion of staff here.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election in recent years of increasing numbers of
legislators who vowed fierce resistance to the Washington culture,
public affairs professionals learned that they could influence
lawmakers more effectively by whipping up sentiment beyond the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Public affairs and lobbying began to merge in campaigns in
lawmakers' home districts _ campaigns that mobilized prominent
citizens, editorial writers or simply those affected economically
to weigh in on an issue.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Cassidy recalled a campaign his company waged
beginning in 1992 to keep the proposed Sea Wolf class of nuclear
attack submarine alive. After President Bush canceled the project,
Cassidy was hired by the manufacturer, General Dynamics, whose
Electric Boat Division made the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set out to change the debate,'' he said. ``At one point we
identified every single supplier from around the country and
brought them all to Washington for a meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Those suppliers were then sent directly to their members of
Congress, not the committees that dealt with military
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassidy company also sought support from unions and oversaw
letter-writing campaigns, paid retired admirals to speak in local
districts and arranged meetings with as many editorial boards as
were willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The first tangible result was that Bill Clinton, then a
presidential candidate, came out in favor of the Seawolf. The
project was saved and is still alive, in spite of periodic raids by
congressional budget-cutters who argue that it is superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cassidy was ranked first among Washington lobbying
and public-relations firms in the amount of business it does,
edging out the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson &AMP;
Hand. Verner Liipfert is one of a handful of firms that specialize
in lobbying and constitute the other major wing of this business.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big ones are Patton, Boggs, whose partners include the
well-known lobbyist Thomas Boggs, and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP;
Feld, home to Robert Strauss, the former Democratic National
Committee chairman, and Vernon Jordan, former head of the Urban
League and prominent presidential friend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and interest groups that use such law firms find
they usually have to assemble a team of other agencies to handle
public relations, polling and the like.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of debate whether that is better or worse than
the all-under-one-roof approach. But Verner Liipfert, with
high-profile partners like the former senators Bob Dole and George
Mitchell, led the successful campaign to persuade Congress to block
federal anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Cassidy, Shandwick gets a collection of companies
that billed more than $40 million in 1998, as well as a group of
prominent political figures, including Jody Powell, President Jimmy
Carter's press secretary, and Michael Boland, a former aide to the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   It was once customary for Democrats and Republicans to lobby
separately, but that custom first broke down when Ronald Reagan was
elected while the House was still ruled by Democrats. It has pretty
much vanished with the advent of a Republican Congress and a
Democratic White House. The Cassidy group, carefully cultivating
its bipartisan influence, has become a model for other Washington
firms that combine prominent Democrats and Republicans under one
roof.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella of Cassidy companies includes the Cassidy lobbying
operation; Boland &AMP; Madigan, another lobbying firm; Powell Tate, a
public-relations firm; Frederick Schneiders Research, which offers
opinion and polling services; and Bork &AMP; Associates, which does
law-related public relations.
</P>
<P>
   While Interpublic is now an instant Washington presence, Cassidy
is suddenly connected with a company that has offices in 52
countries. The newest development in the lobbying field, experts
say, is the expansion of the European Union's effect on issues.
</P>
<P>
   To Howard Paster, the Shandwick-Cassidy merger is only the
latest round in a trend that began a decade ago, when Hill &AMP;
Knowlton gobbled up the lobbying firm Gray &AMP; Co. Paster, a former
head of congressional liaison for the Clinton administration, now
heads Hill &AMP; Knowlton, the second-largest public relations firm
both in the United States and in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hill &AMP; Knowlton is owned by WPP, which also owns the advertising
giants Ogilvy &AMP; Mather and J. Walter Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hill &AMP; Knowlton acquired the Wexler Group, a lobbying
firm with a Democratic heritage, a year after it took over Timmons
&AMP; Co., a Republican-oriented lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom has acquired such Washington public relations outfits as
Fleishman-Hilliard and Porter Novelli and Ketchum PR. Omnicom is
looking to bolster its lobbying capabilities through acquisitions,
industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to podesta.com, another firm being sought for
acquisition in Washington is Barbour, Griffith &AMP; Rogers, a
Republican lobbying firm headed by Haley Barbour, the former head
of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Paster, who spent several years trying to sway Congress as the
chief lobbyist in the Clinton administration, said that ``while
having real smart Washington people still helps greatly, it's
important to understand how changes have driven influence away from
the center.'' Lawmakers are moved, he said, by plausible coalitions
put together by professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kamber, head of the Kamber Group, which has special
expertise in labor-related issues, said the future probably means
more and more mergers. Companies have to grow to please their
stockholders, he said, and ``realistically what's happened is that
the easiest way to grow is acquire someone with clients _ it's much
faster than building up new clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamber said that in the current atmosphere of mergers, he
constantly asks himself if he can thrive as an independent or
merely survive, which means he would be looking to merge his
50-person firm with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the answer is really unclear to me,'' he said.

   BOSTON _ Plucked from the thick mud of Fort Point Channel in
October, an 18-inch-long piece of wood decorated with gold leaf and
painted with lacquer now rests in water in a Provincetown
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure hunter Barry Clifford, who discovered the pirate ship
Whydah in 1983, believes this small artifact now in his possession
might be yet another startling find: The first relic retrieved in
more than two centuries from one of the 342 chests heaved overboard
during the Boston Tea Party. The defiant event occurred Dec. 16,
1773.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from the site where the Tea Party ships were tied up,''
Clifford said, referring to a long-gone wharf just north of today's
Moakley Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the object ``exactly'' resembles the
description of a chest retrieved from the Tea Party ships that is
in the possession of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   If tests support the object's link to Boston's landmark act of
colonial defiance, Tea Party Museum general manager Don Knuuttila
said the discovery would be enormously significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a wonderful find. Certainly the possibility
exists,'' Knuuttila said. ``Things in salt water and mud can be
preserved for very, very long periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Berkland, the Boston city archeologist, said the discovery
is interesting, but that Clifford must share the find with
professional archeologists to determine if the artifact is
connected to the Tea Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obligated to share the information and to get expert
advice on it _ whether it is contacting a conservator from the
Museum of Fine Arts to do wood analysis or to do an identification
of a Revolutionary piece,'' Berkland said.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, whose 1989 request to excavate the channel was
rejected by the state as too broad, said he would present the
artifact to government archeologists for study.
</P>
<P>
   State Archeologist Brona Simon said the exact location of the
discovery, made by two divers last month, will be critical to
determining whether the object is from the Tea Party. And the
waters just off 470 Atlantic Ave., where Clifford said the find
occurred, have been dredged several times since the Revolutionary
War.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Griffin's Wharf _ where two of the three Tea Party ships
were tied up _ is now buried beneath tons of landfill under
Atlantic Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just so many considerations regarding the
possibility this is one of the tea chests _ tides, dredging of the
harbor, the reconditioning of the wharf area,'' Birkland said. ``It
depends on the context, the environment that the artifact was found
in. If it was undisturbed for a couple of hundred years in dense
silt and clay, then preservation could be quite, quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford has clashed with archeologists before. His excavation
of the Whydah off Wellfleet, which sank in 1717 and has yielded
more than 200,000 artifacts, has been criticized as being motivated
more by profit than history.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, however, has countered that his private venture
brought to light the remnants of a misty past that otherwise would
have gone unnoticed if left to public archeology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the expectation of renewed attacks, Clifford said
he is excited about the possibility of a Tea Party find. The
discovery, he added, reinforces his decade-old push to excavate
parts of Fort Point Channel and other sections of Boston Harbor,
which he describes as a ``treasure trove'' of cultural and historic
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made last month, Clifford said, by two diving
acquaintances who worked by themselves but used information that
the treasure hunter gleaned during a sonar profile of the channel's
bottom in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The divers found the wood protruding from mud near a stone
foundation in 15-foot-deep water, Clifford said. ``The guys were
very excited,'' added Clifford, who is storing the artifact in cool
water in his observation lab in Provincetown.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-inch-long piece tapers from 4 inches to 1 inch wide, he
said. Hand-painted gold leaf adorns the beveled, top edge of the
wood, Clifford added. A dark lacquer covers the outside.
</P>
<P>
   These characteristics match the description of a tea chest held
by the DAR at its Washington headquarters, Clifford said. That
chest reportedly washed ashore in Dorchester after the Tea Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weren't cranberry crates. They were highly decorated.
They were painted in gold leaf, and they were lined with either tin
or lead. What's going to happen? They're going to sink,'' Clifford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in deep mud, they'd stay perfectly preserved. And
that's what Fort Point Channel is _ deep mud. They may have floated
into the mud and eventually been covered up in silt.''
</P>
<P>
   Knuuttila, of the Tea Party Museum, said that 18-inch-long
gilded chests were stored under the captains' quarters of the Tea
Party ships. Historians do not believe the rebellious Bostonians,
disguised as Indians and brandishing ``tomahawks,'' reached that
elite-bound cargo but settled instead for hacking nondescript
crates in the main hold.
</P>
<P>
   However, Knuuttila would not rule out the chance that the
decorative chests also were dispatched to the shallow bottom and
mud flats of then-South Cove during low tide on the night of Dec.
16, 1773.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a great find,'' Knuuttila said. ``This was the
first act of true defiance that the colonists got involved in. They
all could have been shot.''

EX-NURSE SENTENCED TO 360 YEARS IN PRISON FOR HOSPITAL DEATHS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   CHICAGO _ Orville Lynn Majors will spend the rest of his life in
prison for the murders of six patients at a rural hospital in
Indiana where he had been a licensed practical nurse. Majors,
suspected of killing as many as 100 patients by lethal injection,
was sentenced Monday to six terms of 60 years each. He will not be
eligible for parole for at least 180 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At long last, may the souls of Mary Ann Alderson, Dorothea
Dixon, Luella Hopkins, Margaret Hornick, Freddie Dale Wilson, Derek
Maxwell and Cecil Smith rest in peace,'' said Judge Ernest E.
Yelton, naming the seven patients for whose deaths Majors was
prosecuted. The jury was unable to decide whether Majors was guilty
of killing Smith, but convicted him on Oct. 17 of killing the other
six.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual string of deaths was noticed in 1993, soon after
Majors was hired as a nurse at Vermillion County Hospital in
Clinton, 90 miles west of Indianapolis. Majors was fired in 1995,
but not charged until 1997. Investigators who reviewed patient
records said that as many as 100 patients had died suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   In more than five weeks of testimony, prosecutors presented
little direct evidence that Majors killed the patients, only vials
of potassium chloride and syringes found at a house where he once
lived. Prosecutors, who relied on testimony that Majors was often
alone with the patients soon before they died, said that the deaths
were consistent with potassium injections, which stop the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were not allowed to present testimony about the
larger number of deaths, because Yelton said it would confuse the
jury and prolong the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty because of the higher
cost of prosecuting a death penalty case.
</P>
<P>
   After neither the prosecutors nor defense attorneys made a
sentencing recommendation, the judge lectured Majors, calling his
crimes ``a paragon of evil at its most wicked.''
</P>
<P>
   Majors, 38, of Linton, Ind., did not react to the verdicts, but
looked down. His family has said that he was made a scapegoat for
shoddy medical practices at the hospital, and was demonized because
he is bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   Families of the victims testified Monday to their loss, and then
cried as the judge sentenced Majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Majors, if you don't want the fruit of sin, then stay out
of the devil's orchard,'' said Derek Maxwell's wife, Kathryn.

FAILED GYROSCOPE PUTS HUBBLE INTO SLUMBER; REPAIR MISSION NEXT
MONTH 
 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The fourth of six gyroscopes aboard the orbiting
Hubble Space Telescope has faltered, forcing an abrupt halt to all
celestial observations and lending new urgency to a December space
shuttle repair mission, NASA said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spacewalking astronauts have trained to replace all six of the
gyroscopes and make other repairs during the 10-day flight of the
shuttle Discovery. The shuttle is to lift off with a crew of seven,
including a quartet of spacewalkers, on Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's failure left the 13-ton, 43-foot long telescope with
only two operable gyroscopes. At least three are required to carry
out observations of stars, galaxies and other celestial phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The high-revving gyroscopes are among the most crucial
components of the telescope's pointing system, which enables
ground-based astronomers to aim and lock the space telescope onto
distant, faint objects for lengthy observations.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating additional gyroscope losses, NASA in March
announced an unscheduled servicing call by shuttle astronauts,
weeks after a third Hubble gyroscope faltered. The gyroscopes were
designed for periodic replacement. NASA places the gyroscope
replacement portion of the upcoming $205 million mission at $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   The next scheduled shuttle visit to Hubble had been planned for
mid-2000. Initially, the agency planned to move the flight to
mid-October, but that changed with the July launching of the
shuttle Columbia with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after liftoff, Columbia experienced an electrical short
that was traced to insulation damage on internal wiring. The
finding forced a suspension of all shuttle flights until Discovery,
Endeavour, Atlantis and Columbia could be inspected and repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery was towed to its launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space
Center in Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the latest gyroscope failure forced the space
telescope into an electronic slumber called a ``safe mode.'' The
operating mode ensures that the telescope continues to generate
electricity for its scientific equipment and flight controls,
though it is unable to point at celestial targets.
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscope stopped after experiencing a sudden power surge.
The previous failures followed successive electrical
irregularities, some spanning several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores the wisdom of scheduling this call-up service
mission,'' said David Leckrone, the Hubble's senior project
scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
where the observatory is managed. ``We will only lose about three
weeks of science observations. Had we not split the mission and
proceeded with our June 2000 mission we would be facing a
seven-month interruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to replacing all six gyroscopes next month,
spacewalking astronauts plan to install a faster flight computer, a
solid state data recorder, a new transmitter, another large
guidance device as well as new external insulation.

THE FACE BEHIND THE FICTION IN `DUTCH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' makes clear,
this man is an enigma.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart, but a bit shifty; quick-witted, but perhaps not as
intellectually deep as he'd like you to believe. Certainly an
actor, someone who measures each word for effect as well as
meaning. And when the going gets tough and the questions get
tougher, he's a master at answers that sound good but say little.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not describing Ronald Reagan, but Edmund Morris, the
author of ``Dutch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected controversy,'' the 59-year-old Morris said in his
room in Dallas' tony Adolphus Hotel, in the middle of a monthlong
national promotional tour. ``I expected the method by which I wrote
this book to create heated discussion. But I offer no apology.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those, especially critics, who say Morris owes an
apology. Fourteen years after he accepted a $3 million advance from
Random House to write a definitive Reagan biography, and after the
president allowed him unprecedented access to the White House
during the final years of his administration, Morris shocked the
literary world in October by turning out a 750-page tome in which
he inserted himself as a fictional character. Make-believe has
never been considered an element in political biographies,
especially from an author who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1980 for
his study of the early career of Theodore Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Reagan was so complex, so baffling. I thought it was
impossible he could be so simple in one sense, and yet also one of
the most important presidents in recent memory,'' Morris said. ``I
could not achieve any writing rhythm, any sense of who he was
besides the obvious, until I tried this different technique.''
</P>
<P>
   The nattily dressed, bearded native of Kenya who speaks with an
ingrained British accent exhibits a Reagan-like ability to tidy up
past unpleasantness when he discusses ``the epiphany'' that led him
to the unexpected format for ``Dutch'' _ named after Reagan's
college nickname.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened on the campus of Eureka College'' in Illinois,
Morris said, carefully considering each word. ``Like many
biographers trying to get at their subjects, I went back to
(Reagan's) origins. This was in the fall of '92, and I wanted to be
where he had gone to college. I stepped on an acorn. In the moment
of crunching that acorn beneath my shoe, I suddenly felt an empathy
with the young Dutch, who must have stepped on acorns in the same
place at an earlier time.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris then decided to insert himself in Reagan's life as a
fictional college classmate named Edmund Morris, who was once saved
from drowning by lifeguard Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   His new approach, Morris said, put him in a writing groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``What came out of my pen after that was real prose, rather than
the sterile stuff I'd been writing for more than two years
before,'' he said. ``I felt liberated by my new writing device.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and readers have carped about not being certain what in
``Dutch'' is real and what isn't. Morris suggests paying attention
to footnotes, although he admits that he isn't disappointed if some
people never figure out that narrator Edmund Morris is fictional.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I had the hopeful, romantic notion readers would
really believe they had a biography of Reagan written by an
87-year-old contemporary,'' Morris said. ``I believe the fuss comes
from critics who had rigid expectations. Real readers, the ones who
bought and actually read the book, are overwhelmingly supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of ``Dutch'' seem to validate the approach. The book
debuted on every bestseller list and has remained in the top 10 of
most of them for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But reviews have been caustic. Several critics have suggested
Morris' ego is to blame, that, after winning a Pulitzer and being
acclaimed for earlier work, he wanted to be as much a celebrity as
the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Morris seems almost Reagan-like in his denial. He remains
good-natured and does not accuse anyone of malice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All writing is difficult,'' Morris said, leaning back in his
chair and smiling. ``I had the pressure any writer feels _ how to
write this book, from what POV (point of view), how to begin, how
to end. So the book is, really, a plain narrative, not a political
study, per se, but a life story.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is eager to explain how much time he spent with President
Reagan. In addition to regular half-hour Oval Office interviews,
author and subject even convened for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man had dinner at my home,'' Morris said. ``The next day,
I met him in the Oval Office, and it was obvious our dinner
together the night before had completely disappeared from his
memory. It wasn't Alzheimer's. It was the way he really was at
center. He never, ever, lived in the past, even though he often
invoked the past in his stories and speeches. What interested
Ronald Reagan was always the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote was meant to illustrate just how difficult it was
for Morris to capture the essence of Reagan, especially in
comparison to Theodore Roosevelt, his next project. It is a second
biography, this covering TR's life from 1901 through 1908. As a
subject, Morris said, Roosevelt won't require the tricks he used in
``Dutch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``TR is a biographer's dream,'' he said. ``He doesn't need a
fictional narrator, since there was so much of him. Reagan, the
actor, constantly needed an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morris said he has treated Reagan fairly. Reagan ``was a
huge, dominant figure,'' he said. ``I believe I have done him full
justice for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said that acclaimed fellow writers such as David
McCullough and Bill Styron have been supportive. He has heard,
however, that Nancy Reagan was ``devastated'' by the book, which
includes fanciful projections of Reagan's love affairs, limited
parenting skills and intense interest in cultivating wealthy
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me. You can't write a biography if you're
worried about hurting people,'' Morris said in one of his few
direct answers.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the former president himself? If Ronald Reagan could
miraculously emerge from the fog of Alzheimer's, how would he react
to ``Dutch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would not have been interested in the book, no matter what
I wrote in it,'' Morris said. ``Reagan was not really interested in
himself. The only things he liked to look at were political
cartoons of himself. He lacked that kind of vanity. He'd flip
through ``Dutch'' for a moment and put it aside, forgetting
instantly he had looked at it at all.'' .MDUL/.MDNM/ (Jeff Guinn is

`DOGMA' PRAISED, REVILED _ HERE'S A CATHOLIC REVIEWER'S TAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I attended Sunday Mass at a Catholic
Church other than the one I've been attending for the past 10
years. I've always considered my parish kind of mellow, with a
strong music ministry and affable priests who emphasize the
positive messages in the Gospel. But as soon as I walked into the
new church, I knew it would be even more contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   The church was set up in the round, rows of chairs with no
kneelers, with the altar at the center. The choir, which was part
of the circle, seemed to include whatever instruments the singers
could bring to the party: the requisite piano and guitars, but also
various horns and a cello. Most telling, though, was the Mass
itself: Two key prayers were omitted, and one of the two pre-Gospel
readings was dropped. Some of this was no doubt due to the time of
the Mass _ 6:30 p.m. _ but it was still, to me, unusually
user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what Father Tom would have thought of this. Father
Tom was the pastor at the El Paso, Texas, parish where I grew up;
he was an old-school Irish priest who resisted the modernizing of
the Mass. Father Tom did not believe that lay people should serve
Communion, did not practice the sign of peace _ the pre-Communion
ritual in which Catholics turn to their neighbors, shake hands and
say ``Peace be with you'' _ and did not believe that music should
be part of the Mass, because he considered it a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Father Tom would not have liked Dogma, Kevin Smith's new movie
that's both a satire of the Roman Catholic Church and a plea for a
return to simple faith. Some groups call the movie blasphemous and
anti-Catholic, but its bigger sin is that it's a bit lazy _ Smith,
a gifted and funny writer, is capable of examining the movie's
themes without taking so many cheap shots. But Dogma's foes are a
little lazy, too, in not taking note of its positive elements; his
movie doesn't take a casual approach to faith.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, those interested in how theology is filtered through
pop culture should be putting their energy into promoting films
that are pro-faith without being controversial. Admittedly, though,
there are too few of these in our pop life; too often, any TV show
or film that ``explores'' Catholicism does so by lampooning or
stereotyping Catholic characters _ something we SHOULD get worked
up about. ___
</P>
<P>
   Smith's movie is creating quite an uproar, and it gives me an
odd sense of nostalgia, because every few years while I was growing
up, we would be told at Mass not to see a movie _ Jesus Christ
Superstar, Godspell, The Exorcist, The Life of Brian, The Last
Temptation of Christ _ because of its questionable religious
stance.
</P>
<P>
   Dogma, no doubt, would have received similar condemnation. The
movie has many blasphemous moments; the one that sticks out most in
my mind is when a cardinal played by George Carlin uses a Communion
chalice for putting practice. Because of moments such as this, the
movie has stirred the wrath of activist groups, who contend that
the movie is anti-Catholic. But although I think the movie is
flawed, I believe that Smith meant well; the movie's end message,
however muddled, is pro-faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make a devout flick, you know?'' Smith told The
Philadelphia Inquirer recently. ``I never thought it was
controversial. I just thought it was ... two hours of preachy Jesus
(stuff). Christ knew the value of telling a good story to get his
points across. This film is not blasphemy. We treat God very
devoutly. I believe in God. I don't want to (tick) him off.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell if Smith is being naive or shrewd, but my
money's on naive: The movie was a controversy waiting to happen.
Its most vocal foe has been The Catholic League for Religious and
Civil Rights, which speaks out against defamation of Catholicism.
The league based its opposition to the movie on an early draft of
the script; although Smith points out that league members haven't
seen the movie, many of the gags they objected to made it to the
screen intact. And league officials, while acknowledging that they
haven't seen the film, defend their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in this particular case, their main characters are
apparent, their roles are apparent and most of the dialogue is
apparent,'' Patrick Scully, director of communications for the
Catholic League, told the San Jose Mercury News. ``You don't have
to see the movie to get that. We saw the script.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Smith's movie _ and the other aforementioned
films, as well as 1994's Priest and the short-lived 1997-98 TV
series Nothing Sacred _ at least makes you think about faith.
Rather than reject these films, I find that they speak to my
Catholicism, because they present Catholics who are much like me _
human, flawed, even troubled. They may go to extremes in doing so,
but they do it in the spirit of challenge _ and faith that can't
withstand challenge is diluted faith. ___
</P>
<P>
   I started thinking this way around the first time I saw Jesus
Christ Superstar. A good Catholic boy (better than I am now,
anyway) when I was in junior high, I avoided seeing the movie for
years because my parish told me not to go. It wasn't till about
three years after its release when, under the influence of an
effusively persuasive friend, I caught it at a midnight movie (on
Good Friday, no less). I was surprised at how moved I was _
remember, I was a teen-ager _ and how much the movie helped me get
a grasp on the story of the Lord's passion. It wasn't till I was an
adult that I realized why the movie upset church groups; among
other things, it portrays Christ as a didactic, self-pitying
whiner. No wonder a teen-age boy could relate.
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, an outcry against a movie like Dogma will
backfire, arousing curiosity in audiences who would otherwise be
disinterested. The best example of this is 1988's The Last
Temptation of Christ, which was lambasted for its infamous
depiction of a crucified Christ imagining what domestic life with
Mary Magdalene would be like. The movie is actually thoughtful _ to
the point of ponderousness _ in the way it addresses Christ's
humanity, and it unfolds in a self-serious 2 3/4 hours; if its foes
didn't want it seen, they should have ignored it _ or handed out
leaflets saying ``Warning: This is really slow.'' (MORE) nn

``xxx really slow.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Dogma, Last Temptation was made by a Catholic-raised
director _ Martin Scorsese, whose very Catholic obsessions with sin
and redemption have fueled virtually all of his films. Scorsese has
always been better addressing these topics in a secular way (Taxi
Driver, Raging Bull) than in a spiritual one (Kundun); he's
actually at his most sacred when he's profane. But at least
Scorsese, and Smith, come by their Catholic obsessions honestly.
They're trying to deal with their own doubts and fears, not just
using Catholicism as an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   And cinematically, we are easy targets; the Catholic Church,
with its belief in resurrection, miracles, saints, rituals and
mystery, is ready-made for drama. Our struggles to attain
spirituality in a material world, and our renowned guilt when we
fail to attain that spirituality, are perfect fodder for conflict.
(Believe me, as a church-going Catholic who writes about movies for
a living, and who enjoys many despite their moral shortcomings, I'm
conflicted quite often). We're not unique in this _ people of all
faiths, and nonbelievers as well, have their inner dramas _ but the
combination of mysticism and frailty, coupled with many filmmakers'
own Catholic backgrounds, makes us popular movie subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, we're often subject to carelessness and
cavalier attitudes in how we're portrayed, often in ways that would
inspire outrage if they were aimed at other religious groups.
Imagine what would happen if another denomination was accused of
murder or conspiratorial cover-ups, as the Catholic Church was in
the anachronism-laced Godfather Part III and in this year's
Stigmata (the Catholic League also condemned Stigmata, but not as
vocally as it has Dogma). ___
</P>
<P>
   What's truly offensive, though, isn't movies like Dogma; it's
movies that employ Catholic characters simply for convenience's
sake, without any clue as to what we're all about. The most recent
example of this is The Bachelor, in which James Cromwell plays a
Catholic priest who blithely follows Chris O'Donnell's character,
Jimmie, around San Francisco as Jimmie proposes to more than a
half-dozen women because he stands to win $100 million if he gets
married within 27 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this marriage is more likely a job for a justice
of the peace; Cromwell is here to act Irish and talk about true
love (he's a widower who turned to the priesthood after his wife's
death). For all his wisdom about true love, he doesn't appear to
have an inkling that Jimmie's marriage plans are a mockery of a
sacrament _ not only does Jimmie jump from woman to woman, he's
also planning to stay married only 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Bachelor is merely misguided, as is the just-released The
Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, which portrays the
15th-century warrior saint as a histrionic, conflicted diva
(several scenes depict Joan wrestling with her ``Conscience,''
portrayed by Dustin Hoffman as a grim hooded figure, although The
Catholic Encyclopedia says that the saint never displayed such
self-doubt). On a purely secular level, both movies are pretty
awful, but they don't sink to the anti-Catholic depths of an
equally awful film, the summer comedy Detroit Rock City.
</P>
<P>
   DRC disappeared from theaters so quickly, it's almost not worth
criticizing, but it may be the most anti-Catholic movie of the past
couple of years. The movie, set in 1978, is about four Cleveland
teens who'll do anything to get tickets to a Kiss concert in
Detroit. Lin Shayes (There's Something About Mary) plays the mother
of one of the teens, an alcoholic harridan who's rabidly against
Kiss' ``devil music'' (funny, I don't remember being told not to
listen to Kiss in '78, but then the group didn't interest me much
at the time). Sam Huntington plays her son, whose rebellion against
his protesting mom includes having sex _ in a confessional. Now
there's a desecration of something sacred to Catholics, and all for
a cheap, unfunny gag that has nothing to do with provoking thought.
___
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dogma is benign; its most offensive element, to me,
is the suggestion that Catholics have become a bunch of bored
automatons who show up at church every Sunday because they have to.
``It's called the Celebration of the Mass,'' Smith said during an
interview with the ZUG comedy Web site, ``but it's no party. No
one's having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is exaggerating the point, but although a Catholic study
released last week reported that many young-adult Catholics are
slipping away from the church, Smith ignores the church's increased
emphasis on compassion and activism. And the size of the crowds I
encounter every Sunday at my church, a large Fort Worth parish with
several weekend Masses, indicates that many Catholics of all ages
are still very involved in the Mass and the church. Maybe he's
going to the wrong Masses at the wrong church.
</P>
<P>
   Why this boredom has led Smith to include Saturday Night
Live-level blasphemous gags to address crises of faith could be
considered a mystery, but then so could the Catholic League's
comparative silence on movies that are clearly pro-faith, without
the sophomoric sacrilege. In the two years and change that I've
been reviewing movies, we've had Contact, in which Jodie Foster's
lack of faith is shaken by a message from space; Ponette and Wide
Awake, about children praying passionately to God for reassurance
about dead relatives; and The Apostle, with Robert Duvall as a
fallen preacher who finds his way back into the fold. You might
know about the controversy over Dogma, but are you aware that it
opened on the same weekend that NBC showed a TV movie called Mary,
Mother of Jesus? It received much less publicity, despite advance
reports that it was a reverent portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The struggles over faith have enough drama; it's not necessary
to tart them up with easy gags. But perhaps Smith is trying to get
the young audience he earned with the superior but secular (and
more vulgar) Clerks and Chasing Amy to examine their own beliefs.
If that's the case, he should be commended, not condemned. But I
can't escape the sense that more people are going to enjoy Dogma
for its secular humor and its cheap shots than for anything Smith
really has to say about religion. Whether he's trying to bring
Catholics back to the fold or trying to draw them out of the flock,
it's doubtful he'll succeed in either case. His movie will probably
be a success, but he'll still be preaching to the converted.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENGINEERS EVOLVE WITH HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gone are the days when the United States had a
clearly defined enemy, and as a result, jobs for aerospace
engineers are no longer as plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War brought with it an unprecedented scaling
back of the military-industrial complex, and no region of the
nation felt its effects more than Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But the disappearance of aerospace jobs in the suburban San
Fernando Valley and Ventura County areas around Los Angeles, rather
than destroying the economy, has effected a transition in the focus
of the region's employment base.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers who once designed launch vehicles and guidance systems
now are creating telecommunications switches and fiber optic
routers. So while the '80s and '90s saw the development of the
Silicon Valley in Northern California's Santa Clara County, it also
saw the parallel development of a technological hardware industry
in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Noam Lotan, chief executive officer of Chatsworth's MRV
Communications, said his industry especially has benefited from the
services of people once employed in defense and aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've used subcontractors that have in the past been doing
lots of work for the aerospace industry,'' Lotan said. ``The
mechanical tolerances are very, very small. It was very useful to
have this kind of infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Also important, especially to companies in the communications
equipment industry, was the presence of businesses experienced in
working with the military and defense contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of military-related technology has to do with
communications in general and wireless communications in
particular, Lotan said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said military contractors have translated their
expertise into the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of military stuff would involve communication and
networking,'' Kyser said. ``Any time you're talking about
communication and networking (now), that would probably be
something that grew out of a military application.''
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace industry, closely connected to defense
contracting, also contributed to the region's technical base.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had some very definite centers of advanced research _ at
Lockheed, especially Skunk Works, Hughes Missile, Rocketdyne,''
Kyser said. ``As the downsizing occurred, I think a lot of the
people who maybe didn't want to move had some better ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 and 1994, Hughes Missile Systems laid off thousands of
workers and transferred thousands of others to Tucson, Ariz. Those
who opted to stay in California were left with few employment
options at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a brain drain, state and local officials launched
efforts to encourage institutions such as the California Institute
of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both in Pasadena,
to increase their research.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurship was encouraged through economic development
efforts in a further attempt to prevent the loss of professional
people and to smooth the transition to a more consumer-focused
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the industry has begun to swing away from its military
focus, the technology sector has begun to grow into a major force
in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came out of aerospace, but the idea is that you have
other applications for that technology,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of entrepreneurs who come to the area to study
at Southern California universities and an available pool of
engineers and skilled workers contributes to the industry's
strength, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the new crops of educated techies generated by local
schools, and you've got prospects for further growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry clusters tend to develop where the talent congregates.
In the case of the technology industry, the engineers already were
in Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Chatsworth, Calabasas and
Camarillo. The budding technology companies simply followed.

MANNESMANN IN SURPRISE SUIT TO STOP HOSTILE BID BY VODAFONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Great Britain)  (See also VODAFONE-MANNESMANN-OPTIONS) 
(mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A day after rejecting a $106-billion takeover from
Vodafone Airtouch PLC, Mannesmann AG of Germany moved Monday to
thwart the British company's hostile bid by suing to remove its
corporate adviser, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., accusing the Wall Street
investment bank of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann played its surprise card Monday afternoon when its
lawyers filed a request for an injunction with Britain's High
Court, seeking to prevent Goldman from advising Vodafone, the
world's biggest wireless operator. It argued that Goldman's
previous work for Mannesmann had given it access to confidential
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that Goldman, Sachs has explicitly promised us
not to advise Vodafone or anybody else on an unsolicited bid, and
then did the contrary,'' Klaus Esser, Mannesmann's chief executive,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers depicted the maneuver as potentially a
landmark event in corporate takeovers, one that might change
deal-making by turning advisers into litigation targets alongside
the corporations in play. A boom in European mergers has left many
investment banks in the position of working for competing
companies, creating the same potential conflicts as those alleged
in the Mannesmann-Vodafone brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, the top corporate adviser in Europe, said it would
temporarily stop advising Vodafone until the case is heard
Thursday, thereby suspending its involvement at the height of an
intensifying takeover drama that had been billed as likely to
produce history's biggest-ever hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone said it was reviewing Mannesmann's court maneuver.
Goldman said in a statement that it ``has acted properly and has
pressed for an early hearing so it can challenge this action
vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Only hours earlier, executives close to the takeover discussions
had said that Vodafone was leaning toward a bid for Mannesmann
early Tuesday. But the pending court action injected new
uncertainty, representing a clear escalation of the battle between
Vodafone and Mannesmann, which began three weeks ago when the
German company announced its $33 billion acquisition of Orange PLC.
That purchase of Britain's No. 3 mobile phone operator turned
Mannesmann from a Vodafone partner elsewhere in Europe to a rival
on Vodafone's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is dominance in Europe's mushrooming wireless market as
the Continent gears up not only for a boom in the number of mobile
phone users, particularly among the European Union's 350 million
people, but also for a surge in wireless Internet use propelled by
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman had managed the international portion of a $1.6 billion
sale of new Mannesmann stock and was an adviser to Hutchison
Whampoah, a Hong Kong-based group that owns 44 percent of Orange's
stock and was a key participant in Mannesmann's $33-billion deal to
buy Orange. Vodafone's advisers on the Mannesmann takeover effort
are Goldman and Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Mannesmann, a fast-growing German
telecommunications giant that has emerged from what was once a
staid engineering concern, rejected a $106.4 billion overture from
Vodafone's chief executive, Christopher Gent, who had flown to
Duesseldorf, Germany, to present his offer only to be told by
Mannesmann's Esser that it was ``wholly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's rejection of Vodafone's all-stock bid _ which
valued the German company at 203 euros, or $209.50 a share _ sent
Vodafone's stock down by 3.75 pence (six cents) to close at 292.5
pence ($4.73) on Monday. Mannesmann's shares rose 9.5 percent to
17.68 euros ($18.21) to a record 202.98 euros ($209). Mannesmann's
stock has risen by 31 percent in the past two weeks of fevered
takeover speculation that has driven up telecommunications stocks
in general.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications PLC, for instance, closed up 46.5
pence (70.68 cents) at 1,286 pence ($20.83). But the move in share
prices did not shake the widespread belief among analysts that
Vodafone has little option but to pursue a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the stakes are as high as they are, they need to show
an aggressiveness and forcefulness,'' said John Jensen, a
telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``And it's not
like they are starved for cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen and several other analysts said Vodafone would need to
bid upwards of 220 euros ($226) and possibly up to 250 euros
($257.50) to persuade Mannesmann's shareholders _ none of whom hold
a controlling bloc of shares _ to support such a deal. The upper
limit of Vodafone's bid will be dictated partly by the level at
which the offers would dilute the earnings of the combined
companies, a figure that some analysts placed at between 230 euros
($236.9) and 240 euros ($247.20).
</P>
<P>
   That means that the bid could be valued at around 127 billion
euros, or $130.8 billion _ compared with the previous European
record for an unsolicited bid of $64 billion, by Olivetti SpA for
Telecom Italia SpA earlier this year. The bid would also far exceed
the current record, a $115 billion takeover deal by MCI Worldcom
for Sprint announced last month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vodafone is set to announce first-half earnings Tuesday, and
analysts are anticipating a 70 percent gain in earnings to 810
million pounds ($1.31 billion) as a result of its acquisition last
January of Airtouch, a U.S. telecommunications concern.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal for Mannesmann would be far more complex than the
trans-Atlantic negotiations that fused Vodafone and Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   Successful hostile takeovers are virtually unknown in Germany
and Mannesmann has expressed its desire to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, the Mannesmann chief, sought to reinforce that impression
Monday, telling CNN: ``There is always a price for everything but I
am 100 percent convinced that there will not be a price which is
good enough, which is fair enough to Mannesmann shareholders, which
is at all affordable to Vodafone shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Esser's view reflects his his belief that Mannesmann's strategy
is ``diametrically opposed'' to his suitors', according to an
executive close to Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   The German giant has decided its future growth is based on a
combination of communication methods, including land-line networks,
data networks and wireless networks. Conversely, Vodafone has
successfully built its business strictly on a wireless strategy.

 &HT;    NFL NOTEBOOK: Niners planning to release Phillips
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci said Monday that the
team will release troubled running back Lawrence Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who signed with San Francisco after being waived in
St. Louis and Miami because of off-the-field problems, was
suspended indefinitely from the team. Mariucci said the 49ers were
clarifying contractual issues with the NFL's Management Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we have not waived him yet is because of
contractual reasons,'' Mariucci said. ``There are some salary-cap
ramifications. We want to fully understand those.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who seemed to resurrect his career in NFL Europe this
spring, has been bothered by a sore hamstring this season. He lost
a starting job to former Eagles running back Charlie Garner.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Phillips missed playing time when he was hurt,
Mariucci said the team wouldn't negotiate an injury settlement
because the former Nebraska star practiced as late as Friday.
Mariucci also said Phillips skipped two days of medical treatment
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence had every intention of being the featured back
here,'' Mariucci said. ``But he was injured and fell behind the
others. I think right from the get-go that started to gnaw at
Lawrence. He was a spot player with us, but he became very
frustrated with his role on the team. I think he became very
disinterested and shut it down both mentally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips didn't travel with the team to New Orleans, where the
49ers lost to the Saints 24-6 Sunday. Mariucci said Phillips
participated in special-teams practice Friday, but refused to
participate in drills with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Running backs coach Tom Rathman) asked him to take some reps
and Lawrence told him, `You don't put me in games anyway, so why
should I practice?''' Mariucci said. ``That's conduct detrimental
(to the team). I've never seen that before.''
</P>
<P>
   By cutting Phillips now, the Niners would take a $212,000 hit on
their salary cap. The team can suspend Phillips for four games _
the maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement _ and
then take less of a salary-cap blow.
</P>
<P>
   Smith `ready to go'
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost All-Pro offensive guard Larry Allen for at
least two weeks because of a sprained knee, but running back Emmitt
Smith might return for this week's game at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Smith broke his right hand in a loss at Minnesota two weekends
ago. In Sunday's 27-13 win over Green Bay, the Cowboys played
without Smith, quarterback Troy Aikman and receiver Michael Irvin
for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas rushed for 149 yards against the Packers, but substitute
Chris Warren lost two fumbles in 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try some different padding on (Smith's) hand,''
Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``It's his right hand and he
carries the ball with his left. If things go well in practice,
he'll probably play. He's feeling better and he's ready to go.
Whenever he can get out there, we want him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Aikman, who suffered a concussion against the
Vikings and didn't play last week, is doubtful for Sunday's game.
Aikman underwent more medical tests Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds against him playing are very high,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ESPN reported that Irvin, who suffered a neck injury
Oct. 10, will announce his retirement later this week.
</P>
<P>
   49ers looking at `Hoss'
</P>
<P>
   With quarterbacks Jeff Garcia and Steve Stenstrom struggling,
the 49ers will try out Super Bowl XXV hero Jeff Hostetler. Mariucci
said he contacted Hostetler last week, and the former New York
Giants starter is expected to arrive in San Francisco today.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler, 38, hasn't played since 1997, though he was on the
Redskins' roster last year. He sat out this season after his
8-year-old son, Tyler, was partially paralyzed after an all-terrain
vehicle accident in the yard of the family's West Virginia home.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler was the Raiders' starter from 1993 until the team
signed free agent Jeff George after the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Stenstrom, making his first start after replacing former
Canadian League star Garcia, completed 18 of 32 passes for 157
yards with one interception against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stenstrom probably did as well as Hoss would do when you think
about it,'' 49ers general manager Bill Walsh said. ``He had some
dropped balls. He was chased around a little bit. He threw some
good balls. He handled himself pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers haven't scored an offensive touchdown since Oct. 17, a
streak that was prolonged when Stenstrom threw an interception on
the 49ers' final drive.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor hurting again
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor is questionable for
Sunday's game against the Saints after aggravating a hamstring
injury in a 6-3 victory over the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Without Taylor in the backfield, the Jaguars had only 132 yards
total offense and managed just nine first downs _ both franchise
lows. Taylor, a former first-rounder from Florida, has finished
only three games this year. In those games, the team averaged 37
points. In the others, they've averaged only 16.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor originally strained his left hamstring in the second week
against Carolina, forcing him to miss the third game against the
Titans. He returned the following week against Pittsburgh and
aggravated the hamstring again, forcing him to miss games against
the Jets and Browns.

ABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCATES DENOUNCE DEAL ON U.N. DUES 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fragile deal between the White House and House
Republicans to end a fight over abortion and U.N. dues drew
scathing criticism Monday from abortion rights advocates and
cutting reviews from Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In breaking an impasse that will free nearly $1 billion that the
United States owes the United Nations, both sides claimed victory
Monday in an issue that has jeopardized American global leadership
and a year-end budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal still has a few crucial loose ends, like the timing
of repaying the back dues and a dispute over debt relief to the
world's most impoverished nations.It could be months before it is
clear who the real winner is.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from Bradley and Gore underscored Gore's desire to
avoid giving his Democratic rival any opening to exploit on a
white-hot domestic issue. As Gore's presidential campaign goes on,
he has been more willing to take positions that diverge from
President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Under a compromise struck late Sunday, a ban on U.S. funds going
to international organizations that promote abortion rights would
be written into law. The deal is a triumph for House conservatives
led by Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., who for three years has
insisted on tying the payment of the U.N. dues to the funding ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton could waive the ban if he pays a $12.5 million
penalty, to be subtracted from the $385 million in grants the
Agency for International Development awards to family planning
groups abroad. The $12.5 million, just over 3 percent of the total,
would go to a separate children's health fund.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also caps at $15 million the amount of U.S. grants to
organizations that perform abortions or advocate family planning
measures. Administration officials said it was unlikely the cap
would be met and health services would be only minimally affected.
But abortion-rights supporters said the provision would have a
chilling effect on family-planning activities overseas, from
sponsoring conferences to publishing safe-sex pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has aggressively
lobbied Clinton to repay Washington's U.N. debt and volunteered to
be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion-rights groups,
defended the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement that I hope will come out will not interfere
with family planning around the world and that it will have minimal
effect,'' Albright told reporters traveling with Clinton in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates denounced the deal as a sell-out to
appease a small band of Republicans, and claimed that the
deal &UR;  &LR; would endanger the lives of women in developing countries who
rely on the help of international family planning groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's lives have once again been sacrificed for political
expediency,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., who telephoned the White House
chief of staff, John Podesta, to demand a meeting on Tuesday, said,
``Administration negotiators paid an unjustifiable, high-cost
ransom to a small number of extreme-right, anti-choice lawmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expressed pessimism about a final deal. ``The
more I get into the details, the more difficult it is to resolve,''
said Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the
House Appropriations Committee. ``We've got too much talking on
camera, including by the secretary of state.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue exploded on the campaign trail Monday as a potentially
divisive issue between the two Democratic presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bradley, Kristen Ludecke, said the former New
Jersey senator opposed the tentative deal and cited his remarks on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not support it if I was there,'' Bradley said on CNN's
``Late Edition.'' ``A woman's right to choose is absolutely
essential, and I think family planning for the rest of the world,
if we wanted to provide it, should be permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to employees at Microsoft on Monday, Gore would not
directly answer whether he supported the deal, but did say that he
opposed ``bargaining away any critical policy aspect of a women's
right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Gore adviser said the vice president had expressed
``strong reservations'' about the deal, and while heaping most of
the blame on Republicans, said Gore ``opposed what the White House
ended up doing''
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives expressed cautious optimism that they had
won their biggest victory on the issue since Clinton rescinded a
1984 executive order by President Ronald Reagan that denied grants
to international organizations for any purpose if they promoted
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred direct financing for abortions
since 1973, but Reagan advanced that policy by adopting what has
become known as ``Mexico City'' because he announced the executive
order during a U.N. conference there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as close as we've been to reinstating the language of
Mexico City since Bill Clinton became president,'' said Michele
Davis, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican presidential front-runner, said Bush ``would support
reinstating the executive order banning the use of taxpayer money
to promote abortions in foreign countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal appears to pave the way to end a long-running dispute
that has threatened to strip the United States of its vote in the
U.N. General Assembly unless it pays up before Dec. 31. The seat
and vote in the Security Council are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would tie in a State Department reauthorization
bill that allows $926 million over three years to pay the U.N.
debt. The first installment from that bill, combined with money
from a second spending bill that covers the costs of the Commerce,
State and Justice departments, would be enough to prevent
Washington from losing its General Assembly vote, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. foreign policy is on a little firmer ground with this
news,'' said Linda S. Jamison, executive director of the Emergency
Coalition for U.S. Financial Support of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's key Senate allies, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the Democratic leader, and Joseph R. Biden, the senior Democrat on
the Foreign Relations Committee, also voiced support for the deal.
``Somebody has to give, and there is give here on both sides,''
said Daschle. ``It's a pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the deal, administration officials said they could
shield international groups from financial cuts by defining which
organizations are affected and how lobbying for abortions rights is
defined.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said the deal expires after a year, when all
sides agreed the fight would be joined again, but this time without
the huge U.N. debt hanging over the White House's head.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters were not placated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This not a compromise,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the
National Abortion Rights Reproductive League. ``This is
capitulation.''

 WASHINGTON: a statement. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are elements of Monday's agreement that could do just that
_ if one is willing to wait long enough.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barshefsky's negotiating team spent a considerable
amount of time defanging China's insistence over the summer that
foreigners could never invest in Chinese Internet service
providers. The United States insisted that the Internet had to be
dealt with like the rest of the telecommunications market _ open to
foreigners and Chinese alike. That is a remarkable concession in a
country that only a few years ago strictly controlled who could own
radios and that put speakers in every village, to blare propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an increasingly information-based economy it is difficult
to tell people to be economically creative and politically
suppressed,'' the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Monday from Turkey, where he is traveling with Clinton. ``But it's
a long-term hypothesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, the Chinese gave away their ability to be
the sole judge of what foreign investors can do and what they
cannot. Once China is a member of the WTO, it must submit to the
group's dispute-settlement system. That means cases of Chinese
trade barriers will be sent to three-judge panels in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects that the Chinese leadership will roll over and do
whatever the courts command. But then again, neither do the
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is hope but no assurance that trade
liberalization can lock in political liberalization. But there is a
far better bet that it may be able to lock in China's economic
liberalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years the accord will throw open to
foreigners _ at least on paper _ markets that have long been out of
reach. Life insurance companies will have the right to sell their
policies anywhere in the country. Grain producers and computer
makers can distribute their goods themselves, without going through
state-owned firms. Five years from now foreign banks will be able
to open branches, doing business with ordinary Chinese in the
national currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these businesses have long been protected by the Chinese
government. By throwing open the doors, after five years of
preparations, China's leaders are clearly betting that the arrival
of the foreigners will spur both efficiency and growth. It
demonstrates, experts say, that China has learned a lesson from the
experiences of Japan and South Korea: Over-protection of domestic
industries breeds fat, smug companies that are ripe for disaster
when hard times strike.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky strategy for the Chinese, of course. Competition
can breed unemployment _ already a growing problem in China _ and
unemployment can breed political activism.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a risk for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a backlash against too much trade liberalization
too fast,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the former undersecretary of
commerce and one of the architects of Clinton's early forays into
commercial diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a backlash already in full swing in Europe, and parts of
Asia. If it hits particularly hard in China, Washington may be
reassessing the political benefits of Clinton's strategy.

 &HT;    Murderer joins bar as lawyer
 &HT;    By Wes Hills and Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Fury and sadness swept over Dayton a quarter
century ago when Derek Anthony Farmer, then 16, was arrested in the
murders of a long-time civil rights activist and a widely respected
police sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was convicted of those murders and served 18 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Farmer, now 42, earned the opportunity to serve the
law rather be punished by it. He became the first convicted
murderer in Ohio history to be sworn in as a lawyer. He's expected
to practice law in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I can never pay back, but I can pay forward and I can
make a contribution,'' Farmer said at a hearing that helped
determine whether he could practice law. It took support from
prominent area judges, particularly Chief U.S. District Judge
Walter Rice, for Farmer to become a lawyer after his convictions in
the March 1974 murders of Dayton civil rights activist W.S.
McIntosh and Dayton Police Sgt. William K. Mortimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So confident am I of his character, ethics and sense of
responsibility, that I would truly trust him with my life and the
lives of my family members,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer's sister, Betty Blankenship, kept any judgment of
Farmer to herself Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discussed this as a family and just decided that we're
going to have no comment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone believes Farmer deserves this chance. One of
those against it is Dayton Police Chief Ronald Lowe Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, it's a slap in the face to me personally, to
every law enforcement officer that's been shot in the line of
duty,'' Lowe said. ``I'm totally for rehabilitation, but there has
to be boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one against Farmer is Lee C. Falke, Montgomery County
prosecutor at the time of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's lowering the standards for the people we want in
the practice of law,'' Falke said. ``Attorneys already suffer an
image problem and certainly it adds to the problem. . . . I really
don't understand how it's possible that he got a license.''
</P>
<P>
   Falke said he ``knew Sumpter McIntosh and Sgt. Mortimer and I
could never quite forgive or forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer and his nephew, Calvin Jerome Farmer, then 18, held up
the Harry Potasky jewelry store on March 4, 1974, in downtown
Dayton and pistol whipped Harry Potasky, 81.
</P>
<P>
   When they ran from the store into the outstretched arms of
McIntosh, Derek Farmer complied with McIntosh's command to stop.
Calvin Farmer gunned him down.
</P>
<P>
   That same morning, Derek Farmer surrendered seconds before his
nephew fatally shot Mortimer, 43, as police closed in on a housing
project on the city's West side.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 18, 1975, Farmer was then convicted of aggravated murder
in McIntosh's slaying and of purposeful murder in the slaying of
Mortimer.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Farmer was convicted of a single count of murder and
sentenced to life in prison _ but served the then eight-year
minimum sentence before he was paroled in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge Rodney M. Love, now
deceased, declined to send Derek Farmer to the electric chair and
sentenced him to life.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Farmer would spend nearly a decade longer behind bars than
the triggerman. While at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in
Lucasville, he earned his high school and college diplomas before
his release on Oct. 29, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 23, 1997, letter to the Tuscarawas County Bar
Association, Professor J. Dean Carro of the University of Akron
School of Law urged that Farmer be permitted to take the Ohio Bar
exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Derek has been in law school, I have entrusted to
him the care of the most important people in my life _ my two
boys,'' Carro wrote. ``Derek routinely baby-sits for my children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the race of life, sometimes we judge people by where they
finish,'' Carro continued. ``Sometimes we should measure people
from where they started and where they finish. On that basis Derek
has achieved more than any person I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice continues to be one of Farmer's strongest supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After exchanging letters with Farmer for several years, Rice
recalled meeting him upon his release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed at the time with the fervor of his
determination to pay back our community for what had transpired,''
Rice wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer worked in Rice's court as an intern in the summers of
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia J. Mengel, clerk for the Ohio Supreme Court and secretary
for its board of commissioners on character and fitness, said a
felony conviction is no automatic barrier to becoming an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Mengel said the board, as well as the Tuscarawas County Bar
Association, thoroughly reviewed Farmer's past as well as ``lots
and lots of evidence that demonstrate his positive social
contributions'' before recommending that he be permitted to take
the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony before the Ohio Supreme Court's board of
commissioners on character and fitness, Farmer said he initially
thought of himself as the victim. But while incarcerated, he said,
he realized that the victims' families experienced the real agony.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer said he has turned down interviews with the media because
they would have incensed the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the hearing, Farmer said he could only hope that
he would be judged on his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I can never pay back but I can pay forward and I can
make a contribution and I hope (the victims' families) would judge
me by that, if they judge me at all.''

   SANTA MONICA _ Lashawanda McCullom, a 30-year-old nurse, put her
credit union's cash card into a Bank of America automated teller
machine here, punched in her secret code and requested a
withdrawal. The machine spit out her card and flashed a message:
``Due to a recent vote by the Santa Monica City Council, the
convenience of this ATM is now available to Bank of America
cardholders only.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCullom, who expressed mild frustration at being denied her
cash, was caught in the cross-fire of a skirmish over ATM
surcharges that now seems to be breaking into a full-fledged war.
Suddenly, the fact that it costs an extra $1.50 or so to get money
out of a cash machine seems to have tapped into some deep well of
public resentment _ or at least politicians believe it has.
</P>
<P>
   This oceanside suburb of Los Angeles last month passed the
nation's first local ordinance banning banks from charging
noncustomers for using their ATMs, and Bank of America retaliated
by denying noncustomers use of its machines. San Francisco voters
approved a similar measure earlier this month, and now, legislators
in other cities and states are said to be looking at similar
ordinances. The New York City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, said
Monday that he planned to propose such a law, and the Los Angeles
City Council has instructed the city attorney to study the city's
authority to enact a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense has also proposed a ban on such
surcharges on all military bases. Connecticut and Iowa already ban
such surcharges under pre-existing laws, and three other states _
Wyoming, Arkansas and Mississippi _ have price caps on the
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers just find the surcharge sort of the fee that broke
the consumer's back, so to speak,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the
attorney general of Connecticut, which is now battling the banking
industry in court. ``Consumers see no reason for it. They regard it
almost as a personal insult. It has evoked an emotion that is quite
astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, saying it has the right to charge for a
service, is fighting to squelch the uprising before it gathers more
steam. California's leading banks argued Monday in U.S. District
Court for an injunction preventing the Santa Monica and San
Francisco ordinances from being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   And on the day Santa Monica's ordinance took effect _ last
Thursday _ Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, the state's two
largest banks by far, began prohibiting noncustomers from using
ATMs, which is why Ms. McCullom could not get her money on Friday.
The banks say they will do the same in San Francisco when that
ordinance takes effect, probably next month.
</P>
<P>
   How widespread the bans will become remains to be seen. Santa
Monica and San Francisco are both unusually liberal cities.
Consumer groups have failed to get any state legislature to enact
such a ban, and Alfonse D'Amato, when he was a U.S. senator from
New York, never got very far with his attempt to legislate a
nationwide prohibition. Rep. Bernard Sanders, an independent from
Vermont, this month re-introduced legislation banning surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it is unreasonable to charge consumers for access to
their own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are basically holding our money hostage,'' said Jon
Golinger of the California Public Interest Group. The U.S. Public
Interest Research Group found that 93 percent of banks surveyed
impose such a surcharge, up from 71 percent in 1998 and 15 percent
in 1996. Nationally, such surcharges appear to generate about $2
billion to $3 billion a year or more for operators of the ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that in many cases consumers are being charged
twice for each withdrawal. If a Wells Fargo customer, for instance,
takes money out of a Bank of America machine, Wells Fargo charges
that customer $2 for using a ``foreign'' ATM, about 50 cents of
which goes to reimburse Bank of America. But Bank of America itself
charges $1.50 for use of its machine by a noncustomer, bringing the
total fee for retrieving as little as $20 of one's own money to
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica and San Francisco ordinances, as well as the
regulation in Connecticut, bar only the $1.50 surcharge levied by
the ATM owner, not the fees imposed by a bank on its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the frustration over the surcharges stems from what is a
general proliferation in banking fees in an era of deregulation,
and the fact that ATM use was once free. ``People see the way banks
are trying to charge for everything under the sun,'' said Walter
McCaffrey, a New York City councilman from Queens who is helping
draft the proposed legislation there. ``The original position was
that ATMs were not a profit center.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks say it is their right to charge for services. If consumers
don't want to pay they can use their own bank's ATMs. Without
surcharges, they said, there would be fewer ATMs and less
convenience for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find too many people who are willing to
give the service for free,'' said Terry Zink, senior vice president
in charge of ATMs for Wells Fargo. ``The biggest issue is whether
or not consumers have the right to pay for services they want.''
</P>
<P>
   What is perhaps most unusual about this battle is that only a
few years ago, the forces were on the opposite sides. The banks
themselves, through two major networks that link ATM machines,
prohibited the surcharges. And legislators in 15 states enacted
laws overriding the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Banks initially shunned fees to encourage people to use the
machines. They viewed ATMs not as money makers but as cost-savers,
a way to cut down on the number of tellers.

 &HT;    NASCAR NOTEBOOK: Grandstand tickets remain for NAPA 500
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ Atlanta Motor Speedway officials said Monday
that about 14,500 reserved grandstand tickets are available for
Sunday's NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   With a weekend forecast of partly sunny skies and temperatures
in the mid-60's, AMS president Ed Clark said he expects a flurry of
last-minute ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the NAPA 500 has been a sellout, and we expect a
tremendous demand for tickets this week due to the very favorable
event-week forecast,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   For tickets, call AMS at 770-946-4211 or Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering Allison
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Davey Allison, the Winston Cup driver who was
killed in a 1993 helicopter crash, played a prominent role in both
victory celebrations following Sunday's Pennzoil 400.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie sensation Tony Stewart took the checkered flag for his
third victory of the year, breaking Allison's 1987 record for
victories in a season by first-year drivers, with two.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett also wrapped up the Winston Cup championship, the
first one for team owner Robert Yates. Yates started his team in
'87 with Allison as the driver. Allison fell just short of winning
a championship for Yates in '92 and was a top contender for the
following season's title before perishing in the July crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Davey Allison is a huge part of this,''
Jarrett said. ``He's the one that sat with Robert and started this
whole thing back in 1987. That is when Robert decided to buy the
team. The success that they have had, the organization that they
built from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of this would have ever happened if it wasn't for Davey,
and it's unfortunate that he was taken, not only from our sport,
but a lot of people's lives because of the person he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that he's had a huge hand in
this, along with Ernie Irvan (another former Yates driver) and what
he was able to do and accomplish and keep things going at Robert
Yates Racing. Davey Allison was a very special person, and we know
that's someone we've had on our side this whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates, who maintained his composure throughout the post-race
celebration, finally broke down when asked about Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're going to make me cry,'' Yates said softly. ``We
knew Davey was watching over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Allison parallel: Jarrett, 42, is the second-oldest
Winston Cup champion. Bobby Allison, Davey's father, was 45 when he
won the title. The engine builder on Allison's trophy-winning team
was none other than Robert Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek and three members of his family were involved in a
single-car crash Sunday evening after arriving at Concord (N.C.)
Regional Airport. The only injured passenger was Nemechek's wife,
Andrea, who is expected to be released from the hospital today....
Nine Winston Cup drivers, including Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt,
tested the 2000 Monte Carlo on Monday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
``I think the car has got a lot of potential,'' Mike Skinner said.
``We're overdue for a change.''

MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING TO KILL CASTRO GO ON TRIAL IN PUERTO RICO  
(DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico. _ The six defendants, aging Cuban exiles
in sport coats and suits, sat quietly in a federal courtroom here
looking more like a schism from the local Rotary Club than a
counter-revolutionary cabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these distinguished Cuban gentlemen are any Rambos,''
one of their lawyers assured the jury.
</P>
<P>
   But as g prosecutors began Monday to present the first case ever
brought in the United States against someone accused of plotting to
kill President Fidel Castro fo Cuba, they quickly offered a
different image of the men's activities. Pulling away a coverlet
beneath the prosecution table, one of the prosecutors displayed a
pair of big, semi-automatic sniper rifles, each capable of piercing
a bullet-proof vest from a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take our word for it,'' the prosecutor, Miguel A.
Pereira, went on. He suggested that the jurors consider instead the
assertions of one of the accused, Angel Alfonso, after the
60-year-old textile-plant manager was arrested on Oct. 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he will go to jail,'' federal agents recounted
Alfonso as saying, ``once he gets out he will attempt a second
mission to assassinate Castro because his sole mission in life is
to kill Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited trial thus began with the jurors weighing two
seemingly improbable theories. The prosecution suggested a plot so
bumbling that two of the tired-looking defendants had turned in a
rental car in Miami with boxes of .50-caliber ammunition still in
the trunk. (The rental agency quickly telephoned the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.)
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants may have cast them even more
implausibly: as stubborn Cuban patriots who had gone to great
lengths to sneak onto a Venezuelan island where Castro was to
attend a regional summit meeting, not to kill him but to
demonstrate peacefully against his presence and to help rescue any
members of his entourage who might want to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling aboard a 46-foot cabin cruiser, the men brought the
rifles (as well as night-vision goggles, a radio scanner,
satellite-positioning units and camouflage gear) because ``they
needed protection,'' one of their lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The six men face charges including conspiracy to murder an
internationally protected person, the possession of illegal weapons
and making false statements to investigators. All of them could
face life imprisonment if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The case against a seventh man, Juan B. Marquez, was postponed
because he has cancer. He is also facing trial with his son and
other defendants in a separate federal drug-trafficking case.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention in court Monday of the relationship that
has drawn particular attention to the case: the ties of several of
the accused men to the Cuban American National Foundation, one of
the most powerful ethnic lobbying groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The closest that Pereira, the prosecutor, came to the foundation
was to note that one of the two Barrett sniper rifles was purchased
in 1995 by one Jose Hernandez. But he did not mention that
Hernandez, who has not been charged in the case, is the
organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining his case, Pereira stuck mainly to Alfonso's
admissions and the circumstantial evidence that was discovered
after Coast Guard officers stopped four of the defendants aboard
the cabin cruiser Esperanza on Oct. 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After the weapons were discovered and the men were arrested,
Alfonso told federal agents that the rifles were his, that he had
brought them on the boat to kill Castro. But the prosecutors,
concerned about the legal impediments to using the statements of
one defendant against the others, agreed to use all but one of his
statements only against him. Alfonso's lawyer asserted that he had
simply made up that threat in an angry and frustrated attempt to
get attention.
</P>
<P>
   As the commander of the Coast Guard cutter subsequently
testified, the men first said they were fishing, but gave the wrong
registration numbers for the boat and claimed to have traveled the
nearly 900 miles from Miami in just a day; later they said they
were headed to sell the boat in St. Lucia. After the men were
persuaded to dock at Aguadilla in Puerto Rico, ostensibly to repair
leaks, federal agents discovered the weapons and other equipment in
a secret storage area on board.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last year, Cuban security officials said that at
least four of the seven defendants in the case had considerable
histories of terrorist plotting against the Castro g, and that at
least two of them had had ties to the CIA. The officials asserted
that many of the incidents in a wave of anti-Castro attacks between
1992 and 1997 had been carried out by a secret, militant cell
within the Cuban American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While several of the men acknowledged taking part in
anti-Communist plots for which they were jailed in Cuba, both they
and the foundation vehemently deny using violent means against
Castro in recent years. And if g investigators were able to
penetrate the conspiracy that the prosecutors described, there was
no sign of it today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the prosecutors had hoped to keep politics out of the
case, they were quickly disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers described at length their clients'
patriotism, rarely missing a chance to draw parallels between the
struggles of right-wing Cuban exiles and those of Puerto Rican
nationalists who are generally found on the other end of the
ideological spectrum.

<P>
   BEIJING _ American and Chinese negotiators reached a landmark
agreement on Monday to open China's economy to foreign competitors
and in return to make the world's most populous nation a full
partner in international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   After six days of arduous negotiations, the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and China's trade minister,
Shi Guangsheng, signed the papers at 3:50 p.m. on Monday, shook
hands and raised a champagne toast to an agreement that capped 13
years of on-and-off negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal signed on Monday, Beijing would reduce tariffs on
various industrial and agricultural products and lift many of the
barriers in the way of American banks, insurance and telephone
companies to operate here.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the United States agreed to support China for
membership in the World Trade Organization, the 134-member
organization that sets the rules for global trade. China must still
complete side agreements with the European Union, Canada and some
developing countries, including Brazil, before its application can
be taken up by the body's 134 member states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say that this is a profound and historic moment in
U.S.-China relations,'' said a clearly exultant Barshefsky, adding
that the agreement would not only aid the economies of both
countries, but also serve as an anchor in the tumultuous political
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The last six days of day-and-night negotiations were conducted
in a ``win-win spirit,'' Shi said at the ceremony, ``and finally we
reached an agreement that serves the interests of both China and
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the rejoicing, the agreement still faces tough
resistance in the United States, where it is opposed by labor
unions and some critics of China. The U.S. Congress must vote to
put an end to the annual review of Chinese trade and to establish
permanent normal trading relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For China, membership in the trade body will mean a long-sought
acceptance into the ``club'' of world powers. The WTO's elaborate
rules will help protect China from discriminatory policies abroad,
but will also force the discipline of globally agreed rules on
China's own fitful progress toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Full WTO membership will be a victory for President Jiang Zemin,
who sees achieving China's economic modernization as his legacy
even as he tries to insure continuation of Communist Party rule. At
the same time it will cheer the more liberal, reform-oriented
factions led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, since it locks China
onto the path of economic opening and the global competition they
hope will force China's own state-owned industries to become
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The step is a politically risky one for Jiang and Zhu at a
moment when those state-run companies are already shedding millions
of workers. For President Clinton, Monday's agreement provides a
badly needed centerpiece to his fraying policy of engagement with
China, offering the prospect of tangible gains to many companies
and to consumers. It is also a stunning recovery from what his own
top aides describe as a huge mistake: his decision to walk away
from the surprisingly sweeping deal, similar to Monday's, offered
in April by Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing, Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, the White House
chief of economic policy who attended the talks as a symbol of
Clinton's personal commitment, were driven to the secluded
leadership compound for a brief meeting with Jiang, who had twice
in the past month conducted telephone talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the talks was far more than how deeply American
insurance and telephone companies could invest in China, or how
freely American oranges could be exported there - among the many
issues that both sides have argued about for years. The accord goes
to the heart of China's transition to an open, market economy and
for the first time it puts Beijing under the jurisdiction of the
rules of international trade set by the World Trade Organization,
enforced by a trade court.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Turkey on Monday, Clinton said: ``I think this is a
good agreement for China, for America and for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's struggle to make this accord a central foreign
policy achievement is far from over. Congress will review the
accord when it takes up the biggest single American concession:
Granting permanent trading rights to China rather than reviewing
those rights annually, a Capitol Hill ritual that has turned into
an annual debate about human rights and arms proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken often of ``integrating China into the world
economy'' and gradually getting the country to embrace ``the rule
of law,'' starting with commercial law. But without closing a WTO
agreement, his aides said, he would have little progress to point
to.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement may also help to repair the damage done from
charges of Chinese spyingin the United States, the accidental
American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May and
China's continuing suspicion that the United States is attempting
to ``contain'' its military and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful completion of WTO will go a long way to smooth out
some of the extreme oscillation that we have seen in Sino-American
relations in recent years,'' said Joseph Fewsmith, a China expert
at Boston University. `'I think it gives us a chance to build some
substance into a relationship that has been badly damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO sets rules for global commerce, adjudicates disputes
and, with global trading accords, presses for ever-freer markets.
Monday's agreement is a huge step toward membership for China. It
is probably already too late, experts said, for China to be fully
admitted before Nov. 30, when a new round of global trade
negotiations will begin in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's accord means that China will take a larger role in
setting the agenda at Seattle, and the talks are expected to go on
for years.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the American goal was to press China not
only for large reductions in tariffs on imported farm products and
industrial goods such as automobiles. In measures that may
ultimately have a far more profound impact, China had to commit
itself to allowing foreign companies to take majority investments
in many industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The final six daysof negotiations went through several rough
spots. Several times Barshefsky and Sperling suggested they were
packing up to leave, threats Barshefsky said in an interview on
Monday that were ``largely tactical, to force the Chinese to make
some progress.''

PARENTS ADVOCATE GUN CONTROL IN MEMORY OF SON'S SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a glorious Saturday morning in June of 1993, John Cleveland
Stevens got up early, showered and shaved, and then told his
parents that he was going to the guitar store. He walked out the
door carrying his guitar case, but he would never return. Later
that day, John drove to a nearby Park, just down the road from his
Fort Worth, Texas, home. It was around 4 p.m. when he put a
short-barreled shotgun in his mouth and committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens was only 19.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news account of his death. A newspaper obituary a
few days later didn't mention how he died.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Kenneth and Nancy Stevens, are sharing his story
six years later because they believe that their son would be alive
today if Texas had a waiting period to purchase firearms. They also
believe that Texas should not allow minors to purchase guns.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released recently by the U.S. government show that
the rate of violent crime is dropping nationwide. But it is
difficult to celebrate such news after reading about the recent
deadly shootings in Honolulu and Seattle, which continue a pattern
of mass murders that have occurred in places such as Pearl, Miss.;
Paducah, Ky.; Springfield, Ore.; Littleton, Colo.; Atlanta; and
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Gun crimes, in fact, seem to be getting more commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   While America becomes a killing field, a circular debate about
gun control continues. The Brady Bill that imposed a national
waiting period expired in 1998, replaced by a system of instant
background checks that critics say is flawed because of
inconsistencies in reporting information in each state.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, advocates enforcement of gun
laws already on the books, but does not believe there is a need for
new legislation. In 1995, he signed a bill allowing people to carry
concealed weapons with the provision that they first apply for a
permit.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that might address the issue has either died or is
going nowhere on a state and national level. The larger question
now is whether society is willing to protect its citizens,
especially its children.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Kenneth always believed more needed to be done to
regulate the proliferation of firearms. But like most of us, every
time they read the headlines, they just shook their heads and
turned the page. Their son's death changed that. ___
</P>
<P>
   It is early October, shortly after 8:30 a.m., a warm day like
the Saturday John Stevens died, six years ago. Nancy Stevens sits
on a chair. Her husband, Kenneth, is on the living room sofa.
</P>
<P>
   They remember that when John headed to the guitar store, the
rest of the family _ including his brother and sister _ was
watching the movie ``American Graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult time for John. He had just completed his
freshman year at Earlham College in Richmond, Va., but when he
returned home he was depressed. His relationship with the girl that
he hoped one day to marry was ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could tell he wasn't doing well,'' his mother said. ``He
wasn't eating.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a freshman in high school, John began having mood
swings that were diagnosed as clinical depression. He also suffered
from attention deficit disorder. A psychologist prescribed Prozac,
which managed to keep John's condition under control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he was depressed again. John stayed up late one night
writing a letter to his girlfriend. On the night before he died, he
began sorting through his possessions, keeping some, discarding
others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his parents had no way of knowing how distraught he was
or what thoughts might be running through his head.
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't return from the guitar store by noon, however,
Nancy Stevens became uneasy. John's bass guitar was standing in a
corner of his bedroom against the wall, but she distinctly
remembered him taking the guitar case.
</P>
<P>
   She canvassed the neighborhood, looking for the family's
bright-blue minivan that her son was driving. When she didn't find
it, she decided to run a few errands and return home.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., the worried mom got into her husband's car and
drove to the park, just a quarter-mile away. That's where she saw
the minivan and instinctively knew that something was wrong. But
she was afraid to see for herself and quickly drove home to find
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the park _ where a Texas Christian University
student had hanged himself a year earlier _ and headed for the
minivan.
</P>
<P>
   In a clearing, they saw John's guitar case and their hearts
began to race. They were running now, sensing that something
terrible had happened. Kenneth got to John first. He turned and
urged his wife to stay back.
</P>
<P>
   That was all that Nancy Stevens needed to know. ``I just started
crying,'' she said, tears spilling from her eyes now as they did
then. ``Oh, no. Oh, no,'' she said, sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   Her son was dead. ___
</P>
<P>
   John was an intense, blue-eyed boy who adored his brother,
James, and his little sister, Sara. He loved Russian literature and
played in the high school band and on the football team.
</P>
<P>
   He volunteered at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History
and the Presbyterian Night Shelter. He was a member of the
Religious Society of Friends.
</P>
<P>
   No one except his immediate family knew that John suffered from
clinical depression. He did not have to provide this information
when he bought the shotgun. Even now, instant background checks are
often incomplete and fail to disclose data about mental
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Kenneth know that some people will say that John
would've killed himself regardless of whether he had a gun. But
they believe the lack of stricter gun laws made it too easy for him
to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young people, in particular, who have a very impulsive
element to their suicide, having access to a means of suicide that
is quick and irrevocable, like a gun, is an unnecessary risk,''
said Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at John
Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md., and author of a book
detailing her own struggle with manic depression and suicide
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Vital Statistics Report, guns were
used in 17,566 suicides in 1997, the last year for which statistics
are available, compared with 13,522 homicides.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when John Stevens took his own life, six of his
schoolmates also died. Three were slain; three committed suicide.
All the incidents involved guns.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that these statistics show a decrease from the
beginning of the decade. Nonetheless, what Nancy and Kenneth find
distressing is that their 19-year-old son could not purchase
alcohol legally, but could walk in off the street and buy a gun.

   Six months after their son's death, Nancy and Kenneth learned
who had put the shotgun in his hands. In December 1993, a Christmas
catalog addressed to John Cleveland came in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   It was from Firearms Unlimited in southwest Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the guy up and told him to take John off his mailing
list,'' Kenneth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stevenses believe that within 24 hours before his death,
their son withdrew $500 from his savings account, and spent about
$200 of it to purchase a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of the day that their son shot himself, a store
manager from Bookstop, his favorite bookstore, called to offer John
the job he had applied for the day before.
</P>
<P>
   His parents believe the job offer would've been enough to give
him renewed hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much good stuff ahead for him,'' Nancy said,
``had he just been able to get through one afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   By sharing their story, Nancy and Kenneth Stevens hope to help
parents prevent similar tragedies. They want to stop the
manufacture and sale of automatic weapons. They want guns
registered, the way cars are. They want to keep guns out of the
hands of young people.
</P>
<P>
   They speak before groups such as the League of Women Voters and
they belong to Texans Against Gun Violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Stevens teaches constitutional history. He knows the
right to bear arms is guaranteed by the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no freedom is absolute,'' he said.

   ``Clearly,'' she said, ``they were not going to let us leave.''
In an interview from Hong Kong on Monday, Barshefsky said that the
key Chinese player in the talks appeared to be Zhou, who twice
stepped in to break an impasse and ultimately directed his
negotiators to make several key concessions - allowing American
firms to take a 50 percent stake in China's booming
telecommunications companies, for example. But all his decisions,
analysts here said, were almost certainly cleared by the top party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of an agreement had been worked out last
April, when Zhu visited Washington. But Clinton backed away from
any agreement at the time, fearing congressional opposition. Most
of Monday's pact follows the April understandings, and in resolving
areas of continued dispute, Barshefsky asserted ``I think we
achieved an overall strengthening of this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The agreement involves a general reduction in China's import
tariffs from the current average of 22.1 percent down to 17
percent, with tariffs on major American farm products cut sharply
to 15 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs on automobile imports, which now range up to 100 percent
to protect China's inefficient producers, will be reduced over a
six-year period to 25 percent, with fastest reduction in the
initial years. That is one year longer than China offered in April.
But equally important, American officials said, foreign auto
companies and banks will for the first time be able to offer
consumer loans for car purchases, a critical concession in a
country where few can lay out the money for such a large purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese consumers may soon be purchasing General Motors cars,
for example, with the ``GMAC'' loans so familiar to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most contentious issues in recent days, Barshefsky
said, involved the American demands for ways to respond to ``import
surges'' and for use of a methodology to identify illegal
``dumping.'' China wanted such measures to phase out quickly, but
in the end agreed to surge protections for a 12-year period, and
the anti-dumping regime for 15 years. Without those concessions,
Barshefsky told her Chinese counterparts, Congress could easily
balk at the accord.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, China has agreed to allow foreign companies
to distribute their own goods - rather than forcing them to
distribute food or industrial components through Chinese companies.
They will also be able to repair and support their products
directly.
</P>
<P>
   In the textile area, one of the most politically sensitive in
the United States, it was the Americans who called for restrictions
on free trade. The Chinese wanted to scale back the American demand
to continue its existing textile import quotas for another 10
years. In the end, the United States agreed to end quotas after
five years, but with special ``anti-surge'' safeguards for another
four years after that.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-dumping and textile provisions are charged issues for
Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to keep the support of organized
labor in his Presidential bid even as labor groups oppose the trade
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment in China's telecommunications sector had
become a sore point inside China, where some saw it as an issue of
national security. The Americans fought for 51 percent ownership
rights - which Zhu had offered in April - but finally agreed that
foreign firms could take up to 50 percent ownership of companies in
this booming sector, beginning two years after China enters the
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Important provisions will open Chinese retail banking to foreign
firms over several years, and also improve market access for
insurance companies, legal and accounting firms. But the American
negotiators got far less in the infant and high-risk financial
securities market here, where they are will be limited to minority
stakes in such activities as underwriting stock issues.
</P>
<P>
   For China _ which is still unraveling the legacy of Mao Zedong's
cloistered, command economy _ entry into the world trade body will
carry profound implications.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists here compare WTO entry to Deng Xiaoping's
landmark opening of the economy to market forces and foreign
influence in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening of China to the outside world began with Mao
Zedong's meeting with Richard Nixon in 1972,'' said Hu Angang, a
leading economist here at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ``The
second major stage was marked by Deng Xiaoping's visit to the
United States in 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joining WTO will represent a whole new stage in China's
opening to the world,'' Hu said. ``It will signify a shift from
partial to comprehensive opening and reform,'' he said, ``and a
shift from an opening based on domestic rules to an opening based
on internationally defined rules.''
</P>
<P>
   China's embrace of more open markets reflects the desire of
Jiang and other top leaders to push ahead with a radical overhaul
of the domestic economy, opening it to global competition and
bringing in more foreign capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and his fellow Communist Party leaders see the economic
transformation as vital if China to become a great power in the
century ahead. They also know that if they do not provide steadily
rising incomes to their people, the party's rule is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So the renewed opening is perhaps an unavoidable but risky step
for the Communist leaders, who can expect to see some cherished
state enterprises crushed even as others are energized. In the
short run, at least, already impoverished farmers may be harmed by
cheap imports and more urban workers will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the changes China has promised are breathtaking in
their scope. But even the most optimistic American officials
concede that threatened Chinese ministries and provinces are likely
to find ways to delay implementation of many provisions. This
suspicion is likely to feed controversy in the United States about
the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Democrats and Republicans say the agreement will
almost certainly be approved in Congress sometime early next year,
after a spirited debate.

REACTING TO SANCTIONS, AFGHANS ATTACK U.N. OFFICES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With international sanctions imposed on
Afghanistan on Sunday because of the Taliban's refusal to turn over
a Saudi-born Islamic militant to the United States, mobs in several
Afghan cities have stepped up attacks and protests directed at the
United Nations, organization officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, demonstrations have been held at U.N. offices in
several cities, including Kabul, the capital. On Monday, an office
in Farah was burned, the United Nations reported from Islamabad,
Pakistan. No staff members have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that the Taliban focus on U.N. offices, because
there is no American presence in Afghanistan. U.N. officials there
say that the Taliban, the Islamic militants who control much of the
country, have been unable or unwilling to keep large mobs from
overrunning their police units. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
condemned the attacks on Monday and warned the Taliban that it was
their responsibility to protect U.N. buildings.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. agencies are providing an assortment of aid programs for
Afghanistan again, after an interruption last year caused by
security problems and the treatment of female staff members. The
World Food Program recently reopened a bakery in Mazar-i-Sharif to
make cheap bread available to 85,000 people. An antipolio campaign
is in progress, and Unicef is helping support home schools where
girls can receive basic educations.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions against the Taliban, which freeze assets abroad
and bar the Afghan national airline, Ariana, from international
routes, were approved by the Security Council at the insistence of
the United States. Washington has charged the Saudi-born militant,
Osama bin Laden, with complicity in the bombings of American
embassies last year in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Some relief officials have criticized the measures, saying that
for many poor and barely middle-class Afghans the airline is the
sole link with the outside world for trade and that ending the
flights will kill much the incipient commercial activity.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Afghan postal authorities asked for permission to fly
at least twice a week to collect and deliver mail to this
landlocked country. A sanctions committee being set up by the
Security Council will make those decisions, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban say that the United States has never presented them
with evidence of bin Laden's links to the bombings or other acts of
terrorism.

`SOPRANOS' STAR WORKS ON IMAGE ; MIZRAHI'S ASSOCIATES FIND NEW
PROJECTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When some aspiring actresses envision their own
stardom, they think of time spent writing gushy notes to their good
friend Tom Ford, thanking him for all those feathered jeans and
python stilettos he keeps sending over, no bill enclosed.
</P>
<P>
   During the decade-plus she struggled to make it in show
business, Edie Falco was never one to harbor those fantasies.
Fashion simply wasn't something Ms. Falco, now the star of ``The
Sopranos,'' the HBO series, thought much about. For years she
happily made do with unfeathered jeans and discarded clothes from
the movies on which a friend, Eric Mendelsohn, assisted the costume
designers. Once, Mendelsohn recalled, he gave Ms. Falco items from
a film in which the lead character, named Dottie, just wore things
with dots. ``For a long time, Edie only wore dots,'' Mendelsohn
said. Now a director, he cast Ms. Falco in the title role of his
first feature, ``Judy Berlin,'' to be released in February.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of ad hoc approach to dressing doesn't work once
you are finally famous, as Ms. Falco is learning. Shortly after a
television show declared her one of the worst-dressed guests at the
Emmys in September _ an event in which she won the best-actress
award for her portrayal of Carmela Soprano, the mob wife with
social aspirations _ HBO provided Ms. Falco with the services of a
stylist, Toni Fusco, and a $20,000 budget to help the actress
refurbish her image.
</P>
<P>
   From her apartment in Manhattan last week, Ms. Falco said she
was humiliated when she discovered from friends that panelists on
Melissa and Joan Rivers' post-Emmy show had found her seemingly
innocuous Pamela Dennis skirt and halter top so offensive. ``It's
actually a big deal for me to get dressed like a grown-up,'' she
explained. ``I thought I looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was embarrassed at how embarrassed I was,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Falco dealt with her shame by joking to all her ``Sopranos''
colleagues about her worst-dressed status, hoping she'd be the
first to tell them. (Everyone, as it turns out, already knew.) Ms.
Falco began asking a ``Sopranos'' costume designer for fashion
advice, and soon enough Ms. Fusco was called by the network's
talent-relations office to help the ``Sopranos'' star do some
shopping. (A spokeswoman for HBO said she couldn't comment on the
matter.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she looked beautiful at the Emmys,'' Ms. Fusco said.
``I felt so bad for her.''
</P>
<P>
   On their major shopping outing, Ms. Fusco took the actress to
DKNY (Ms. Falco's suggestion), Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman
and Manolo Blahnik (the stylist's choices). Ms. Falco bought a
pantsuit, a handkerchief skirt, some cashmere sweaters and a few
pairs of pumps. But bleeding HBO dry she is not. The actress' total
purchases came to about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE AFTER MIZRAHI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Eisner, a former fashion editor, muse and stylist, has
strayed far from the world of dressing celebrities. Having worked
for Isaac Mizrahi overseeing ad campaigns, Ms. Eisner began
rethinking the merits of a career based on the vagaries of the
runway when the designer closed his business last year. ``I felt
that I was at a point where I was over the whole fashion world,''
Ms. Eisner said from her home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With the encouragement of her friend Bruce Weber, the
photographer, Ms. Eisner teamed up with a former Mizrahi colleague,
Roman Alonso, and a graphic designer, Lorraine Wild, to open an
art-book publishing house named Greybull Press in Los Angeles.
Forthcoming books include ``Height of Fashion,'' with images of
people at moments when they feel they've looked their best, as well
as a book on all things custom-made, photographed by Dewey Nicks.
</P>
<P>
   Greybull's first book, though, due in February, comes from Ms.
Eisner herself. Titled ``Rodeo Girl,'' it features pictures taken
from the world of rodeo queen pageants, an obsession of Ms.
Eisner's, who grew up in Cheyenne, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodeo Girl'' also attracted another member of the Mizrahi
circle, Douglas Keeve. Keeve, who directed the documentary
``Unzipped,'' about Mizrahi, was so intrigued by the subject of the
book that he's going to begin shooting a new documentary (with Ms.
Eisner) on rodeo pageants in Las Vegas later this month. The film
will be financed in part by Polo Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Keeve, who has moved back to New York from Los Angeles, said he
was offered a chance to direct studio films after the success of
``Unzipped'' in 1995, but nothing panned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stuff I'd been dreaming about my whole life,'' he said.
``Rodeo Girl,'' though, is a project he's looking forward to. ``I
didn't make `Unzipped' for my fashion friends,'' he said. ``This is
similar. People will hear about this film and say `Who cares?' And
they'll see this film and say, `I care.''' &QL;

 SANTA MONICA, Calif.: of tellers.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   But then some banks as well as some nonfinancial companies began
realizing that charging customers would make it economical to put
ATMs in remote locations and away from banks themselves. Moreover,
the prohibition on surcharges raised antitrust issues because it
made it difficult for nonbanks to be in the ATM business because
there would be no way to recover their costs. This led to the state
laws allowing the fees and to the decision in 1996 by two major
national ATM networks _ Visa's Plus and Mastercard International's
Cirrus _ to lift the prohibition on surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the number of ATMs has nearly doubled to 227,000 from
123,000 in 1997, according to the American Bankers Association.
Most of the new machines are not at banks and thrifts but at
supermarkets, malls, airports, amusement parks and other so-called
off-premise locations. Indeed, slightly more than half of all ATMs
are now off premise, according to Bank Network News, a
Chicago-based newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, about half of all new ATMs _ including most of the
off-premise ones _ are owned by companies other than banks, thrifts
or credit unions, according to Speer &AMP; Associates, an Atlanta
consulting firm. These companies include Electronic Data Systems,
the big computer services company, the Publix Supermarkets chain
and many smaller companies that have gone into business just to
provide ATMs. Many retailers own their own ATMs, but some merely
collect some fee from the ATMs that are stationed in their stores
but are owned by others.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco and Santa Monica laws allow these nonfinancial
institutions to levy the surcharges, under the theory that they do
not gain savings from having fewer tellers. The Connecticut rule,
however, bars surcharges on all machines. The New York ordinance
has not been drafted yet but could be similar to the California
ones.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer groups say that bank fees are well in excess of
what it costs for an ATM transaction, some bankers say they are
losing money on ATMs even with the surcharges. And they say
prohibiting surcharges will force closure of many ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the surcharge, there's no way a lot of off-premise
ATMs can be profitable,'' said Robert Litan, director of economic
studies at the Brookings Institution, who studied the matter for
the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence on this question is mixed. Connecticut has only about
two-thirds of the number of ATMs per million people as the nation
as a whole, according to Bank Network News. But Iowa has almost as
many machines per capita as the nation as a whole and more than
some states that allow the surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   In their court case in San Francisco, Bank of America, Wells
Fargo and the California Bankers Association argue that local
ordinances are pre-empted by federal banking regulation. The Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal regulator, has
intervened in the case on the side of the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have won decisions on these grounds in Iowa and
Connecticut, but the ban on surcharges in those states remains
while the decisions are being appealed. But a 1990 decision by the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and
other Western states, found that a federal law does allow some room
for states to regulate ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the surcharges say they favor the big banks under the
theory that consumers, to avoid the fees, will put their accounts
in banks that have the most machines. ``When a business can gain
customers by raising prices, that's not what competition is all
about,'' said Adam Radinsky, deputy city attorney for Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller banks and credit unions have pushed for free ATM
use or have banded together to offer free use to one another's
customers, to better compete with bigger banks. Still, many smaller
banks impose the surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Santa Monica, some people think the whole controversy is
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Santa Monica is overstepping its rights trying to
impose business practices on the banks, and I think the banks are
being vindictive and hasty in trying to make a statement back to
the city of Santa Monica,'' said Katrina Osio, a 33-year-old
marketing director of an Internet company. ``I just think it's
childish.''

   CHINA TO OPEN ITS ECONOMY UNDER LANDMARK TRADE DEAL
</P>
<P>
   United States and Chinese negotiators agreed to open China's
economy to foreign competitors and make the world's most populous
nation a full partner in international commerce. Under the deal,
Beijing would reduce tariffs on industrial and agricultural
products and lift many of the barriers in the way of American
companies. In exchange, the United States agreed to support China
for membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Moore, the head of the World Trade Organization, cautioned
that several steps remained before China could become a
full-fledged member.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chinese and China-related companies surged as
investors concluded that the trade agreement would help Chinese
companies more than hurt them.

   UPRISING WIDENS OVER ATM FEES

HOSTESSES RELY ON FAMILY HEIRLOOMS TO SERVE UP MEMORIES AT
THANKSGIVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setting the holiday table is the best reason to take on the
chore of hosting the family's holiday feast.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing the stage is an exhilarating ritual, one that many
hostesses are loath to share. They think of it as an intimate act
of self-expression _ the gift of the meal surrounded by the setting
that says this moment is special.
</P>
<P>
   There are family members who have never been a part of this
ritual. They don't know where the tablecloths are stored, and
they've never seen the felt-lined chest that holds the family
silver. They will never experience the familial connection of
pulling Grandmother's gravy boat from the back of the cupboard and
washing the dust off by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers jealously guard their position as sole table designer,
and only when their daughters reach a double-digit age are they
allowed to help. Direction and vision belong to the hostess; girls
are allowed to assist, but their contributions are not sought. Sons
are rarely inducted into the silver-setting, centerpiece-arranging
routine, and that is a shame.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wonderful sense of continuity that comes from
preparing the same meal that Mother and Grandmother made. No matter
how antiquated the menu _ starch-heavy and bereft of fresh produce
_ there is a sense of history in using the same recipes and serving
the food in some of their hand-me-down dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the family think the holiday table appears as if
by magic.
</P>
<P>
   The process begins in the early hours when the house is quiet,
long before the guests arrive and when the children are still
asleep. For a moment, the cold turkey and empty pie pans are
abandoned in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The dining-room table is cleared of homework, bills and shopping
bags. It is wrenched apart with a terrible sticky, creaky-wood
groan. The leaves are wrestled into place, and the table is pushed
back together. At either end, the wood is dull and scratched,
showing the wear of family dinners. The center leaves have few
stories to tell; they are still shiny and slick. This visual tale
of old and of special occasion is the tableau, the stage, ready to
be dressed. ___
</P>
<P>
   When Renie Steves opens her cabinets to take out her holiday
table settings, she has multiple choices. The professional cooking
instructor has a weakness for stoneware and china, and her
cupboards are stacked with scores of patterns. But since this is
Thanksgiving she reaches for the 100-year-old cut glass. It
belonged to her father, a collection he compiled over many decades.
</P>
<P>
   Steves believes Thanksgiving is the perfect time to bring
memories and mementos to the table. She unpacks boxes and boxes of
the beautiful faceted glass. She has more-expensive crystal, she
has more-elaborate china, but the cut-glass pieces make her feel
connected. She begins to tell stories about her father and his
quest for yet another piece of glass.
</P>
<P>
   Glass becomes Steves' motif. She uses glass grapes to hold place
cards, and Baccarat crystal bone plates. She takes liberties with
her stemware. She can _ she is a wine writer, and she is not
intimidated at all about using small etched-glass tumblers for her
white wine and hollow-stem wine glasses for champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mixing casual with elegant is the best trick around,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Layers of cut-glass plates are piled on top of Royal Worcester
Livinia pattern china that rest on Fitz &AMP; Floyd green chargers. The
same green chargers are used at Christmas for another elaborate
table.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece, designed by Jill Ross, owner of French Meadows,
is filled with fresh produce. Ross said she was inspired by Flemish
still-life paintings of abundant flowers and fruit. So Ross did the
same, filling the table with seasonal fruits, vegetables and
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers market is wide open, and I try and use things that
will last awhile,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   She places decorative kale along the center line as a base on
which she piles pine cones, asparagus, cinnamon sticks, sunflowers,
cranberries, coffee beans, roses, hydrangeas, raspberries, Indian
corn, sheaves of wheat, artichokes, apples, and seed pods from
poppies. There are probably more things in the Ross mix; the sheer
variety is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to reflect the bounty of Thanksgiving as it flows
into Christmas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty is the key word in decorating holiday tables. Take a look
around the specialty stores and friends' homes. Notice how the pros
set the table. They use an abundance of stuff _ plates, glasses,
ornaments, flowers, silver. An overloaded table is the hallmark of
the holidays. There is no hint of a microwaved dinner when the
Spode Christmas pattern is towering over the buffet table.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't need a special set of china for holiday
dining. At Fort Worth's Dishes From the Past, mismatched patterns
are encouraged. Granny's Wedgwood can be paired with the Royal
Doulton, and a bit of Noritake can slide into the mix too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are buying patterned salad plates to go with a
plain set of china,'' said store owner Jennifer Marcell. She's
finding brides are now registering for entire sets of mismatched
patterns. It's quite the trendy thing to do.

SENATE REPUBLICANS DROP AMENDMENTS OPPOSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By TIM WEINER  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans agreed on Monday night to
eliminate or change a series of pro-business amendments in the
year's last spending bills, even though the measures had been
sponsored by members of their own party. The moves effectively
sweep away the next-to-last barrier to a final budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments, or riders, on the Interior Department spending
bill, had been fiercely opposed by environmentalists, and on Monday
night the riders were altered or abolished to the satisfaction of
the White House, said senior administration officials and a top
House Republican.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said last month that he would veto the bill if
it contained the amendments, which he called ``stealth attacks on
the environment.'' A senior White House official said the riders
had fallen to ``public pressure and the sense that the president
wasn't going to live with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said, ``We think the Interior issue is
settled.'' But he warned, ``Until it is signed, sealed and filed in
the House, you can't be sure of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress and the White House were working
Monday night on one last multibillion-dollar bargain they needed to
complete a deal: a package of budget cuts and accounting devices,
known collectively as ``offsets,'' totaling about $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That would cover the costs of new programs the Republicans want,
along with the spending compromises they struck with the White
House in budget negotiations. It would also give the Republicans
political cover by allowing them to say their spending bills did
not dip into Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the Interior Department riders was reached
during a three-way conference call among the White House budget
director, Jack Lew; Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio. Gorton, speaking long-distance from his home state,
was frustrated by the outcome, said his spokeswoman, Cynthia
Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation ``closed up the things we thought were a huge
problem,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a rider allowing mining companies to dump
thousands of tons of waste on federal land. It would have
effectively erased a 1997 Interior Department ruling limiting dump
sites to five acres per mine. The Republicans agreed to let the
limit apply to all applications for mining permits filed after the
1997 ruling, meaning it would cover more than 300 applications so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Other mining regulations, which would have been nullified by the
riders, will take effect in April. They impose new environmental
restrictions and financial requirements on mining operations to
prevent companies from walking away from played-out mines.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's agreement also appears to end a long and
hard-fought effort by Senate Republicans on behalf of energy
companies. They sought to block the Interior Department from making
companies pumping oil and gas from federal lands pay royalties
based on the market price of the oil. Some companies set the price
themselves, saving a total of about $5 million a month in fees owed
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The new pricing scheme will go into effect March 15. The
chairmen of the Senate and House Appropriations committees said
they would oppose any new attempt to alter it.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans said Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the
ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, had lifted
his threat to hold up a budget deal until Congress passed a new law
that would allow his state's coal miners to keep dumping wastes in
valley streams.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's agreement also eliminated another rider that
would have blocked a rule barring new roads in 40 million acres of
national forest until 2001, when the next administration takes
power.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republican riders remain. One stops the Interior
Department from prohibiting lead mining along the Ozark National
Scenic Riverways in Missouri. Another automatically renews
ranchers' grazing permits on federal lands for 10 years while
federal environmental reviews are conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The final deal also doubled to about $400 million the money that
will go to one of President Clinton's favorite projects, the Lands
Legacy Program, which buys scenic or environmentally sensitive land
threatened by development.

150,000 FEWER SMOKERS IN SIX YEARS, BAY STATE TO REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Touting its aggressive antitobacco program, the state
Department of Public Health today is releasing statistics that show
Massachusetts with at least 150,000 fewer smokers than six years
ago, and a slightly declining teen smoking rate that is bucking a
national trend.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which will be presented at the monthly Public Health
Council meeting, will also show that 75,000 fewer people died from
tobacco-related illnesses since the state's tobacco control program
began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials Monday refused to divulge the survey
numbers, but Cellucci administration sources have described the
latest findings as ``incredible'' and that it demonstrates that the
Massachusetts antismoking program ``leads the country (if not the
world)'' in efforts to curb tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging facts to emerge is that there are
signs that Massachusetts teens _ the hardest age group to convince
to stay away from cigarettes and other tobacco products _ are
smoking less at a time when the trend nationally indicates
teenagers are smoking more.
</P>
<P>
   According to one source, youth smoking fell to 19 percent from
25 percent, a 20 percent drop. The change is within the 8 percent
margin of error of the poll, but officials are still expected to
point to the drop as a trend, particularly at a time when national
figures show teen smoking rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Adult Tobacco Survey, which is taken from time
to time for the department's Tobacco Control Program, was carried
out by the Center for Survey Research at the University of
Massachusets/Boston and was completed early in the summer. It is
taken by random phone surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts antismoking campaign, which spends $13 million
on advertising, has often been held up as national model. Since it
began in 1993, various studies have shown there have been steep
drops in Massachusetts adult smoking.
</P>
<P>
   An Abt Associates study last year found consumption of
cigarettes dropped by 31 percent in six years to a rate that ranked
Massachusetts as the third lowest in the nation. The survey being
released measures the smoking rate, or the percentage of people who
say they smoke on a regular basis, as compared to consumption,
which is measured by sales.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results are being released at the same time the
American Cancer Society _ the prime sponsor of the 1992 ballot
question that raised the cigarette tax by 25 cents per pack and
created the nationally acclaimed antismoking advertising program _
promotes its Great American Smokeout on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Fresina, the society's director of government affairs, said
she did not know the exact results of the survey but had heard they
are ``very very encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``But despite all this good news, there is still a need to
redouble our efforts,'' Fresina said. ``Twenty-eight people a day
die in Massachusetts and we have not won the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has agreed to use $22.8 million that the state
is receiving from the national tobacco settlement and add it to the
$31.2 million current annual funding for the Department of Public
Health's antismoking program, an increase in the department's
budget of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The additional funding is part of the $20.87 billion budget plan
lawmakers put on Governor Paul Cellucci's desk last week. The
governor, who is expected to announce his vetoes Tuesday, will
leave the funding intact, administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Cellucci has sharply questioned the large amounts
of expenditures for tobacco control. In his budget plan released in
January, the governor suggested spending $500,000 to evaluate the
program. He also wanted to divert $4 million to a firefighters
education program for school children that allowed firemen to earn
overtime. Public health critics said the program was not effective
in preventing smoking and was a boondoggle for a firefighters union
that endorsed the governor's election.
</P>
<P>
   The $22.8 million will be used for four different areas: $7
million will be directed to local communities to enforce local
ordinances and by-laws; $6.7 million for tobacco cessation
programs; $2.5 million for research and evaluations; and $6.6
million to media campaigns targeting minority areas.

MICROSOFT WORKERS QUESTION GORE AND DON'T LIKE HIS ANSWERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vice President Al Gore stepped into the lion's
den Monday, facing down hundreds of Microsoft employees smarting
from the judicial finding that their company had bullied its rivals
and stifled competition. He told them just what they did not want
to hear _ that competition is fundamentally a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   With 300 people packing an auditorium on the computer giant's
campus, the vice president talked about ``unfair use of market
dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector.''
He added: ``If competition is valuable, which I think it is, then
antitrust laws have a place in embodying the values of our
country.'' At another point: ``The values that are inherent in the
antitrust laws are ones that are sound, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was virtually echoing the heart of the federal government's
case against Microsoft, and the atmosphere here in the company
auditorium went icy at his words.
</P>
<P>
   Gore trooped out to Microsoft, Washington state's largest
employer, as just another candidate for president. He was following
in the footsteps of several of his rivals, including former Sen.
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, his sole Democratic challenger, and a
number of Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore had the added burden of representing an administration
that has ferociously pummeled Microsoft in court. Complicating his
task as a candidate is the fact that, as one questioner pointed
out, Gore is probably the most ``technologically savvy'' candidate
ever to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   He also had the misfortune to have had an earlier meeting here
rescheduled so that Monday's visit came just 10 days after Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court found in a
devastating assessment that the company has monopoly control over
PC operating systems and that it wields that power in ways that are
hurt American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wearing a sweater and slacks, the casual attire that
Microsoft allows its employees, tried at first to avoid commenting
on the case. But the audience relentlessly questioned him about his
views. Isn't government interference more of a threat to consumers
than Microsoft? he was asked. Isn't it a dangerous invasion of
privacy when the government can cull and regurgitate someone's
e-mails to use against them in court?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most pointedly, one employee told Gore that he shared
his Democratic social values and wanted to vote for him but felt
deeply conflicted because of the administration's ``favorable
reaction to a ruling that says we're harming consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, a law professor specializing in anti-trust
cases at George Washington University, said afterward that Gore had
put himself in ``an extraordinarily difficult position,'' but, he
said, ``the issues the case raises are so fundamental to the future
of the company and of innovation that it's perfectly reasonable for
people to ask what his views are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a precedent for commenting on such cases. When Boeing
acquired McDonnell-Douglas in 1997, Gore came to the home of Boeing
in Seattle and said the United States would fight attempts by
Europe to block the merger. Kovacic said that Gore's advocacy in
favor of Boeing's monopoly, and in favor of the American company's
pre-eminence in the aircraft sector of the economy, stood in stark
contrast to the administration's opposition in the case of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has a lot of domestic enemies, and a lot of them are
in Silicon Valley, and they have thrown a lot of cash at both
parties, but in particular to the Democrats,'' Kovacic said.
``Microsoft has a legion of enemies who hold it in contempt. And
that's a tricky issue for the White House. Do you attack the
pre-eminent symbol of American information technology success or
safeguard the interests of their Silicon Valley opponents? It's a
tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore turned the conversation to one of values, mentioning
support for research and development, dealing with inequality and
then said: ``And yet another value that I think is important in our
country is competition. And competition can be stifled both by
unwise and unhealthy government action and also by private action
on the part of companies that want to unfairly use market dominance
in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this grim judgment, Gore has tried to portray himself as
a friend of the high-tech industry, going so far earlier this year
to proclaim himself as the father of the Internet. He has promoted
tax credits for research and development, and Monday he threw
around notions like and quantum computing and Moore's Law with
abandon. He also noted that one of his daughters, Karenna, had
worked briefly at Slate, Microsoft's online magazine. One of his
former employees, Ginny Terzano, once Gore's press secretary, has
just been hired by Microsoft to head its lobbying office in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what kind of affinity Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman, may have for Gore. Gates was not on hand for
Monday's visit, having a prior commitment at a conference. There
has been considerable debate over Gates' political leanings and
speculation that he wants to drag out the lawsuit until a new
president takes office and appoints a new chief of the Justice
Department's anti-trust division.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft gave $1.3 million last year to candidates in both
parties. Microsoft employees have been more generous to Republicans
this year than to Democrats, giving $29,000 to Bush and $13,000 to
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees who attended Monday's session with Gore
reflected the computer industry's stance that elected politics has
little to do with their success. A cluster of employees, who
declined to give their names, said they were more interested in
Gore's views on education and health care than on the anti-trust
case because, as one put it, ``the administration doesn't have much
say in the overall economic growth of the last 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's comments did not appear to win him many friends. ``I
appreciate him being honest,'' said one employee. ``But I'm not
encouraged. He was on the side of the government.''

TRADE MISSION COST TAXPAYERS $142,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It will go down as one of the most expensive trade
missions Massachusetts has ever organized.
</P>
<P>
   A one-week trip to France and Ireland in June cost taxpayers
$142,000 _ an average of nearly $16,000 for each of the nine people
in the official Massachusetts delegation, according to expense
accounts released Monday to the Boston Globe under the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The tally included:
</P>
<P>
   --$42,872 for individual hotel and food costs and another
$13,000 in airfare.
</P>
<P>
   --$10,000 for cars and vans in Paris, and $10,500 for the same
in Dublin and Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   --$8,869 for 16 rental cell phones, with extra charges for a
lost leather pouch and battery charger. Kathleen Molony, head of
the Massachusetts Trade Office, said the delegation knew the phones
would be expensive, but felt it was important to stay in constant
contact with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it (nearly) $9,000?'' said Jason Kauppi, a spokesman for
Governor Paul Cellucci. ``Well, when you're overseas selling
yourself, you need to look like you're a world class operation.''
</P>
<P>
   --$6,800 for meeting room rental charges in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   --A $2,400 Parisian breakfast for 50 at an average cost of $48
per head.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly $2,000 for dozens of trinkets _ letter openers,
coasters, glassware, and frames _ from Boston jeweler Shreve, Crump
&AMP; Low that the governor handed out to dignitaries. Another $140 was
spent on gifts for officials in Ireland. ``We do take gifts as a
matter of protocol,'' Molony said.
</P>
<P>
   --About $2,000 for a tour of Paris and help with protocol for
Cellucci's three days in France. That included some translation
services for courtesy calls with French ministers.
</P>
<P>
   --$150 for luggage pickup at a Paris hotel.
</P>
<P>
   An internal post-trip report written by the state director of
economic development Carolyn Boviard shows that IBM, Custom
Extrusion, and Cerulean Technology Inc. had possible business leads
from the trade mission, but that there was little else to show for
the costly excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That report was done immediately following the mission,'' said
Candace Perodeau, a spokeswoman for Boviard. ``Those were just
initial reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Molony conceded that, nearly five months after the trade
mission, there is still no tangible commerce as a result of the
trip. ``It sometimes takes a bit longer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken White, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, was
shocked to hear the litany of expenses. ``It would be interesting
to hear those who flew on this trade mission explain how the
investment and trinkets from Shreve, Crump &AMP; Low produce benefits
for the taxpayers of Massachusetts,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to ask, `What sort of return do we get in exchange for
this kind of outlay?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some on the trip did pay their own way, including House Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran, who used campaign funds to cover expenses.
Boston College and Northeastern University paid their own way, as
did local companies.
</P>
<P>
   IBM attended six meetings. ``Among the successes noted that came
from the trip was the opportunity the trade mission offered to
`introduce Investment Belfast to Lotus,' '' stated the economic
development report, which was also released to the Globe. ``The
company (IBM/Lotus) speculates that it may earn as much as $5
million from having participated in the trade mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerulean Technology ``had meaningful follow-up with seven
different firms,'' and Custom Extrusion ``was able to survey the
markets and to see how the Economic Union is changing the manner in
which business transactions occur,'' the report said. The company
told the state it had found a ``strong contact in France with whom
they plan on doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boston College said it found a potential pool of
technical workers in Ireland. Northeastern said the trip was
``useful in talking about the French education system.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cellucci took office as lieutenant governor in 1991, there
have been 25 state trade missions, according to Molony. She said
the only one in recent memory that cost more was a trip to South
America that spanned four countries. However, she said she did not
know the bottom-line expense of that mission.
</P>
<P>
   Kauppi, Cellucci's spokesman, defended the trip, saying France
imported $700 million in goods and services from Massachusetts,
making the country the sixth-leading export for the state. And
Ireland, with its booming economy, has tremendous trade growth
potential.

<P>
   For American International Group, the giant insurer, the new
trade agreement with China is a long-awaited go-ahead to sell
insurance everywhere in China, not in just a few cities. AT&AMP;T sees
the door open to provide Internet services in China. And Milliken &AMP;
Co., the big textile manufacturer _ forecasting doom _ says that
President Clinton's negotiators have signed a death warrant for the
industry in America.
</P>
<P>
   Many industries _ commercial banking, auto and aircraft
manufacturing, farming and food processing, investment banking,
electronics, money management, filmmaking _ hailed the agreement
Monday between China and the United States as a wonderful
opportunity to expand rapidly into the giant Chinese market. The
Clinton administration gave its blessing to China's entry into the
World Trade Organization in exchange for numerous market-opening
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have $200 million in revenue from selling
insurance in China and I expect that to grow to a very big number
in the future,'' said Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American
International Group, which has been selling life insurance to the
Chinese since 1992. The agreement would allow the insurer to
increase the number of its branch offices to as many as 12, from
four, and expand into property and casualty insurance _ well ahead
of other American insurers just moving into China.
</P>
<P>
   The dissonant notes came mainly from textile makers, although a
spokesman for the computer software industry said people in that
industry would withhold judgment until they knew the details of the
agreement dealing with piracy. ``We are cautious in endorsing
anything until we have seen the final ink dried on the paper,''
said Dan Duncan, a vice president of the Software and Information
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   The piracy rate for business software has been 95 percent in
recent years, which means that for every 100 copies of Microsoft
Office software exported to China, 95 are copied illegally, Duncan
said. ``One has to wonder why the rate has stayed so high over the
years unless there is some government involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Textile import quotas now limit the shipment of yarn and cloth
to the United States from China's modern and low-cost textile
industry, which is big enough to supply the entire world, said John
Nash, counsel for Milliken in Washington. The World Trade
Organization requires its member countries to phase out tariffs and
quotas, but American manufacturers had counted on 10 more years of
limits on Chinese imports, until 2010, Nash said. The new
agreement, however, specifies Jan. 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration and Congress are spending our jobs like
drunken sailors,'' Nash said, arguing that many of the 551,000
people still employed in American textile factories could lose
their jobs as a result of the accord. Congress must still approve
the deal reached in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO also objected strenuously to dealing with a country
with a poor human rights record. In a statement that promised
fierce opposition to congressional approval, John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO, said, ``The agreement reached this
weekend deals away our democratic principles and most cherished
values, and we will fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cheering from corporate America carried the day. ``China
is the only place in the world where you can go and see economic
development right in front of your eyes,'' said Stephen Roach,
chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``If China
comes alive, they are going to really need advice and insight from
global financial service companies like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   American commercial banks are big beneficiaries. Since 1997,
they have been allowed to provide services to foreign companies
operating in China. Now they will gradually be allowed to provide
services to Chinese companies, making them loans, handling currency
transactions and providing other services. ``Based on our
understanding of the terms, the agreement provides a very
significant liberalization in China's financial services market,''
said a spokesman for Citigroup, which has seven offices in China.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, American money managers, including the big
Wall Street brokerage houses and mutual funds like Fidelity,
Vanguard and T. Rowe Price, will be allowed to form joint ventures
with Chinese companies, owning up to 33 percent at first and as
much as 49 percent in a few years. Just as these firms rushed into
Japan when that nation opened its gates, they most likely will rush
into China, where they see a fresh supply of investor cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are big savers,'' said Robert Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies see themselves as big potential
winners. AT&AMP;T, whose operations are limited now to providing
services for 50 foreign multinational companies in China, sees the
agreement as the first step in allowing American companies to
invest in Chinese Internet providers. ``Internet is the biggest
area that we are currently excluded from,'' said Bruce Jackson,
AT&AMP;T's vice president for global marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also viewed the agreement, or at least the sparse
details available Monday, as a new Chinese willingness to permit
foreign investment in mobile phone systems and other
telecommunications services _ providing Motorola with an expanded
market for the cell phones, pagers and semiconductors that Motorola
already makes in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any expansion in investment opportunities in China translates
into opportunities for Motorola,'' said Norman Sandler, the
company's director of strategic issues. ``Motorola itself might
invest in new wireless ventures, foreign or Chinese, and sell
equipment to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Automakers, whose sales in China are still tiny, hailed a
provision in the agreement that will let foreigners provide Chinese
with car loans, but most said they were waiting to see the final
terms before judging its benefits. And Caterpillar Inc. pointed to
China's new willingness to let foreign companies distribute their
own products exported to China, replacing Chinese distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are allowed to own one dealership now and we would set up
more, although how many more we don't know yet,'' said William
Lane, Caterpillar's director of governmental affairs. ``This is
just the first bite of the apple,'' he added. ``By joining the
World Trade Organization, China will be obligated to permit further
market openings.''
</P>
<P>
   Farm organizations said that China had moved in the right
direction in lowering tariffs on food imports, although Gene Paul,
president of the National Farmers Organization, cautioned: ``This
is not going to change the current situation of low prices. I've
read that China had a record corn crop, and we have to realize that
ships run both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronics manufacturers expressed concern that the Chinese
government would pressure foreign manufacturers to buy supplies
from state-owned Chinese companies. But in general, corporate
America saw in the treaty a new willingness in China to abide by
international rules of trade and to avoid conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the view at Boeing Inc., which has always sold
aircraft to Chinese airlines. ``This treaty brings us a huge step
toward creating a normal business relationship between the two
countries,'' said Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman. ``And in that
climate we can be very successful.''

KERRY BILL WOULD CREATE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE D. BUTTERFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling affordable housing a ``glaring need,'' Senator John
Kerry is set to announce Tuesday a sweeping legislative proposal
calling for the creation of a $2 billion-a-year National Housing
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The trust, which the Massachusetts Democrat said can be funded
by annual revenues of the Federal Housing Administration, would be
used to help create rental housing for low- and moderate-income
families, and to expand elderly housing and homeownership programs
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund proposal to create affordable housing is the
centerpiece of an address Kerry is scheduled to deliver Tuesday
night at the 32nd annual dinner of the Citizens' Housing and
Planning Association Inc. (CHAPA) in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Kerry's office said the senator, who is the
ranking Democrat on the Senate's housing subcommittee, will work to
build bipartisan support for the legislation to establish the trust
fund, which he expects to introduce at the next session of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, housing is the forgotten stepchild in the policy
debate at the national level,'' Kerry said in a prepared statement.
He said the federal government ``has to begin to again play a more
aggressive role in increasing (housing) supply.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, the federal government helped build an average
of 128,000 affordable housing units per year, but that number fell
to just 53,000 affordable units per year in the 1990s, according to
CHAPA.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Kerry's office noted, the declining federal commitment
has come at a time of soaring rents and real estate prices _ a
situation that is especially acute in Massachusetts _ and in the
face of a rapidly growing elderly population.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, there are about 130,000 low-income families
living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs, with as
many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing
units, officials said. Those numbers do not include tens of
thousands of moderate-income families in need of affordable
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Housing advocates Monday applauded Kerry's housing trust fund
proposal. They said his position on the Senate Housing
subcommitteee, combined with growing calls for affordable housing
from local officials, would give the proposal high visibility in
the next session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge shortage of rental housing for families and the
elderly. We need to do something to address that shortage, and this
proposal does,'' said Aaron Gornstein, executive director of CHAPA,
which is one of the region's most respected nonprofit housing
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a realistic, practical proposal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Kerry's plan calls for creation of a new
national housing trust, set up much like the federal highway trust
fund, which would take revenues generated by the FHA and reserve
them for use exclusively in federal housing initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources and housing officials said Monday the FHA
generates about $2 billion annually from insurance guarantees it
provides as one of the nation's largest mutual mortgage funds, and
from related sources.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday the $2 billion was in excess of reserves
the FHA is required to set aside.
</P>
<P>
   The money currently goes into the nation's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   According to an outline of the proposal, many of the legislative
efforts would be directed toward helping local and state
governments build affordable housing and boost the rate of
homeownership through an array of existing, but underfunded,
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing
Studies at Harvard University and a former head of the FHA, said
Kerry's proposal was a ``noteworthy'' way of addressing the
shortage of affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to find ways to give more resources to this
problem. It's a growing problem, and it's not going to go away,''
Retsinas said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kerry's proposal, the housing trust fund would be used to
expand rental housing for families, preserve and renovate existing
affordable housing, and increase subsidized housing and assisted
living for elderly, whose numbers are expected to grow dramatically
in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is also calling for more aid to low-income and first-time
home buyers through a program of tax credits to investors in
below-market second mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Another would allow home buyers to use IRAs for down payments on
homes.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR TEXAS SCHOOL PRAYER CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that combines the Constitution, God and
the Texas gridiron, the Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide if
public school students can conduct prayers before football games
without violating the constitutional separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   When the court hears arguments in the case this winter or
spring, the Santa Fe Independent School District in Galveston
County will press the justices to rule that pre-game prayers do not
violate the Constitution's prohibition on governmental endorsement
of religion. In successfully urging the high court to hear the
case, Santa Fe said the prayers are the legitimate free expression
of students who publicly seek God's assistance in maintaining
sportsmanship during the games.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe, marks
the Supreme Court's first major foray since 1992 into the thorny
First Amendment issue of governmental endorsement of religion at
public schools. The justices, in several decisions since 1962, have
ruled that the Constitution generally prohibits school-district
involvement in sectarian activities, saying that such participation
alienates students of minority religions.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited the Supreme Court's
line of religion cases in ruling in February that Santa Fe, by
permitting students to recite prayers before football games,
endorsed faith in violation of the Constitution. The First
Amendment prevents public schools from compelling students to
listen to expressions of religions they do not accept, the court
said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Leon Frels, representing the school board,
assailed that ruling and said the Constitution does not apply
because the students, not the school, are initiating and leading
the pre-game prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic and reasoning of the 5th Circuit's decision will
require that school officials prevent any speaker, including
speakers as diverse as athletes, politicians, academics,
entertainers, maybe even judges, from discussing a religious topic
or invoking the Lord's name, to ensure that no audience member
perceives that the school is endorsing the speaker's religious
message,'' Frels argued in a legal brief to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   But parents of some Santa Fe students, who have so far
successfully challenged the pre-game activity, countered that that
prayers violate the Constitution by subjecting players and
spectators to religious expressions with which they might disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that ... prayer before football games is led by
students does not diminish the pressure to religious conformity, if
anything, it may increase it,'' wrote the parents' attorney,
Anthony Griffin of Galveston, in a brief to the high court. ``And
the fact that a prayer is overtly sectarian only magnifies the
message that there is one (true) faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Santa Fe and the parents cited the Supreme Court's 1992
decision striking down as unconstitutional a planned invocation by
a rabbi at a high school graduation in Rhode Island. The justices
in Lee vs. Weisman held 5-4 that schools may not direct a religious
exercise at graduation ceremonies, noting that students at such
events have no real alternative but to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe argued that the Lee case does not apply to football
games because the students themselves, without the school's
direction or assistance, are conducting the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   But the parents challenging the school district countered that
football games are no different than graduation ceremonies insofar
as the students in attendance must either listen or leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe case has become a rallying cry for Texas political
leaders and lawmakers who regard God and the gridiron as virtually
inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Attorney General John Cornyn have
submitted a brief to the justices, urging them to rule the pre-game
prayers constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the leading Republican contender for president, hopes the
court will overturn the 5th Circuit decision because ``he believes
it is a First Amendment right for students to participate in the
free exercise of religion, and he believes government should not
dictate or censor the content of voluntary student-led prayer,''
said the governor's spokeswoman, Linda Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most members of the Texas congressional delegation
this month spearheaded passage of a House resolution calling on the
Supreme Court to rule pre-game prayers constitutional. The
resolution, which does not have the force of law, was intended to
express the ``sense of the House'' that the Constitution permits
students to publicly seek divine guidance for sportsmanship and
fairness before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   During the football season, Santa Fe High School senior Marian
Ward delivered prayers at home games. She and her family filed a
separate lawsuit in September challenging the ruling by the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that even nonsectarian,
nonproselytizing prayers were inappropriate at football games.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the nation's highest court would review the case
spread quickly through Santa Fe and Galveston County on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're elated, but I don't think we should be surprised,'' said
school board president John Couch. ``We've stood on principle for
the last six years, saying we believe our students have the First
Amendment right to their message.''

CELLUCCI SAID POISED TO VETO $10M FOR ELECTIONS REVAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Unmoved by more than 100 chanting protesters at his
office door Monday, Governor Paul Cellucci has decided to veto $10
million in the state budget to fund a voter-passed Clean Elections
law, as well as new language that campaign finance reformers say
guts the intent of the law, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci met with a handful of activists after a noisy throng
clogged the hallway and stairwells outside his office, at one point
drawing a security force of nine State Troopers, some in riot
helmets.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he was ``listening'' to the activists, but sources
said the governor had already concluded over the weekend that he
would veto the $10 million and the controversial language changes.
``He was headed in that direction for a couple of days,'' said one
Cellucci advisor, who added, ``the decision has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who sources say will also veto more than $100 million
in education funds, apparently did not make his decision on the
Clean Elections law clear to campaign finance reform activists.
They emerged from a meeting with the governor Monday encouraged
that he had seemed receptive to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that he is open-minded about it,'' said David
Donnelly, director of Mass Voters for Clean Elections, the group
which pushed the 1998 ballot initiative that created the law.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had hoped to convince Cellucci not to veto the
$10 million in Clean Elections funding, which would create a fund
that would give matching dollars to eligible political candidates
in an effort to limit the influence of special-interest money and
help make state elections more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   They have also urged him to strike language, added by the
Legislature, that would allow incumbents to raise huge amounts of
money for most of their terms and then tap into the new system six
months before an election.
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous crowd of activists first pursued the governor out
of a meeting with Republican leaders and chased him outside,
jeering and shouting as he jumped into a waiting black sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the group staged a sit-in outside Cellucci's office,
leading his aides to take the rare step of shutting the governor's
office doors and shutting down a nearby elevator bank, as
organizers passed out bottled water, ordered pizzas, and chanted:
``Clean elections now!''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders have argued the Clean Elections law passed
overwhelmingly last year would limit their ability to pay for
constituent services and other important non-campaign activities.
The governor has raised several other concerns about the law,
including his opposition to giving taxpayer dollars to candidates,
and the long-term costs of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will let stand a legislative proposal that will
create a study of the Clean Elections law and its potential costs.
Advocates say the voluntary public financing system, which kicks in
for the 2002 state elections, needs $56 million in public funds but
critics say it may cost considerably more.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has also argued that the money is not needed this year
and the state should wait for the outcome of court challenges that
could affect national campaign finance laws before appropriating
money. Advocates argue that the governor and legislators must
demonstrate a willingness to fund the system in order to encourage
candidates to join the system.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for the state legislature and statewide office can
qualify by raising enough matching funds in donations that cannot
exceed $100.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cellucci will unveil his other budget vetoes Tuesday
that could slash more than $400 million from the $20.87 billion
spending plan passed by the Legislature last week.
</P>
<P>
   With the Legislature scheduled to adjourn for the year at
midnight Wednesday, lawmakers are still unsure whether they will be
able to override key Cellucci vetoes. The Senate voted last week to
convene for special sessions if necessary, but an attempt to
suspend the House's rules and extend formal legislative sessions
was easily defeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was an important victory for House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran who is wary of having the Legislature return for an
open-ended special session. Cellucci warned that such a session
would result in a ``feeding frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of dissident House members were puzzled Monday after
winning just 43 votes on the motion to convene a special session.
Earlier, they had collected 61 signatures from members for a letter
asking Finneran to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cellucci's other vetoes will include $117 million
in education funds the governor did not seek but were added to the
budget by the Legislature. Word of those expected cuts stunned
advocates for more education funding, including Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham, who insisted the budget devote $245 million
to fund the state's 1993 Education Reform Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe my ears,'' said Birmingham. ``This is just
folly.'' If Cellucci vetoes the money, Birmingham said, ``he should
drop the pretense of being the education-reform governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has said his budget and the House's plan included
enough money to fund education reform. But Birmingham said those
budgets used a ``sleight of hand'' to divert $90 million from the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Beckwith, executive director of the Massachusetts
Municipal Association, added that such a veto would be ``enormously
troubling, especially in light of the latest MCAS results.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, sources said rather than striking a popular
teacher-retirement plan, Cellucci will send it back to the
Legislature with amendments, a move that would effectively kill the
measure.

   WASHINGTON _ Government officials said Monday evening that the
National Transportation Safety Board was considering asking the FBI
to take over the case of EgyptAir 990, after a review of the
plane's cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were focusing on a cryptic utterance,
possibly a prayer, that they indicated might be the last words of a
pilot determined to destroy himself and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in the Atlantic, near Nantucket Island, R.I.,
two weeks ago, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not characterize the words beyond saying that
they may have been a prayer. The crew's conversations, other than
uneventful ones with air traffic controllers, were in Arabic and
senior officials of the safety board said that even with the aid of
additional interpreters brought in Monday, they did not understand
what was being said on the tape. The problems were ones of
language, culture and hearing what people said in a noisy cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation investigators also stressed that they had not yet
synchronized the voice tape with the flight data recorder tape,
which would record events occurring on the airplane and could put
the statements in context. For instance, a prayer being said after
the plane began plummeting so fast that passengers were rendered
weightless would not be suspicious. So a fuller understanding of
the tape might make it clear that the crash was, in fact, an
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has supreme authority over transportation
accidents, and guards that role jealously, but the FBI, which
usually assists the board, takes over if the two agencies decide
that there was evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the safety board, Jim Hall, at a news conference
Monday afternoon, said, ``We are concentrating our efforts on
determining from the evidence, including the cockpit voice
recorder, whether or not this investigation is to remain under the
leadership of the NTSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify why he was focusing on whether the crash was
properly within his agency's jurisdiction, Hall simply reread his
statement about leadership of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the safety board proposed
stepping aside Monday afternoon, and taking a subordinate role
assisting the FBI, but was dissuaded by the FBI from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which had one agent sitting in with safety board
officials on Sunday to listen to the tape, sent more Monday
evening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The board is often eager to extricate itself from crashes that
are not caused by mechanical failures or human error; most
recently, it gave the FBI jurisdiction over the derailment of an
Amtrak train in October 1995, near Hyder, Ariz., that was
determined to have been caused by someone sabotaging the tracks. It
has also turned over two aircraft incidents, in which disgruntled
airline employees came into the cockpit and attacked the pilots
flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   And board officials say that they have a full agenda of work
ahead of them without this crash, including the TWA 800 crash three
years ago, which many initially suspected was sabotage. In
addition, they would not say how many voices were heard on the
tape. The cockpit requires a crew of two, and has two seats where
observers, trainees or company employees along for the ride can
sit.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 10-year-old Boeing 767, was cruising at 33,000 feet
about half an hour out of Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31
when the autopilot disengaged, either by itself or by the action of
a pilot. Then the plane flew steadily for a few more seconds, and
went into an extremely steep dive. During the dive, someone turned
off the engines.
</P>
<P>
   The dive was so steep that people inside were rendered
weightless, but after descending about 3 miles, the plane pitched
up again, subjecting everyone inside to two and a half times the
normal force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Then it turned downward again and apparently broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Monday evening, ``I am well aware of the many rumors,
theories, and stories circulating in the last 72 hours _ indeed, in
the last two weeks _ about potential causes of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. intelligence official said Monday night that the CIA
still has no evidence indicating terrorist activity in connection
with the crash. The official said that the CIA has translators
listening to the tape, but CIA officials still are not certain of
the significance of the utterances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An American pilot with long experience in crash investigations
run by the safety board suggested that the board's next steps could
include interviews and even cultural study, as opposed to technical
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the New York
office, said, ``as far as the FBI is concerned, we're doing the
same things today that we've been doing for the past two weeks. But
we all agree _ FBI, NTSB an the rest of the parties _ that the tape
recordings need to be further analyzed before people can reach
certain conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, FBI Director Louis Freeh met with Hall to discuss the
progress of the case and the possibility that the bureau might take
over the inquiry. In part, senior officials are worried over how to
pay for what could be a long and costly investigation, if it is
necessary to retrieve large sections of the aircraft from the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said the bureau might tap the
government's Counterterrorism Fund, a reserve of several million
dollars that is managed by the Justice Department. The fund is
designed to pay for extraordinary expenses involved in terror
cases, but only if the evidence suggests a criminal act.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan laid out in a
somber, self-critical report Monday the tragic story of how the
United Nations allowed the Bosnian Muslim ``safe area'' of
Srebrenica to be overrun in July 1995 by Bosnian Serbs, who then
systematically killed thousands of its men and boys.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica became a damaging symbol of the
organization's failure at peacekeeping in a new era of brutal civil
wars, and it demonstrated the inadequacy of a system that allowed
political considerations to color military decisions when troops
were under U.N. command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy of Srebrenica will haunt our history forever,''
the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Srebrenica and other towns that the Security Council
had identified as safe areas, but then refused to authorize enough
troops to defend, led four months later to the U.S.-sponsored
Dayton peace agreement and the introduction of a NATO-led
international military force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   While blame is widely distributed in the U.N. report, the
organization's examination of its own record in Srebrenica breaks
new ground by effectively damning the diplomatic nicety of trying
to remain neutral and above the fray in civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   This conclusion comes two months after Annan, taking a more
aggressive stance on crimes against civilian populations, startled
the opening session of this year's General Assembly by saying that
national borders would no longer protect leaders who abuse people
under their control.
</P>
<P>
   With his declaration and Monday's report, the United Nations is
saying that the time has come when it will have to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the
scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the
people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder,'' a
senior U.N. of come when it will have to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through error, misjudgment and the inability to recognize the
scope of evil confronting us we failed to do our part to save the
people of Srebrenica from the Serb campaign of mass murder,'' a
senior U.N. official said Monday, introducing the report. ``These
failings were in part rooted in a philosophy of neutrality and
nonviolence wholly unsuited to the conflict in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In particular,'' this official said, ``the report makes clear
the inadequacy of the entire approach of the United Nations to the
Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing and mass murder, culminating at
Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan was then in charge of U.N. peacekeeping; Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was the secretary-general, in overall command.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on about 100 interviews with a range of
international figures involved in Bosnia, singles out the Bosnian
Serb political and military leaders, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko
Mladic, as the ``architects and implementers of the attempted
genocide in Bosnia'' and criticizes all those who negotiated with
them rather than using military force against them in the early
stages of the war. It demands that they be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal lesson of Srebrenica,'' the report says, ``is
that a deliberate and systematic attempt to terrorize, expel or
murder an entire people must be met decisively with all necessary
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on Srebrenica was released on the same day that the
three joint presidents of Bosnia, speaking to the Security Council
on the fourth anniversary of the Dayton agreement, pledged to
create the first integral national institutions for Bosnia. The
country is now divided into an ethnic Serbian republic and a
federation of Bosnian Muslim and Croat areas.
</P>
<P>
   A multiethnic border patrol will be established to help curb
cross-border terrorism, smuggling and corruption. A secretariat
will be created for the joint presidency, which has had no shared
staff, and a common passport for all Bosnians will be introduced.
The three presidents have also agreed to form a peacekeeping unit
of their own to contribute to the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said that while these may seem like small steps,
it took Richard Holbrooke, the author of the Dayton accord and now
chief U.S. representative at the United Nations, six hours Sunday
night to extract agreement on them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say that the willingness of the three presidents _
Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim; Ante Jelavic, a Croat, and Zivko
Radisic, a Serb _ to act jointly in issuing what they call their
Declaration of New York reflects some important changes in the
political atmosphere of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnians now see their neighbors moving toward integration
in Europe and possible membership in the European Union _ a hope
that a fragmented, frequently dysfunctional Bosnian state cannot
possibly entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, U.S. officials said, the crumbling economic power and
unstable political situation in Serbia, the major republic
remaining in Yugoslavia, mean that Serbia is no longer a beacon to
the Bosnian Serb republic, which is now economically stronger in
some ways than the Serbian motherland.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The officials said that in recent months displaced people in
Bosnia, apparently feeling more secure, have begun returning to
rural areas from which they were displaced as ethnic minorities
during the four-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this important act,'' Holbrooke said in the Security
Council on Monday, ``the presidents have taken a major step toward
consolidating the progress of the past few years _ and in doing so,
have helped Bosnia take another step toward fulfilling the vision
of Dayton: a unified, single democratic country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Muslims now control the Srebrenica city council, though
not without considerable fears for their own safety, officials say.
Elected in 1997 but unable to venture back to the town for more
than a year, they were among the survivors of the massacres in July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica was then under the guardianship of 110 Dutch
peacekeepers, who were no match for the Serbs who suddenly
surrounded and assaulted the town. The U.N. report on Monday says
that the Dutch commander had asked for NATO air support on four or
five occasions but was either turned down or, finally, provided
with two patrols that dropped only two bombs and left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch government, however, feared that its troops might be
taken hostage and at least on one occasion strongly opposed
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the Dutch could have been more forthright
in reporting immediately after the incident what evidence they had
that a massacre was taking place. The study also faulted French and
British commanders leading U.N. troops for their reluctance to call
on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of the problem of protecting the safe areas _
Srebrenica, Zepa, Goradze, Bihac, Tuzla and Sarajevo _ was the
refusal of Security Council members, including the United States,
to authorize enough troops to do the job. Boutros-Ghali wanted
34,000; the Security Council authorized only 7,400. Later, U.S.
politicians blamed the secretary-general for the capture of most of
those enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the international community makes a solemn promise to
safeguard and protect innocent civilians from massacre,'' the
report says, ``then it must be willing to back its promise with the
necessary means.''

EVEN IF DUES PAYMENT IS MADE, U.S. MIGHT STILL LOSE GENERAL
ASSEMBLY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With DUES-CONGRESS) 
(HLW)

   UNITED NATIONS _ Appropriating nearly $1 billion in back dues
and assessments to the United Nations may not be enough to prevent
the United States from losing its vote in the General Assembly next
year, U.N. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.N. official estimated that the United States must
come up with at least $350 million by the end of December to avoid
forfeiting its vote. But legislation worked out by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., would
initially pay only $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is real because the U.N. charter says that any
country falling two years behind in its dues will be stripped of
its right to vote in the assembly. A few other countries have lost
their votes for this reason, such as Bengladesh and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official expressed confidence that the
gap could be covered by pooling the first payment with other funds
being appropriated in a separate bill for the Departments of State,
Commerce and Justice. Another official described this as ``creative
accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Helms-Biden legislation authorized $926 million in payment
over three years. But it also attached the following conditions,
which other countries are likely to challenge:
</P>
<P>
   --The other 187 member countries must accept the $926 million as
Washington's payment in full and agree not to keep billing for the
remaining arrears. The United Nation says that Washington owes
nearly $1.6 billion, using different calculations and counting
expenses that the United States has refused to pay for political
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   --The United States' share of the U.N. budget must be trimmed to
22 percent from 25 percent, which Washington has been paying for
years.
</P>
<P>
   --The United States' share of peacekeeping costs must be cut to
25 percent from 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --The U.N. budget cannot include any growth in spending, even
allowing for inflation. The budget has not risen in dollar terms
since since 1994, said Catherine O'Neill, the director of the U.N.
office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another condition, that the United States be reinstated on a key
budget committee, was met after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told foreign ministers attending the General Assembly in
September that without the committee seat, the administration would
find it impossible to get Congress to allocate money.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the biggest contributor to the United
Nations, but also its biggest debtor, accounting for more than 60
percent of the total owed by member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the General Assembly vote for nonpayment would not affect
the United States' seat and vote in the Security Council, or its
veto power as one of the council's five permanent members. But the
loss of the assembly vote would be a setback to the nation's
prestige and influence in the organization, which has been
declining as the arrears piled up.
</P>
<P>
   The debt was on the minds of a group of lawmakers who visited
U.N. headquarters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is tragic that we will have not paid our dues up to
this point,'' Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said. ``I'm very
embarrassed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Boxer told a cluster of reporters, many of whom
represent foreign news organizations, that the administration had
done the best it could in working out a compromise. But she added,
``We have some very radical members controlling Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national security in paying our dues is of utmost
importance,'' Senator Boxer said. ``The fact that our national
security is being held hostage by these radical elements in
Congress is shocking to me, and I think it is shocking to the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said the effect of the new
legislation could not be seen until it was in draft language. ``My
understanding from conversations with folks in Washington is that
we will be able to fulfill our obligations,'' Gejdenson said. ``It
would be truly outrageous that after all this time we still don't
pay our bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior administration official said that some of the reforms
contained in the Helms-Biden legislation, like reducing the United
States' share of the United Nations' cost, might become possible
once Washington offered the money. ``If we have a check in hand,
the climate for reforms will be greatly improved,'' the senior
official said.

 By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The investigators came late last January, on a
Thursday. They were deliberately cryptic. All they would tell St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center was that they were looking into a
possible violation of the federal ``anti-dumping'' law, which
prohibits hospitals from refusing to at least examine and stabilize
patients who cannot pay.
</P>
<P>
   It was serious business. Only a handful of cases were
investigated each year. Not until the investigators left did the
hospital learn what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   The previous July, a French woman in her 40s had come to the
emergency room with abdominal pain. Pelvic cancer was suspected,
and she was admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology floor, where
the diagnosis was confirmed. A private doctor, along with the house
staff, attended to her. The doctor concluded that she needed
surgery within several weeks, followed by chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had no insurance. The senior physician discharged her,
and left a note on the woman's chart saying she had instructed her
to obtain health insurance or go to a public hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators determined that when the woman left the hospital,
she had barely been able to walk. That same day, she went to
Bellevue Hospital Center, a city facility, where surgeons operated
immediately. Officials there felt the woman had been treated
unlawfully by St. Luke's-Roosevelt, and they complained to the
state Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigators spent five days at St. Luke's and
issued a harsh report criticizing the care of the French woman but
also identifying much else they didn't like _ tardy treatment of
patients in the emergency room, poor record-keeping, uninsured
patients being told they would have to pay at least $400 and then
leaving the ER without being examined.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital was ordered to put new policies into effect or be
cut off Medicare, an action that, in effect, would close it down.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital administrators felt that their decision on the
uninsured woman had been a judgment call _ that she was not in
imminent danger and had time to make arrangements to enter another
hospital _ although they acknowledged that doctors should have
helped her transfer. And the documentation was sloppy. The hospital
believed the woman had been given more care than her chart
indicated.
</P>
<P>
   In March, new procedures took effect in the ER. Dr. Edward
Lathan heard about them at the weekly department meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors didn't dive right into the issue: First there
was a presentation about assessing a patient's airway to determine
the difficulty of inserting a breathing tube. Slides were shown of
potential patients. Hillary Clinton's face flicked on the screen.
``Easy for the anatomy, difficult because of the hype,'' one intern
volunteered. Prince Charles (``May have receding mandible and
therefore difficult''). Linus (``His head is too big for his
body'').
</P>
<P>
   Then an administrator related the case of the French woman. He
told the residents that under no circumstances was anyone to be
turned away again for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   A third-year resident spoke up: ``This is similar to what we do
every day in the ER. Someone comes in and needs a root canal and
has no insurance. I say, `You can go to our dental clinic, but
you'll get a bill _ I suggest you go to a city hospital,' and I
give them some names.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're not going to say that anymore,'' he was told. ``I
have been informed that our clinics will see any and all referrals
from the ER.'' (Actually, this might have been more than the
regulators were insisting on, but the hospital wanted to do too
much rather than too little.)
</P>
<P>
   As Lathan began his shift that day, changes were already
manifest. At the check-in counter, there had been phones and a list
of managed-care companies' phone numbers so patients could call for
authorization. The insurers wanted these phones, and of course the
hospital did, too, for they made reimbursement easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department, however, saw them as an impediment to
care. The lists were stripped away. The phones were dismantled. No
longer was there to be any discussion of money before a patient was
examined. At a time when everything about medicine seemed to come
down to money, the word was not to be uttered by the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators also were unhappy that, life-threatening
emergencies aside, the hospital had no guidelines for how quickly
patients were to be examined. They singled out a number of
troubling cases, including that of a patient who had what he
described as ``the worst headache of my life'' and waited eight
hours to be treated for what turned out to be a brain hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, new time dimensions were adopted. In ``urgent''
cases, less dire than emergencies, patients were to be seen within
an hour; ``nonurgent'' patients had to be seen within four hours.
Emergency or urgent patients who became fed up waiting and left
would be ``called and requested to return.'' If they had no phone,
the hospital was to send a telegram.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its remedial plan, the hospital created a video
explaining the anti-dumping law and promised to show it to the
entire staff.
</P>
<P>
   The interns saw it during regular conferences. But no mention
was made of the case of the French woman or the state
investigation. Dr. Jennifer James and Dr. Bryan Holland, in the
medicine and pediatrics departments, gave the video no particular
attention. To them it seemed like just one more standard bit of
preaching.

   Food, Glorious Food
</P>
<P>
   The Gin Mill bar on 83rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue was a hive
of activity, especially in the rackety back area where the interns
congregated. It was Residents' Happy Hour, courtesy of Pfizer.
Almost every Wednesday one of the drug houses sponsored a Happy
Hour, when the interns could drink and attack a buffet table.
</P>
<P>
   A young, primly dressed Pfizer representative stamped Dr. James'
hand, to show she was entitled to free drinks, and gave her a
brochure on Norvasc, a hypertension drug. Dr. James deposited it in
her pocket. She was here to socialize.
</P>
<P>
   She scooted to the bar and mingled with the other interns. There
was plenty of gossip to absorb _ could you believe that resident
who was hitting on two interns? There were pictures to study _ one
intern had just married in Japan and had brought his album.
</P>
<P>
   They lined up for food.
</P>
<P>
   Interns were obsessed with food. Since they never had time to
eat, they thought about it constantly. One of two things generally
happened during internship: You gained weight because all you ate
was junk food, or you lost weight because you skipped so many
meals.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was a well-known fact that the best way to fill a room
with residents was to bait the room with food. Planning a lecture
on bladder catheterization? Order pizza and make sure there are
plenty of seats.
</P>
<P>
   One particular species willing to provide consumables was the
pharmaceutical salesman. Eager to impress on the doctors the
illimitable virtues of their drugs, they appeared almost daily at
lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   In the late morning, when hunger was gnawing at the interns, the
magic words would reverberate over the public address system:
``Lunch for the house staff will be served in conference room B at
noon.'' The meaning was clear. A drug rep was here. Free food!
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the interns dictated the menu. On Fridays, for
instance, they usually insisted on Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The interns felt they were crossing no ethical lines. They had
essentially no say in which drugs were put on the hospital's
approved list. ``I come to see the other interns and to eat,'' Dr.
James said.
</P>
<P>
   The drug reps were not the only visitors. One day, John Hancock
came peddling insurance and mutual funds to an audience commonly
boasting negative net worths. Still, the room was full. The company
had brought Indian food.
</P>
<P>
   `A Little Gastric Upset'
</P>
<P>
   At the monthly meeting for the medicine residents, there were
the same nagging issues. The residents were admonished about the
need to discharge patients in a timely manner. The all-important
length of stay (LOS) averages had been creeping up, particularly
among Medicare patients. In 1992, the hospital's LOS was 14 days,
and it was now a little over six, but that was still above the
national average. Keep someone too long and the hospital ate the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in an unsubtle way of shaming the laggards, St. Luke's
had resumed sending LOS report cards to the attendings, as the
senior staff doctors are known. The residents received their own
promptings: ``Anyone who discharges someone today gets a second
free sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to make the residents care too deeply about
medicine's new economics, about managed care's protocols. Their
income remained at the same low level no matter how many patients
they treated or how fast they treated them.
</P>
<P>
   They were still full of medical-school idealism. To a certain
extent, they felt shielded from reality, being taught by doctors
who were unsure how to teach for the new medical world.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Lesch, the chairman of the department of medicine,
struggled in his own mind about how much to adapt. He labored at
getting his department's LOS in line. (As he put it, ``This is no
longer a hotel.'') But when he got deep into a discussion of
managed care, he would get riled and say: ``I teach them medicine.
Managed care is not medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   There was actually something of a generation gap among the
attending physicians. Some younger ones did not quite share the
older doctors' virulent feelings about the new age. Even so, the
interns heard almost nothing but grumbling from attendings, even
young ones, about the changed ways, and often Dr. James said to
herself, ``Enough already.''
</P>
<P>
   One day an attending cornered her in the hallway and began
moaning about how he was making so much less money and how horrible
his life had become. ``What am I supposed to do,'' Dr. James
thought, ``not become a doctor?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, from their own rush of experiences, the interns had begun
to adopt their own biases about managed care. In tallying the risk
factors of a new patient, Dr. James and her friends joked that if
the person was covered by a certain managed-care company, they
would consider that a risk factor like smoking or obesity.
</P>
<P>
   All manner of mixed signals filtered down to the impressionable
interns. One morning, after an intern informed her attending doctor
that her patient was ready to leave, the attending said he wanted
her to stay another day. He wanted to take a picture of the woman's
exotic, looping toenails but had forgotten his camera.
</P>
<P>
   The intern was astonished that someone was being kept in the
hospital for a snapshot of her toenails. To Dr. James, this one set
of toenails seemed to reflect the growing disharmony of the times.
On one rotation, Dr. James reported to a third-year resident, who
repeatedly told her: ``This is a teaching hospital. If you're just
curious, order the test.''
</P>
<P>
   With staffing tight, the attending doctors were stretched as
thin as the residents, and it was an issue trying to get them to
teach enough hours. Private attendings rarely taught anymore, as
they once voluntarily did. And many staff attendings would spend an
hour on rounds and then be swallowed up by an increasing weight of
responsibilities _ private patients, paperwork, research.
</P>
<P>
   They would write a progress note only when a patient was
admitted. Lesch asked them to write daily notes, as the interns
did; the hospital could bill for them. Eyes lifted. Medicaid would
pay $7 a note. Eyes lowered. Lesch wondered how some attendings
even knew the patients. How could they teach the interns how to
interact with patients when the attendings themselves didn't
interact with them?
</P>
<P>
   He recognized that what the interns saw and heard was often
contradictory. But he did not have the answers. ``They have to find
their own values,'' he said. ``They have to find how far they will
go before they compromise. I hope I at least give them a little
gastric upset.''

 NEW YORK: gastric upset.''

<P>
   Internship: The Bottom Line
</P>
<P>
   One of his clinic patients paid in cash _ $67.50. Seeing actual
money change hands, Holland felt good. ``I'm bringing in money for
the hospital,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Given their low pay and handyman job description, the interns
assumed they were big moneymakers for St. Luke's. And compared with
attending doctors, they were so much of a bargain that more of them
were graduating than society could absorb.
</P>
<P>
   Nodding to concerns about a glut of doctors, New York was in the
midst of a federal experiment in which the government was paying
the state's teaching hospitals to reduce their number of residents
by a fourth. Yet more than half of the enlisted hospitals had
withdrawn, unable to make the economics work.
</P>
<P>
   After scaling back the number of its interns, St. Luke's was
going to raise the number next year. Even so, the hospital was
having an increasingly hard time breaking even on its residents.
</P>
<P>
   The algorithm computed by the financial staff went like this: It
cost about $184,165 a year to train an intern. There was the modest
salary of $39,270, the proportionate expense of an attending
doctor, malpractice premiums and various other expenses like the
high technology and the inevitable excess of tests and longer
patient stays.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 percent of the cost was covered by Medicaid and
Medicare, and the rest by private insurers, through a special state
tax. In this stubborn new environment, though, they were reducing
the level of payment.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, St. Luke's calculated that it actually lost about
$1,500 per intern. It tried to economize. The rule of thumb used to
be that residents ordered every test known to man times two. While
attendings no longer allowed so many tests, studies suggested that
residents still ordered about 20 percent more than doctors at
nonteaching hospitals did.
</P>
<P>
   With further funding cuts looming, there was not much more the
interns could be asked to do other than swab the floors.
</P>
<P>
   `Another Medical Triumph'
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, Dr. James joined the others for Intern Report, in
which an intern presented one of her cases. Dr. Gregory Steinberg,
associate director of medicine, moderated.
</P>
<P>
   The intern recited the bare facts: a 39-year-old man whose chief
complaint was that he felt sick for five days and was getting
worse. He had no significant medical history. He had a throbbing
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. He
smoked crack and marijuana and occasionally slept on the street,
where he was exposed to pigeons and rats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do pigeons do for you?'' Steinberg said. ``What do rats
do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plague,'' someone suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not too much plague in New York,'' Steinberg pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of people were exposed to rat urine?
</P>
<P>
   One intern said, ``Swimmers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Swimmers?'' Steinberg said. ``Where do you do your swimming?''
</P>
<P>
   The correct answer was sanitation workers and those who work in
sewers.
</P>
<P>
   The man was administered antibiotics, though his diagnosis
remained unclear. Tests were done. Day by day, he began feeling
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we treating?'' Steinberg asked. ``At God knows what
cost per day? We're treating us. We're feeling better because he's
feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers were howling to get patients discharged swiftly, but
the house staff wanted to learn. When oddities arose _ curious
tangents not always clinically relevant _ the interns investigated
at their leisure, sometimes forgetting about the patient, never
thinking about dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   By day 12, this patient was feeling so much better that he was
discharged. The assumption was that he had leptospirosis, an
infection that rats can transmit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we did nothing for him but gave him antibiotics, and he
probably would have gotten better without them,'' Steinberg said.
``Another medical triumph. We did nothing. The patient got
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Children, Checks and Balances
</P>
<P>
   He had been drinking. The police found him passed out on the
subway and brought him in. His blood-alcohol level was twice the
legal limit for an adult. He was 12.
</P>
<P>
   Holland visited him in his room and tried to discover the
precipitating events. It was a fragile moment. ``Kids start with
one thing and then move on to drugs and who knows what,'' he said.
``You want to stop it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy insisted that he was just experimenting. He was getting
good grades in school. Holland learned from the parents that they
were having marital problems. That might be part of it. The boy
squirmed and smiled weakly as Holland spoke indignantly of the
evils of alcohol. Truth was, social work was part of being a
doctor, too.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the room, Holland was quiet. ``I think he'll be OK,'' he
said. ``He's clearly smart and well-mannered. He said he was never
doing this again. I think he'll be too scared to.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a shift in the clinic, Holland and the other
doctors clattered into a small back office for a soda. With the
inevitability of gravity, the conversation turned to the problems
of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The attending on duty, a young woman from India, mentioned how
she recently did a blood screening for a child and the insurer
wouldn't pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ```Not indicated,' they said,'' she complained. ``And it was
absolutely needed. It's really bad out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland gave a wry smile: ``Down with the insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The attending went on: ``It's good that something came along,
because we needed checks and balances. There was a lot of waste in
the system. But they've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Her own son had been hospitalized for pneumonia while visiting
India and her insurer had refused to cover it. ``I fought for a
year and two months to be paid,'' she said. ``I nagged them every
week. Then I threatened to report them to the attorney general. I
got a check in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning,'' Holland said. ``Threaten, threaten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what they get away with,'' the attending said.
``Most people don't have the knowledge to fight. I'm in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an exaggerated silence. After a while, the attending
said: ``The administration calls here all the time and they want
numbers. They want patients every 20 minutes. They're constantly
looking for numbers. Some socially deprived children need 45
minutes or an hour. I'm supposed to teach the interns, and I'm
supposed to turn out numbers. They're contradictory issues.
Something has to give.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``They're always pulling the interns out of the
clinic to cover something on the floor. When these interns go out
into practice, they almost feel like admitting everybody, because
all they know is in-patient care. They haven't developed clinical
judgment. Someone has pneumonia. Admit him. But wait, this kid
doesn't have respiratory distress. I'll send him home and follow up
tomorrow. Clinical judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said: ``I've noticed different types of attendings. Some
have no clinical judgment. They order every test because they're
insecure. Others know right away what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to develop a feel for who you listen to and who you
don't,'' the attending said. ``When you're finished here, you'll
know what each attending doesn't know. Not what they know, but what
they don't know.''

   Conundrums of Intensive Care
</P>
<P>
   The big-bellied man would never wake up. His was a life now
unsalvageably distant. His diseased heart had sent him into cardiac
arrest. He had lost his pulse entirely. By the time doctors had
resuscitated him, he appeared to be brain dead.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the doctors could shut off the ventilator and that would
be that, just another of those quotidian horrors of internship.
Tests detected no brain waves. He was removed from the ventilator.
Under the hospital's protocol, he had to fail for two and a half
minutes to take a breath. A few seconds shy of the deadline, he
gave a single gasp.
</P>
<P>
   That gasp was enough that now only his son, who lived in Puerto
Rico, could end what pretense of life the machinery continued to
give his father.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. James called him, she explained that, barring
unexpected divine intervention, there was no chance his father
would recover. She explained that the motionless man lying in
intensive care was little more than flesh attached to machines. The
son said: ``What does it hurt? Let's keep him alive.'' At a cost of
$3,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   She shivered in anger: ``I thought the son was being selfish and
stupid. It sounded like he didn't want to think that he was turning
off the ventilator and killing his father. But what about how it
was inhuman to keep his father alive? How we would have to keep
doing tests on him. Maybe add a feeding tube. Maybe end up cracking
his ribs if he coded _ for someone who was no longer a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, the father did ``code'' _ his heart stopped _
and this time the doctors could not revive him.
</P>
<P>
   The intensive-care unit was the grimmest destination in the
hospital. Here Dr. James often saw the final gasps of someone's
life, and it was never pretty. It was here that she experienced the
frustration of having to do too much, to treat patients in the
throes of incurable, lingering disease, whose lungs were run by
respirators, whose stomachs were fed by tubes, who were more like
lab experiments than human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James kept hearing that time and money were precious, and
yet so much of both was expended on patients locked in an
unstoppable dance with death. ``Why do another X-ray, another blood
culture?'' she said. ``It's not making them better. If anything,
it's making them worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Often the only sounds in the unit were the hum and buzz of
machines and the occasional television _ talk shows, soaps. And so
many sad stories.
</P>
<P>
   She looked in on a patient on a ventilator who was unable to
speak. The patient was 89, with respiratory pneumonia. Dr. James
had taken care of her for two weeks, without exchanging a word.
``It's weird,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care doctor had stopped by and urged that her course
of antibiotics be finished so she could return to her nursing home.
``But the nursing home doesn't take `vents,''' Dr. James said. ``I
don't know if I can wean her off it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And for what life? The woman had dementia. She had not spoken in
a long time. She had no family, only a legal guardian. Guardians
are usually reluctant to halt care, because of fear of
repercussions. The attending looked in: ``I have the feeling that
if that woman were awake, she would say, `Please stop _ don't do
this to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   A pulmonary fellow in the unit said: ``Doctors are uncomfortable
talking to people about health-care proxies when they're well, and
we pay the price. When I have a practice, I'll have it right on the
chart as the first thing to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   She was silent a moment. Then she added: ``But it's not easy.
Like, I don't have one. It's hard to know, who do I entrust my life
to?''
</P>
<P>
   So many of these patients posed ethical conundrums for the
interns. Do this. Don't do this. Sometimes Dr. James felt bitter.
Why should she have to work so hard in here, often for no gain?
There were consequences for the soul. The family of one comatose
woman had decorated her room with pictures of her dog and cat, and
that made Dr. James think of her as truly alive. But she would
never open an eye again.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they would joke about someone: ``Oh, the guy's shot.
Let's just let him die.'' It muted the sorrow, but it also
expressed what they felt.
</P>
<P>
   So many cases were hopeless that the interns were taken aback
when they encountered an ICU patient back on the wards, nearly well
again. Dr. James had a man with sickle-cell anemia who reached the
brink of death only to reject it. Soon he was released. She thought
of him as Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   Over the loudspeaker now came word of a drug-company lunch, and
the interns' spirits abruptly lifted. Escape from this sorrowful
shift. By the time Dr. James wrapped up her paperwork and got
there, however, the turnout was so huge that all the plates had
been claimed. Disappointed, she backtracked to the cafeteria with a
fellow intern and had to pay for ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   In an uninflected tone, her friend told her about a dreadful
case. The interns were urged always to ask about DNR (do not
resuscitate) orders, but it was complicated. The friend said she
had just lost a patient, a 53-year-old woman with emphysema. She
was intubated and then, as she improved, extubated. She got worse
again and refused another intubation. She had signed a DNR order.
Helpless to do anything for a woman she felt could recover
completely, the intern watched her die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I just got the funniest news from Ohio,'' Dr. James said.
``Someone I know who's doing her internship in Dayton just had her
first death _ this after eight months of internship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding,'' her friend said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I had one the first month,'' Dr. James said. ``I'm
sure glad I'm not doing my residency in Ohio. What would I learn?''

<P>
   Postmortem Blues
</P>
<P>
   There was a pep talk on autopsies. For years, it had been
getting harder to obtain permission for them, and the number of
autopsies had dwindled steadily. Enhanced technology had greatly
improved doctors' ability to diagnose illness and families felt
there was nothing more to discover.
</P>
<P>
   Patients' relatives were more reluctant to expose them _
particularly those who were very old _ to what they saw as an
indignity, when no known medical procedure could do them any good.
Religious factors were involved, too.
</P>
<P>
   Still, autopsies did turn up surprises and were important
teaching aides. Federal rules decreed that teaching hospitals
should perform autopsies for at least 15 percent of deaths, but
since few hospitals could meet the threshold, it was rarely
enforced. St. Luke's had an 11 percent average.
</P>
<P>
   Interns were understandably squeamish even at broaching the
issue with patients' families. So the medicine department had
devised a macabre contest of sorts, with a prize to the intern who
rounded up the most autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, interns had received medical textbooks or Barnes
&AMP; Noble gift certificates for each autopsy they achieved. These
were apparently inadequate stimuli, so this year the incentive was
sweetened, to a grand prize of $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the interns found this particularly ghoulish. Some
actually felt no longer inclined to pursue autopsies. In any event,
there was a catch. The prize was awarded only if the department
recorded at least 100 autopsies for the year, and it was woefully
shy of that target.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James had zero autopsies. Personally, she felt them
inappropriate, unless there was some mystery about the death. She
almost had one. But the hospital was unable to get it done before
the family insisted on burial. Overnight, she went from plus 1 back
to 0.
</P>
<P>
   Salving Loneliness, Saving a Life
</P>
<P>
   Lathan felt gloomy. ``When you're counting the hours and waiting
for the shift to end, you know it's not good,'' he said over lunch.
His best friend, an intern at another hospital, told him that one
of the surgery interns there had hanged himself in his room. There
were money issues. Love issues. Protracted depression.
</P>
<P>
   Lathan was not so much depressed as aggravated by his ascetic
life. He didn't even date; he had no time for a relationship.
``You're spending like 80 percent of your life in this place,
working six days straight,'' he said. ``It's like being in a prison
camp. I find myself less tolerant. Now it's a case of if it's not
about my education, I don't want to do it, and I resent it. I don't
want to be used as a slave just because of lack of manpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement and thrill is not there. It's a shame, too,
because medicine really is a joy. It's a shame that they have a
system that actually makes you hate medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Into the ER the patients still came. The man said he felt a
weakness in his side. He said he could not walk steadily: ``I walk
like a zombie. I walk like a robot.'' He had to go to the bathroom.
Lathan watched him walk. He walked like a person. What he was was
depressed. Lathan discharged him and suggested a therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wasting my time,'' Lathan said. ``I don't like people
who waste my time.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw an 85-year-old woman complaining of diarrhea, vomiting,
chills. Her home-care aide told Lathan: ``I think her biggest
problem is loneliness. She says when she's home she feels sad. When
she got here, she said she felt alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He nodded. He understood.
</P>
<P>
   Lathan was summoned to another room. A woman, 41, desolate for
reasons best known to her, had swallowed 28 tablets of Doxepin, a
depressant, saying she wanted to die. ``She just wanted to kill
herself in front of the triage nurse,'' a nurse said.
</P>
<P>
   Lathan and several residents channeled their energy into
reversing her actions. He put in a breathing tube. She was
connected to an EKG machine. ``Hello, hello,'' Lathan said.
</P>
<P>
   They began pumping her stomach. While Lathan worked on her, the
chief resident dispassionately lectured him on how much fluid to
add, why this, why that. The woman was a life hanging by a thread,
but also a vehicle for teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of her stomach were placed in a pink plastic bin.
``It's how you take gasoline out of a tank, water out of a swimming
pool,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   The floor was a mess of discarded packaging from the cavalcade
of medical supplies. Soon the woman was ready for a chest X-ray,
and then she would go to intensive care. The chief resident said,
``All right, we're cool.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing more to say. Lathan had a pilot with abdominal
pain who was supposed to be flying to Spain. The shift had hours to
go. Something special had happened. A woman would live who had
tried not to.
</P>
<P>
   Managed Care 101
</P>
<P>
   Late in the internship year, in a rare attempt at formally
addressing the mechanics of managed care with the house staff, the
hospital arranged for a pair of seminars. They were described in
leaflets sent to all the residents as ``important seminars that can
assist you in practicing medicine in this ever-expanding era of
managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   The sessions were staged in a large conference room at Roosevelt
and beamed by closed-circuit television to St. Luke's. They
attached an accept-it-it's-not-going-away sensibility to the topic.
Reprints of studies and charts were stacked on a table for
attendees to take with them.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much need. Only a handful of people showed up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Lashawanda McCullom, a 30-year-old nurse,
put her credit union's cash card into a Bank of America automated
teller machine here, punched in her secret code and requested a
withdrawal. The machine spit out her card and flashed a message:
``Due to a recent vote by the Santa Monica City Council, the
convenience of this ATM is now available to Bank of America
cardholders only.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCullom, who expressed mild frustration at being denied her
cash, was caught in the cross-fire of a skirmish over ATM
surcharges that now seems to be breaking into a full-fledged war.
Suddenly, the fact that it costs an extra $1.50 or so to get money
out of a cash machine seems to have tapped into some deep well of
public resentment _ or at least politicians believe it has.
</P>
<P>
   This oceanside suburb of Los Angeles last month passed the
nation's first local ordinance banning banks from charging
noncustomers for using their ATMs, and Bank of America retaliated
by denying noncustomers use of its machines. San Francisco voters
approved a similar measure earlier this month, and now, legislators
in other cities and states are said to be looking at similar
ordinances. The New York City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, said
Monday that he planned to propose such a law, and the Los Angeles
City Council has instructed the city attorney to study the city's
authority to enact a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense has also proposed a ban on such
surcharges on all military bases. Connecticut and Iowa already ban
such surcharges under pre-existing laws, and three other states _
Wyoming, Arkansas and Mississippi _ have price caps on the
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers just find the surcharge sort of the fee that broke
the consumer's back, so to speak,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the
attorney general of Connecticut, which is now battling the banking
industry in court. ``Consumers see no reason for it. They regard it
almost as a personal insult. It has evoked an emotion that is quite
astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The banking industry, saying it has the right to charge for a
service, is fighting to squelch the uprising before it gathers more
steam. California's leading banks argued Monday in U.S. District
Court for an injunction preventing the Santa Monica and San
Francisco ordinances from being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   And on the day Santa Monica's ordinance took effect _ last
Thursday _ Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank, the state's two
largest banks by far, began prohibiting noncustomers from using
ATMs, which is why Ms. McCullom could not get her money on Friday.
The banks say they will do the same in San Francisco when that
ordinance takes effect, probably next month.
</P>
<P>
   How widespread the bans will become remains to be seen. Santa
Monica and San Francisco are both unusually liberal cities.
Consumer groups have failed to get any state legislature to enact
such a ban, and Alfonse D'Amato, when he was a U.S. senator from
New York, never got very far with his attempt to legislate a
nationwide prohibition. Rep. Bernard Sanders, an independent from
Vermont, this month re-introduced legislation banning surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it is unreasonable to charge consumers for access to
their own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are basically holding our money hostage,'' said Jon
Golinger of the California Public Interest Group. The U.S. Public
Interest Research Group found that 93 percent of banks surveyed
impose such a surcharge, up from 71 percent in 1998 and 15 percent
in 1996. Nationally, such surcharges appear to generate about $2
billion to $3 billion a year or more for operators of the ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that in many cases consumers are being charged
twice for each withdrawal. If a Wells Fargo customer, for instance,
takes money out of a Bank of America machine, Wells Fargo charges
that customer $2 for using a ``foreign'' ATM, about 50 cents of
which goes to reimburse Bank of America. But Bank of America itself
charges $1.50 for use of its machine by a noncustomer, bringing the
total fee for retrieving as little as $20 of one's own money to
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica and San Francisco ordinances, as well as the
regulation in Connecticut, bar only the $1.50 surcharge levied by
the ATM owner, not the fees imposed by a bank on its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the frustration over the surcharges stems from what is a
general proliferation in banking fees in an era of deregulation,
and the fact that ATM use was once free. ``People see the way banks
are trying to charge for everything under the sun,'' said Walter
McCaffrey, a New York City councilman from Queens who is helping
draft the proposed legislation there. ``The original position was
that ATMs were not a profit center.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks say it is their right to charge for services. If consumers
don't want to pay they can use their own bank's ATMs. Without
surcharges, they said, there would be fewer ATMs and less
convenience for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to find too many people who are willing to
give the service for free,'' said Terry Zink, senior vice president
in charge of ATMs for Wells Fargo. ``The biggest issue is whether
or not consumers have the right to pay for services they want.''
</P>
<P>
   What is perhaps most unusual about this battle is that only a
few years ago, the forces were on the opposite sides. The banks
themselves, through two major networks that link ATM machines,
prohibited the surcharges. And legislators in 15 states enacted
laws overriding the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Banks initially shunned fees to encourage people to use the
machines. They viewed ATMs not as money makers but as cost-savers,
a way to cut down on the number of tellers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But then some banks as well as some nonfinancial companies began
realizing that charging customers would make it economical to put
ATMs in remote locations and away from banks themselves. Moreover,
the prohibition on surcharges raised antitrust issues because it
made it difficult for nonbanks to be in the ATM business because
there would be no way to recover their costs. This led to the state
laws allowing the fees and to the decision in 1996 by two major
national ATM networks _ Visa's Plus and Mastercard International's
Cirrus _ to lift the prohibition on surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the number of ATMs has nearly doubled to 227,000 from
123,000 in 1997, according to the American Bankers Association.
Most of the new machines are not at banks and thrifts but at
supermarkets, malls, airports, amusement parks and other so-called
off-premise locations. Indeed, slightly more than half of all ATMs
are now off premise, according to Bank Network News, a
Chicago-based newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, about half of all new ATMs _ including most of the
off-premise ones _ are owned by companies other than banks, thrifts
or credit unions, according to Speer &AMP; Associates, an Atlanta
consulting firm. These companies include Electronic Data Systems,
the big computer services company, the Publix Supermarkets chain
and many smaller companies that have gone into business just to
provide ATMs. Many retailers own their own ATMs, but some merely
collect some fee from the ATMs that are stationed in their stores
but are owned by others.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco and Santa Monica laws allow these nonfinancial
institutions to levy the surcharges, under the theory that they do
not gain savings from having fewer tellers. The Connecticut rule,
however, bars surcharges on all machines. The New York ordinance
has not been drafted yet but could be similar to the California
ones.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer groups say that bank fees are well in excess of
what it costs for an ATM transaction, some bankers say they are
losing money on ATMs even with the surcharges. And they say
prohibiting surcharges will force closure of many ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the surcharge, there's no way a lot of off-premise
ATMs can be profitable,'' said Robert Litan, director of economic
studies at the Brookings Institution, who studied the matter for
the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence on this question is mixed. Connecticut has only about
two-thirds of the number of ATMs per million people as the nation
as a whole, according to Bank Network News. But Iowa has almost as
many machines per capita as the nation as a whole and more than
some states that allow the surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   In their court case in San Francisco, Bank of America, Wells
Fargo and the California Bankers Association argue that local
ordinances are pre-empted by federal banking regulation. The Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency, a federal regulator, has
intervened in the case on the side of the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have won decisions on these grounds in Iowa and
Connecticut, but the ban on surcharges in those states remains
while the decisions are being appealed. But a 1990 decision by the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers California and
other Western states, found that a federal law does allow some room
for states to regulate ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the surcharges say they favor the big banks under the
theory that consumers, to avoid the fees, will put their accounts
in banks that have the most machines. ``When a business can gain
customers by raising prices, that's not what competition is all
about,'' said Adam Radinsky, deputy city attorney for Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller banks and credit unions have pushed for free ATM
use or have banded together to offer free use to one another's
customers, to better compete with bigger banks. Still, many smaller
banks impose the surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Santa Monica, some people think the whole controversy is
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Santa Monica is overstepping its rights trying to
impose business practices on the banks, and I think the banks are
being vindictive and hasty in trying to make a statement back to
the city of Santa Monica,'' said Katrina Osio, a 33-year-old
marketing director of an Internet company. ``I just think it's
childish.''

CLINTON PRESSES TURKISH LEADERS ON HUMAN RIGHTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey _ President Clinton, savoring a series of foreign
policy victories Monday, pressed Turkish leaders on human rights
and reconciliation with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The president began a five-day visit to this important
crossroads as diplomatic breakthroughs occurred on China trade
talks, Northern Ireland peace, payment of United Nations arrears
and new efforts to resolve the status of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   The White House moved quickly to claim the achievements for
Clinton, who hopes to craft a significant foreign policy legacy
during the final year of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've had a very good day in foreign policy,'' said
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements come just a month after Clinton suffered his
biggest foreign policy defeat, the rejection by Senate Republicans
of the nuclear weapons test ban treaty. The embarrassing defeat
raised questions about Clinton's ability to conduct foreign policy
as a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide said one of the developments would have been a
victory but to have all four occur within 24 hours ``is
overwhelming.'' He suggested Clinton's critics should ``give him a
nod'' for those victories, contending those achievements dispute
the notion that the president is a powerless lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had announced new talks Dec. 3 between Turkish and Greek
Cypriots over the status of the Mediterranean island, long a source
of tensions been the two nations. After some confusions, those
talks will take place in New York under the auspices of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's foreign policy skills are being tested anew on
this trip to Turkey, part of a 10-day tour of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This republic, founded from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire
after World War I, lies at a geographic, religious and cultural
crossroads between Europe and Asia. The troubled nations of the
Balkans and the Middle East all sprang from the collapse of the
600-year-old Islamic empire, and the ancient conflicts are still
alive today.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Grand National Assembly, Clinton gently urged
the 550-member legislative chamber to do more on human rights,
citing the United States' own historic struggle with slavery and
race as part of a ``long journey'' worth making for a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When peaceful outlets exist to express normal human
differences, the peace is preserved, not shattered,'' Clinton said,
quoting Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.
``Sovereignty should not be built on fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups criticize Turkey's record on torture and
beatings of dissidents and minorities such as the Kurds. President
Suleyman Demirel conceded torture exists but said it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is torture,'' Demirel said during a news conference with
Clinton. ``But torture is not a state policy. Torture is a crime. I
can say that we are doing everything we can to make sure that there
is not torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged the assembly to reduce tensions in the Aegean
by reconciling with rival Greece. ``Believe me, I appreciate how
much history lies behind this troubled relationship. But people are
beginning to see the possibilities that can be created by a new and
better history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Clinton repeatedly took note of the
assistance Greece provided Turkey after a devastating Aug. 17
earthquake killed 17,000 people, and urged it to be used as an
opportunity to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey, a longtime Cold War ally of the United States because of
its proximity to the Soviet Union, awarded Clinton with its highest
state honor. Clinton also was the first foreigner to speak before
its National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an irony of history that we are on the edge of a new
millennium which will be shaped by unbelievable advances in
technology. But the biggest problem the world has is that
everywhere people are too much in the grip of the oldest difficulty
of human societies: We still are prone to fear people who are
different than ourselves,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will tour earthquake-damaged areas Tuesday and go
sightseeing Wednesday. On Thursday, a session opens in Istanbul for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Clinton
also will visit Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Kosovo.

   NEW YORK _ No more Steffi. No Monica this week, either. Just
when women's tennis was getting great, absent from its year-end
championships are the only players who have ever been great.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about sustained greatness, not the kind instantly
attached in our over-infomercialized, dot com world. Lindsay
Davenport and Martina Hingis and the Williams sisters are all
superb players, worthy successors. But without Steffi Graf and
Monica Seles on the Madison Square Garden carpet, the women's game
will not be nearly the showcase the promoters and the critics have
cranked it up to be.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so much the Graf-Seles rivalry, irreversibly altered by
a madman's knife, that the sport suddenly lacks. It's the contrast
of generations, the chronological tension. Graf took most of it
with her when she retired last summer. Seles, out of this
tournament with a stress fracture in her foot, just seems to be
doing a gradual fade, as opposed to taking a dramatic walk.
</P>
<P>
   When they played a riveting three-set match won by Graf here
last November, I remember thinking that she would never allow
herself to do as Seles has. Graf would never languish as a
professional quarterfinalist, unwilling to step out or do what it
takes to move up. After teaching Hingis to respect her elders
during their I-Want-Mommy French Open final, after falling a
victory short of the perfect ending at Wimbledon, Graf intuitively
knew she had done all she could with her eroding, 30-year-old body.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have no idea how much she was hurting the last couple
of years, how many trips to the hospital she made,'' said Jim Fuhse
of the Women's Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   Graf at least got all she could out of her game. In a sport
plagued by victimization, Seles has been the ultimate casualty. I
have rooted for her harder than I do for any other professional
athlete, yet by last September, by the time 17-year-old Serena
Williams was finished thrashing Hingis in the Arthur Ashe Stadium,
it was apparent that, in tennis years, the 25-year-old Seles was as
30-ish as Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Graf rounded 30 and headed home, without so much as a wave to
her beloved Wimbledon Center Court, without taking a farewell
stroke in New York City. Not one given to sentimental displays, she
was talked into a retirement ceremony at Bill Bradley's favorite
arena Tuesday night. All the players, I'm told, will be in on it.
Why not? The Garden may not be Center Court, but it is the center
of the city Graf once used as a safe haven from German fame.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Novotna will be here for the weekend, and I hope they'll
spare a few minutes for her as well. Novotna, who at 31 retired
with her one Wimbledon title, never did live up to her
serve-and-volley potential, but, as Fuhse said, ``Without Jana,
there are no more serve-and-volleyers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, as she survived her good cry on the
shoulder of the Duchess of Kent's shoulder after blowing a
Wimbledon final to Graf, Novotna had her own quiet charisma, a good
story to tell that began behind the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis needs people with personal tales that don't have to be
sanctioned by mom and dad. Teenagers may buy jeans pitched by Anna
Kournikova, who has won far more endorsements (the most of any
women's player) than tournaments (none). Adults still buy tickets
to tennis matches. Most adults probably aren't moved by the
hold-the-presses developments in tennis teen world, such as last
night's scoop that Hingis has dumped the service-challenged
Kournikova as her doubles partner.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it surprising that Graf and Novotna quit, while Seles
seems merely interested in giving herself something to do as she
decides where to go with her life. It's one thing to seize the
opportunity to school Hingis on a sunny June day in Paris. It's
another thing to engage a pack of mouthy teenagers week after
monotonous week.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe tennis could somehow do a better job making both its tours
more adult-friendly. That is not easily achieved for those who
begin training for their careers by first grade and, if eminently
successful, earn a fortune before their first date. It's a wonder
how Graf, who started on tour at 13, even mustered the tolerance to
sit through a few recent matches featuring Agassi, her new
post-tennis companion.
</P>
<P>
   She has left the tour in more capable and gifted hands than have
ever carried it before. Who knows where the family Williams can
take women's tennis in the coming years? Venus and Serena are just
kids, though, all fire and forehands. It's going to be a while
before a great mature player again defends the honor of being 30.

TRUMP IN MIAMI WITH MODEL AND PORTFOLIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With a Slovenian supermodel on his arm, and claiming
that he could outspend anyone, including George W. Bush, in a
three-way race for the presidency, Donald Trump visited Miami on
Monday and reached out to the common man.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that because he has made billions of dollars from hard
work and smart investing he is more qualified to be president than
the sons of wealthy men who have never proven anything, Trump
stopped short of saying he planned to seek the Reform Party
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does run, and if he wins that nomination, Trump said
he would have more to offer the American people than Bush or Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Although some commentators labeled Trump's visit here as his
first campaign trip, Trump said it was not a political event but
instead was a show of support for the United States' embargo of
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Trump, accompanied by his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, a
model who said he would make a fine president, sounded and looked
like a candidate as he made speeches and even, despite his
well-known aversion, shook hands around Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva la libertad! Viva Donald Trump!'' chanted veterans of the
failed Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961, during Trump's visit to Little
Havana earlier in the day. Some of them pumped his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not something I'm in love with,'' he said later, ``but I do
it, and I'm satisfied with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a news conference near the airport, he sounded even
more like a candidate, as he compared his skills with those of Bush
and Gore, whom he described as ``annointed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched the misstatements and I've watched the
incompetence,'' he said at a news conference that, in typical Miami
flavor, switched from English to Spanish and back again.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in particular, he said, is merely riding the name and
connections of his father, former President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that makes them a better candidate than me,''
said Trump, a real estate and casino millionaire who is the son of
a successful businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they make billions in a short period of time? I don't think
so,'' he said. ``It's success,'' he said, when asked about his
credentials. ``Some people have a way of getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   When Trump was asked if he could match the money being raised by
Bush, he said he could do better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need campaign contributions,'' Trump said, though he
said it was hard to turn down offers of honest contributions. And
if he does run, he said, ``I would spend whatever is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, with his business connections and massive casino mailing
lists that could translate into Reform Party votes, is threatening
to shove aside Pat Buchanan as the Reform Party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted the Reform Party nomination, I think I'd get it,''
said Trump, who has referred to Buchanan as a ``Hitler lover.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, a best-selling author, was asked if his threatened run
for the presidency was a ploy to sell real estate and books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need this to sell condos,'' he said. He also said he
did not need a political platform to sell books, then proceeded to
name the three books, by title, that he has written.
</P>
<P>
   Trump was also asked about his stand on abortion _ he finds it
personally distasteful but supports a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, there is only one issue that matters to many
people here _ at least politically: Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, Trump made new friends. In his visit on Monday to
the Bay of Pigs Museum in Little Havana, Trump told about 30
veterans of that failed invasion that he supported the U.S. embargo
as a way to squeeze out Fidel Castro's dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied on his visit to the museum by Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican whose district includes Little Havana.
And while she welcomed Trump's strong stand on the embargo, Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen said she was supporting Bush.

 &HT;    Judge says OK to reenactment of Branch Davidian siege
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ In what plaintiffs' attorneys in the Branch
Davidian civil lawsuit are calling a major victory, a federal judge
in Waco has ordered a demonstration designed to show whether
government agents fired into Mount Carmel on the final day of the
51-day siege with David Koresh and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. on Monday approved a
request from Special Counsel John Danforth for neutral experts to
conduct a simulation that would recreate government aerial infrared
surveillance tapes from April 19, 1993, to determine if bursts of
light on FBI videotapes are gunfire from federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Branch Davidian survivors, who challenged the
government to just such a demonstration last month, have alleged in
a wrongful-death lawsuit that government agents fired into the
compound during the inferno that claimed Koresh and 75 of his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   The government long has denied the accusations and would not
agree to participate in the testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be an overstatement in the least to say that the
plaintiffs have won a major victory today,'' said Mike Caddell, who
represents the majority of the Branch Davidian survivors. ``This is
something that we have been pressing for for weeks. We think this
is perhaps the major issue in the case because it touches on so
many other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three-page order, the judge gave attorneys on both sides
of the case 10 days to submit nominations for a neutral expert, who
will be chosen and retained by the court to conduct the experiment.
The judge also gave the parties a week to forward any objections or
suggestions to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is basically a wholesale endorsement of essentially
our proposal, with Danforth's modifications to it,'' Caddell said.
``I think it is a very positive step. If you are interested in
getting at the truth, I don't know why you wouldn't embrace this
order by Judge Smith with open arms. And since the Department of
Justice is so interested in getting at the truth, I am sure they
will welcome his order.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Monday that his
office still is reviewing the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have been invited by the court to respond,'' Marlin
said. ``All I can say is that we are still reviewing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said he is absolutely convinced that government agents
fired into the compound on the final day because of studies by
plaintiffs' experts, some who are former government employees, who
reviewed the FBI's tapes from its Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that his office has received a letter from
Danforth's office that indicates the FBI is willing to conduct a
re-creation of the FLIR activity for the office of special counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Deputy Special Counsel Edward L. Dowd Jr. notes, this could
result in two separate but simultaneous re-creations _ a nonpublic
one which the FBI authorizes and a public one which DOL
challenges,'' Smith wrote. ``The court is persuaded that one FLIR
test should be conducted, with participation and observation by the
parties and the OSC.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith ordered that the parties, including Danforth's office,
agree upon a written protocol that would best approximate the
conditions of April 19, 1993, including the make and model of the
FLIR equipment, the type of aircraft, altitude, weather conditions,
angle of the sun, types of weapons and rate of firing.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth was appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno in
September to investigate recent revelations in the Branch Davidian
controversy. He has said that the issue of government gunfire will
be among the ``dark questions'' his inquiry will seek to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI contends that the flashes on the infrared tapes recorded
by its airplane were glints of sunlight on puddles of water, metal
or other debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this order further increases the chances that there
will never be a demonstration,'' Caddell said, ``because the truth
is everybody who is involved in this knows how that demonstration
is going to turn out. It increases the likelihood that wiser heads
at the FBI will prevail and say, 'OK, we admit that it is gunfire.'
If Reno and (FBI Director Louis) Freeh are going to have any
vestiges of credibility or authority or leadership left, they need
to admit that it was gunfire now instead of being forced to do so
by the court in this public demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlin said he would not comment on Caddell's accusations.

MARKET PLACE: DRUG MAKER DISCLOSES DATA ABOUT PACT WITH PFIZER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is becoming one of the drug industry's
nastiest takeover battles, Warner-Lambert released some
confidential details on Monday of its agreement with Pfizer to
co-promote Lipitor, a successful cholesterol-lowering drug.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies had agreed in 1996 to co-promote Lipitor, a
drug that analysts predict could have worldwide sales of about $5
billion next year. The details of the Lipitor agreement between
Pfizer and Warner-Lambert had long intrigued analysts, because it
was unclear how much profit Pfizer was receiving from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   While the earnings split regarding Lipitor was not disclosed
Monday, the sales grid that Warner-Lambert released made it clear
how valuable Lipitor was to Pfizer's future performance.
</P>
<P>
   During the first five years of the agreement, Pfizer could
receive up to 48 percent of Lipitor's net sales in the United
States beyond a set amount. Analysts noted Monday that the totals
were relatively low during these years _ ranging from $208 million
in the contract's first year to $584 million in the fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert had announced a $72 billion merger with American
Home Products two weeks ago. That same day, Pfizer made an $80
billion takeover bid for Warner-Lambert. Since then, Warner-Lambert
and Pfizer have made much of their correspondence public, in part
to stir investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   That trend continued Monday, when Lodewijk de Vink,
Warner-Lambert's chairman, sent a letter to William Steere Jr., the
chairman of Pfizer, noting that the details of their Lipitor
arrangement should be made public, including the gain to
Warner-Lambert and the loss to Pfizer should the agreement be
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   In another statement, Warner-Lambert reiterated that it was
considering canceling its co-promotional agreement with Pfizer
altogether, or at best, discontinuing it in 2002, after it came up
for review in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is a bare-knuckles fight,'' said Viren Mehta,
an analyst at Mehta Partners. ``Civility is a matter of the past.
What is clear from the Pfizer side is how they can get all of
Lipitor. The company will proceed with their hostile bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have questioned whether Pfizer miscalculated in
its attempt to take over Warner-Lambert, especially if the company
risks losing its take of the Lipitor revenue. Analysts appeared
confident Monday that Pfizer stood little chance of losing its
Lipitor revenue immediately. Pfizer has expressed even more
confidence in that respect.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer disputed Warner-Lambert's threat to cancel the agreement
over Lipitor immediately, noting that the only way that could
happen was for the company to break its original agreement on
Lipitor. Pfizer also said that it expected Warner-Lambert to renew
the agreement on Lipitor in 2002 because no other company has the
same marketing savvy or history with Lipitor as Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Monday that the public spats between Pfizer and
Warner-Lambert had just begun. One theory among analysts was that
Warner-Lambert released Lipitor's sales grid on Monday to show how
much was at risk for Pfizer if Warner-Lambert canceled their
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer had offered 2.5 of its shares for every Warner-Lambert
share. By contrast, American Home Products had offered 1.49 of its
shares. By the company's closing prices on Monday, Pfizer's offer
was worth $87 a share, compared with American Home Product's bid of
$83.25 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In order for Pfizer's takeover bid for Warner-Lambert to
succeed, analysts contend that it would have to increase its bid.
That would be difficult for Pfizer if the company's stock dropped
in the wake of negative news about Lipitor.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, investors are betting that the offers from
Pfizer and American Home Products are both too low.
Warner-Lambert's shares closed Monday at $92.75, down 87.5 cents.
The company's stock has increased 10.6 percent since it announced
its merger with American Home Products and Pfizer made a hostile
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert should continue
to heat up this week. Pfizer is holding a meeting with analysts on
Tuesday to review drugs it is working on. The company has been
criticized by some analysts as trailing many of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The company may also put its spin on the Lipitor agreement. One
spokesman from Pfizer said Monday that the two companies' Lipitor
agreement had been so successful that there was no reason for
Warner-Lambert to end it out of spite.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Monday that they did not expect the public spats
between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert to harm the prices of drug
stocks. Pfizer's shares dropped 12.5 cents Monday, to close at $35
a share. Shares of American Home Products dipped 6 cents, to close
at $55.875.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that this merger battle is like a
baseball game,'' said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with
Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. ``We're only in the early innings, but there's
plenty more to go. And it's already a donnybrook.''

SANCHEZ-VICARIO LOSES FAST TO AUSTRIA'S SCHETT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria, Spain)   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The legs do not churn and chug the way they used to,
a costly decline for a woman who made a reputation as her sport's
ultimate retriever and captured four Grand Slam titles and nearly
$15 million in prize money. Monday night at the Chase Championships
at Madison Square Garden, an event Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario has
appeared in 11 consecutive years yet barely squeaked into this
season, her stay was cut short by a Chase newcomer, Barbara Schett
of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   But the 16th-seeded Sanchez-Vicario, who had not anticipated
qualifying for singles and had not played a match in a month, did
not seem disheartened by her opening-round loss.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Schett, playing from the baseline and the net
with obvious ease while Sanchez-Vicario scrambled in the backcourt,
made a convincing Chase debut, winning by 6-1, 6-4 in just 61
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arantxa is not playing very powerful,'' Schett said about
Sanchez-Vicario, who held just four of her eight service games,
broke Schett only once and made 21 unforced errors, most of them on
her forehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I was not at my best, at all,'' Sanchez-Vicario
said. ``She's a talented player, and she did play much better than
me. I was missing a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sanchez-Vicario, rumors of her impending retirement
are premature. She hopes to survive the selection process a fourth
time and represent Spain in the Olympics next year.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a year ago that Sanchez-Vicario, whose
counterpunching had wavered before an onslaught of teenage power
players, made a surprise resurgence at the French Open, ending a
four-year Grand Slam title drought. But a left wrist injury kept
her out of action from mid-January to mid-March.

   HEALTH CARE ON THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   www.highwaytohealth.com
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you are visiting a foreign country when a pain in
the back doesn't respond to aspirin, or your child shows signs of
an ear infection, or your spouse develops a fever. You don't speak
the language and you don't know the name of a doctor (or medecin or
medico).
</P>
<P>
   HighwaytoHealth, a Web service based in Radnor, Pa., is designed
to help you find, get and pay for medical care while traveling. For
an annual membership fee of $19, a traveler is covered around the
world for any number of trips. The service says more than 18,000
physicians in 80 some countries _ I didn't count them _ belong to
the network.
</P>
<P>
   Although you can explore the Web site, you can't see the names
and locations of the doctors or make an appointment until you
subscribe and select a user name and password.
</P>
<P>
   First, I tried Paris. After selecting ``medical doctor'' (you
can also choose dentist, physical therapist or sports medicine)
within five miles of where I was, I was presented with a map of
Paris. Next came a list of 10 doctors there whom I could see.
Wandering around, I found seven doctors in New Delhi, two in Buenos
Aires and one in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   You submit a request for a medical appointment to
HighwaytoHealth by e-mail or telephone. When one or more physicians
respond, the subscriber is sent the list to review and select the
best offer. The physicians have signed contracts with the service
agreeing to see subscribers if their schedule permits. The HTH call
center monitors the appointment requests, the company says, to make
sure they are answered, and will even try to schedule an
appointment with an independent doctor if there is none under
contract in your area.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers City Health Profiles, health care
information for some 350 popular travel destinations and, for extra
cost, insurance meant to supplement your regular health plan when
traveling. Two insurance plans, offered through Worldwide Insurance
Services, are TravelGap Vacationer, insurance for one trip at $4.50
a day, and TravelGap Gold, a full year of coverage for $199. Of
course, the value of that insurance depends on the details of your
regular coverage, the procedure required and the country you are
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   HELP FOR NONMEMBERS
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to subscribe to HighwaytoHealth to use its City
Health Profiles. The information for each city covered is divided
into two parts. The first lists such things as emergency telephone
numbers, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies, health care at airports
and other general information. The second is detailed information
about things in the first.
</P>
<P>
   For Paris, there were emergency telephone numbers for ambulance,
police (you dial 17, not 911) and fire help, and for the American
Hospital of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There were also numbers for the International Society of Travel
Medicine, and a link to its Web site, www.istm.org. It provides
news from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.

HONG KONG IS HOPING DISNEY MAGIC RUBS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 21)

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Ever since it was handed back to China in July 1997,
this former British colony has worried obsessively about what it
was going to become. Now, it has an answer: Hong Kong will be the
next outpost in the Disney empire.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Walt Disney Co. announced plans to build a theme
park here, its third outside the United States and second in Asia,
after Tokyo Disneyland. While it would be cynical to say that this
metropolis of 6.8 million will be defined by Mickey Mouse, it is
hard to overstate the impact that officials here believe a
Disneyland will have on Hong Kong's image and its tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of faded out of the spotlight after 1997, and
everybody wrote us off,'' said Mike Rowse, Hong Kong's tourism
commissioner. ``This project tells the world that we are alive and
kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   As the man who negotiated the $3.6 billion deal to bring Disney
to Hong Kong, Rowse is understandably keen to prove its worth. He
contends that Hong Kong Disneyland, which is to open in 2005, will
pump $19 billion into the economy over four decades, much of it
through a revived tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   Rowse said that the theme park would attract 1.4 million
additional visitors to Hong Kong in its first year, and 2.9 million
more annually by the time it is fully developed in 2020. If these
projections are accurate _ and the 17.5 million people a year who
visit Tokyo Disneyland suggest they might be _ the park would
reverse a steady erosion in tourist arrivals since the handover.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hong Kong drew 9.5 million visitors, an 8 percent
decline from 1997. Much of that can be attributed to the regional
economic crisis. But even before that, Hong Kong was becoming less
popular. In 1996, nearly 12 million people visited Hong Kong. Many
were eager for a last look at a British colonial outpost. Once the
Union Jack came down, the crowds went elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here note that the number of arrivals has rebounded 11
percent so far this year. But nobody disputes that Hong Kong needed
a jolt _ something to remind tourists that it is still probably the
most cosmopolitan city in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives said Hong Kong's international character was a
key reason they chose it over Shanghai and other mainland cities
that were lobbying to be the site of the first Chinese Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an incredibly exciting city,'' said Judson C. Green,
chairman of Disney's theme-park division. ``It always has been,
irrespective of the financial crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said Disney was also attracted by Hong Kong's
infrastructure. With a spectacular year-old airport and a gleaming
network of roads, railways, tunnels and bridges, Hong Kong is one
of Asia's easiest cities to get to and get around in. The site for
the proposed Disneyland is in a quiet bay on Lantau Island,
conveniently midway between central Hong Kong and the airport and
not far from a high-speed train that connects the two.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Magic Kingdoms, the park will have shops, restaurants
and theaters _ some with an Asian flavor. It will also have three
or four hotels, with a total of 2,100 rooms. Although the hotels
could compete with those in Kowloon or central Hong Kong, few
hoteliers seem worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a boon for all the hotels, because it will put Hong
Kong back on the map,'' said Robert Hutchinson, former group
director of marketing at Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, a leading
Asian chain.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that business people traveling to Hong Kong
would have an incentive to bring their families; they could stay in
the city for a week, then tack on an extra couple of days at a
Disney hotel.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, Hong Kong's Disneyland will also have to
attract millions of visitors from mainland China. Officials here
said that they planned to work with Beijing to streamline the visa
procedures. With opening day five years away, officials are
confident of reaching an accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Disneyland is poised to draw more Chinese visitors to
Hong Kong, some people here fret that it will rob the city of its
Chinese character. Disney's goal in Hong Kong _ as in Paris and
Tokyo _ is to create an idealized version of America that pays
little heed to the folkways of the host country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, what makes a city great is its ethnic
identity,'' said David Tang, the founder of Shanghai Tang, a
boutique that sells pricey clothing with a retro-Mao flavor, mostly
to tourists. ``This is a Chinese city. We have to cultivate these
Chinese elements.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tang is a lonely dissenter. After years of worrying about
its future _ fears that were compounded by the Asian crisis _ Hong
Kong seems willing to bear the cultural baggage of Disney so long
as it brings the crowds back. Besides, people here are used to
foreign powers with global ambitions.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, Nov. 9,
about an American who faces 10 years in prison for a car accident
in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, in which his interpreter
died, misstated the position of the State Department. The
department says it has never maintained that the jailing of the
American, Loren Wille, was a retaliation for that of a Georgian
diplomat, Gueorgui Makharadze, who killed a teenager in Washington
in 1997 in a drunken-driving accident.
</P>
<P>
   The report also misstated the circumstances surrounding the loss
of Mr. Makharadze's diplomatic immunity. It was lifted by the
Georgian Embassy so that he could face criminal charges arising
from the accident; it was not waived after his conviction.

DEFENSE BEGINS CASE FOR THIRD SUSPECT IN DRAGGING DEATH 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and RICHARD STEWART 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The last of three white men to be tried in last
year's dragging death of James Byrd Jr. could have gotten the black
man's blood on his clothing the day after the killing while
watching someone else clean a bloody chain at the local car wash, a
defense expert testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Paulette Sutton, a forensic serologist at the University of
Tennessee in Memphis, told jurors in Shawn Berry's capital murder
trial that specks of Byrd's blood found on the defendant's jeans,
shirt and boots were not consistent with a beating, but could be
explained by an experiment she conducted at a carwash.
</P>
<P>
   First she stuffed a pair of used jeans with rolls of paper
towels to simulate a person's legs and hung them with bungee cords
at a car wash. Sutton then sprayed water on a 12-foot length of
chain that she had painted the night before with two teaspoons of
human blood.
</P>
<P>
   The faint stains she created as the blood-tinted water
ricocheted off the chain and onto the bluejeans matched a
photograph of the stains on Berry's jeans, she said. Sutton also
said she was wearing a pair of boots at the car wash and got water
spray on her boots consistent with stains on Berry's boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blood was splashing onto an observing individual,'' Sutton
testified, adding that she had been told that Berry had accompanied
co-defendant Bill King to a Jasper carwash and was standing nearby
as King washed off a 24-foot logging chain that had been used to
drag Byrd to his death early on June 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray, who contends
that Berry actively participated in chaining Byrd to the back of
his pickup and was driving the truck that dragged Byrd more than
three miles, challenged the validity of Sutton's experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Besides questioning the methodology, the prosecutor forced her
to concede that she used a different brand of jeans than Berry was
wearing the night of the killing, a different chain and a different
car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the victim's sisters _ one a science teacher and the
other a lab technician _ weren't buying the testimony either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her experiments so far are not scientifically sound, and
anyone in the scientific community will tell you,'' Clara Taylor
said outside the courthouse. ``You have to have a controlled
experiment and all the conditions have to be exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was one of 20 witnesses to take the stand Monday as
Berry's lawyer, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn, began his defense.
Sixteen of those witnesses, including two black people and one of
mixed race, testified that Berry was not a racist, that he had
several African-American friends and that he had cried at the
funeral of a black man he had worked with at a local tire shop.
</P>
<P>
   Berry is expected to testify today. If convicted by the
all-white jury, Berry would face either life in prison or join his
two co-defendants, white supremacists Russell Brewer Jr., 32, and
King, 25, on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Berry's girlfriend, Christy Marcontell, took the
stand to explain her tumultuous relationship with the defendant and
to say that she had lied or exaggerated when she signed two police
statements in October 1997 and in May 1998 complaining that Berry
had assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Shawn enjoyed fighting,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Berry has never punched me. He has never done anything
like that or I wouldn't be sitting there by his side,'' added
Marcontell, who has been sitting at the defense table throughout
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brit Featherston,
who is assisting with the prosecution, asked Marcontell which of
her stories the jury should believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lied to police two times, but I'm up here under oath and I'm
not going to lie,'' she said. ``This police report right here is
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, outside the courthouse, Marcontell told reporters she was
embarrassed that she had to air the couple's dirty laundry on the
witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had absolutely nothing to do with this,'' she said. ``What
is relevant to this case is what happened out on Huff Creek Road.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on Huff Creek Road that police found Byrd's decapitated
body, outside a rural black cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Beaumont, Texas, psychiatrist Edward Gripon
also downplayed the couple's problems, dismissing Marcontell's
complaints as minor incidents of domestic violence that did not
result in serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gripon admitted under cross-examination that Berry would have
been aware that King and Brewer were violent racists because they
talked constantly about starting a race war and because their arms
had been blackened with racist tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   He described Berry's decision to offer a ride to a black man in
the middle of the night with two Klansmen in the truck and then
drive him to a remote wooded area ``relatively poor judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively poor judgment, doctor?'' Gray repeated
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   And Gray challenged Gripon's contention that Berry had been
paralyzed in fear at the crime scene and when he lied in his first
statement to police because he was worried about retaliation from
King and Brewer. In that statement, Gray pointed out, Berry had
pointed the finger at the other two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't he drop them in the grease in the first statement?''
the prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gripon conceded that Berry may have lied ``in an attempt at
self-preservation and damage control.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox Inc. named Sandy Grushow, already president of its
television production studio, to the newly created position of
chairman of Fox Television Entertainment Group on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The move puts Grushow in charge of both the prime-time schedule
on the Fox network and many of the most important shows on the
schedules of competing networks.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment added a further entanglement to what is becoming
a complex series of interlocking business interests within the
television industry. Most of the networks are now part of much
larger entertainment entities and all are seeking to combat rising
program costs and declining revenue by taking advantage of the
opportunities created by holding complementing assets. Studios like
Walt Disney and Fox are increasingly producing shows for their own
networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox's production arm, 20th Television, is the largest
supplier of programs in the television business, with 20 series
spread out across five networks. In addition to eight shows on the
Fox network, the Fox studio produces such hits as ``The Practice''
and ``Dharma and Greg'' for ABC, ``Judging Amy'' and ``Chicago
Hope'' for CBS, ``Stark Raving Mad'' for NBC and ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer'' for WB.
</P>
<P>
   While Grushow said he would keep the interests of the studio and
the interests of the network ``operating totally independently,''
some industry executives suggested that his promotion could
complicate his relationships with competing networks.
</P>
<P>
   ABC had already stirred some confusion and resistance in the
network television industry with its decision last summer to
combine the operations of its studio and the network entertainment
division under two executives, Lloyd Braun and Stu Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow said Monday that ``This is not the ABC model.'' He said
that instead of combining operations, Fox intended to keep the
studio and network decision-making separate, even though both
divisions will report directly to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe for a second that there is going to be any
reason for anyone to worry about divided loyalties,'' Grushow said.
``That's the easy and obvious argument, but I just don't believe
there's any justification for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in contrast to ABC's stated chief intention for
combining the studio and network operations _ to ensure that more
ABC-owned shows get onto the network's schedule _ Fox had no plan
to change its strategy for its studio, which involves producing the
most shows possible for as many networks as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to do anything to put a multibillion-dollar
business at risk,'' Grushow said. ``If one of our writers comes to
us with an idea that is best suited to a network other than Fox,
that show will be going to that network.''
</P>
<P>
   But the double responsibilities of studio and network do create
potentially unusual situations for Grushow. For example, last
spring he pushed hard at NBC for a new comedy, ``Stark Raving
Mad,'' to win that network's most coveted time slot, Thursday at
9:30 p.m. _ which it did. Now he will be in the position of trying
to find the right show on the Fox network to compete with ``Stark
Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Grushow said he would step back a bit from leading the effort to
place Fox studio shows at other networks by naming a new president
of the studio. ``I expect that person will come from inside the
studio,'' he said. ``And he will be the principal salesman for the
shows. But I expect I'll get on the phone a lot to endeavor to get
our shows placed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Grushow's arrival at the network also complicates the role of
Doug Herzog, the president of Fox Entertainment, who joined Fox
only a year ago after leaving his position as president of the
Comedy Central cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Herzog's future have run through Hollywood this
fall. Fox got off to a woeful start this television season, with
virtually all its new shows failing and its slow introduction of
original episodes of series questioned throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow said Monday that Herzog would stay on and would remain
in charge of the day-to-day operations of the network's
entertainment division. He said Herzog had been in the job only 10
months and had been ``unfairly ridiculed for what's gone on at Fox
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation at the network, Grushow said, is bad enough that
he expects initially it will demand more of his time than his work
at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog said he was comfortable with Grushow's appointment,
saying, ``Look, we can use the help.'' He added, ``Things move fast
at Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog had reported to Peter Chernin, the president of News
Corp., parent of Fox. Chernin said Monday that he made the decision
to place Herzog under Grushow essentially to help out Herzog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This did not have anything to do with lack of support for
Doug,'' Chernin said. ``I think he's done a pretty good job.'' But
he acknowledged that adding the network to Grushow's
responsibilities had little to do with needs at the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume it will be good for the studio, but to be blunt, that
was not the issue here,'' Chernin said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government officials said Monday evening that the
National Transportation Safety Board was considering asking the FBI
to take over the case of EgyptAir 990, after a review of the
plane's cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were focusing on a cryptic utterance,
possibly a prayer. They said there were many questions about
exactly what was said and what it meant, but they were concerned
that the statement might be the last words of a pilot determined to
destroy himself and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in the Atlantic, near Nantucket Island, Mass.,
two weeks ago, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not characterize the words beyond saying that
they may have been a prayer. The crew's conversations, other than
uneventful ones with air traffic controllers, were in Arabic and
senior officials of the safety board said that even with the aid of
additional interpreters brought in Monday, they did not understand
what was being said on the tape. The problems were ones of
language, culture and hearing what people said in a noisy cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation investigators also stressed that they had not yet
synchronized the voice tape with the flight data recorder tape,
which would record events occurring on the airplane and could put
the statements in context. For instance, a prayer being said after
the plane began plummeting so fast that passengers were rendered
weightless would not be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior law enforcement official said Monday night he
believed that the tape showed that after one of the two pilots left
the cockpit, another crew member made the suspicious utterance.
Only after that, the law-enforcement official said, was the
autopilot disengaged, seconds before the plane began its fatal
plunge. That sequence of events cast suspicion on the crew member,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has supreme authority over transportation
accidents, and guards that role jealously, but the FBI, which
usually assists the board, takes over if the two agencies decide
that there was evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the safety board, Jim Hall, at a news conference
Monday afternoon, said, ``We are concentrating our efforts on
determining from the evidence, including the cockpit voice
recorder, whether or not this investigation is to remain under the
leadership of the NTSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify why he was focusing on whether the crash was
properly within his agency's jurisdiction, Hall simply reread his
statement about leadership of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the safety board proposed
stepping aside Monday afternoon, and taking a subordinate role
assisting the FBI, but FBI officials said they first wanted to
study the tape more.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which had one agent sitting in with safety board
officials on Sunday to listen to the tape, sent more Monday
evening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The board is often eager to extricate itself from crashes that
are not caused by mechanical failures or human error; most
recently, it gave the FBI jurisdiction over the derailment of an
Amtrak train in October 1995, near Hyder, Ariz., that was
determined to have been caused by someone sabotaging the tracks. It
has also turned over two aircraft incidents, in which disgruntled
airline employees came into the cockpit and attacked the pilots
flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   And board officials say they have a full agenda of work,
including the TWA 800 crash three years ago, which many initially
suspected was sabotage but is now believed to have been caused by
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say how many voices were heard on the tape.
The cockpit requires a crew of two, and has two seats where
observers, trainees or company employees along for the ride can
sit.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 10-year-old Boeing 767, was cruising at 33,000 feet
about half an hour out of Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31
when the autopilot disengaged, either by itself or by the action of
a pilot. Then the plane flew steadily for a few more seconds, and
went into an extremely steep dive. During the dive, someone turned
off the engines.
</P>
<P>
   After descending about 3 miles, the plane pitched up, subjecting
everyone inside to two and a half times normal gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Then it turned downward again and apparently broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Monday evening, ``I am well aware of the many rumors,
theories, and stories circulating in the last 72 hours _ indeed, in
the last two weeks _ about potential causes of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the board and elsewhere were uncertain about
what they had. A U.S. intelligence official said Monday night that
the CIA still has no evidence indicating terrorist activity in
connection with the crash. The official said that the CIA has
translators listening to the tape, but is still not certain of the
significance of the utterances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An American pilot with long experience in crash investigations
run by the safety board suggested that the board's next steps could
include interviews and even cultural study, as opposed to technical
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the New York
office, said, ``as far as the FBI is concerned, we're doing the
same things today that we've been doing for the past two weeks. But
we all agree _ FBI, NTSB an the rest of the parties _ that the tape
recordings need to be further analyzed before people can reach
certain conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh met with Hall to discuss the
progress of the case and the possibility that the bureau might take
over the inquiry. In part, senior officials are worried over how to
pay for what could be a long and costly investigation, if it is
necessary to retrieve large sections of the aircraft from the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said the bureau might tap the
government's Counterterrorism Fund, a reserve of several million
dollars that is managed by the Justice Department.

 Chronicle Books Remains All In the Family  &HT;     By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Nion McEvoy, the great-grandson of San Francisco Chronicle founder
M.H. de Young, yesterday bought specialty publisher Chronicle Books
from his fellow family members for an undisclosed sum.
<P>
   McEvoy, 47, already the editor in chief and a 13-year employee
of Chronicle Books, said he was pleased to keep the San Francisco
company in the family as other assets of Chronicle Publishing are
sold to outside corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it became clear to me that the family was planning to
sell all the assets of the publishing company, I felt very strongly
about wanting to continue my involvement with this one,'' McEvoy
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chronicle Publishing said it sold television
station KRON, but it did not identify the buyer. The station, San
Francisco's NBC affiliate, was the subject of intense interest from
NBC's parent, General Electric, as well as from News Corp., Gannett
Co., Young Broadcasting and several other media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Books employs about 130 people and publishes more than
300 books per year, in addition to maintaining an extensive
backlist of more than 1,000 books. It has three divisions _ adult,
children and gift _ and publishes books in such subjects as food,
photography, art, architecture, interior design, gardening, pop
culture and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In buying Chronicle Books, McEvoy said he was happy to keep the
small press independent in the face of publishing industry
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it great is its independent spirit,'' McEvoy said.
If a large New York publishing conglomerate had bought the company,
``it would have been the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other publicly announced bidder for the firm was Leo J.
Hindery, who had recently left his post as head of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s
broadcast and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery's entry presented an intriguing twist: Hindery, the
former chief financial officer of Chronicle Publishing, was bidding
against McEvoy, who sits on the board of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McEvoy recused himself from all deliberations relating to
Chronicle Books and had to out-bid Hindery for the property. ``Nion
was put through the hoops like he was any other bidder,'' said John
B. Sias, chairman and chief executive of Chronicle Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Books had an estimated value of about $40 million. The
sales price was not disclosed, but the deal was at least $15
million, as it is subject to federal Department of Justice
antitrust review, Sias said.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery, 51, of Hillsborough was traveling and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy said, ironically enough, Hindery had encouraged him to
join Chronicle Books 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy does not plan any major changes in the company. ``Right
at the moment, it ain't broke,'' McEvoy said. ``I want to keep it
the dynamic and innovative company that it is today and explore all
the opportunities that our independence affords us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said company President Jack Jensen will would  &LR; remain in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy recalled joining Chronicle Books ``in 1986, when there
were only 15 of us and we were only doing 25 books a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1968 by former Chronicle executive
Phelps Dewey, and although it was one of the smaller units of
Chronicle Publishing, it was a moneymaker money-maker  &LR; and a source
of pride.
</P>
<P>
   The de Young descendants voted earlier this year to sell all
assets of Chronicle Publishing, starting with the 134-year-old
flagship, The San Francisco Chronicle, which was sold to Hearst
Corp. That sale is pending federal review.
</P>
<P>
   McEvoy, a former attorney with the William Morris Agency, noted
that his own publishing history extends not only to his de Young
roots, but also on his paternal side: His father, Dennis McEvoy,
who died in 1982, was an executive with Readers Digest magazine,
launching the Japanese and Spanish editions of the magazine and
working with such writers as James A. Michener. In addition, his
grandfather, J.P. McEvoy, was a playwright who also worked for the
Ziegfield Follies and wrote dialogue for W.C. Fields and Shirley
Temple movies.

GATES ADVOCATES COMPETITION, BUT HE HAS HIS DOUBTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ As Bill Gates opened his annual speech at the Comdex
technology conference, he tried to portray Microsoft as a company
that wanted to give consumers choices in how they use computers and
get online. But many of those attending expressed doubts about
whether Microsoft was truly embracing the idea of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of technology professionals, from software
developers to network managers, have descended on this city to
attend Comdex, the huge conference that has been showcasing new
business-computing technologies for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 of them swarmed into the ballroom where the
Microsoft chairman presented his keynote address on Sunday night,
eager to hear his reaction to the strong attack embedded within the
findings of a federal judge this month in a government antitrust
case.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from a couple of joking references to lawyers, Gates
steered clear of any direct references to the case. Instead he
jumped among several topics, from the ways software could help
businesses manage hardware failures to how Web sites and non-Web
programs could seamlessly exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, whose company has defined the personal-computer era, also
heralded the dawn of a less PC-centric age, when people will use
several different mobile devices _ like Internet-enabled cell
phones and personal digital assistants _ to gain access to the Web.
He stressed that people will have a choice of Internet devices.
``No one will dominate over the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he painted a picture of a world in which
Windows software would run on any device. And on Monday, as mobs of
people huddled near Microsoft's booth awaiting its opening, several
shook their heads when asked whether they sensed the dawn of an era
in which Microsoft would lose its dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to deflect the monopoly situation he's facing,''
said Charles Shepperd, director of information systems for Plastics
Plus, a company in Auburn Hills, Mich. There may be many new
companies, and many new products evolving, Shepperd said, but ``I
don't think anybody is going to be able to catch up'' to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gervais, director of research and development for a start-up
company called RealLegends.com, said that Microsoft's ``deep
pockets'' would keep it in its dominant position for several years,
regardless of the outcome of the Microsoft trial.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat crosslegged on the convention floor, Gervais pulled
out his hand-held device, a personal digital assistant called a
Cassiopeia, which runs on one of Microsoft's operating systems,
Windows CE, which Gates cited in his speech as a platform of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Windows CE represents, in fact, an area in which Microsoft does
have formidable competition. The Palm, from 3Com, is the personal
digital assistant of choice, Gervais noted, and does not use a
Windows operating system. He also predicted that voice-recognition
software might someday replace the Windows graphical interface.
Still, he said, it will probably be 10 years before ``there will be
a lot more choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Some attendees pointed to Linux, the operating system of the
so-called open-source movement, as another potential competitor to
Microsoft. In fact, many at the conference, while bemoaning a
Microsoft monopoly, also hailed Linux's latest successes.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the organizers of Comdex, Ziff-Davis, opened
a parallel conference called the Linux Business Expo to give Linux
developers a central place to display their wares. The halls were
not nearly as crowded as those near Microsoft's booth, but hundreds
of people streamed by to look, for the first time, at new programs
like a Linux version of Word Perfect from Corel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of momentum,'' said Andy Wolf, a business
development manager for Andover.net, the parent company of
SlashDot, a pro-Linux Web site. ``But I don't necessarily think it
will become bigger than Microsoft.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But several of those interviewed noted the quandary inherent in
such competition. Because Linux is a free system, whose code can be
manipulated by anybody, it also breeds variation. Instead of having
one standard system upon which everyone can build applications and
use documents, Linux may have differing branches depending on how
it is altered by individual developers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, stands for standardization _ there
is one system that can be built upon without any fear of
incompatibility.
</P>
<P>
   To Ryan Priest, a Microsoft-certified systems engineer who came
to Comdex partly to hunt for a job, Microsoft's standards are not
something that should be simply dismissed: ``It boils down to, how
can you use it? Everybody can develop things that are compatible
with Microsoft. With other platforms, you're going to have
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Competition is good. But you also want stability.''

 Brokers, VC Firms Team Up  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Three of the nation's largest online stock brokers and three
well-known Menlo Park venture capital firms are forming an
investment bank that will specialize in funneling new high-tech
stocks to online investors.
<P>
   The new firm, which has yet to be named, will be based in
Silicon Valley and plans to start underwriting and distributing
shares of information technology and Internet companies early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. of San Francisco, TD Waterhouse Group of
New York and Ameritrade Holding Corp. of Omaha are investing in the
enterprise and will be exclusive sellers of all equity securities
underwritten by the new investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The other financial partners _ Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
Trident Capital and Benchmark Capital _ will help steer startups to
the new underwriting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ryles, who resigned as head of technology investment
banking for Merrill Lynch two weeks ago, will serve as chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new firm will be designed to respond to online investor
demand for new issues, which to date has not been fully satisfied
by the traditional offering process,'' said Ryles. Most traditional
equity underwriters allocate scarce shares of hot IPOs to large
institutional clients like mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although many customers of online brokerages own shares in
high-tech companies, Ryles noted they ``generally have not been
able to participate fully in the initial public offering process.''
Instead, they buy shares, often at inflated prices, once trading
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The average gain for 438 IPOs that have gone public this year is
a whopping 125 percent, according to IPO Monitor. And the biggest
gains often occur on the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer demand is just huge,'' said Schwab Chief Strategy
Officer Dan Leemon. Schwab has distributed about 10 million shares
in 73 IPOs this year, and Leemon said it could easily have sold
several times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab began exploring the creation of an investment bank in the
summer and decided it would have more clout working with other
underwriters if it teamed up with other large online brokers.
Schwab recruited TD Waterhouse and Ameritrade, which together serve
4.5 million active online investor accounts (more than 50 percent
of the total) with nearly $750 billion in combined customer assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our customers, and the investment managers we serve
want a bigger share of the IPO pie,'' said Schwab President David
Pottruck. TD Waterhouse President Frank Petrilli added, ``We are
excited to be part of a venture that fundamentally changes the IPO
process and recognizes individual investors as the powerful force
that they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering shares in IPOs, the new investment bank plans
to provide research to individual and institutional investors and
eventually sell them late-stage investments in private companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new investment bank is not alone in going after the online
market. Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette distributes some IPO shares
through its DLJDirect unit, and online broker E-Trade Group of
Menlo Park has invested in an online investment bank called
EOffering.
</P>
<P>
   Ryles said one of the goals of both the brokerage and venture
capital backers of the new investment bank is to allocate shares to
customers who plan to hold on to the stock rather than ``flip'' it
for a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   By better assessing online demand for new shares, the investment
bank and issuers should also be able to to do a better job pricing
new shares.

 Red Hat Juggles Executives While Picking Up Cygnus  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
After striking it rich with a multibillion-dollar IPO this summer,
Red Hat Inc. is now using its highly valued stock to acquire other
companies.
<P>
   Red Hat, the leading distributor of Linux software, said
yesterday that it will buy privately held Cygnus Solutions of
Sunnyvale for about $697.6 million in stock. Cygnus makes tools
used by computer programmers to create software applications for
the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement yesterday, Red Hat said chief
executive Bob Young is stepping aside and will be replaced by the
company's current chief operating officer, Matthew Szulik. Young
will stay on as chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat of Durham, N.C., became an instant Wall Street darling
when it went public in August. The stock price shot up from $14, to
as high as $135, in its first few weeks of trading before leveling
off at about $100. Red Hat shares climbed $3.56, to $105.38, in
trading yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Red Hat now has a market capitalization of $7.3 billion. Not bad
for a company that has yet to make a profit and that had revenue of
just $10.8 million for the fiscal year ended February 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Linux operating system is widely perceived as a possible
threat to Microsoft's Windows software, which today runs the vast
majority of desktop computers. Unlike Windows, Linux is an
open-source software program that is available free to users.
However, Linux currently is suitable only for users with
considerable technical know-how, while Windows is marketed for
average PC owners. Red Hat, and a handful of other companies, make
money by providing support and services to businesses using Linux.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of Cygnus, Red Hat picks up valuable
engineering talent and a workforce of 181 employees. Red Hat
anticipates no layoffs and expects to have a total head count of
more than 400 workers once the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Cygnus is subject to regulatory approval and is
expected to close on January Jan.  &LR; 27.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also gives Red Hat a strategic toehold toe-hold  &LR; in the
so-called post-PC world. That's because Cygnus software is used in
such products as wireless phones, handheld computers and other
Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, shipments of these appliances are expected to outstrip
shipments of personal computers, according to International Data
Corp. Unlike the Windows advantage monopoly &LR;   &LR; in personal
computers, there is no dominant operating system for these new
devices.
</P>
<P>
   George Weiss, an analyst with the Gartner Group, thinks the deal
makes a lot of sense but worries that Red Hat may be positioned to
grow big and mean at the expense of such Linux competitors as
Caldera Systems, Suse and Turbo Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open-source movement is based on the principles of sharing
and giving back to the community,'' he said. ``But Red Hat needs to
make more acquisitions and get larger to justify its high
valuation.'' He believes the company may run into trouble _ and
incur the disdain of developers _ as it tries to reconcile these
opposing forces.
</P>
<P>
   As for Red Hat's management shuffle, the official line is that
Bob  &LR; Young will remain deeply involved in the company and will
continue to play an important role in promoting Red Hat and the
entire Linux movement.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Young does not have the full confidence of
Wall Street and lacks key leadership qualities. By contrast, new
CEO Matthew  &LR; Szulik has a proven track record, having held
executive positions at five software companies. ``Red Hat needs
more seasoned, professional leadership as it moves from a startup
to a financially viable organization,'' said Weiss.

 _ SF CHRON   Income Rules For Switch To Roth 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: My wife is approaching age 701/2, when she must begin taking
distributions from her traditional individual retirement account.
The IRA contains almost $24,500, all of it taxable. Rather than
take distributions, she would like to convert the account to a Roth
IRA, which would mean declaring the $24,500 as income (and paying
the tax). However, this looks like a Catch-22 situation. We have a
substantial income already, and the additional $24,500 would push
us above $100,000, which is the highest permissible amount for
people making IRA conversions. Do they make an exception in cases
like ours to let us do a rollover anyway?
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   The amount you want to roll over to a Roth IRA is excluded from
your income from salary, interest and dividends, capital gains,
pensions and the like in calculating whether you are eligible for a
rollover, says Bob Meyer, assistant technical coordinator with the
Internal Revenue Service's Northern California district. ``You
could even roll over a million dollars or more,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   However, if your wife doesn't act soon and is forced to take
distributions before she rolls over her IRA, the distributions must
be figured in with the rest of your income. If a distribution
pushes you above $100,000, you won't be eligible to do a rollover
that year.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth's creator, U.S. Sen. Senator  &LR; William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., wanted distributions excluded from the income calculation.
He hoped to give a break to IRA holders who _ through no fault of
their own _ already had reached age 701/2. But he had to back off
because the federal bean counters said such an exemption in the
early years of the Roth program would cause a significant budget
squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has decreed that distributions no longer will affect
your eligibility for a rollover starting Jan. 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
When Not to Pay Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Q: My income is primarily from Social Security disability
insurance and a private disability insurance policy. Neither is
taxable. However, I own shares of a mutual fund that pays out
capital gains from time to time. Also, I recently sold $2,000 worth
of shares at a capital gain to have more cash on hand. My question:
Do I have to pay taxes on my capital gains?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: That depends on the size of your gains, your age, your
marital status and whether you are filing a separate or joint
return.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to pay taxes if your income, apart from the
nontaxable disability payments, is greater than the sum of your
exemptions plus either the standard deduction or your total
itemized deductions _ whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you won't even have to file a return if your
income is less than the exemption plus the standard deduction. For
single people under age 65, the income cutoff for filing a return
next April is $7,050; for those 65 and older, the cutoff is $8,100.
</P>
<P>
   For married couples filing jointly, the cutoffs are: $12,700
with both spouses under 65; $13,550 with one spouse under 65;
$14,400 with both spouses 65 or older.
</P>
<P>
   You are correct in stating that your Social Security disability
payments are tax-free. However, if your private policy was provided
by your employer, the benefits are not exempt from taxes. But if
you bought the policy yourself, then the benefits cannot be taxed.

Tardiness Costing Money
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been investing in my company's 401(k) plan for the
past two years. We have a choice of funds through the T. Rowe Price
mutual-fund group. I am paid biweekly, and my 401(k) payment is
automatically deducted. Since the beginning of the year, I have
been checking my balance every day, and I have noticed that my
contributions were showing up in my account at irregular intervals
_ sometimes as early as the day I am paid, other times as much as
four business days later. According to my calculations, I have lost
money this way because the fund prices have tended to rise during
the periods when my contributions were delayed. What can I do about
this?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: T. Rowe Price spokesman Todd Remert says the fund group
``makes every attempt to get 401(k) contributions invested on the
day we receive the money.'' Generally speaking, that will be the
same day you are paid because standard procedure is for employers
to wire the money to Price.
</P>
<P>
   If there have been delays, Remert says, it might be that your
employer caused them.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility, he says, is that your plan has ``unique
procedures'' that make occasional delays inevitable. For example:
``An employer might be processing payrolls from multiple locations
across the country, and it may have asked us to wait to invest
until we've received all the money.''
</P>
<P>
   You should ask your employer if it can explain the delays. You
also should call T. Rowe Price at (800) 638-5660. Give them the
name of your employer, and discuss your plight. Remert promises
that Price will check it out.

 Legal Limbo Mires Microsoft Stock  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
So, what are you going to do about your Microsoft stock?
<P>
   The software colossus seems highly vulnerable in the wake of the
withering denunciation by federal Judge Thomas P. Jackson of its
``monopolistic'' business practices.
</P>
<P>
   However, its fate remains uncertain, pending Jackson's final
verdict in the federal government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an out-of-court settlement between Microsoft and the
government, Jackson is expected to render a verdict in favor of the
government early next year and to mete out stiff penalties.
</P>
<P>
   He may order the company broken up into three or more pieces.
Or, he may leave the company intact but impose draconian
restrictions on its business practices that will drastically slow
its tremendous growth.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's fate is important not only to people who own the
stock directly, but also to millions of mutual fund investors and
pension-plan beneficiaries who own it indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   The stock is nearly ubiquitous in professionally managed
portfolios. It is owned by more than 2,000 institutions, which
among them hold nearly close to  &LR; 2 billion of its 5 billion shares
_ about $175 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   Only this month, Microsoft became one of the 30 stocks in the
widely watched Dow Jones industrial average. That means a weak
performance by Microsoft will drag on the indicator that many
people consider ``the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Microsoft's stock has been a tepid performer
since the judge issued his ``findings of fact'' after the stock
market closed on November 5.
</P>
<P>
   While most technology stocks have been on a tear _ the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index has risen 3.8 percent in that
brief span _ Microsoft is down 5 percent, closing yesterday at $87.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of the software giant's principal business
adversaries have been particularly strong since November 5.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, Apple Computer, International Business
Machines and Red Hat _ all of which produce computer operating
systems that compete, or try to compete, with Microsoft _ have
enjoyed nice run-ups.
</P>
<P>
   So have Oracle, second to Microsoft in applications software,
and America Online, owner of Netscape, which produces the
second-most-popular Internet browser, after Microsoft's Internet
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   If you had put equal amounts of money into each of those six
stocks on November 5, you would be sporting a handsome 8 percent
gain as of yesterday's market close.
</P>
<P>
   If you own Microsoft and the company's plight worries you _ but
you want to remain invested in high technology _ you might consider
selling at least part of your holdings. You could then invest the
proceeds in other strong, prominent technology companies with
clearer prospects _ particularly competitors that stand to benefit
most if Microsoft bogs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's management is going to have to alter their
decision process,'' predicts Stewart J. Pillette of Pillette
Investment Management in San Francisco. However the legal chips may
fall, he says, it seems likely that Microsoft will be less able to
``bulldoze'' the competition in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't own Microsoft stock, it might be advisable to avoid
it for a while, because uncertainty usually puts a damper on a
stock's performance. At some point, the company's legal problems
may drive the stock so low that it becomes a screaming buy _ but
that doesn't seem to have happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice would be to hedge your bet by investing in a
predominantly high-tech index, such as the Nasdaq 100, which
includes Microsoft and many of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   There are several mutual funds that track this index _ or, you
can buy shares in the Nasdaq-100 Trust, which trades as a stock on
the American Stock Exchange under the symbol QQQ. The trust's
shares closed yesterday at $144.09 _ up 5.7 percent since November
5.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's moderately weak stock-market performance in recent
days reflects the consensus evaluation of the perils the company
faces. What the consensus seems to say is that the future looks
unpleasant for Microsoft, but not necessarily disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Market experts interviewed by The Chronicle stress that
Microsoft is one of the great corporate juggernauts in business
history, full of talented people on both the technology and
financial sides. Even broken into pieces, they say, it will remain
a great and profitable force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can just say that Microsoft is done for,''
says Scott Marcouiller, a vice president and analyst with A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Son in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, market strategist with Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, says Microsoft's outlook is ``fundamentally quite good.''
He says the Windows 2000 launch, scheduled for February, ``probably
will be one of the most successful product launches in the history
of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also will be buoyed by continuing, strong technology
trends, Acuff believes. ``The Internet is probably going to expand
substantially in the next few years, and certainly Microsoft will
be one of the beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Microsoft's fate could remain uncertain for
years. Whatever the judge may finally rule, the company is likely
to appeal, and the appeals process could last two years or more.
</P>
<P>
   However, some experts think Microsoft will negotiate a
settlement, rather than submit further to Judge  &LR; Jackson's tender
mercies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge's statement was so severe, there's just no question
that Microsoft is highly motivated to come to a settlement,'' says
Gail Seneca of GMG Seneca Capital Management in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts disagree, feeling that Microsoft's notoriously
combative management will never voluntarily agree to restrictions
on its strategies and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see a settlement myself,'' says Peter Ausnit, an
analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan in San Francisco. ``The judge seems
to want to stop them from adding significant features and functions
to their operating system. They fundamentally believe that if they
don't innovate, they will be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects Microsoft to grit its teeth until the judge hands
down the verdict and sentence, then fight tooth and nail in the
appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the most radical punishment the judge is likely to
impose would be to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, one likely scenario would be to split it into
three companies, centered around Microsoft's operating systems,
applications (such as Microsoft Office) and consumer products/Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Any such ruling would rank right up there with the most
momentous antitrust breakups of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of Standard Oil produced several large, independent
oil companies, among them San Francisco's San &LR;  Francisco-based
 &LR; Chevron. The breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph gave
birth to the so-called Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Breakups, as those examples suggest, aren't necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Standard Oil and AT&AMP;T, they turned out to be
hugely profitable for shareholders. Free to innovate and flourish
on their own, the liberated parts of those monopolies collectively
became worth more than the whole.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a breakup, the most valuable pieces of Microsoft would
still be around, with a potential to continue earning humongous
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how a breakup might occur,'' says Seneca,
``there is no question that the real moneymaker for Microsoft has
been its software products, primarily its Windows operating system.
The operating system would continue to operate, no matter where.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater danger for Microsoft, most experts say, would be for
it to remain in one piece, but hog-tied competitively by harsh,
court-imposed restrictions on how it can develop and market
products.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all experts consider a breakup desirable. In an
interview with Barron's this week, David Readerman of Thomas Weisel
Partners in San Francisco, estimates the company's breakup value at
a mere $65 per share _ $22 below yesterday's close. Readerman
suggests that Microsoft is overvalued now, and that this is likely
to become more obvious in a breakup, when investors assign rational
values to each of the pieces.

 U.S., China Sign Landmark WTO Accord  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
With a handshake and a clink of champagne glasses, U.S. and Chinese
negotiators finally came to terms yesterday on a breakthrough
agreement that paves the way for China to enter the World Trade
Organization.
<P>
   Under the accord, reached after six days of marathon talks in
Beijing, China has agreed to cut tariffs on agricultural and
industrial goods and allow easier market access for U.S. financial
institutions, insurers and telecommunications firms.
</P>
<P>
   In return, China takes a big step closer to fulfilling its
long-held ambition of joining the WTO, which calls the shots for
global commerce and mediates disputes among member countries.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a 50 percent cap on U.S. investment in mainland
telecommunications businesses, it looks as if the American side
managed to fulfill most of its wish list, though the precise
details of the accord won't be clear for another few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is a major step forward in bringing China into
the WTO and a profoundly important step in the relationship between
the United States and China,'' President Clinton said yesterday
during a visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   He said the accord is ``good for the United States, good for
China and good for the world economy.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; 11th-Hour Agreement
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative who hammered
out the 11th-hour agreement, said, ``This is a profound and
historic moment in U.S.-China relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her counterpart in the negotiations, Chinese Foreign Trade
Minister Shi Guangsheng, told reporters in Beijing that the talks
were held amid a ``win-win spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion of this agreement serves the interests of both
China and the United States and is conducive to the development of
Sino-U.S. relations, to China becoming a WTO member as soon as
possible and to the development of the world economy and trade,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be too late for China to become a full member of
the WTO by the start of the organization's November 30 summit in
Seattle, it almost certainly would receive more deference than
generally given an ``observer'' nation.
</P>
<P>
   Before gaining full WTO membership, China would have to receive
``normal trade relations'' recognition from the U.S. Congress,
which, with an election on the horizon, won't come easily.
</P>
<P>
   China's human rights record angers politicians from both the
left and right, and just about every special interest group _ from
farmers to textile and apparel makers _ will want to weigh in with
criticisms before giving a green light to China's WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a tough fight,'' said Dave McCurdy, president of
the Electronics Industry Alliance, a confederation of tech and
telecom trade groups. ``But at the end of the day, I think Congress
will approve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-China trade accord obligates Beijing to slash tariffs
by an average 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But China backpedaled from an earlier agreement to allow U.S.
companies to hold 51 percent stakes in mainland telecommunication
ventures. Instead, Beijing drew the line at 50 percent ownership,
thus preventing foreign companies from holding a majority position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big 1 percent,'' acknowledged McCurdy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. telecom companies racked up more than $2 billion in sales
to China last year, and investment of as much as $200 billion is
foreseen in the near future as the country rapidly erects its
infrastructure for digital communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most dynamic sector out there,'' McCurdy said. ``They
want to keep a piece of the action.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord also:
</P>
<P>
   _Allows for foreign investment in Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   _Doubles the number of foreign films allowed into Chinese
theaters from the current annual total of 10.
</P>
<P>
   _Allows overseas manufacturers to import and distribute their
own products rather than go through state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   _Permits foreign banks to offer services in local currency to
mainland companies within two years of joining the WTO, and to
individual Chinese within five years.
</P>
<P>
   _Allows foreign auto companies full distribution and trading
rights. By 2006, China will reduce tariffs on automobiles to 25
percent from the current 80 to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _Cuts tariffs on agricultural products to 14.5 percent from the
present 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said much of the discussion over the weekend centered
on ``import surges'' and illegal ``dumping'' of products. The U.S.
steel industry, in particular, has been calling for more-stringent
measures to prevent Chinese manufacturers from undercutting
domestic companies with bargain-basement exports.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides ultimately agreed to maintain trade limitations
for 12 years and to uphold current anti-dumping restrictions for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Textiles also figured prominently in the final negotiations. The
United States has agreed to end its import quotas after five years
but to implement ``anti-surge'' safeguards for four years
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Waiting for Fine Print
</P>
<P>
   While all observers are still waiting to see the fine print on
the accord, initial reactions were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know so far is excellent,'' said Anne Craib, director
of international trade for the Semiconductor Industry Association.
``We think we got everything that was in the April agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   That presumably would include China signing the Information
Technology Agreement, a separate treaty that calls for most tariffs
on tech products to be eliminated by 2000. It affects $500 billion
in global technology trade, including $100 billion in U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   While Zhu had agreed in April to sign the treaty prior to China
joining the WTO, it's not yet known whether that pledge remained in
effect for yesterday's deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a sticking point, so I assume it's in
there,'' said Jennifer Guhl, director of international trade policy
for the American Electronics Association, which represents about
3,000 high-tech heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to see when the full agreement is released,''
she said. ``The devil truly is in the details.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the AFL-CIO said U.S. workers should be concerned
about increased competition from low-paid Chinese factory
employees.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; `A Grave Mistake'
</P>
<P>
   ``The fevered rush to admit China to the WTO is a grave
mistake,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said in an angry &LR; 
statement. ``The agreement reached this weekend would deal away our
democratic principles and most cherished values, and we will fight
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Pulaski, secretary-treasurer of the California Labor
Federation, said his group would follow the AFL-CIO's lead in
opposing China joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has a bad habit of engaging in prison labor,'' he said.
``That's not what positive economic relations should be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar dissent is likely from European labor leaders, but most
observers expect China's pending talks with the EU to proceed
smoothly. They note that many of the EU's concerns overlap with
those of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else, the agreement marks China's coming of economic
age following 13 years of failed negotiations to join the
135-member WTO. Beijing still must cut separate deals with the
European Union, Canada and other nations, but the U.S. negotiations
were the main stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations hit a brick wall in April when the Clinton
administration gave a cold shoulder to a series of far-reaching
concessions offered by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the president's advisers felt that the political
climate wasn't right for a trade deal with China, which was facing
accusations of having made off with American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while a red-faced Zhu was still trying to explain the
situation to more-conservative elements of his government, NATO
warplanes accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Beijing and Washington went from chilly to
downright frigid, and China took a number of its earlier
concessions off the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   By all reports, Clinton later kicked himself for not having
accepted Zhu's original terms and subsequently became more
personally involved in reopening trade talks with the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   After several go-nowhere meetings between the two sides in
recent months, Barshefsky and her team were dispatched to Beijing
for what most observers believed was a last-ditch effort to get the
negotiations back on track before the WTO summit in Seattle later
this month.

 Banks Get Reprieve on ATM Fee Ban  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked San Francisco's
voter-approved initiative barring banks from charging fees to
noncustomers who use their ATMs.
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker granted the banks' request for
a preliminary injunction, preventing the San Francisco ATM
surcharge ban from taking effect and prohibiting Santa Monica from
enforcing a similar ordinance that became effective last week.
</P>
<P>
   Without the injunction, the San Francisco law would have started
in December, 10 days after the Board of Supervisors certified
results of the November 2 initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that the banks had made a convincing case,
saying: ``The ordinances are likely to be invalidated as pre-empted
by federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America and Wells Fargo Bank said they will restore ATM
service to noncustomers in Santa Monica now that they can levy
surcharges again. The two banks stopped letting anyone but account
holders use their 33 cash machines Thursday when that city's fee
ban took effect.
</P>
<P>
   BofA had said it would also cut off noncustomers in San
Francisco if the surcharge ban were enforced, a move that could
have made it more difficult for tourists and people visiting on
business to get cash. The court order blocking the ban removes that
threat.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Long Court Battle Foreseen
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is the first step in what is expected to be a long
courtroom fight over the legality of the anti-surcharge measures.
Banks argue that federal law gives U.S. bank regulators sole
authority over the fee practices of nationally chartered banks,
pre-empting local law.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for San Francisco and Santa Monica say the federal law
governing ATMs _ the Electronic Funds Transfer Act _ specifically
gives states and localities the right to enact ATM consumer
protections.
</P>
<P>
   If the banks win the case, San Francisco's law would apply only
to a handful of ATMs operated by state-chartered financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts in the Northeast and Midwest, ruling on
ATM surcharge bans set by Connecticut and Iowa, have issued
contradictory opinions on the authority of state banking regulators
to ban ATM surcharges. Both cases avoided direct rulings on the
bans, which currently stand in both states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is a mess and needs to be clarified,'' said David
Bartone, a Washington, D.C., attorney specializing in ATM law.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since San Francisco voters approved Proposition
F, outlawing ATM surcharges, the matter has moved to the front
burner politically as well as legally. New York City, New Orleans,
Los Angeles and about a dozen other cities across the nation are
considering similar ATM surcharge bans, and banks are preparing to
oppose the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The banks filed suit to block the San Francisco and Santa Monica
laws the day after the San Francisco election.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Cutoff Called Scare Tactic
</P>
<P>
   Surcharge foes say the lawsuit and ATM cutoff of noncustomers
are designed to intimidate other states and localities that are
considering surcharge bans. ``They are attempting to scare off
other cities,'' said Stacy Mitchell, a banking specialist with the
Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Fee critics also say that Bank of America's threat to stop
letting noncustomers use its ATMs in San Francisco may be a bluff.
That is because rules set by switching systems linking the cash
machines of different institutions, such as Visa's Plus and
MasterCard's Cirrus systems, limit the ability of a member bank to
take its ATMs out of the networks.
</P>
<P>
   The banks say they are defending their right to charge a
reasonable fee for a service to noncustomers. Any moves to limit
ATM use to their own customers would be within the rules, they say.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is one of two fees that customers typically pay when
they use a cash machine not belonging to their regular bank, thrift
or credit union.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the fee a financial institution charges its own
customers for using an outside ATM, typically $2 in California. The
second is the ATM surcharge that the outside ATM owner levies on
noncustomers who use its cash machines, typically $1.50 in the
state. The second fee is banned under the San Francisco and Santa
Monica laws.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco voters approved Proposition F by a 2-to-1 ratio.
Santa Monica's City Council enacted its ban on October 12. The two
cities are the first in the country to ban ATM surcharges by
referendum or legislation.

CHINA, U.S. SIGN TRADE PACT

   LOS ANGELES -- Southern California's economy will see
significant long-term gains from Monday's breakthrough U.S.-China
trade agreement, trade experts said, but they cautioned that
improvements will be gradual.
</P>
<P>
   The deal calls for Beijing to slash tariffs and other trade
barriers that now keep U.S. products away from China's 1.3 billion
consumers. In exchange, the United States will support China's
membership in the World Trade Organization, the 135-member
Geneva-based organization that sets the rules for global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce applauded
the deal; labor unions and industries that will have to compete
against inexpensive Chinese imports denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to say that this agreement is a step in the right
direction, but it's also just a start,'' said Jack Kyser, economist
with the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. ``We'll have to see
how it works in reality because China is not your typical
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, for one, achieved a notable victory as the number of
American films allowed into China _ legally _ will double annually
to 20.
</P>
<P>
   Economists were quick to note that the deal does not
specifically address China's widespread intellectual piracy, which
results in hundreds of American films flooding the market each year
via pirated videotapes. ``That's a very important issue to the
motion picture and computer businesses,'' said California
Department of Finance economist Ted Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, even though Chinese consumers have shown an appetite
for U.S. films, the market remains undeveloped, with modest numbers
of movie houses and taxes of more than 50 percent. Additionally,
authorities have barred American movies for parts of this year
during the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of
communist China and during the aftermath of the U.S. bombing of the
Chinese embassy in May during the military campaign against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment industry's lobbying arm, the Motion Picture
Association, has estimated that pirated videos, videodiscs and TV
programs in China generated an estimated $120 million in losses for
U.S. studios last year. But MPA chief Jack Valenti issued a
positively worded statement Monday that called the agreement
heartening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are joyful that our friends in China have recognized the
worth of American films in their country,'' Valenti said. ``We are
looking forward to working with China Films so that the American
films that enter are given the widest distribution. This bodes well
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Walt Disney Co., which has made the most
aggressive move into China with its recent deal to build a theme
park in Hong Kong, also endorsed the deal. ``We think it's great
that we will have more opportunities to exhibit our films in
China,'' said spokeswoman Christine Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said Southern California companies that could see
long-term gains from the pact include those in entertainment,
financial services, money management, health services, biomedical
and professional services such as engineering and aerospace. ``I'd
say the agreement is being greeted with relief and some
skepticism,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached after 13 years of talks, requires China
to cut tariffs an average of 23 percent and promises greater access
to U.S. banks, insurers and telecommunications firms. The pact will
not take effect until China gains entry to the WTO, and most of it
will be phased in over five years or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will probably see increases in port traffic across the
board as trade restrictions are lifted,'' said Gordon Palmer,
manager of master planning for the port of Long Beach. ``It means
that West Coast ports are probably going to continue to be busy.''
</P>
<P>
   China already generates the largest cargo volume of any nation
at Long Beach, with $12 billion in imports and exports during the
first half of this year, up 14 percent over the same period last
year. The largest components are electrical machinery at $1.9
billion, footwear at $1.7 billion and other machinery at $1.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, noting that economists expect China's cargo volume to
grow by 6 percent annually, also said the deal is likely to spur
further development of new Chinese ports beyond the mainstay
locations at Hong Kong and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   The trade agreement was announced two weeks after Disney sealed
its deal with Hong Kong for a theme park that will open in 2005.
Entertainment analyst Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co. said
Monday the new pact could help keep the Disney deal on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of improvement in the U.S.-China relationship would
only act to improve the relationship between U.S companies and
China,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister also said the agreement will add to the likelihood of
Universal going forward with rumored plans to open a theme park in
China.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Quick, name the Division I university outside of
Los Angeles with the most L.A.-area football players. If you're
stumped, don't take it too hard because Justin Mobley, Joe Manning,
Tyler Fenwick and Jake Farrell _ who all guessed Arizona _ were
wrong, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a Pac-10 school. Nor is it an independent or a member
of the Big Ten, SEC, ACC, Big East or Big West.
</P>
<P>
   It's the school the four former area standouts attend, the
University of New Mexico, which plays in the Mountain West
Conference, in Albuquerque. Heading into Saturday's game at
Wyoming, New Mexico is 3-6, 2-3 in the conference. A three-game
losing streak has ended any chance at a winning record and bowl
bid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seven area players, head coach Rocky Long was at
UCLA and assistant coach Jim Fenwick _ who recruited most of the
seven _ coached at Valley College and Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Albuquerque isn't the first place you'd consider looking for
numerous transplanted Angelenos. It's biggest claim to fame might
be Bugs Bunny's punch line: ``I knew I should have made that left
turn at Albuquerque.''
</P>
<P>
   The area players _ Mobley (Antelope Valley Christian), Manning
(AV), Fenwick (Chaminade), Farrell (Newbury Park), Ted Iacenda
(Hart) James Pritchett (Hart) and Quincy Wright (El Camino Real) _
agree life is different in the nation's 36th largest city.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it takes just 20 minutes to drive out of town, and a
traffic jam that lasts 10 minutes is considered major. Also, there
aren't as many malls, clubs, restaurants, movie theaters or other
diversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even compare it,'' Wright said. ``L.A. is upbeat, up
to date. Albuquerque is slow, dry. I'm used to action and it's dead
out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the players enjoy the clean air, the changing seasons, the
new football complex and playing in front of 33,000 fans. Also, the
players agree, having so many Angelenos helps cut down on
homesickness.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lobos' impressive sports amenities don't hurt
either. The complex includes a 10,000-square-foot weight room,
which Farrell said is nicer than UCLA's.
</P>
<P>
   The training facilities have 30 tables and 60 trainers, plus a
full-time doctor. Every position has its own meeting room _ ``That
blows me away,'' Farrell said _ and there are larger rooms for the
offense, defense and entire team.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a player's lounge, complete with leather sofas,
big-screen TVs and soda machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facilitiesare a big part of where you want to go,'' Farrell
said. ``That's a big seller for me. It's clean. That's where you
spend all your time.''
</P>
<P>
   The complex was one reason Jim Fenwick was able to recruit so
many area players. Even without the help, though, Fenwick's role
can't be understated. With his Southern California roots, it's no
surprise he has assembled a corps of skill players from the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of me knowing the area and feeling comfortable
with it,'' Fenwick said. ``It's good football or we wouldn't
recruit it. I'll always be in Southern California. I know the high
schools and junior colleges and can feel and know when they're up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he gets a recruit, Fenwick shows him the city, points out
how the Lobos are the only game in town, mentions how the climate
isn't much different than back home (except for the snow), and
walks them through the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids come here and feel like they're in a special program,''
Fenwick said.
</P>
<P>
   The players enjoyed widespread media attention in high school,
but it's an even bigger deal here. Newspaper and television
reporters are at every practice. Tyler Fenwick says fans write
letters suggesting plays. Mobley told of a time someone called into
Long's radio show and announced Mobley had been sleeping in a
two-hour lecture class.
</P>
<P>
   The players are often asked to make appearances at charities and
schools. Once, Farrell had lunchwith the best students at an
elementary school, where he was considered a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's also a down side. The media played up an
incident last summer, when a walk-on from Albuquerque was arrested
for making fake IDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all over the TV. It was all over the newspapers,''
Farrell said. ``They arrested him when he was working out in the
locker room. A TV crew followed the police in. . . . If we do
anything wrong, it's splashed all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question, why would someone like Iacenda want to
move into this fishbowl? Because he could get a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   After being arrested and later cleared of sexual assault while
at USC, Iacenda wanted out, but the Trojans were slow in granting
him a waiver to transfer. Fenwick waited it out and got Iacenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so grateful,'' Iacenda said. ``He's the man. I owe
everything to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The media also has been positive, portraying Iacenda as a man
wronged by a woman's false claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nice people,'' Iacenda said. ``There's so much support
for the New Mexico program. They die Lobo red.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE NEW MEXICO SEVEN &QL; 
A look at L.A.-area football players at New Mexico: &QL; 
__ Jake Farrell: WR _ 8 games, 3 catches, 54 yards, 1 TD &QL; 
Has seen between 12-15 plays each game. Likes the Native
American/Southwestern styles but finds the campus too homogeneous.
Dismisses the Albuquerque Dukes baseball team, saying,``No one goes
to Dukes games. The stadium _ it's so old and desolate. The Dukes,
it's pretty depressing. They lose all the time.'' &QL; 
__ Tyler Fenwick: WR _ 9 games, 2 catches, 8 yards &QL; 
Plays as much as 25 downs a game. Really misses the various
fast-food hamburger restaurants that L.A. has, especially Carl's
Jr. ``That hurts. When we played San Diego State, all the
California guys say we've got to go to Carl's Jr.'' &QL; 
__ Ted Iacenda: RB/WR _ 9 games, 20 catches, 199 yards, 1 TD. Also
18 rushes for 78 yards. &QL; 
Has started twice. His only complaint about Albuquerque? The cold
winters. ``They're brutal.'' Says the adjustment wasn't difficult
because he considers his hometown of Santa Clarita to be a smaller
version of Albuquerque. &QL; 
__ Joe Manning: WR _ 7 games, 11 catches, 98 yards. Also 17 punt
returns for 87 yards and 2 kickoff returns for 54 yards. &QL; 
Coaches didn't know what to do with him after a horrible spring.
But he worked hard in the offseason and convinced the coaching
staff to play him. Has seen as many as 40 downs a game. &QL; 
__ Justin Mobley: QB _ 7 games, 9 of 23 passing, 88 yards, 1 TD, 3
INTs. Also 19 rushes for 89 yards and plays on special teams. &QL; 
Went to New Mexico because coaches promised him a chance to throw
the ball (other schools wanted him to play defense). His one
touchdown was to Farrell, but he hasn't played quarterback in the
last five games. &QL; 
__ James Pritchett: WR _ Redshirting. &QL; 
Is Iacenda's roommate. He hurt his chances when he pulled a quad
muscle during rookie camp. ``It set me back really far. I'll have
to wait 'till spring.'' &QL; 
__ Quincy Wright: RB _ 9 games, 5 rushes, 96 yards. &QL; 
Primarily plays on special teams. Since he's from South Central
L.A., he often gets asked if he was there during the riots and if
he was scared (he was and he was). Suffered homesickness the first
month, but placing pictures around his room made him feel better. &QL;

IN BEIJING, TRADE PACT ELICITS JOY, CAUTION, INDIFFERENCE

<P>
   BEIJING _ Many Chinese were pinching themselves Monday
afternoon, filled with disbelief that, after more than a decade of
false starts, China had actually taken the plunge into the
international economy, signing a landmark trade agreement with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   On a chilly gray afternoon in Beijing, many people were
ebullient when they first heard the news. For most people, it
raised the prospect of new opportunities to make money as well as
new chances to consume. The agreement drops many current
restrictions on trade and investment and reduces import taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's signed?'' said Li Dayong, 29, who works for an American
pharmaceutical firm. ``That's great! I'm thrilled! We've been
wanting this for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some took a macro view, welcoming the treaty as a sign of bigger
things: China's new economic muscle, an immutable commitment to
further economic reform and a renewal of relations with the United
States, which had been ravaged by the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in May.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijingers also seemed keenly aware that there will be
individual winners and losers along China's new path. Most are
paying careful attention to the micro view, calculating what the
trade agreement _ which is widely expected to lead to World Trade
Organization membership _ means for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news. I had planned to change my Daewoo for a
better car soon and now I'll buy an imported American one,'' said
Xu Yiang, a stock investor, referring to the Korean car he now
owns.
</P>
<P>
   Xu said he also plans to change his investment strategy, buying
telecommunications stocks that he deems likely to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
   But Luan Wenqiang, a worker at Beijing Light Truck Co.,
predicted that the agreement would drive him out of his already
tenuous job. ``Our factory is already in bad shape,'' he said.
``Most workers are on leave and are called back only when there is
work to do. This will open China to better and cheaper U.S. trucks.
I don't believe we will survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, duties on imported vehicles will drop
dramatically, from the current rate of 80 percent to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, duties on imported vehicles will drop
dramatically, from the current rate of more than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the hundreds of millions of Chinese who farm the land or
work as low-wage laborers in small cities and towns, Monday's
triumphant treaty was a big bang in another universe _ although
many will probably feel its effects.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen migrant workers interviewed in Beijing said they
had never heard of the trade organization, which has had only
fleeting recent mention in the press despite the frantic
negotiations here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to do with my life,'' said a middle-aged man, a
worker in a small machine factory, strapping a huge box of cabbage
to the back of an ancient bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The new treaty will certainly bring both new investment and
intense competition to China and the outcome will vary from
industry to industry. But many corporate leaders seemed to relish
the challenge of being able to compete in the world arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy to hear about this,'' said Duan Yongji,
the chairman of China's giant Stone Group, a technology company.
``Everyone knows that entry will make the country more open and
that will bring more competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we shouldn't need a greenhouse to protect us. And we also
hope that entry will open more opportunities for collaboration and
cooperation between Chinese and foreign companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Duan added that, at a personal level, he was relieved to hear
the government renew its vows, so to speak, to principles like
economic overhaul and engagement with the West. The Chinese
government has often appeared lukewarm on such concepts.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing's business districts, many owners of small businesses
likewise focused more on the opportunities of Monday's deal than
its risks.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign companies have opened offices here in the last five
years _ even though their activities were extremely circumscribed
by Chinese law _ gambling that this huge economy would one day
open. On Monday, people dared to imagine the payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Li Dayong, an American drug company employee, said that until
now his company had not been able to import many of its medicines
to China. ``Now I think it should become easier to bring foreign
medical products in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dai Liming, 35, well dressed in a sweater vest and suit, saw
only possibilities when he heard the news. Dai, who works as a
representative for a domestic trading company, predicted that ``the
deal will bring my company new opportunities for foreign trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But others offered more sober assessments, noting that many of
China's service industries _ from insurance to the Internet to
personal banking _ are young and ill prepared to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already facing fierce competition from foreign
companies in some areas and if further concessions are made in the
insurance sector we'll be facing a grimmer future,'' said Lu
Youquan, manager of Antai Life Insurance Co. in Shanghai. ``Their
management is more efficient and their marketing skills more
aggressive. Nineteen ninety-nine has already been a bad year for us
_ we're losing clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lu said that he holds out hope that membership in the
World Trade Organization might give the economy a boost, and that
his company's business might improve despite the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this makes the cake larger,'' he said. ``If it does,
then everyone _including us _ can have a larger share.''

 &HT;    Answer wife, judge tells Gingrich
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Cobb County judge tersely ordered Newt Gingrich
Monday to answer all of his estranged wife's questions about his
money and extramarital love life, or else.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson gave the former U.S. House
speaker 20 days, or until Dec. 6, to ``fully and completely''
answer 32 questions, some of them potentially embarrassing, that
his wife has asked in their divorce. The questions include one that
asks Gingrich to name any lovers he's taken during his 18-year
marriage to his wife, Marianne, 48.
</P>
<P>
   In her short, two-page ruling, Robinson said she will wait to
see if Gingrich, 56, complies with her 20-day deadline before
deciding whether to sanction him for not answering the questions,
which his wife posed three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to answer them all,'' said Gingrich's attorney,
Randy Evans, following the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson rejected Gingrich's argument that the multiple-part
questions actually amounted to more than the 50 allowed by state
law.
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson agreed that many of the interrogatories
represented two or more questions, she still counted a total of
just 49.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also must answer this question that Evans previously
has called silly: ``Do you believe that that you have conducted
your private life in this marriage in accordance with the concept
of `family values' you have espoused politically and
professionally?''
</P>
<P>
   John Mayoue, attorney for Marianne Gingrich, said he was
``enormously pleased'' with the ruling. ``It's disturbing that it
takes a court order to require Mr. Gingrich to fully and completely
answer questions under oath,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich's attorney said he and his client had to take the
issue to the judge. ``If you don't do that, then you've waived the
rule and they just keep asking more and more and that defeats the
purpose of the rule,'' Evans said. He pointed out that Marianne
Gingrich now has just one question left.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's ruling Monday ended one of several bitter disputes
that have marked the case since Gingrich filed for divorce in July.
A second order she issued Monday may end another.
</P>
<P>
   The judge gave the Gingriches until Nov. 29 to comply with a
temporary agreement they voluntarily drafted in September. The
agreement requires the couple to put all of their assets into a
joint account until their divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches have been fighting over whether Marianne Gingrich
has placed all the money she controls into the account. Both sides
asked the judge to step in.
</P>
<P>
   And a third dispute should be put to rest next week when a
Washington judge decides when Callista Bisek, the congressional
aide Gingrich admits to having an affair with, will have to answer
questions under oath about the relationship. Bisek, 33, has asked
the judge to toss out Marianne Gingrich's subpoena requiring Bisek
to show for a deposition and bring documents proving the affair.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is set for next Tuesday.

DEAL ON U.N. DUES BREAK AN IMPASSE AND DRAWS CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Restructures to raise 4th graf of background, quotes from
Gore, more on his efforts to distance himself from Clinton; Adds
details on $12.5 million waiver, background on State Department

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fragile deal between the White House and House
Republicans to end a fight over abortion and U.N. dues drew
scathing criticism Monday from abortion rights advocates and
cutting reviews from Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In breaking an impasse that will free nearly $1 billion that the
United States owes the United Nations, both sides claimed victory
Monday in an issue that could undermine American global leadership
and a year-end budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal still has a few crucial loose ends, like the timing
of the repayment of the back dues and a dispute over debt relief to
the world's most impoverished nations. Until the agreement is
complete, the long-term impact of the measure remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the compromise appears to pave the way to end a
long-running dispute that has threatened to strip the United States
of its vote in the U.N. General Assembly unless it pays before Dec.
31. The seat and vote in the Security Council are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism from Bradley and Gore underscored Gore's desire to
avoid giving his Democratic rival any opening to exploit on a
white-hot domestic issue. As Gore's presidential campaign goes on,
he has been more willing to take positions that diverge from
President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to employees at Microsoft in Seattle on Monday, Gore
would not directly answer whether he supported the deal, but did
say that he opposed ``bargaining away any critical policy aspect of
a women's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Gore adviser said the vice president had expressed
``strong reservations'' about the deal, and while heaping most of
the blame on Republicans, said Gore ``opposed what the White House
ended up doing''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has tried to distance himself from Clinton on the
issue of his personal conduct, this position is probably the one in
which he most distanced himself from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under a compromise struck late Sunday, a ban on U.S. financing
to international organizations that promote abortion rights would
be written into law. The deal is a triumph for House conservatives
led by Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., who for three years has
insisted on tying the payment of the U.N. dues to the funding ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton could waive the ban if he pays a $12.5 million
penalty, to be subtracted from the $385 million that a State
Department agency, the Agency for International Development, awards
to family planning groups abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The $12.5 million, just over 3 percent of the total, and down
from the initial demand by Republicans of $100 million, would go to
a separate children's health fund, also administered by the Agency
for International Development. If the deal is completed, Clinton is
expected to invoke such a waiver. The $385 million is what Smith
and his colleagues had sought to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton invokes the waiver, the agreement caps at $15 million
the total amount of money that the United States would give to
organizations that perform abortions or advocate family planning
measures. Administration officials said it was unlikely the cap
would be met and health services would be only minimally affected.
But abortion-rights supporters said the provision would have a
chilling effect on family-planning activities overseas, from
sponsoring conferences to publishing safe-sex pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has aggressively
lobbied Clinton to repay Washington's U.N. debt and volunteered to
be the lightning rod for criticism from abortion-rights groups,
defended the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement that I hope will come out will not interfere
with family planning around the world and that it will have minimal
effect,'' Albright told reporters traveling with Clinton in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates denounced the deal as a sell-out to
appease a small band of Republicans, and claimed that the
deal &UR;  &LR; would endanger the lives of women in developing countries who
rely on the help of international family planning groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's lives have once again been sacrificed for political
expediency,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, which uses less than 1 percent of its funds
for abortion services.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., who telephoned the White House
chief of staff, John Podesta, to demand a meeting on Tuesday, said,
``Administration negotiators paid an unjustifiable, high-cost
ransom to a small number of extreme-right, anti-choice lawmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agency for International Development says that family
planning programs, which it oversees, have helped prevent
unintended pregnancies in more than 70 countries, and have
increased the use of contraceptives in those countries from 10
percent in those countries 34 years ago currently to 40 percent
now.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats expressed pessimism about reaching a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I get into the details, the more difficult it is to
resolve,'' said Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ``We've got too
much talking on camera, including by the secretary of state.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue exploded on the campaign trail Monday as a potentially
divisive issue between the two Democratic presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Bradley, Kristen Ludecke, said the former New
Jersey senator opposed the tentative deal and cited his remarks on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not support it if I was there,'' Bradley said on CNN's
``Late Edition.'' ``A woman's right to choose is absolutely
essential, and I think family planning for the rest of the world,
if we wanted to provide it, should be permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives expressed cautious optimism that they had
won their biggest victory on the issue since Clinton rescinded a
1984 executive order by President Ronald Reagan that denied grants
to international organizations for any purpose if they promoted
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has barred direct financing for abortions
since 1973, but Reagan advanced that policy by adopting what has
become known as ``Mexico City'' because he announced the executive
order during a U.N. conference there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as close as we've been to reinstating the language of
Mexico City since Bill Clinton became president,'' said Michele
Davis, a spokeswoman for Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican presidential front-runner, said Bush ``would support
reinstating the executive order banning the use of taxpayer money
to promote abortions in foreign countries.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is tied to a separate bill that would authorize
the State Department to pay the $926 million debt to the United
Nations over three years. The first installment from that bill,
combined with money from a second spending bill that covers the
costs of the Commerce, State and Justice departments, would be
enough to prevent Washington from losing its General Assembly vote,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. foreign policy is on a little firmer ground with this
news,'' said Linda S. Jamison, executive director of the Emergency
Coalition for U.S. Financial Support of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Clinton's key Senate allies, Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
the Democratic leader, and Joseph R. Biden, the senior Democrat on
the Foreign Relations Committee, also voiced support for the deal.
``Somebody has to give, and there is give here on both sides,''
said Daschle. ``It's a pretty good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In defending the deal, administration officials said they could
shield international groups from financial cuts by defining which
organizations are affected and how lobbying for abortions rights is
defined.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they said the deal expires after a year, when all
sides agreed the fight would be joined again, but this time without
the huge U.N. debt hanging over the White House's head.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters were not placated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This not a compromise,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the
National Abortion Rights Reproductive League. ``This is
capitulation.''

 &HT;    Lady Dogs dodge upset bid by UAB

<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Being near the top of the national rankings is no
good place to be at the start of the season, as the Georgia women
found out Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3-ranked Lady Bulldogs looked sloppy but hung on against
a gritty Alabama-Birmingham team for a 76-75 win in the first round
of the Women's Preseason NIT at Stegeman Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which moved up two spots in the polls before ever
playing a game because of losses by Tennessee and Rutgers on
Sunday, almost fell into their company.
</P>
<P>
   Junior guard Kelly Miller was shut out most of the first half
but led Georgia in scoring with 22 points. Coco Miller scored 17
and Tawana McDonald 11 for the Lady Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   For Alabama-Birmingham, forward Deanna Jackson led the way with
28 points and Mia Thrash had 14.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Georgia plays at No. 17 Virginia Tech, a 60-45
winner over Liberty, in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   In a ragged display, as season openers tend to be, the Blazers
were not daunted by facing the highest-ranked team in the 16-team
NIT field.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 35 minutes, UAB dictated the tempo, while Georgia
was erratic defensively and couldn't get into the running game it
likes.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had an answer every time Georgia came close. The
Lady Dogs took their first lead of the second half with 7:57 to
play when Kelly Miller stole the ball from Sally Jeter while
applying pressure on an inbounds play and put in a layup for a
59-58 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until the final minutes that Georgia was able to
add to its lead. The Millers hit consecutive jumpers from the
perimeter for a 71-67 lead at the 2:34 mark, but Thrash halved the
gap with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Then UAB's Holly Holland shot an air ball, and Georgia's Deana
Nolan was fouled on the rebound. She made one of two shots, and
Kelly Miller made two more from the line for a 74-69 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson came back and hit two 3-point baskets in the final
seconds, including the last points of the game, but Georgia made
five of six free throws.
</P>
<P>
   From the earliest moments of the game, Georgia had trouble
solving Alabama-Birmingham's matchup zone or countering the
transition game, and trailed 35-33 at the intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Miller scored her first four points of the game on buckets
in the final 1:21, but Thrash sank a trey at the buzzer for the
Blazers.

IT'S NO USE TRYING TO HERD BAPTISTS

<P>
   Reading about the Texas Baptists meeting in El Paso, Texas,
recently, I was reminded of a favorite Will Rogers quote: ``I
belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I feel that way: I belong to no organized
denomination. I am a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   I like it like that.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite joke among those few who actually worry about things
like the Texas Constitution is that after Reconstruction, Texans
distrusted government so much that they deliberately designed one
that wouldn't work. The framers could have been taking their cues
from the Baptists, especially Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   If you think I overstate, please consider the most recent flap
among Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Southern Baptist Commission adopted the Baptist
Faith and Message Statement. The statement outlines the basic set
of beliefs that Baptists hold and is similar to those of many other
denominations. The Baptist statement says Jesus was born of a
virgin, died for our sins and was bodily resurrected and that the
Bible is an infallible guide.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say that the Southern Baptist Convention is locked in
a fundamentalist-vs.-liberal fight. That's not true. There are no
liberal Baptists, at least religiously.
</P>
<P>
   The most you can be is moderate, and most moderates in the
convention easily supported the 1963 statement. But when the
convention amended it in 1998 to ask Christian wives ``to submit
graciously to the servant leadership of their husbands,''
controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment begins: ``The husband and wife are of equal worth
before God, since both are created in God's image. ... A husband is
to love his wife even as Christ loved the church.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But then the amendment said: ``A wife is to
submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband
even as the church willingly submits itself to the headship of
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usual in religious arguments, people on all sides of this
issue quote Scripture to support their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work here. The Rev. Charles Wade of
Arlington said that the El Paso decision to stick with the 1963
wording without the amendment dealing with the role of wives sends
a message that Texas Baptists do not want to see radical changes in
the central statement of Southern Baptist beliefs. The national
convention recently appointed a committee to rewrite the entire
Baptist statement of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the decision in Texas _ somewhat of a maverick state
convention among Southern Baptists these days _ was immediate from
the more conservative leaders of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a poor Baptist to do when faced with obviously
conflicting opinions among the leaders of the denomination?
</P>
<P>
   The same thing that Baptists have done for most of their
history. They are supposed to figure it out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A treasured Baptist belief is in the ``priesthood of the
believer,'' the concept that every Baptist everywhere is ultimately
responsible for his or her relationship with God.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists are to read the Scripture, educate themselves about the
issues, and listen to their scholars and their pastors. And after
prayer, they are supposed to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wonders of being a Baptist is that there is no
national or worldwide organization _ only cooperative associations.
The power in Baptist circles is vested in the local church and,
beyond that, in the individual believer.
</P>
<P>
   People commenting on the difficulty of getting a group of
independent thinkers to do anything together sometimes say it's
like trying to herd cats. You could substitute ``herd Baptists''
and have the same image.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, it doesn't much matter what the Southern Baptist
Convention does _ or, for that matter, the Baptist General
Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What Baptists believe is going to be settled in local churches
and by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to bet, I'd bet on Baptist women. They already do most
of the church work anyway. To which we men usually graciously
submit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government officials said Monday evening that the
National Transportation Safety Board was considering asking the FBI
to take over the case of EgyptAir 990, after a review of the
plane's cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were focusing on a cryptic utterance,
possibly a prayer. They said there were many questions about
exactly what was said and what it meant, but they were concerned
that the statement might be the last words of a pilot determined to
destroy himself and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in the Atlantic, near Nantucket Island, Mass.,
two weeks ago, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not characterize the words beyond saying that
they may have been a prayer. The crew's conversations, other than
uneventful ones with air traffic controllers, were in Arabic and
senior officials of the safety board said that even with the aid of
additional interpreters brought in Monday, they did not understand
what was being said on the tape. The problems were ones of
language, culture and hearing what people said in a noisy cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation investigators also stressed that they had not yet
synchronized the voice tape with the flight data recorder tape,
which would record events occurring on the airplane and could put
the statements in context. For instance, a prayer being said after
the plane began plummeting so fast that passengers were rendered
weightless would not be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior law enforcement official said Monday night he
believed that the tape showed that after one of the two pilots left
the cockpit, another crew member made the suspicious utterance.
Only after that, the law-enforcement official said, was the
autopilot disengaged, seconds before the plane began its fatal
plunge. That sequence of events cast suspicion on the crew member,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has supreme authority over transportation
accidents, and guards that role jealously, but the FBI, which
usually assists the board, takes over if the two agencies decide
that there was evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the safety board, Jim Hall, at a news conference
Monday afternoon, said, ``We are concentrating our efforts on
determining from the evidence, including the cockpit voice
recorder, whether or not this investigation is to remain under the
leadership of the NTSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify why he was focusing on whether the crash was
properly within his agency's jurisdiction, Hall simply reread his
statement about leadership of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the safety board proposed
stepping aside Monday afternoon, and taking a subordinate role
assisting the FBI, but FBI officials said they first wanted to
study the tape more.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which had one agent sitting in with safety board
officials on Sunday to listen to the tape, sent more Monday
evening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The board is often eager to extricate itself from crashes that
are not caused by mechanical failures or human error; most
recently, it gave the FBI jurisdiction over the derailment of an
Amtrak train in October 1995, near Hyder, Ariz., that was
determined to have been caused by someone sabotaging the tracks. It
has also turned over two aircraft incidents, in which disgruntled
airline employees came into the cockpit and attacked the pilots
flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   And board officials say they have a full agenda of work,
including the TWA 800 crash three years ago, which many initially
suspected was sabotage but is now believed to have been caused by
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say how many voices were heard on the tape.
The cockpit requires a crew of two, and has two seats where
observers, trainees or company employees along for the ride can
sit.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 10-year-old Boeing 767, was cruising at 33,000 feet
about half an hour out of Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31
when the autopilot disengaged, either by itself or by the action of
a pilot. Then the plane flew steadily for a few more seconds, and
went into an extremely steep dive. During the dive, someone turned
off the engines.
</P>
<P>
   After descending about 3 miles, the plane pitched up, subjecting
everyone inside to two and a half times normal gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Then it turned downward again and apparently broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Monday evening, ``I am well aware of the many rumors,
theories, and stories circulating in the last 72 hours _ indeed, in
the last two weeks _ about potential causes of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the board and elsewhere were uncertain about
what they had. A U.S. intelligence official said Monday night that
the CIA still has no evidence indicating terrorist activity in
connection with the crash. The official said that the CIA has
translators listening to the tape, but is still not certain of the
significance of the utterances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An American pilot with long experience in crash investigations
run by the safety board suggested that the board's next steps could
include interviews and even cultural study, as opposed to technical
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the New York
office, said, ``as far as the FBI is concerned, we're doing the
same things today that we've been doing for the past two weeks. But
we all agree _ FBI, NTSB an the rest of the parties _ that the tape
recordings need to be further analyzed before people can reach
certain conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh met with Hall to discuss the
progress of the case and the possibility that the bureau might take
over the inquiry. In part, senior officials are worried over how to
pay for what could be a long and costly investigation, if it is
necessary to retrieve large sections of the aircraft from the
seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said the bureau might tap the
government's Counterterrorism Fund, a reserve of several million
dollars that is managed by the Justice Department.

IT'S NO USE TRYING TO HERD BAPTISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading about the Texas Baptists meeting in El Paso, Texas,
recently, I was reminded of a favorite Will Rogers quote: ``I
belong to no organized party. I am a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I feel that way: I belong to no organized
denomination. I am a Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   I like it like that.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite joke among those few who actually worry about things
like the Texas Constitution is that after Reconstruction, Texans
distrusted government so much that they deliberately designed one
that wouldn't work. The framers could have been taking their cues
from the Baptists, especially Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   If you think I overstate, please consider the most recent flap
among Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Southern Baptist Commission adopted the Baptist
Faith and Message Statement. The statement outlines the basic set
of beliefs that Baptists hold and is similar to those of many other
denominations. The Baptist statement says Jesus was born of a
virgin, died for our sins and was bodily resurrected and that the
Bible is an infallible guide.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say that the Southern Baptist Convention is locked in
a fundamentalist-vs.-liberal fight. That's not true. There are no
liberal Baptists, at least religiously.
</P>
<P>
   The most you can be is moderate, and most moderates in the
convention easily supported the 1963 statement. But when the
convention amended it in 1998 to ask Christian wives ``to submit
graciously to the servant leadership of their husbands,''
controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment begins: ``The husband and wife are of equal worth
before God, since both are created in God's image. ... A husband is
to love his wife even as Christ loved the church.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But then the amendment said: ``A wife is to
submit herself graciously to the servant leadership of her husband
even as the church willingly submits itself to the headship of
Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usual in religious arguments, people on all sides of this
issue quote Scripture to support their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more at work here. The Rev. Charles Wade of
Arlington said that the El Paso decision to stick with the 1963
wording without the amendment dealing with the role of wives sends
a message that Texas Baptists do not want to see radical changes in
the central statement of Southern Baptist beliefs. The national
convention recently appointed a committee to rewrite the entire
Baptist statement of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the decision in Texas _ somewhat of a maverick state
convention among Southern Baptists these days _ was immediate from
the more conservative leaders of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a poor Baptist to do when faced with obviously
conflicting opinions among the leaders of the denomination?
</P>
<P>
   The same thing that Baptists have done for most of their
history. They are supposed to figure it out for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A treasured Baptist belief is in the ``priesthood of the
believer,'' the concept that every Baptist everywhere is ultimately
responsible for his or her relationship with God.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists are to read the Scripture, educate themselves about the
issues, and listen to their scholars and their pastors. And after
prayer, they are supposed to make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One of the wonders of being a Baptist is that there is no
national or worldwide organization _ only cooperative associations.
The power in Baptist circles is vested in the local church and,
beyond that, in the individual believer.
</P>
<P>
   People commenting on the difficulty of getting a group of
independent thinkers to do anything together sometimes say it's
like trying to herd cats. You could substitute ``herd Baptists''
and have the same image.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, it doesn't much matter what the Southern Baptist
Convention does _ or, for that matter, the Baptist General
Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What Baptists believe is going to be settled in local churches
and by individuals.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to bet, I'd bet on Baptist women. They already do most
of the church work anyway. To which we men usually graciously
submit.

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``MY MOVIE BUSINESS'' &QL; 
By John Irving (Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New &AMP; Notable has had occasion to talk with a
number of good writers whose books have been made into movies,
including Alice Walker (``The Color Purple''), Michael Ondaatje
(``The English Patient''), Sue Miller (``The Good Mother''),
Russell Banks (``The Sweet Hereafter''), Anna Quindlen (``One True
Thing'') and David Guterson (``Snow Falling on Cedars''). Almost
without exception, the happiest among them were those who had
relinquished control, who recognized from the start that they were
writers of novels, not screenplays. They took the money, handed
over their books and waited to see what came of it. Over the years,
John Irving has chosen a different path. He declined to write the
screenplay for ``The World According to Garp,''but he was involved
enough in the filmmaking process to rankle under the changes that
Steve Tesich made in his novel. He also declined to write the
screenplay for ``The Hotel New Hampshire,'' then watched as Tony
Richardson made a farcical exaggeration of the book. Irving did not
decline to write a screenplay for ``The Cider House Rules.'' In
fact, he wrote many of them, draft after draft for director after
director. Over the course of 13 years, he worked with four
directors and wrote so many versions of the script that he learned
how to do it right. His first draft, written when he still believed
a film should be true to a novel, would have made a nine-hour
movie. The final script whittled a 500-page novel down to 136
pages. By that time, Irving knew that ``a screenplay, as a piece of
writing, is merely the scaffolding for a building someone else is
going to build.'' This memoir of his moviemaking experiences is
unabashedly self-indulgent, a chance for Irving to talk about his
novels, his children and friends, his grandfather (whose work as an
obstetrician influenced the story of ``Cider House'') and his
success. It's also a chance to plug the movie, which is set to open
here next month. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE ART OF THE STORY'' &QL; 
Edited by Daniel Halpern (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This international anthology of contemporary short stories
includes work from 78 contributors from 35 countries. All of the
writers were born from 1938 to 1970 and were chosen by Halpern to
represent a greater sensitivity to popular culture than those
included in his earlier volume, ``The Art of the Tale.'' These
stories, he says, are ``less in `the classical mode' and more
reactive to the media in all its venues. These younger writers have
distanced themselves _ sometimes subtly, sometimes less so _ from
the influential writers practicing during the first two or three
decades of the 20th century.'' Raymond Carver just made the cut, as
did Margaret Atwood, Richard Bausch, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates,
Amos Oz, Kenya's Ngugi Wa Thiong O (EDITORS: how it's listed at
amazon.com ) and Argentina's Luisa Valenzuela. Among the younger
writers are Lorrie Moore, Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, Bobbie Ann
Mason, Tobias Wolff, Barry Hannah, James Kelman, Richard Ford,
Deborah Eisenberg, Banana Yoshimoto, Martin Amis, Turkey's Murathan
Mungan, Ghana's Ama Ata Aidoo and Lebanon's Hanan Al-Shaykh. Also
here are writers from Cuba, Nigeria, Martinique, India, Haiti,
Vietnam, Russia, Hungary, Somalia, Uruguay, France, Tanzania,
Poland, Scandinavia, South Africa and China. &QL; 
``ENCHANTED NIGHT'' &QL; 
By Steven Millhauser (Crown, $17) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the night of revelation. This is the night the dolls
wake. This is the night of the dreamer in the attic. This is the
night of the piper in the woods.'' This passage is a sign of
ethereal things to come. Millhauser, who won a Pulitzer Prize for
``Martin Dressler,'' has written an otherworldly story in brief
passages that portray people in a Connecticut town one hot summer
night. There is Havershaw, a 39-year-old man who lives in the attic
of his mother's house and struggles to find some justification for
his life. There are ``the outlaws,'' a gang of teenage girls who
break into houses and steal unimportant things (refrigerator
magnets, toothbrushes), always leaving behind the same note _ ``We
Are Your Daughters.'' There is Janet Manning, a young woman with
sensuous thoughts of the handsome stranger she met on the beach
that day, and William Cooper, a young man with a crush on a lovely
mannequin in the window of a department store (a mannequin that
will, on this magical night, come to life). And all across town,
the old, forgotten dolls stored in attics begin to wake up and
shake their dusty limbs. Some town, huh? Millhauser's dreamlike
tale _ a mere 109 pages long _ is grounded in the familiar longing
of his characters and played out under a big, white moon on an
enchanted summer night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``FRONTIER CHILDREN'' &QL; 
By Linda Peavy and Ursula Smith (Oklahoma, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was sadder to see than the graves of children who died
along the westward trail as their families traveled with the wagon
trains of the mid-1800s. And nothing was more triumphant than news
of children who made the journey and began a new life. Peavy and
Smith, whose previous collaborations were ``Pioneer Women'' and
``Women in Waiting in the Westward Movement,'' offer a clear-eyed
view of what frontier life was like for youngsters of Chinese,
Hispanic, Native American, African-American and European
backgrounds. Because the experiences of these children were largely
undocumented, the authors have relied on stories handed from one
generation to another, the few existing letters and diaries written
by frontier children, journals kept by explorers and missionaries,
and, most important, photographs. Their text is accompanied by 206
black-and-white images, and some of them will break your heart. &QL;

DAM-BREACHING ALTERNATIVES OFFERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The surest way to resurrect once-prolific Snake River salmon
runs is to punch holes in four dams that have turned a cool,
free-flowing run of the river into a string of warm ponds, says a
panel of scientists appointed by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday federal fisheries managers, facing an intense
campaign of political pressure spearheaded by Sen. Slade Gorton,
are unveiling a series of alternatives to save Snake River salmon
from extinction. But this new menu of choices, while costly and
controversial, might negate the need to breach the four dams in
southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service will be giving the
region's political leaders a list of options to try to save Snake
River salmon. In effect, the message is, ``OK, you decide how to
save these fish.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for the Pacific Northwest, which is under
the gun to save what is arguably its most cherished natural
resource _ salmon. Where once the runs were plentiful, now there is
a 1-in-10 chance some Snake River stocks will go extinct in the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Residents living along a 140-mile stretch of the Snake fear
their already-battered economy will take a fatal drubbing if the
dams are disabled. Breaching the dams would boost electricity costs
and make the river too shallow for barges to ferry their grain to
market, necessitating more-expensive truck or railroad
transporation.
</P>
<P>
   The report is a precursor to a preliminary decision next month
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on whether to disable the dams.
</P>
<P>
   That decision is being widely watched, from New York, where
environmentalists are running full-page newspaper ads, to Alaska,
where the governor labled the dams ``a killing field'' for salmon
that are crucial to his state's fishing fleets.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary list of salmon-saving options being released
Tuesday by National Marine Fisheries Servicecomes with some
difficult choices.
</P>
<P>
   These possibilities include new limits on logging, grazing and
development near the banks of the Snake and its tributaries.
Protecting these stream banks would help keep the Snake's water
clean and cold, as salmon require.
</P>
<P>
   The options also might include reducing Indian tribes' salmon
catch, but that is likely to trigger a new round of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribes already are livid, accusing federal fisheries
managers of hoarding scientific information that is the basis of
Tuesday's report.
</P>
<P>
   The report examines the four broad categories of actions the
region could undertake to help Snake River salmon. The ``four Hs,''
as they were dubbed by fisheries managers, are: hydropower,
hatcheries, habitat and harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams:
</P>
<P>
   By far the most controversial has been hydropower. The four dams
proposed for breaching were built primarily to make the river
deeper, opening it to barge traffic, and to produce electricity.
One also provides irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
   The four dams produce about one-twentieth of the Northwest's
power. Without them, residential electric users in Seattle might
pay an extra $1 or so each month; those in southeast Washington
might see monthly bills rise $4 or $5 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Breaching the dams _ carving holes through their earthen flanks,
leaving the supporting concrete abutments intact _ would help the
fish because they would no longer get chewed up in the dams'
turbines or cut by screens and pipes as they migrate to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as the river's flow increased, salmon no longer would
wander through warm, sluggish pools, making them unhealthy and easy
pickings for predators. With the dams out, they would be more
readily swept out to sea in a cooler, faster-running river. And
they would not face lethal levels of nitrogen infused into the
river when water spills through the dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking purely about biology, about how to bring
back salmon, dam-breaching would in many ways be a no-brainer,
because it clearly returns the river to the way (the fish)
evolved,'' said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the Fisheries
Service. ``But that's a specious argument, because that's not the
way the world is run.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorman denies charges that his agency doesn't have the stomach
to breach the dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dam breaching is as lively and debateable an alternative as it
was a year ago,'' Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not breaching the dams would almost certainly require Idaho
farmers to give up about 325 billion gallons of water each year.
This would probably exacerbate the fight for river water already
being played out between Idaho and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of breaching the dams was considered radical until the
last few years, when a wide-ranging panel of scientists from
federal and state agencies and Indian tribes, among others, called
it a promising solution.
</P>
<P>
   The science group, known as Process for Analyzing and Testing
Hypotheses, or PATH, worked on the problem for about five years. It
said dam-breaching is sure to save fall chinook runs and help save
spring and summer runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, though, the National Marine Fisheries Service
assembled a new team of scientists working exclusively for the
agency. Their conclusions differ somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   The NMFS team agreed with PATH that dam-breaching offers
near-certainty the fall chinook runs would return, said NMFS
biologist Michelle McClure.
</P>
<P>
   But the NMFS team says it would take more than just dam
breaching to revive the spring and summer runs, McClure said.
</P>
<P>
   Barging fingerlings:
</P>
<P>
   Not breaching the dams also means continued use of a technical
fix of unknown value: barging salmon. Some of the young salmon are
gathered up each year, put into boats or trucks and whisked
downstream so they avoid the the fish-killing dams.
</P>
<P>
   Barging was roundly criticized in a recent report by biologists
working for Indian tribes, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
the states of Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The great unknown in this debate is how much barging hurts the
fish. How many, scientists wonder, die after their release because
of the bruising, crowded ride downstream in barges?
</P>
<P>
   The newly assembled NMFS team concluded in the last half-year
that barging isn't as bad for fish as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fish are doing well in barges, it makes (dam) breaching
look less necessary,'' said Rick Iljenfrtiz of the Fisheries
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Non-NFMS scientists disagree.
</P>
<P>
   PATH said improving barging would provide only a 50 percent
assurance the fish would rebound.
</P>
<P>
   And an Oct. 4 report issued by biologists working for Indian
tribes, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the states of Idaho,
Oregon and Washington dissected the NMFS team's scientific
assumptions and concluded its analysis is far too optimistic about
keeping fish alive after barging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize there is uncertainty around this,'' McClure said.
``Our scientists have come up with an estimate that they think is
the best estimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Inland opposition:
</P>
<P>
   Much of the opposition to dam breaching is centered along the
river from the Tri-Cities in Washington to Lewiston, Idaho. Though
Lewiston is hundreds of miles inland, it is a seaport where wheat
and other goods bound for the oceanare loaded on barges for the
trip downriver.
</P>
<P>
   Those barges move grains at less than half the rates charged by
railroads. Already the wheat farmers are struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Not just wheat is affected.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of jobs would disappear as 13 irrigated farms near
Pasco lost their current water supply and Lewiston's biggest
employer, the Potlach Corp., closed because it could no longer
transport paper, pulp and lumber downriver by barge, proponents of
the dams say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not breaching the dams also could cost jobs as federal
officials turned from hydropower to habitat, meaning they would try
instead to improve conditions in the river.
</P>
<P>
   A key assumption here is that more water would be flowed through
the Snake, cooling the river and helping sweep young salmon
seaward. That water would come from a rich belt of Idaho
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   How much water would Idaho farmers have to forego? A figure that
the Bureau of Reclamation has analyzed is another 1 million
acre-feet, or about 325 billion gallons annually. That would mean
nearly one-fifth of Idaho's irrigated farmland _ perhaps as much as
1,000 square miles _ would be at risk, said Lynn Tominaga of the
Idaho Water Users Association.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, timber interests feel they've given enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forest-products industry has already stepped up the plate
in terms of making sure our practices are freshwater- and
fish-friendly _ big time,'' said Chris West of the Northwest
Forestry Association, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and fishermen agree:
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and fishermen, meanwhile, are concerned that
federal fisheries managers are even considering leaving the dams in
place.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that a modest federal investment could help
revitalize Southeastern Washington's economy _ economic aid they
say the hard-hit region needs no matter what happens to the dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers speak for themselves. Where you had viable runs
prior to construction of the dams, immediately after you put the
dams in, you got serious declines in salmon stocks,'' said Steve
Fick, president of Salmon For All, an Astoria, Oregon-based group
of commercial fishermen and processors. If the salmon runs continue
to decline, Fick fears more job losses. He supports helping people
upriver compensate for any job losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want win-win solutions,'' Fick said. But he adds, ``Their
jobs aren't any more important up there than our jobs are down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses catering to recreational anglers are worried, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear you can do all sorts of things and you won't
recover the salmon unless you breach the dams,'' said Liz Hamilton
of the Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association, an organization
of businesses dependent on recreational fishing. Environmentalists
and fishermen cite federal studies showing that while thousands of
jobs would be lost, thousands of jobs also would be created. In the
short run, the job picture looks great. In the first decade or so,
some 24,000 jobs would be created, mostly in construction work in
breaching the dams, building improved highway and rail routes for
grain shipments, and related tasks.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials say , some 6,200 jobs eventually would
vanish , mostly in farming , dam operations and reduced consumer
spending resulting from higher electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   A study this month by environmental groups disputed that
conclusion. Commercial fishing and recreation jobs would rebound,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   And they point out the preliminary federal study failed to count
the benefits of a restored fishery to an important group: Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes:
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are a key part of the dam-breaching equation. They
stopped commercial fishing for spring and summer chinook runs as
their numbers dropped, said Don Sampson, director of the Columbia
River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are still fishing for fall chinook, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the case law behind this. It's saying that
basically, for conservation purposes, tribes can be restricted in
their harvest _ but all other sources of mortality must be
controlled first,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson said he would prefer not to file a lawsuit against the
government for failing to conserve salmon, but ``we have to be
accountable to our people and the salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are solidly in favor of dam breaching because a team
of scientists assembled by the federal government said breaching
the dams provides virtual certainty that fall chinook runs would
recover.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, businesses dependent on the dams are seeing a
glimmer of hope, said Bruce Lovelin of the Columbia River Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is putting more options on the table,''
Lovelin said. ``It's amazing that the federal government is going
through an orderly progression of developing information and
releasing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also are eagerly awaiting the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the economic disruption of both dam removal and doing the
alternative will be clear,'' said Chris Zimmer of Save Our Wild
Salmon. ``There is no free lunch, and now we have to ask the
members of Congress: OK, if you're not ready to take on the dams,
how are you going to place these restrictions on other groups?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real test for the politicians.''

GORE GETS A WORKOUT AT MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The managers of Microsoft Monday greeted Vice President Al Gore
with a mental workout that was the equal in intensity to the
physical exertions he underwent while climbing Mount Rainier last
July.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that their company would be accused of harming American
consumers, employees in Redmond told Gore the software industry is
intensely competitive, and voiced offense at the Justice
Department's celebration of a federal judge's anti-trust ruling 10
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to talk about specifics of the Justice Department's
case against Microsoft. But he delivered a plainspoken defense of
anti-trust laws, underscoring many of the underlying arguments that
the administration used against the Redmond-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If competition is valuable, which I think it is, then
anti-trust laws have a place in embodying the values of our
country,'' said Gore, the Clinton administration's self-described
point man on technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to another question, Gore added: ``Competition can be
stifled both by unwise and unhealthy government action, but also by
companies that want to use innovation in one sector to stifle
competition in another.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has looked out at friendly faces and heard only the
occasional heckler during 11 previous previous visits to the Puget
Sound area since the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he drew big crowds _ 300 packed into an auditorium at
Microsoft's campus and 500 people at the Northshore Senior Center _
but faced tough, knowledgeable questions on anti-trust, abortion
and trade.
</P>
<P>
   He heard genuine anguish at Microsoft. One questioner, who began
working for the software company when he was 14, said he was a
Democrat because of the party's stands on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is I want to vote for you ...'' the questioner
told Gore, but the vice president is number two man in an
administration ``that accuses us of harming the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I respect your feeling and thank you for the underlying
values that motivate it,'' replied Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Again straying close to a comment on the Microsoft case, the
vice president added: ``The values that are inherent in our
anti-trust laws are ones that are sound, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore received a warm greeting at the senior center, and a few
hot questions. A woman named Toni Potter voiced fears of the World
Trade Organization that the new world economic order might bring
about disappearance of the world's forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe we must integrate labor and environmental
concerns into trade negotiations,'' said Gore, echoing a position
he unveiled during a July speech in Seattle. The vice president
challenged Potter on how she would change trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be done in public,'' Potter replied.
</P>
<P>
   Gore started to put down his questioner, citing the fact that
juries work in private. He pulled up, however, and said: ``I think
it should be a little more open.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers have vowed they will put 50,000 demonstrators
on the streets of Seattle for an anti-World Trade Organization
protest on Nov. 30, as trade ministers from around the world
convene in Seattle. Monday, however, they mustered only nine
protestors outside the Northshore Senior Center.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, the vice president reveled in the Clinton
administration's successful conclusion of a trade agreement that,
he said, ``virtually assures'' that China will join the World Trade
Organization. The vice president predicted the accord will ``open
up Chinese markets to a lot of our goods and services.'' But Gore
appeared to deliberately distance himself from a deal struck over
the weekend between the White House and House Republicans. In
exchange for money that will cover the United States' back dues to
the United Nation, the administration agreed to a ban on U.S. money
going to international organizations that support abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked about the deal during his appearance before
Microsoft employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not favor bargaining away any critical policy aspect of a
woman's right to choose,'' he replied. Afterward, the vice
president made clear that he was not part of negotiating the deal,
and said he has not talked to President Clinton about it.
</P>
<P>
   As he runs for president, Gore _ who was hit by a thunderstorm
on Mount Rainier in July _ has become a lightning rod on such
global issues as the World Trade Organization and
Northwest-oriented issues like prevention of oil spills in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has been an occasional bearer of popular
news, announcing Friday that a Navy rescue tug will be put at Neah
Bay starting in mid-December, providing immediate response to
marine mishaps during the darkest, stormiest months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Monday how long the tug will be stationed at the mouth of
the Strait, Gore replied: ``As long as it's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also serving as a financial drawing card Monday. He
adjourned to Newcastle Country Club last night, dining with about
20 big donors at a fundraiser that took in an estimated $225,000
for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president seemed charged up by his session at
Microsoft, which came just 10 days after U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson found that the company has stifled competition to
the detriment of American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won a healthy round of applause by asking if he could come
back. He was the sixth presidential candidate to visit the
Microsoft campus, which has also hosted GOP frontrunners, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain, as well as former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's fast-rising competitor for the
Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Microsoft severed relations with Gore. The software
giant has just hired the vice president's former press secretary
and longtime Democratic spokespersonm, Ginny Terzano, to head its
Washington, D.C., lobbying operations.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government officials said Monday evening that the
National Transportation Safety Board was considering asking the FBI
to take over the case of EgyptAir Flight 990, after a review of the
plane's cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were focusing on a cryptic utterance,
possibly a prayer. They said there were many questions about
exactly what was said and what it meant, but they were concerned
that the statement might be the last words of a pilot determined to
destroy himself and the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in the Atlantic, near Nantucket Island, Mass.,
two weeks ago, killing all 217 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not characterize the words beyond saying that
they may have been a prayer. The crew's conversations, other than
uneventful ones with air traffic controllers, were in Arabic and
senior officials of the safety board said that even with the aid of
additional interpreters brought in Monday, they did not understand
what was being said on the tape. The problems were ones of
language, culture and hearing what people said in a noisy cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation investigators also stressed that they had not yet
synchronized the voice tape with the flight data recorder tape,
which would record events occurring on the airplane and could put
the statements in context. For instance, a prayer being said after
the plane began plummeting so fast that passengers were rendered
weightless would not be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior law enforcement official said Monday night he
believed that the tape showed that after one of the two pilots left
the cockpit, another crew member made the suspicious utterance.
Only after that, the law-enforcement official said, was the
autopilot disengaged, seconds before the plane began its fatal
plunge. That sequence of events cast suspicion on the crew member,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board has supreme authority over transportation
accidents, and guards that role jealously, but the FBI, which
usually assists the board, takes over if the two agencies decide
that there was evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the safety board, Jim Hall, at a news conference
Monday afternoon, said, ``We are concentrating our efforts on
determining from the evidence, including the cockpit voice
recorder, whether or not this investigation is to remain under the
leadership of the NTSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify why he was focusing on whether the crash was
properly within his agency's jurisdiction, Hall simply reread his
statement about leadership of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the safety board proposed
stepping aside Monday afternoon, and taking a subordinate role
assisting the FBI, but FBI officials said they first wanted to
study the tape more.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which had one agent sitting in with safety board
officials on Sunday to listen to the tape, sent more Monday
evening, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The board is often eager to extricate itself from crashes that
are not caused by mechanical failures or human error; most
recently, it gave the FBI jurisdiction over the derailment of an
Amtrak train in October 1995, near Hyder, Ariz., that was
determined to have been caused by someone sabotaging the tracks. It
has also turned over two aircraft incidents, in which disgruntled
airline employees came into the cockpit and attacked the pilots
flying the plane.
</P>
<P>
   And board officials say they have a full agenda of work,
including the TWA Flight 800 crash three years ago, which many
initially suspected was sabotage but is now believed to have been
caused by mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not say how many voices were heard on the tape.
The cockpit requires a crew of two, and has two seats where
observers, trainees or company employees along for the ride can
sit.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a 10-year-old Boeing 767, was cruising at 33,000 feet
about half an hour out of Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 31
when the autopilot disengaged, either by itself or by the action of
a pilot. Then the plane flew steadily for a few more seconds, and
went into an extremely steep dive. During the dive, someone turned
off the engines.
</P>
<P>
   After descending about 3 miles, the plane pitched up, subjecting
everyone inside to two and a half times normal gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Then it turned downward again and apparently broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said Monday evening, ``I am well aware of the many rumors,
theories, and stories circulating in the last 72 hours _ indeed, in
the last two weeks _ about potential causes of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the board and elsewhere were uncertain about
what they had. A U.S. intelligence official said Monday night that
the CIA still has no evidence indicating terrorist activity in
connection with the crash. The official said that the CIA has
translators listening to the tape, but is still not certain of the
significance of the utterances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An American pilot with long experience in crash investigations
run by the safety board suggested that the board's next steps could
include interviews and even cultural study, as opposed to technical
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, Joseph Valiquette, a spokesman for the New York
office, said, ``as far as the FBI is concerned, we're doing the
same things today that we've been doing for the past two weeks. But
we all agree _ FBI, NTSB an the rest of the parties _ that the tape
recordings need to be further analyzed before people can reach
certain conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, FBI Director Louis J. Freeh met with Hall to discuss the
progress of the case and the possibility that the bureau might take
over the inquiry. In part, senior officials are worried over how to
pay for what could be a long and costly investigation, if it is
necessary to retrieve large sections of the aircraft from the
seabed.

HUBBLE TELESCOPE TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Hubble Space Telescope has temporarily ceased
scientific operations because of the failure of its precision
pointing system, a development that will leave the valuable
observatory dormant until a space-shuttle repair mission scheduled
to arrive next month, NASA officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiting telescope shut itself down on Saturday when one of
the three remaining gyroscopes used to stabilize and point the
observatory failed after 12 hours of erratic behavior. The
telescope needs a minimum of three of its six gyroscopes operating
to make astronomical observations, and had been limping along on
three of the devices since February.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the threat of losing valuable observations from one
of the world's premier optical telescopes, National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials decided last March to divide a
Hubble service mission planned for June 2000 and send up a
space-shuttle crew early to install new gyroscopes and do some
other work.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day service flight, originally scheduled for mid-October
but delayed because of space-shuttle problems, is tentatively set
for launching on Dec. 6. A second mission, to complete Hubble
modifications planned for the original service and repair flight,
is scheduled for May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Leckrone of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., the senior project scientist for Hubble, said
Monday that the observatory's shutdown shows the wisdom of last
spring's decision to fly a service mission early. If the shuttle
mission gets off on time and is successful, he said, the loss of
Hubble data will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling very lucky today,'' Leckrone said in an interview.
``It could have been much worse, and it's gratifying to know that
we made the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the early mission, Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's chief
scientist, said the agency wanted to avoid a ``science emergency''
in which researchers would lose the service of one of astronomy's
crown jewels. About $20 million a month is budgeted for Hubble
observations, he said, and the $75 million cost of the extra
shuttle service mission was worth the expense to protect this
research investment.
</P>
<P>
   With only two working gyroscopes, the Hubble automatically went
into ``safe mode,'' a dormant condition in which the telescope
closed its aperture door to protect its optics and aligned itself
to the sun to ensure that its solar panels could draw adequate
power. Ground crews continue to control and monitor the craft when
it is in the safe state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said Hubble's shutdown should result in only
three weeks of lost data. Leckrone said about 100 observations had
been scheduled between last weekend and the beginning of the
service mission, at which time the telescope was to have stopped
doing studies for three weeks to a month anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It should be possible to reschedule most of the lost
observations within the next year, Leckrone said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The shuttle Discovery was moved to its launching pad over the
weekend and its seven-member crew is at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida to rehearse the countdown and launching. Discovery's flight
was delayed because testing and modifications to all electrical
wiring in all four shuttles took longer than expected, and one of
Discovery's three main engines had to be changed after a servicing
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The primary task of the mission is to replace all six of
Hubble's gyroscopes, which are packaged in pairs. Four new
gyroscopes were installed during the first Hubble servicing
mission, in 1993, and all six of the instruments were working
during the second service mission, in 1997. One failed later in
1997, a second stopped working in 1998 and a third was lost last
February.
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscope problems appear to be caused by corrosion in
silver-copper wires the size of a human hair that carry electricity
to the high-speed motors that turn the gyroscopes' stabilizing
wheels. The wires are immersed in thick fluid in the sealed
chambers containing the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists believe that compressed air used to push the
viscous fluid into the chambers forced oxygen into the mixture,
which led to the formation of a corrosive substance that eroded the
wires.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of eliminating the problem, engineers used inert
nitrogen gas instead of compressed air to move the fluid when
making new gyroscopes to be installed on Hubble.

 &HT;    Leonid meteors: A sprinkle, shower or storm?
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Constellation Leo will roar in the
pre-dawn hours Thursday, shooting a blizzard of white-hot meteors
across the eastern sky.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe the much-awaited Leonid meteor storm will happen
Wednesday morning. Or later Thursday when we'll miss most of the
celestial fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it won't be a storm of meteors at all, merely a drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom among astronomers is that the best space
show this side of Hollywood will debut early Thursday when between
200 to 5,000 meteors per hour will streak above the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for precision? These are the same folks who touted
such notorious astronomical fizzles as comets Kohoutek in 1973-74,
Halley in 1986 and Hyakutake (gesundheit!) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many predicted a storm last year. Although some spectacular
fireballs were seen (18 hours ahead of schedule), the peak was only
250 meteors per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meteor showers are like blind dates,'' said Jack Horkheimer,
director of the Miami Space Transit Planetarium. ``You never know
what you're going to get until you meet face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid shower, so called because the meteors seem to flare
from the sickle-shaped constellation of Leo, is an annual event.
Mark your calendar today through Thursday when the Earth moves
through the debris trail of Comet Tempel-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic specks of dust, chunks of ice and extraterrestrial
rock slice through the atmosphere. They appear as shooting stars as
they burn into nothingness at 43 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   A typical year boasts 10 to 20 meteors per hour. But every 33
years the fresh ribbon of debris makes for spectacular celestial
fireworks. The 1966 peak was 2,400 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Local sky-watchers counted 50 per hour at the peak last year
when clouds obscured most of the sky. Globally, the top number was
250 per hour over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it could be a shower, a storm or a sprinkle,'' said
Charlie Fredrickson, president of the Astronomical Society of the
Palm Beaches. His group will gather in the pre-dawn darkness near
20-Mile Bend where urban lights will not obscure the flashes of
meteors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect more meteors but dimmer,'' Fredrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The darker the sky, the easier to spot the meteors. If the
darkness of the wilderness west of Loxahatchee is too scary, try a
beach or a pier jutting into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to get far enough away to see the Milky Way,'' Horkheimer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The best viewing for the east coast is expected to be between 3
and 6 a.m. Thursday, after the moon has set and Leo has risen in
the east, said Erich Landstrom, astronomy director at the South
Florida Science Museum in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Grab a lounge chair, a thermos of coffee and plenty of patience.
No binoculars or telescopes are needed. In fact, they only narrow
the view. Scan the sky rather than looking at Leo. Better yet,
divide the sky into quarters and each observer take a quadrant.
</P>
<P>
   Meteors often come in spurts so there could be many minutes
between sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Horkheimer is taking no chances. He's going out before dawn
Wednesday and then before midnight the next night. ``I missed the
storm in '66 by one hour,'' he said. ``I went to bed. I'm not going
to miss it this time.''

RANDY JOHNSON GETS NATIONAL LEAGUE CY YOUNG AWARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a year in which one pitcher won 22 games, it took
an extraordinary season for another pitcher to win the Cy Young
award.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Arizona's Randy Johnson, who finished with a 17-9 record
but had 364 strikeouts in 2712/3 innings, beat out Houston's Mike
Hampton _ who went 22-4 _ for the National League Cy Young award.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won the 1995 award while with Seattle, became just
the second pitcher to win in both leagues. (Gaylord Perry was the
first.) A third pitcher, Boston's Pedro Martinez, is expected to
become the third pitcher to join that group, because he is almost a
lock to win the American League Cy Young award Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson lost nine games in the regular season and
struggled in the postseason, he used his flaming fastball to have a
dominant year, leading the league in earned run average (2.48) and
complete games (12).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also led the majors in strikeouts. He was only 19
strikeouts short of the season record held by Nolan Ryan, and
Johnson now has the fourth-highest, single-season total. Johnson
struck out 10 or more batters 23 times, matching Ryan's record set
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received 20 of the first-place votes cast by members of
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Hampton led the
league in victories and received 11 first-place votes. Atlanta's
Kevin Millwood was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think this award isn't solely based on wins and
losses,'' Johnson said. ``There was a lot more to the season I had
than wins and losses. Quite honestly, I feel, still, this is the
best year I had in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, the most feared hurler among hitters in the
National League because of his long-limbed, left-handed release,
was also a hard-luck pitcher. In seven of his losses, Arizona
scored two or fewer runs, including a stretch in which the
Diamondbacks were shut out in four straight Johnson starts. In
those games, Johnson had an e.r.a. of 1.41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't dwell on it,'' Johnson said about the lack of
support. ``There were a few players that came up and said I handled
it really well and that meant more than any win I got this year. It
was frustrating. I continued to work hard and I was able to put up
some numbers I felt at the end of the year I could be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Johnson struggled in his only postseason appearance this
year when the New York Mets overcame 11 strikeouts to score seven
runs and hand him a loss. In postseason play, Johnson has lost
seven consecutive decisions over nine games that began after he
beat the Yankees twice in the 1995 playoffs while pitching for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when Tom Glavine won the award, the National League
Cy Young award has been dominated by Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and
Glavine, the heart of the Braves' rotation. From then until now,
the only other pitcher to break their string was Martinez, who won
while with Montreal. &QL;

CLINTON WINS ENDORSEMENT OF A CLINTON LABOR SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Robert Reich, the former secretary of labor
in the Clinton administration, broke ranks with his old boss Monday
and endorsed former Sen. Bill Bradley over Vice President Al Gore
in their race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully choosing his words during a joint appearance with
Bradley at St. Anselm's College, Reich called his decision ``very
difficult,'' saying he had ``great respect and admiration'' for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Reich, who served as labor secretary in Clinton's first
term, said he thought Bradley had laid out stronger proposals for
confronting what he called ``the nation's great unfinished
agenda,'' ending child poverty, extending health care to all
Americans and improving schools. Reich, who teaches social and
economic policy at Brandeis University, has been informally
advising Bradley on social policy for several months, Bradley's
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times call for bold solutions,'' Reich told 250 students
at the college. ``Bill Bradley will provide them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considered Gore unelectable _ as Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., asserted when he endorsed Bradley in September _
Reich replied, ``I won't say anything negative about the vice
president.'' He added that he had broken the news to Gore in a
telephone call Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign responded to the news by releasing documents
purporting to show clear differences in Reich's positions on health
care policy and Bradley's proposal to make health insurance
available to almost all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley plan calls for replacing Medicaid, the government
health care program for he poor, with a system of private
insurance. Gore asserts the plan would hurt poor black and Hispanic
people. And Monday, it produced quotes from Reich criticizing past
efforts to overhaul Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But Reich told reporters Monday that he could see the logic of
Bradley's plan, saying many poor people go on and off Medicaid and
therefore might be better served by a system of private insurance.

MANNESMANN IN SURPRISE SUIT TO STOP HOSTILE BID BY VODAFONE

<P>
   LONDON _ A day after rejecting a $106-billion takeover from
Vodafone Airtouch PLC, Mannesmann AG of Germany moved Monday to
thwart the British company's hostile bid by suing to remove its
corporate adviser, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., accusing the Wall Street
investment bank of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann played its surprise card Monday afternoon when its
lawyers filed a request for an injunction with Britain's High
Court, seeking to prevent Goldman from advising Vodafone, the
world's biggest wireless operator. It argued that Goldman's
previous work for Mannesmann had given it access to confidential
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that Goldman, Sachs has explicitly promised us
not to advise Vodafone or anybody else on an unsolicited bid, and
then did the contrary,'' Klaus Esser, Mannesmann's chief executive,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers depicted the maneuver as potentially a
landmark event in corporate takeovers, one that might change
deal-making by turning advisers into litigation targets alongside
the corporations in play. A boom in European mergers has left many
investment banks in the position of working for competing
companies, creating the same potential conflicts as those alleged
in the Mannesmann-Vodafone brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two of Mannesmann's current advisers in its
efforts to repulse Vodafone also worked for Vodafone's allies in
other deals in the last year. Merrill Lynch advised Bell Atlantic
and Morgan Stanley advised Airtouch Communications when it was
acquired by Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, the top corporate adviser in Europe, said it would
temporarily stop advising Vodafone until the case is heard
Thursday, thereby suspending its involvement at the height of an
intensifying takeover drama that had been billed as likely to
produce history's biggest-ever hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone said it was reviewing Mannesmann's court maneuver.
Goldman said in a statement that it ``has acted properly and has
pressed for an early hearing so it can challenge this action
vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Only hours earlier, executives close to the takeover discussions
had said that Vodafone was leaning toward a bid for Mannesmann
early Tuesday. But the pending court action injected new
uncertainty, representing a clear escalation of the battle between
Vodafone and Mannesmann, which began three weeks ago when the
German company announced its $33 billion acquisition of Orange PLC.
That purchase of Britain's No. 3 mobile phone operator turned
Mannesmann from a Vodafone partner elsewhere in Europe to a rival
on Vodafone's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is dominance in Europe's mushrooming wireless market as
the Continent gears up not only for a boom in the number of mobile
phone users, particularly among the European Union's 350 million
people, but also for a surge in wireless Internet use propelled by
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman had managed the international portion of a $1.6 billion
sale of new Mannesmann stock and was an adviser to Hutchison
Whampoah, a Hong Kong-based group that owns 44 percent of Orange's
stock and was a key participant in Mannesmann's $33-billion deal to
buy Orange. Vodafone's advisers on the Mannesmann takeover effort
are Goldman and Warburg Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday, Mannesmann, a fast-growing German
telecommunications giant that has emerged from what was once a
staid engineering concern, rejected a $106.4 billion overture from
Vodafone's chief executive, Christopher Gent, who had flown to
Duesseldorf, Germany, to present his offer only to be told by
Mannesmann's Esser that it was ``wholly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's rejection of Vodafone's all-stock bid _ which
valued the German company at 203 euros, or $209.50 a share _ sent
Vodafone's stock down by 3.75 pence (six cents) to close at 292.5
pence ($4.73) on Monday. Mannesmann's shares rose 9.5 percent to
17.68 euros ($18.21) to a record 202.98 euros ($209). Mannesmann's
stock has risen by 31 percent in the past two weeks of fevered
takeover speculation that has driven up telecommunications stocks
in general.
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications PLC, for instance, closed up 46.5
pence (70.68 cents) at 1,286 pence ($20.83). But the move in share
prices did not shake the widespread belief among analysts that
Vodafone has little option but to pursue a hostile bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the stakes are as high as they are, they need to show
an aggressiveness and forcefulness,'' said John Jensen, a
telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``And it's not
like they are starved for cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Jensen and several other analysts said Vodafone would need to
bid upwards of 220 euros ($226) and possibly up to 250 euros
($257.50) to persuade Mannesmann's shareholders _ none of whom hold
a controlling bloc of shares _ to support such a deal. The upper
limit of Vodafone's bid will be dictated partly by the level at
which the offers would dilute the earnings of the combined
companies, a figure that some analysts placed at between 230 euros
($236.9) and 240 euros ($247.20).
</P>
<P>
   That means that the bid could be valued at around 127 billion
euros, or $130.8 billion _ compared with the previous European
record for an unsolicited bid of $64 billion, by Olivetti SpA for
Telecom Italia SpA earlier this year. The bid would also far exceed
the current record, a $115 billion takeover deal by MCI Worldcom
for Sprint announced last month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vodafone is set to announce first-half earnings Tuesday, and
analysts are anticipating a 70 percent gain in earnings to 810
million pounds ($1.31 billion) as a result of its acquisition last
January of Airtouch, a U.S. telecommunications concern.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal for Mannesmann would be far more complex than the
trans-Atlantic negotiations that fused Vodafone and Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   Successful hostile takeovers are virtually unknown in Germany
and Mannesmann has expressed its desire to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   Esser, the Mannesmann chief, sought to reinforce that impression
Monday, telling CNN: ``There is always a price for everything but I
am 100 percent convinced that there will not be a price which is
good enough, which is fair enough to Mannesmann shareholders, which
is at all affordable to Vodafone shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Esser's view reflects his his belief that Mannesmann's strategy
is ``diametrically opposed'' to his suitors', according to an
executive close to Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
   The German giant has decided its future growth is based on a
combination of communication methods, including land-line networks,
data networks and wireless networks. Conversely, Vodafone has
successfully built its business strictly on a wireless strategy.

LACK OF FUNDS ENDANGERING CARE IN SOUTH AFRICA'S HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The public hospital system in South
Africa is so short of cash that it lacks enough workers, medical
equipment, ambulances, linens and medicine to provide proper care
to the poor, a government commission has found.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cancel surgical procedures because they lack sterile
towels and sheets, the commission said. Nursing departments are so
shorthanded that immobilized patients must often be bathed and fed
by relatives. Outdated medicine routinely appears in wards. And at
two hospitals, several patients died because the equipment they
needed was broken or unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that the budget is insufficient for current
services,'' the commission wrote in its study, which was issued in
October. ``It is clear to the commission that health care is
compromised if much needed personnel cannot be appointed and
equipment cannot be acquired in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   The report focused on five hospitals in Soweto, Pretoria,
Midrand, East Rand and Vereeniging and emphasized that many
doctors, nurses and pharmacists still provide good care. But
government officials say the findings are particularly worrisome
because they reflect problems common in public hospitals across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of apartheid, the government has greatly expanded
access to health care for blacks and people of mixed race, who were
once relegated to substandard facilities in urban areas and often
went with little or no care in rural areas. Today the country
spends more than $3 billion a year on health care and offers free
primary care to pregnant mothers, children under 6 and poor people
without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy on primary care has left public hospitals
straining to care for surging numbers of women, children and people
with AIDS, the commission found. Many of those patients should be
treated in the developing network of public clinics but end up in
hospitals because the clinic system suffers from even greater
shortages of workers and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, recently vowed to
improve the quality of care, expand primary clinics and revitalize
public hospitals. Local officials in Gauteng, the province that
encompasses the five troubled hospitals, have promised to spend an
additional $4 million on those hospitals and to seek donations of
medical equipment from international agencies and private business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the issue of the budget is the biggest
challenge we're facing,'' said Gwen Malegwale Ramokgopa, the
provincial health minister.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first improvements is to allow some hospitals to fill
positions that had been frozen. The good news came to Soweto last
month when hospital administrators learned they would be allowed to
fill 104 of 140 vacant doctors' posts. But the administrators said
shortages of nurses and pharmacists still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved,'' said John Pettifor, who heads the pediatrics
department at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. ``But we
still don't have enough nurses to manage the patients we're
admitting. And equipment is not being replaced as fast as it
becomes obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital wards and bathrooms are so dirty that ``hospital
hygiene does not meet clinically required standards,'' the
commission found. And some hospital pharmacies turn away 300 to 500
patients daily because they lack enough workers to distribute
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Other hospitals lack wheelchairs and gurneys. Faulty and
outdated devices give incorrect readings or break down. And because
of an ambulance shortage, it can take 46 minutes or more to
transport patients to the hospital.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am building some floor-to-ceiling wood shelves on one wall
in my family room and want to make sure that the vertical sides
will be absolutely plumb and vertical.
</P>
<P>
   Because the walls, as well as the floors and high ceilings in
this old house, are not really level I cannot simply measure in
from a corner of the room to draw a truly vertical line on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   How can I plumb the vertical ends of my built-in bookcase
without having to go out and buy an expensive long spirit level of
some kind?
</P>
<P>
   A: The simplest way to draw a vertical line that is absolutely
plumb is to snap a chalk line on the wall by using a plumb bob and
length of chalked line as shown here.
</P>
<P>
   The line should be coated with chalk powder by rubbing it over a
piece of chalk or by passing it through powdered chalk (sold in
hardware stores).
</P>
<P>
   Tie a plumb bob to the bottom end of this line and tie the top
end to a nail driven into the wall up near the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the line to hang free until the weighted plumb bob down
near the floor stops swinging, then pull the string tight while
holding the plumb bob steady at the bottom with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   With the other hand pull the center of the string out an inch or
two from the wall, then allow it to snap back against the wall.
This will create a chalked line on the wall that will be exactly
plumb.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The exhaust fan in our bathroom rattles when it is running.
Can you tell me if this rattle can be corrected, and if the fan
really should exhaust bathroom odors?
</P>
<P>
   A: The rattle is probably due to one of two things: the fan
blade could be loose on its shaft, or the blade could be hitting
something inside the housing when it is spinning.
</P>
<P>
   This can be determined by pulling off the housing or grill that
covers the fan, then turning off the power and rotating the fan
blade by hand while observing what happens as the blade spins.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fan's use _ most home bathroom fans in general are
intended to exhaust moisture when bathing. They do help to exhaust
odors, but most are not really large enough to do a thorough job of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The aluminum siding on my house was originally brown, but now
the color is dull and faded.
</P>
<P>
   When I accidentally spilled some linseed oil in one area near
the garage, I noticed that the oil made the color look darker and
more like its original color.
</P>
<P>
   Since I like the appearance, and since this was accomplished
without painting, I wonder if it would be possible to do this on
all the siding on that side of the house?
</P>
<P>
   A: The trouble with linseed oil is that it is very susceptible
to mildew _ it will usually turn dark and blotchy looking in time.
Most oils will have this same affect on dark colors, but the color
will not last as long as paint.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you want try this, then don't use linseed oil.
Instead, use a product like Penetrol, or one of the clear
penetrating wood sealers that are sold in all paint stores.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our family room and kitchen windows get lots of afternoon
sun, which makes these rooms uncomfortably warm during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   I have installed window shades, but these tend to darken the
rooms and kill our outside view.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a special glass or some kind of clear film we can
install that will help solve this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are transparent window films that can be applied to
window glass to greatly cut down on the amount of heat that will
come through that glass. Some are clear but the most efficient ones
are slightly tinted (usually an amber cast).
</P>
<P>
   Most create a ``mirror'' effect on the outside during daylight
hours (you can see out, but outsiders can't see in). At night the
effect is the opposite: if interior lights are on, you cannot see
out, but those outside can see in.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``PLUMB LINE'' goes with this column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Chalked plumb line will mark vertical line on wall when
snapped lightly after pulling plumb line tight.

<P>
   BEIJING _ American and Chinese negotiators reached a landmark
agreement on Monday to open China's economy to foreign competitors
and in return to make the world's most populous nation a full
partner in international commerce.
</P>
<P>
   After six days of arduous negotiations, the U.S. trade
representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and China's trade minister,
Shi Guangsheng, signed the papers at 3:50 p.m. on Monday, shook
hands and raised a champagne toast to an agreement that capped 13
years of on-and-off negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal signed on Monday, Beijing would reduce tariffs on
various industrial and agricultural products and lift many of the
barriers in the way of American banks, insurance and telephone
companies to operate here.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the United States agreed to support China for
membership in the World Trade Organization, the 135-member
organization that sets the rules for global trade. China must still
complete side agreements with the European Union, Canada and some
developing countries, including Brazil, before its application can
be taken up by the body's 135 member states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say that this is a profound and historic moment in
U.S.-China relations,'' said a clearly exultant Barshefsky, adding
that the agreement would not only aid the economies of both
countries, but also serve as an anchor in the tumultuous political
relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The last six days of day-and-night negotiations were conducted
in a ``win-win spirit,'' Shi said at the ceremony, ``and finally we
reached an agreement that serves the interests of both China and
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the rejoicing, the agreement still faces tough
resistance in the United States, where it is opposed by labor
unions and some critics of China. The U.S. Congress must vote to
put an end to the annual review of Chinese trade and to establish
permanent normal trading relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   For China, membership in the trade body will mean a long-sought
acceptance into the ``club'' of world powers. The WTO's elaborate
rules will help protect China from discriminatory policies abroad,
but will also force the discipline of globally agreed rules on
China's own fitful progress toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   The accord goes to the heart of China's transition to an open,
market economy. It would put Beijing, for the first time, under the
jurisdiction of the rules set by the World Trade Organization,
which are enforced by a trade court.
</P>
<P>
   Full WTO membership will be a victory for President Jiang Zemin,
who sees achieving China's economic modernization as his legacy
even as he tries to insure continuation of Communist Party rule. At
the same time it will cheer the more liberal, reform-oriented
factions led by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, since it locks China
onto the path of economic opening and the global competition they
hope will force China's own state-owned industries to become
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   The step is a politically risky one for Jiang and Zhu at a
moment when those state-run companies are already shedding millions
of workers. For President Clinton, Monday's agreement provides a
badly needed centerpiece to his fraying policy of engagement with
China, offering the prospect of tangible gains to many companies
and to consumers. It is also a stunning recovery from what his own
top aides describe as a huge mistake: his decision to walk away
from the surprisingly sweeping deal, similar to Monday's, offered
in April by Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing, Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, the White House
chief of economic policy who attended the talks as a symbol of
Clinton's personal commitment, were driven to the secluded
leadership compound for a brief meeting with Jiang, who had twice
in the past month conducted telephone talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the talks was far more than how deeply American
insurance and telephone companies could invest in China, or how
freely American oranges could be exported there - among the many
issues that both sides have argued about for years. The accord goes
to the heart of China's transition to an open, market economy and
for the first time it puts Beijing under the jurisdiction of the
rules of international trade set by the World Trade Organization,
enforced by a trade court.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Turkey on Monday, Clinton said: ``I think this is a
good agreement for China, for America and for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's struggle to make this accord a central foreign
policy achievement is far from over. Congress will review the
accord when it takes up the biggest single American concession:
Granting permanent trading rights to China rather than reviewing
those rights annually, a Capitol Hill ritual that has turned into
an annual debate about human rights and arms proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has spoken often of ``integrating China into the world
economy'' and gradually getting the country to embrace ``the rule
of law,'' starting with commercial law. But without closing a WTO
agreement, his aides said, he would have little progress to point
to.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement may also help to repair the damage done from
charges of Chinese spying in the United States, the accidental
American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May and
China's continuing suspicion that the United States is attempting
to ``contain'' its military and economic power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful completion of WTO will go a long way to smooth out
some of the extreme oscillation that we have seen in Sino-American
relations in recent years,'' said Joseph Fewsmith, a China expert
at Boston University. `'I think it gives us a chance to build some
substance into a relationship that has been badly damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO sets rules for global commerce, adjudicates disputes
and, with global trading accords, presses for ever-freer markets.
Monday's agreement is a huge step toward membership for China. It
is probably already too late, experts said, for China to be fully
admitted before Nov. 30, when a new round of global trade
negotiations will begin in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's accord means that China will take a larger role in
setting the agenda at Seattle, and the talks are expected to go on
for years.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the American goal was to press China not
only for large reductions in tariffs on imported farm products and
industrial goods such as automobiles. In measures that may
ultimately have a far more profound impact, China had to commit
itself to allowing foreign companies to take majority investments
in many industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The final six days of negotiations went through several rough
spots. Several times Barshefsky and Sperling suggested they were
packing up to leave, threats Barshefsky said in an interview on
Monday that were ``largely tactical, to force the Chinese to make
some progress.''

   &LR;  ``Clearly,'' she said, ``they were not going to let us
leave.'' In an interview from Hong Kong on Monday, Barshefsky said
that the key Chinese player in the talks appeared to be Zhou, who
twice stepped in to break an impasse and ultimately directed his
negotiators to make several key concessions - allowing American
firms to take a 50 percent stake in China's booming
telecommunications companies, for example. But all his decisions,
analysts here said, were almost certainly cleared by the top party
leadership.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of an agreement had been worked out last
April, when Zhu visited Washington. But Clinton backed away from
any agreement at the time, fearing congressional opposition. Most
of Monday's pact follows the April understandings, and in resolving
areas of continued dispute, Barshefsky asserted ``I think we
achieved an overall strengthening of this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The agreement involves a general reduction in China's import
tariffs from the current average of 22.1 percent down to 17
percent, with tariffs on major American farm products cut sharply
to 15 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs on automobile imports, which now range up to 100 percent
to protect China's inefficient producers, will be reduced over a
six-year period to 25 percent, with fastest reduction in the
initial years. That is one year longer than China offered in April.
But equally important, American officials said, foreign auto
companies and banks will for the first time be able to offer
consumer loans for car purchases, a critical concession in a
country where few can lay out the money for such a large purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese consumers may soon be purchasing General Motors cars,
for example, with the ``GMAC'' loans so familiar to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most contentious issues in recent days, Barshefsky
said, involved the American demands for ways to respond to ``import
surges'' and for use of a methodology to identify when the Chinese
might be illegally selling products below cost, or ``dumping.''
China wanted such measures to phase out quickly, but in the end
agreed to surge protections for a 12-year period, and the
anti-dumping regime for 15 years. Without those concessions,
Barshefsky told her Chinese counterparts, Congress could easily
balk at the accord.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, China has agreed to allow foreign companies
to distribute their own goods - rather than forcing them to
distribute food or industrial components through Chinese companies.
They will also be able to repair and support their products
directly.
</P>
<P>
   In the textile area, one of the most politically sensitive in
the United States, it was the Americans who called for restrictions
on free trade. The Chinese wanted to scale back the American demand
to continue its existing textile import quotas for another 10
years. In the end, the United States agreed to end quotas after
five years, but with special ``anti-surge'' safeguards for another
four years after that.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-dumping and textile provisions are charged issues for
Vice President Al Gore, who hopes to keep the support of organized
labor in his Presidential bid even as labor groups oppose the trade
accord.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment in China's telecommunications sector had
become a sore point inside China, where some saw it as an issue of
national security. The Americans fought for 51 percent ownership
rights - which Zhu had offered in April - but finally agreed that
foreign firms could take up to 50 percent ownership of companies in
this booming sector, beginning two years after China enters the
trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Important provisions will open Chinese retail banking to foreign
firms over several years, and also improve market access for
insurance companies, legal and accounting firms. But the American
negotiators got far less in the infant and high-risk financial
securities market here, where they are will be limited to minority
stakes in such activities as underwriting stock issues.
</P>
<P>
   For China _ which is still unraveling the legacy of Mao Zedong's
cloistered, command economy _ entry into the world trade body will
carry profound implications.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists here compare WTO entry to Deng Xiaoping's
landmark opening of the economy to market forces and foreign
influence in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening of China to the outside world began with Mao
Zedong's meeting with Richard Nixon in 1972,'' said Hu Angang, a
leading economist here at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ``The
second major stage was marked by Deng Xiaoping's visit to the
United States in 1979.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joining WTO will represent a whole new stage in China's
opening to the world,'' Hu said. ``It will signify a shift from
partial to comprehensive opening and reform,'' he said, ``and a
shift from an opening based on domestic rules to an opening based
on internationally defined rules.''
</P>
<P>
   China's embrace of more open markets reflects the desire of
Jiang and other top leaders to push ahead with a radical overhaul
of the domestic economy, opening it to global competition and
bringing in more foreign capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and his fellow Communist Party leaders see the economic
transformation as vital if China to become a great power in the
century ahead. They also know that if they do not provide steadily
rising incomes to their people, the party's rule is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So the renewed opening is perhaps an unavoidable but risky step
for the Communist leaders, who can expect to see some cherished
state enterprises crushed even as others are energized. In the
short run, at least, already impoverished farmers may be harmed by
cheap imports and more urban workers will lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the changes China has promised are breathtaking in
their scope. But even the most optimistic American officials
concede that threatened Chinese ministries and provinces are likely
to find ways to delay implementation of many provisions. This
suspicion is likely to feed controversy in the United States about
the pact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Democrats and Republicans say the agreement will
almost certainly be approved in Congress sometime early next year,
after a spirited debate.

JUDGES REINSTATE CONVICTION IN EXTORTION OF BILL COSBY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a highly unusual move, the federal appeals panel
that overturned the conviction of a woman accused of trying to
extort $40 million from Bill Cosby reversed itself Monday and
reinstated the guilty verdict against her.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Autumn Jackson, who had claimed to be Cosby's
out-of-wedlock daughter, and two others were convicted in 1997 of
conspiring in a threat to sell her story to a supermarket tabloid
unless the actor paid her the money. But a three-judge panel of the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge in the trial
had improperly instructed the jury and overturned the convictions.
Ms. Jackson was released from prison after serving only 14 months
of her 26-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, that same panel reversed itself and reinstated all
three convictions, citing a Supreme Court decision on jury
instructions that came down just one day after its ruling last
June. As a result, Ms. Jackson will probably have to return to
prison, said her lawyer, Robert Baum, who delivered the news to her
by phone late Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was devastated,'' said Baum. ``She asked me a few
questions, and then she just broke down and started crying and
couldn't talk to me any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Ms. Jackson, 25, who gave birth to twin boys in jail,
had been living with her husband and sons, who are about a year and
a half old, and her mother outside Los Angles.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson had been serving her sentence at the federal
Correctional Institution at Dublin, in northern California, when
her conviction was overturned last spring. Baum said Ms. Jackson
would surrender to prison authorities, but he added that he would
then seek her release on bail. He said he was considering seeking a
review by the full federal appeals court or the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Cosby, Andrew D. Schau, said Monday: ``The decision
confirms that the defendants' conduct was wrong, and that the jury
that convicted them got it right the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
in Manhattan, who prosecuted the case, had no comment Monday on the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The original trial of Ms. Jackson and her two co-defendants
attracted widespread attention because of Cosby's role as the
victim. Testimony in the case showed that on Jan. 16, 1997, the
same day that Ms. Jackson made her demand of $40 million, Cosby's
son, Ennis, was killed in California. There was no connection
between the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   When Judge Amalya L. Kearse, writing for the panel, ordered the
convictions overturned June 9, she said the jury should have been
allowed to consider whether Ms. Jackson believed she had a rightful
claim to the money in light of her contention that Cosby was her
father. The trial judge had told the jury that Ms. Jackson's belief
was irrelevant to whether she was guilty of extortion.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Kearse said that under a new Supreme Court decision
handed down on June 10, the judge's failure to instruct the jury on
the issue was ``harmless error,'' and the convictions could be
affirmed. The Supreme Court had ruled that errors in a judge's jury
instructions are harmless when they could not have affected the
jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The defense in the trial had argued that Ms. Jackson's conduct
was not illegal because she honestly believed that she was Cosby's
daughter and had a claim against him. Cosby has denied that he is
Ms. Jackson's father, although he did admit having an affair with
her mother in the 1970s
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government, in seeking to have the convictions reinstated,
told the panel that no matter what the jury was told by the trial
judge about Ms. Jackson's feeling of entitlement, no rational juror
could have agreed with her belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any asserted belief that Jackson was entitled to $40 million
from Cosby would have been preposterous on the facts of this
case,'' Ms. White said in papers submitted to the appeals panel.
</P>
<P>
   Kearse, who was joined in her opinion by Chief Judge Ralph K.
Winter and Judge Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland, agreed that there
was ``no evidence on which a rational juror'' could find ``that
Jackson had a plausible claim of right to the $40 million she
demanded.''

WARPED VALUES A LAUGH A MINUTE

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Ken Griffey Jr., who casts as large a shadow over
Seattle as the Space Needle, demands to be traded so he can be
closer to his wife and kids. If we could speak over the trumpets'
blaring of Junior's old-fashioned family values, we'd ask him: If
it's all about kin, why not just sell the house in Orlando and take
up permanent residence in Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   There's a name for political candidates in these times who are
as disingenuous as Griffey, who is catering to his kids only if
they are fraternal twins named Greed and Glory:
</P>
<P>
   Also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   Just as there's a word to describe workers in other fields who
reject a substantial raise and call in sick 100 consecutive days in
protest, as did Seattle Seahawks receiver Joey Galloway:
</P>
<P>
   Unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with putting athletes on a pedestal is they tend to
look their best when contributing the least to society's upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   They don't interact with our children eight hours a day like
teachers or day-care workers; they don't counsel battered women or
create jobs for the needy or feed the homeless or patrol our
streets at night.
</P>
<P>
   They entertain us for a few hours and help us forget our
troubles and for that they are treated like royalty.
   We watch Shaquille O'Neal shrug off a $10,000 fine for
instigating a fight with Charles Barkley as the cost of being a big
man in a hacker's league.
</P>
<P>
   We watch Lawrence Phillips blow off practices and Ryan Leaf blow
off steam at his general manager and it dawns on us: Somewhere
along the way, the court jesters began ruling the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   This occurred to the creators of ``Cosby,'' too. Executive
producer Tom Straw and writers Nick LeRose and Tom Reeder cleverly
address the absurdity of society's values in this week's episode of
the CBS sitcom, which airs Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Straw, LeRose and Reeder conjured up a world in which teachers
get money for nothing and computers for free; a society in which
educators make more in five minutes than entertainers do in a year;
an environment that leads disgruntled basketball star Patrick Ewing
to opine, in a wickedly wonderful cameo, ``I blame the media. They
treat these teachers like Gods.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode _ extended a half hour to 60 minutes because the
well of satirical material to draw from was so deep _ revolves
around Doug E. Doug's character, Griffin Vesey, a science teacher
at Ralph Bunche Middle High in Astoria, N.Y., who is barely making
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Vesey fantasizes about what it would be like if teachers enjoyed
the same kind of attention and adulation as today's superstar
athletes. What if he were a free agent being courted by a rival
school district with very deep pockets?
</P>
<P>
   What if he had an agent (played by Bill Cosby) to do his
negotiating and the ensuing bidding war played out on television
and in the tabloids?
</P>
<P>
   Vesey could be Keyshawn Johnson impersonating Barkley playing
Doug Jeter imitating Ricky Williams. The professional sports scene,
with its sycophants and stratospheric salaries and insatiable egos,
is a landscape ripe for ridicule and the ``Cosby'' writers manage
to pluck it clean.
</P>
<P>
   The message that gives the lines their punch is that society has
it all backward. We empower and enrich and elevate people whose
unique skills make today a little brighter but don't do a whole lot
toward lighting tomorrow's path.
</P>
<P>
   We pay athletes hundreds of millions of dollars to jump high,
shoot low, run fast or age slow. Then we pay them millions of
dollars more to endorse sneakers while teachers on shoestring
budgets buy construction paper and crayons and books out of their
own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Our children grow up wanting to emulate their favorite sports
stars and make millions, not be like their favorite instructors and
make a difference. Society lets them know in myriad ways which one
is more valued.
</P>
<P>
   Straw grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Some years later, he
can remember the names of the teachers at Birmingham High in Van
Nuys who positively influenced him. The idea of teachers as
celebrities he got from author Frank McCourt, who recently was
quoted in The New York Times magazine lamenting education's low
placement on society's ladder of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the idea of doing a sports parody, ``there were so
many things that connected so quickly,'' Straw said Monday from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, Jerry Rice and Doug Flutie _ good sports that they are _
made cameo appearances, playing themselves in Vesey's fantasy as
dedicated athletes who are underappreciated and overworked.
</P>
<P>
   They delivered the message, loud and clear. We trust somebody
will explain to Phillips, Leaf, Galloway, Griffey et al., why the
episode is so funny.

NEW YORK SUES GE OVER POLLUTION IN RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued General
Electric on Monday, the first time the state has ever taken the
company to court over PCB contamination of the Hudson River, in an
action that he says he hopes will open the door to many similar
suits.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed in state Supreme Court in Albany, does not
address the environmental and health effects of GE's three decades
of dumping PCBs into the river, issues that are the subject of an
ongoing inquiry by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The
agency is expected to decide next year whether to order widespread
dredging of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Spitzer's complaint takes the novel approach of
pursuing monetary damages, blaming PCBs for the state's trouble in
maintaining a shipping canal that links the Hudson to Lake
Champlain. He invited local governments and private interests along
the nearly 200-mile length of the river to join in his suit or file
their own, on similar grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal theory, once we establish this legal theory, will
open GE up to damages that are vast, that will apply up and down
the Hudson River, and that will be monumental in scale,'' he said.
``All the communities up and down the river have been impaired
because of the PCBs in the Hudson _ the value of property, the
ability to get commerce through, jobs that have been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer intentionally steered clear of sticky questions about
damage to human health and ecosystems, adhering, he said, to
grounds where he was confident he could win, and win quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists applauded the suit, predicting that it would
put added pressure on GE to reach a settlement with the
environmental agency for large-scale dredging of the river. The
company strenuously opposes dredging, which could cost it more than
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, Mark Behan, dismissed the suit as
``politics, purely and simply politics,'' adding that General
Electric would contest it ``with vigor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's administration also took issue with the
action, warning that it could interfere with other state actions
against GE over pollution in the Hudson, which has been declared a
toxic cleanup site under the federal Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists dismissed that concern, some saying that the
governor, a Republican, simply did not like being overshadowed on
environmental matters by the new attorney general, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   John Cahill, Pataki's commissioner of environmental
conservation, predicted that his agency and the EPA would be
dragged into Spitzer's suit. That, he said, would draw resources
away from both the federal agency's investigation and a claim for
economic damages against General Electric under the federal
Superfund law that the state and federal governments have been
exploring jointly.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that the suit could hinder future claims under
state law, since all such claims, he said, should be filed at once.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the environmental agency declined to comment on the
suit, or on Cahill's prediction that it would slow their work.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists were elated that after decades of
struggle, the state had finally sued General Electric. ``We're
delighted to see an aggressive approach being taken, finally,''
said Cara Lee, environmental director of Scenic Hudson, a
conservation group. ``This suit will probably bring forward
additional information that will, if anything, make for a better
EPA decision and better state claims in the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The environmental agency is scheduled to make a preliminary
decision late next year on whether to order dredging of PCB ``hot
spots'' up and down the river, but a final decision is not expected
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups fear that by then, there could be a
Republican administration in Washington that would be less likely
to take such action, a prospect that they say makes the attorney
general's suit all the more important.
</P>
<P>
   The suit continues Spitzer's string of audacious actions against
major corporations in his first year in office. He has threatened
to make New York the first state to sue gun makers in an attempt to
make them put safety devices on handguns and limit how and where
guns are sold. And he has sued power plants in the Midwest and
South over air pollution that crosses state lines; it is the first
such suit by any state.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's suit deals with the 35-mile-long Champlain Canal, from
the southern tip of Lake Champlain to the Hudson at Waterford. It
intersects the Hudson just downstream from the General Electric
plants, at Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, that dumped PCBs into the
river from the 1940s to 1970s, when the federal government banned
them.
</P>
<P>
   In some stretches, the canal runs alongside the river. In
others, it enters the river; that is, what is called the canal is
actually just the deepest part of the river. That provides the
basis for the attorney general's narrowly drawn suit.
</P>
<P>
   The state Constitution requires that the state maintain the
canal for commercial traffic, and state law requires that it be at
least 12 feet deep. But where the canal lies in the river, it has
been allowed to silt up _ it is as shallow as 7 feet in places,
Spitzer's aides said _ because of PCBs in the sediment.
</P>
<P>
   If the state were to dredge the canal, it would have to abide by
strict federal standards for handling and disposing of PCBs, making
the work far more expensive. Spitzer said that was why the state
had not dredged the channel in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   His suit seeks to force the company to pay the additional cost
to dredge the shipping channel in the part of the river that
doubles as the canal, a sum that he said would be at least $10
million and possibly far more. He noted that he was leaving open
the possibility of seeking damages for lost economic activity along
the canal, which would probably be many times the cost of dredging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar figure is not as important as the precedent-setting
nature of the action,'' Spitzer said. ``This case will also
establish a case for others faced with increased dredging and
disposal costs. This includes municipalities in the region and
downstream. It also includes private facilities such as marinas and
waterfront businesses and others who can demonstrate economic harm.
These damages will be vast.''
</P>
<P>
   Behan, the General Electric spokesman, said the state had never
even requested permission from the federal government to dredge the
channel, proving that it was not a pressing need.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Munk, a spokeswoman for the state Thruway Authority,
which is controlled by the governor and operates the canal, said,
``We believe that there is no need to do dredging for navigational
purposes prior to EPA's assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   But she conceded that at times, getting a ship through takes
special measures like removing some of its load or using dams to
raise the water level temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial traffic on the river has declined, from 13,615
vessels in 1980 to 2,517 last year, though some of that drop
results from the decline of manufacturing upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said Spitzer's suit appeared to be a strong one.
``There's a long history of the state suing under public nuisance
laws when there is interference with a transportation corridor,''
said Karl Coplan, a law professor at Pace University who
specializes in environmental law.
</P>
<P>
   Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, were long used as insulators
in electrical equipment. General Electric estimates that its two
plants on the Hudson, 50 miles north of Albany, dumped more than a
million pounds of PCBs into the river, but its critics contend the
amount was far more. Spitzer said the true figure was more than 100
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Though the federal environmental agency has declared that PCBs
cause cancer in animals, and probably in humans as well, there is
debate among scientists about what, if any, risk there is to humans
from low-level exposure.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric contends that its dumping was legal, because no
law explicitly prohibited it. But environmentalists argue that the
extent of the dumping made it illegal because it violated state
clean-water laws, a position supported by Spitzer.

Aires and JAMES WILSON in Panama City 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LIMA, Peru _ Blanca and Jaime Gorenstein consider themselves
part of Latin America's middle class, ``or at least we did,'' says
Blanca. When they married, Jaime's three-employee business had been
importing car parts for three years. But for the better part of
this decade, business has gone from good to bad, a bit better and
then terribly worse. Finally, he shut it down.
 &HT;    Now Jaime helps out a couple of friends in a sales job, but his
salary is variable and the $400 Blanca brings in monthly from her
part-time secretarial job is essential. Friends who were also doing
reasonably well are now selling property for working capital to
keep their businesses going.
 &HT;    ``There's only enough for necessities,'' says Blanca. The
Gorensteins closed their checking accounts and have no credit
cards, save one for frugal shopping at a local department store.
They have to think hard to recall their last major household
purchase. ``In the past six or seven years, nothing,'' says Blanca.
``On the contrary, we were robbed three years ago and we couldn't
replace the large television set. We just keep watching the little
one.''
 &HT;    The portrait of the Latin American middle class has not turned
out as first sketched. Over the last decade, reformers behind
economic liberalization from Argentina to Mexico claimed their
programs would shrink poverty and create jobs _ effectively
shifting the subsistence working masses in the region upward into
the ranks of consuming middle-class citizens. Ten years of
accumulated evidence shows otherwise. The gap between the ``haves''
and the ``have-nots'' is growing faster than ever. Unemployment
hovers at record levels in a number of countries.
 &HT;    The LATIN TRADE Consensus Forecast shows that the region's
economies, after bottoming out this year, should begin to recover.
But the modest gains forecast _ no more than around 4 percent GDP
growth in Chile and Peru _ do not rival the double-digit and
high-single-digit growth rates posted at the beginning of the
decade. Furthermore, population growth continues to outstrip
economic performance, leaving more people to share less pie.
Profiles of middle-class families (see sidebars) add fuel to the
notion that individuals are feeling the squeeze.
 &HT;    Researchers at Strategy Research, a market research firm focused
on the region, say many companies mistook the burst of consumer
spending that took place in the early 1990s as a sign that Latin
America's middle class was coming of age. '' 'Growing middle
class,' that's what everyone wants to hear,'' says John A.
Holcombe, vice president of Strategy Research. ``We say you have to
understand the market.'' The run on everything from cars to washing
machines to big-screen televisions owed much to pent-up demand
combined with a burst of stability, consumer confidence and easy
credit.
 &HT;    In the United States, fully half of household income goes to
either rent or mortgage payments plus transportation costs _
usually car loans, insurance and maintenance. Latin Americans are
free of many of those costs: Young families live with parents, use
public buses more readily and do not bother with such things as
health insurance. That leaves more money free in the flush times,
like the early 1990s, to buy long-denied ``luxuries,'' that
middle-income U.S. families would take for granted _ say, an
electric dryer or stereo system.
 &HT;    The reality, says Holcombe, is that Latin purchasing power is
still hovering around the same levels as in the mid-1970s. For
consumers, Latin America's lost decade, in fact, threatens to
blossom into the misplaced quarter-century. ``In Latin America, the
problem is that people don't have any money,'' said Jose Gonzalez
of CLSA Global Emerging Markets at a recent conference on economic
prospects.
 &HT;    Governments have responded to the situation as governments will:
by jiggering the statistics. With few options other than the
belt-tightening and privatization mandated by the financial
markets, governments have sanitized the socioeconomic fallout by
redefining poverty levels and the definition of unemployment,
seeming to create dramatic drops in both categories across the
region.
 &HT;    That has improved the overall macroeconomic outlook, but has
done little to companies' bottom lines. Businesses that depend on a
healthy middle class, such as retail chains, purveyors of pay TV,
and automobile manufacturers, to name a few, in recent years are
not hitting the numbers as fast as they had originally hoped. While
auto sales have plummeted in Brazil and Argentina this year, for
example, companies have tried to put a brave face on billions in
investment, telling all comers that the costly endeavors are a must
for establishing brand recognition for the sure-to-come boom.
``It's definitely a viable market,'' says Ivette de Reubens,
regional marketing manager for Microsoft. ``Just not as developed
as the United States.''
 &HT;    The corporate success stories of this decade come from companies
that sell products that everyone needs and can afford.
Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &AMP; Gamble sell small, cheap packages
of shampoo and detergent. Unilever sells many more ice cream bars
than gallon containers of chocolate. The low-priced products are
within consumers' reach and, conveniently, have healthy margins.
 &HT;    Mexican retailer Elektra went another route: financing expensive
white goods in small monthly payments that allowed even the poorest
consumers to buy a refrigerator or television. With interest rates
often over 100 percent a year, such plans made financing appliances
more lucrative than selling them.
 &HT;    Across Lima from the Gorensteins' house, stockbroker Charles
Fyfe has what would seem the quintessential job for a developing
middle-class society. But selling Peru's blue chip equities to
investors is just his day job. Fyfe holds stakes in a number of
small ventures oriented toward the plastic-razor-buying market,
like a company that distributes one-use sleeves of shampoo to
Lima's shantytowns. ``If you want to get rich in these countries,
you've got to sell things to poor people,'' he says. He waxes
poetic over an old school buddy who has made his fortune selling
building materials _ cement and roofing _ in small lots by driving
trucks into the shantytowns and selling each brick on a cash basis.
 &HT;    In October 1994, American Demographics published an article
headlining Mexico's ``bulging'' middle class. A few short months
later, in December 1994, the peso crisis suddenly gobbled up all
the gains. Everyday Mexicans watched their savings devalue and
their credit card debts soar. Suddenly they were back to a beans
and tortillas diet and struggling to find a second job to help
cover costs.
 &HT;    Nearly five years later, Mexico seems back on track and families
are once again starting to buy their version of the American Dream.
Meanwhile, South America suffers mightily under the constraints of
the Asian contagion, depressed commodities prices and the bust of
the Brazilian real.
 &HT;    Argentine entrepreneur Ruben Gonzalez has seen earnings drop by
half at his two laundromats. The vagaries brought about by
uncertain economics have kept him a conservative man. A bachelor,
he lives in a small house and keeps things simple. His car is 15
years old and he says he doesn't waste money on luxury goods. His
clients, however, seem to be deciding that paying to clean their
clothes is also a luxury. ``A few years ago, the laundry business
was better. Now, people like to borrow their family's washing
machines because the extra money spent on laundry is a burden,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Recessions have halted the growth needed to increase the middle
class across the continent. Gains are on hold in Argentina, Peru,
even scrappy Chile, while Brazil and smaller economies like Ecuador
have lost ground. Analysts say Brazil is rebounding faster than
expected from its devaluation, but in many ways, consumers are
blighted with the same process that took Mexicans five years to
slog through.
 &HT;    Brazilians are entering what economists call the ``informal
economy'' in droves. A more accurate term might be urban
subsistence, similar to the way rural peasants grow their own crops
and survive outside the money economy. In cities, however,
desperate job seekers sell whatever they can to their neighbors and
friends. Impromptu, in-home beauty salons and lunch counters, and
door-to-door salespeople are cropping up to replace lost jobs or
supplement incomes after hours. No overhead means such goods and
services are cheaper than traditional companies can offer, but they
chip away at the tax base.
 &HT;    The boombust cycle over the last few years has at once raised
hopes and caused people to resign themselves to a life of greater
effort for diminishing gains. No one complains about the end of the
era of hyperinflation. At least that has allowed Latin Americans to
take a breather from ever-escalating prices.
 &HT;    The missing ingredient, of course, is growing purchasing power
for the masses. For that to happen, the region will have to put
together a string of years of strong growth, not just
flash-in-the-pan results. ``They need stability and balanced
budgets for 10 or 15 years before a broad base of consumers
emerges. Think what happens when you create a middle class in Latin
America that can buy goods,'' Merrill Lynch analyst Eduardo Cabrera
says. ``The potential is tremendous.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, a class of consumers that cannot buy goods is
``middle'' only as in ``middle of nowhere.''

ADVERTISING: HITCHING WEB SITES TO A STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember Carl Sagan's singsong declarations about space being
filled with ``billions and billions'' of stars? Cyberspace is now
becoming filled with stars too, as a lengthening list of dot-com
marketers center their advertising on celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Famous faces and voices are peddling Web sites,
electronic-commerce companies, PCs, search engines and e-tailers _
almost anything interactive- or Internet-related. They range from
immediately recognizable (Donald Trump) to nostalgic favorites
(Barry White) to hip semi-celebrities (the singer Seal).
</P>
<P>
   The trend is not unexpected if dot-com advertising is considered
to be mimicking the model established by pitches for traditional
products like packaged goods.
</P>
<P>
   The initial phase is to inculcate the name, usually by
repetition and spelling: ``Remember, that's
w-w-w-dot-beauteesoap-dot-com. And don't forget, `beautee' has
three E's.'' Then comes the phase of differentiating one brand from
another, particularly in categories where the participants are
proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   And what better way to try doing that than renting some star
power, a device known as borrowed interest? If Amos and Andy could
make Americans brush with Pepsodent toothpaste, and Ozzie and
Harriet make them snap pictures with Kodak film, why can't Sophia
Loren make shopping at www.giftcertificates.com chic and Dr. Joyce
Brothers make buying computers at www.cozone.com seem like a
no-brainer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are inundated with dot-com this and dot-com that,''
said Joseph Park, chief executive at Kozmo.com in New York, a
company specializing in so-called urban delivery services. ``One of
the key challenges is to build credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A celebrity subconsciously brings credibility and legitimacy
to whatever claims are being made,'' he added. A humorous
television commercial for Kozmo.com by DiMassimo Brand Advertising
in New York presents Lee Majors as a contemporary version of Steve
Austin, the character he played on ``The Six Million Dollar Man''
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dot-coms are using celebrities to bring the familiar to the
world of the unknown,'' said Kathy Delaney, partner and executive
creative director at Deutsch Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these dot-com companies are brand-spanking-new,'' she
added. ``The celebrities lend immediate recognizability.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch is introducing a television and print campaign for the
Encyclopedia Britannica Web site (www.britannica.com) that features
Seal, Ms. Taylor, Norman Mailer, Anjelica Huston and Francis Ford
Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities are brands, and their brands can drive brands,''
said Richard Kirshenbaum, co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond &AMP;
Partners in New York, an agency with many dot-com clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest thing is the merging of commerce and entertainment
to create content that consumers remember,'' he added. ``So if
content equals entertainment and celebrities equal entertainment,
therefore content equals celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, the stars have an obvious link to the
dot-coms they promote. For example, a campaign for
Barnesandnoble.com presents authors and entertainers whose books
and compact discs are sold at its Web site (www.bn.com). In
addition to White, the husky-voiced singer, they include the
mystery writer Sue Grafton, the law novelist Scott Turow and the
chef-turned-scribe Emeril Lagasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using a spokesperson who may or may not like the
product,'' said Carl Rosendorf, senior vice president at
Barnesandnoble.com in New York. ``Our spokespeople are the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relevance of the person is most important here,'' he
added. ``At the same time, we're giving the buying-online process
some personality and style.'' The campaign is created by the New
York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of
the Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the celebrities are relevant to where we're spending
most of our money,'' said Len Short, executive vice president for
advertising and brand management at Charles Schwab in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Because Schwab ``bought time in some key sports properties,'' he
added, the brokerage firm's commercials include the football
players Jason Sehorn and Shannon Sharpe and the tennis players Mary
Joe Fernandez and Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   ``The celebrities put us in the event,'' Short said, ``but the
point isn't celebrities. It's that we show them to be surprisingly
intelligent about investing'' _ because they are Schwab customers,
natch. The Schwab spots are created by BBDO New York, part of the
BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get a celebrity for celebrity's sake may bring a bit
of attention to a brand, but it does little or nothing for the
brand in the long term,'' said Ted Sann, co-chief executive and
chief creative officer at BBDO New York, which is known for
star-infused campaigns for Pepsico Inc. brands like Frito-Lay
snacks and Pepsi-Cola soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the same as for general brand advertising,'' he
added. ``There has to be a brand positioning before you hire a
celebrity, which the celebrity has to fit. That was the case with
Cindy Crawford and Ray Charles and Michael J. Fox for Pepsi and
Diet Pepsi.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   How then does Ms. Loren fit with Giftcertificates.com?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a media environment that's so cluttered, especially this
season, you've got to hit as hard as you can,'' said Mark Paviluk,
vice president and group management supervisor on the company's
account at Grey Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what could be more impactful than the most beautiful woman
in the world, who appeals to everyone from the housewife in Des
Moines to the Chanel shopper in Manhattan?'' he asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   For Cozone.com, a unit of CompUSA, a campaign features Trump,
Dr. Brothers and the basketball star David Robinson, all depicted
as fish out of water: Trump, for example, taking a pottery class,
and Ms. Brothers on a turkey shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities often get used too much in advertising,'' said
Edward Boches, chief creative officer at the Cozone.com agency,
Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea here is that just because the celebrity is good at
one thing, it doesn't necessarily mean he or she is good at other
things, like buying computers,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sometimes stars are part of campaigns because they are
stakeholders in the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi Goldberg, for instance, is a part owner in a
gift-certificate Web site, Flooz.com, so she appears in the
advertising by Hanft Byrne Raboy &AMP; Partners in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And members of the NFL Quarterback Club _ present and past
players like Bernie Kosar of the Cleveland Browns, Warren Moon of
the Kansas City Chiefs and Ricky Williams of the New Orleans Saints
_ will be featured in a campaign by Organic in New York for Pseudo
Programs, an Internet broadcaster that uses streaming media on a
Web site (www.pseudo.com). Pseudo has scheduled a live show on the
site at 11 a.m. (Eastern time) Tuesday to promote its coming QB
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an endorsement deal,'' said Jeanne Meyer, senior
vice president for marketing at Pseudo in New York. ``The
Quarterback Club is making a cash investment and Bernie Kosar is
joining our board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. That's another trend, executives who appear in
ads for the companies they own.

JOHN PAUL STAPP, 89, `FASTEST MAN ON EARTH' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. John Paul Stapp, an Air Force medical researcher who rode a
rocket-powered sled at a speed faster than a .45-caliber bullet in
an experiment to test the limits of human endurance, died at his
home in Alamogordo, N.M. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp was known as the ``fastest man on earth'' for his 1954
ride, though the speed has since been surpassed, and it was never
accepted by auto racing officials as an official land speed record.
The speed was impressive, though. Stapp accelerated in five seconds
from a standstill to 632 mph. The sled then decelerated to a dead
stop in 1.4 seconds, subjecting Stapp to pressures 40 times the
pull of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   He became an immediate celebrity. The New York Herald Tribune
called him ``a gentleman who can stop on a dime and give you 10
cents change.''
</P>
<P>
   He won what will perhaps be even more lasting fame in a test
five years earlier, when he suffered injuries owing to a mistake by
a Capt. Murphy. The result: Murphy's Law.
</P>
<P>
   His 1954 experiment has been compared with being in an
automobile crashing into a wall at 50 mph with the shock of the
impact lasting 18 times as long. The sudden stop was accomplished
with the use of bucket scoops underneath the sled that dug into a
trough of water.
</P>
<P>
   How did it feel? ``It's like being assaulted in the rear by a
fast freight train,'' Stapp said. What did he think about as he
listened to the countdown? ``I said to myself, `Paul, it's been a
good life,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he was blinded, but recovered his sight in a
couple of hours. He ended up with two black eyes because his
eyeballs had shot forward in their sockets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ride he had worried that he might become permanently
blind. ``I practiced dressing and undressing with the lights out so
if I was blinded I wouldn't be helpless,'' he said in a 1985
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of this and 28 other high-speed rides was to study
the effects of bailing out of airplanes at supersonic speeds and to
find ways of keeping pilots safer.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments were just the most famous chapter in Stapp's
lifelong mission of testing the limits of human tissue in order to
make transportation safer. The results of his research helped in
areas as diverse as improving seat belts in cars and developing the
medical and psychological tests for choosing the first team of
Mercury astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   He became an early advocate of seat belts and shoulder harnesses
in cars and argued unsuccessfully that airlines should seat
passengers backward so that the entire back could absorb the shock
of a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp's views were also sought on the question of whether
traveling at the speed of light slowed aging, as Einstein had
theorized. He thought not.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp, who was known for his razor-sharp wit, suffered an injury
in the experiment that inspired Murphy's Law, after a somewhat less
rapid sled ride in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant, Capt. Edward Murphy Jr., had designed a harness to
strap the rider in. The harness held 16 sensors to measure the
acceleration, or G-force, on different parts of the body. There
were exactly two ways each sensor could be installed. Murphy did
each one the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that when Stapp staggered off the rocket sled
with bloodshot eyes and bleeding sores, all the sensors registered
zero. He had been restrained in vain.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught Murphy proclaimed the original version of the
famous maxim: ``If there are two or more ways to do something and
one of those results in a catastrophe, then someone will do it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapp was born in Bahia, Brazil, the son of Baptist
missionaries. When he was 13, his parents enrolled him in the San
Marcos Baptist Academy in Texas. At Baylor University in Waco,
Texas, he began majoring in English, but then he nursed a
2-year-old cousin with severe burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I had ever seen anyone die,'' Stapp
said. ``I decided right then I wanted to be a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with a science degree but could not afford to go to
medical school, so he stayed at Baylor and earned a master's degree
in zoology. He then earned a doctorate in biophysics at the
University of Texas. At 29, he entered medical school at the
University of Minnesota, where he earned a degree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he joined the Air Force. He became fascinated with
``aviation medicine,'' which addressed the effects that
ever-increasing speeds and heights were having on the bodies and
minds of fliers.
</P>
<P>
   This led to his assignment in 1947 to Edwards Air Force Base in
California, where he began working with a rocket-propelled sled on
rails. He used a dummy for the first 32 trial runs before
attempting his first ride. The next day he doubled his speed.
</P>
<P>
   He was eventually transferred to Holloman Air Force Base in New
Mexico, where he got an even faster sled. Though he had begun to
let other volunteers take many of the rides, he suffered broken
ribs, hemorrhages in one eye, a concussion, an abdominal hernia, a
fractured coccyx and a shattered wrist. Because of concerns about
his health, the Air Force grounded him after his fastest ride,
overriding his requests that he be allowed to try for 1,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp served in medical advisory and staff positions with the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National
Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, among others. His many awards
included the Medal of Technology, presented to him by President
Bush in 1991. He was president of the American Rocket Society and
wrote more than 50 technical articles.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Stapp Foundation, he led the annual Stapp Car
Crash Conference, which brought together automotive engineers,
trauma surgeons and other experts to examine how people died in car
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to marry until the rocket sled experiments ended. In
1958, he married Lillian Lanese, who had danced with the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo. She survives him, as does his brother,
Wilford, of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp once said that the only lasting effects of his daredevil
experiments ``are all the lunches and dinners I have to go to
now.''

 Por SALLY BOWEN y DOUGLASS STINSON, con BETH RUBENSTEIN en Buenos
Aires y JAMES WILSON en Panama 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features)  &HT;    LIMA _ Blanca y Jaime Gorenstein se consideran de clase media.
``O por lo menos nos considerabamos asi,'' dice Blanca. Cuando se
casaron, el negocio de Jaime, que tenia tres empleados, llevaba
tres anos importando piezas para automoviles. A principio le fue
bien, pero la situacion se deterioro hasta que tuvo que cerrar el
negocio.
 &HT;    Ahora Jaime trabaja en ventas, pero su salario es variable y los
US$400 mensuales que Blanca gana de secretaria son esenciales. Los
amigos a quienes les va mejor venden propiedades para conseguir
capital y mantener sus negocios.
 &HT;    ``Solo hay para las primeras necesidades,'' dice Blanca. Los
Gorenstein cancelaron su cuenta corriente y no tienen tarjetas de
credito, solo una cuenta frugal en la tienda por departamentos de
la localidad. A Blanca le cuesta trabajo recordar cual fue la mayor
compra que hizo para la casa. ``En los ultimos seis o siete anos no
hemos comprado nada. Al contrario, nos robaron hace tres anos y no
pudimos reponer el televisor grande; seguimos viendo el chico.''
 &HT;    El retrato de la clase media latinoamericana no ha salido como
se penso al principio. En la ultima decada, los partidarios de la
liberalizacion economica afirmaban que sus programas reducirian la
pobreza y crearian empleos, elevando a las masas que trabajaban
solo para subsistir a la categoria de consumidores de clase media.
Diez anos de evidencias indican otra cosa. La brecha entre ricos y
pobres crece con mas rapidez que nunca. En varios paises el
desempleo ha llegado a niveles record.
 &HT;    El Pronostico de Consenso de LATIN TRADE muestra que las
economias de la region, tras tocar fondo este ano, deben iniciar un
proceso de recuperacion. Pero los modestos pronosticos de
crecimiento (no mas del 4 por ciento de crecimiento del PIB en
Chile y Peru) estan muy por debajo del crecimiento de casi el 10
por ciento logrado a principios de la decada. Ademas, el aumento de
la poblacion sigue superando al rendimiento economico, y los
perfiles de familias de clase media refuerzan la percepcion de que
los individuos sienten la crisis en carne propia.
 &HT;    Los expertos de Strategy Research, una firma de investigacion de
mercado que se especializa en Latinoamerica, afirman que muchas
companias malinterpretaron la avalancha de gastos del consumidor
que tuvo lugar a principios de los anos 90 y pensaron que era una
senal de que la clase media latinoamericana habia madurado. ``El
crecimiento de la clase media, eso es lo que todo el mundo quiere
oir,'' dice John A. Holcombe, vicepresidente de Strategy Research.
``Pero les decimos que tienen que entender el mercado.'' El alud de
compras de articulos como autos, lavadoras, televisores grandes,
etc., se debio a la demanda reprimida, combinada con un auge de la
estabilidad, la confianza del consumidor y las facilidades de
credito.
 &HT;    En Estados Unidos, la mitad de los ingresos familiares se
destina al pago del alquiler o la hipoteca y a los costos del
transporte, generalmente al prestamo, el seguro y el mantenimiento
del auto. Los latinoamericanos no tienen que cubrir muchos de estos
gastos: los matrimonios jovenes viven con los padres, usan el
transporte publico y no se preocupan de cosas como el seguro de
salud. Por eso, cuando llegan tiempos de auge economico, como a
principios de esta decada, tienen mas dinero para comprar articulos
de lujo, que las familias norteamericanas de ingresos medios
consideran normales, como una secadora o un estereo.
 &HT;    La realidad, dice Holcombe, es que el poder adquisitivo en
America Latina es hoy similar al de mediados de los anos 70. Para
los consumidores, la decada perdida de America Latina amenaza con
extenderse. ``En Latinoamerica, el problema es que la gente no
tiene dinero,'' dijo Jose Gonzalez, de CLSA Global Emerging Markets
refiriendose a las perspectivas economicas.
 &HT;    Los gobiernos han respondido como casi siempre: manipulando las
estadisticas. Como practicamente no tienen mas alternativa que
acatar la orden de los mercados financieros de privatizar y
apretarse el cinturon, los gobiernos han disfrazado el fracaso
socioeconomico cambiando la definicion del nivel de pobreza y de
desempleo, con lo que lograron dar la impresion de que ambos
indices se habian reducido notablemente en toda la region.
 &HT;    Esa maniobra mejoro la perspectiva macroeconomica, pero no las
ganancias empresariales. Los negocios que dependian de una clase
media saludable, como las cadenas minoristas y los fabricantes de
autos, no han tocado las cifras que habian previsto. Aunque las
ventas de autos se han desplomado en Brasil y Argentina este ano,
por ejemplo, las companias justifican los miles de millones en
inversiones afirmando que son imprescindibles para alcanzar el
reconocimiento de la marca cuando finalmente llegue el auge. ``Es
un mercado viable,'' dice Ivette de Reubens, gerente regional de
mercadeo de Microsoft. ``Solo que no tan desarrollado como en
Estados Unidos.''
 &HT;    Los exitos de esta decada los han cosechado empresas que venden
productos que todo el mundo necesita y puede pagar.
Colgate-Palmolive y Procter &AMP; Gamble venden paquetes de champu y
detergente pequenos y baratos. Unilever vende muchas mas paletas de
helado que galones de chocolate, pero los margenes de ganancias de
este tipo de producto barato al menudeo son saludables.
 &HT;    El minorista mexicano Elektra tomo otra ruta: financiar
electrodomesticos caros con bajos pagos mensuales que permitian
hasta a los mas pobres comprar un refrigerador o un televisor. Con
tasas de interes que a menudo sobrepasan el 100 por ciento anual,
es mas lucrativo vender los articulos a plazos.
 &HT;    En el extremo de Lima opuesto a la casa de los Gorenstein, el
corredor de bolsa Charles Fyfe tiene lo que parece ser el empleo
tipico en una sociedad de clase media en vias de desarrollo. Pero
vender acciones de companias peruanas a los inversionistas es su
trabajo de dia. Fyfe tambien tiene intereses en varias empresas
pequenas orientadas al mercado de los articulos baratos de higiene
personal, como una compania que distribuye pequenos envases de
champu en los barrios marginales de Lima. ``Si uno quiere hacerse
rico en estos paises, tiene que venderle a los pobres,'' afirma.
Cuenta la anecdota de un companero de estudios que hizo fortuna
vendiendo materiales de construccion en pequenas cantidades.
Llevaba los ladrillos en camion a las barriadas pobres y los vendia
en efectivo.
 &HT;    En octubre de 1994, American Demographic publico un articulo
sobre la gran expansion de la clase media de Mexico. En diciembre
del mismo ano, la crisis del peso devoro subitamente todo lo que se
habia ganado. Cada dia los mexicanos veian devaluarse sus ahorros y
crecer su deuda de tarjetas de credito. Tuvieron que regresar a la
dieta de tortillas y frijoles y buscar un segundo empleo para
cubrir los costos.
 &HT;    Casi cinco anos despues, Mexico parece estar en vias de
recuperacion y las familias abrigan nuevas esperanzas. Entretanto,
Sudamerica sufre el contagio de la crisis asiatica, la caida de los
precios de los productos basicos y el derrumbe del real brasileno.
 &HT;    El empresario argentino Ruben Gonzalez ha visto bajar a la mitad
los ingresos de sus dos lavanderias. Los altibajos de la incierta
economia lo han convertido en un hombre conservador. Es soltero,
vive en una csa pequena y tiene costumbres frugales. Su auto es de
hace 15 anos y no gasta en lujos. Pero sus clientes parecen pensar
que lavar la ropa fuera de casa tambien es un lujo. ``Hace unos
anos, el negocio de las lavanderias iba mejor. Ahora la gente va a
lavar a la casa de algun familiar que tenga lavadora para evitar el
gasto adicional de la lavanderia,'' dice.
 &HT;    La recesion ha frenado el crecimiento necesario para desarrollar
la clase media en todo el continente. En Argentina, Peru y Chile no
se gana terreno, mientras Brasil y economias menores como la de
Ecuador han dado marcha atras. Los analistas dicen que Brasil se
recupera con mas rapidez de la esperada de la devaluacion, pero en
muchos sentidos los consumidores deben sufrir lo mismo que los
mexicanos durante cinco anos.
 &HT;    Los brasilenos se incorporan por miles a lo que los economistas
llaman la economia informal. Un termino mas exacto seria la
subsistencia urbana, un fenomeno muy parecido al de los campesinos
que cultivan sus parcelas para autoabastecerse y viven fuera de la
economia monetaria. En las ciudades, gente desesperada vende lo que
puede a vecinos y amigos. Por todas partes aparecen vendedores a
domicilio y expendios de comida y salones de belleza improvisados
en las casas para compensar la perdida del empleo o redondear el
sueldo. Estos productos y servicios son mas baratos, pero al mismo
tiempo se reduce la base tributaria porque las empresas informales
no pagan impuestos.
 &HT;    Los altibajos de los ultimos anos han creado esperanzas y a la
vez han hecho que la gente se resigne a una vida de mas trabajo por
menos dinero. Nadie se queja del fin de la hiperinflacion, que al
menos le ha dado un respiro a los latinoamericanos.
 &HT;    Desde luego, el ingrediente que falta es el aumento del poder
adquisitivo de las masas. Para que eso suceda, la region tendra que
disfrutar de varios anos seguidos de un vigoroso crecimiento; no
basta con resultados efimeros. ``Necesitan estabilidad y
presupuestos balanceados durante 10 o 15 anos para que aparezca una
vasta base de consumidores. Imaginense lo que sucederia si se crea
una clase media en America Latina que pueda comprar productos,''
dice Eduardo Cabrera, analista de Merrill Lynch. ``El potencial es
enorme.''
 &HT;    El problema esta en que el surgimiento de esa clase de
consumidores todavia parece un suceso muy remoto.

(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 4th grf to delete reference to Microsoft as Washington
state's largest employer)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vice President Al Gore stepped into the lion's
den Monday, facing down hundreds of Microsoft employees smarting
from the judicial finding that their company had bullied its rivals
and stifled competition. He told them just what they did not want
to hear _ that competition is fundamentally a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   With 300 people packing an auditorium on the computer giant's
campus, the vice president talked about ``unfair use of market
dominance in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector.''
He added: ``If competition is valuable, which I think it is, then
antitrust laws have a place in embodying the values of our
country.'' At another point: ``The values that are inherent in the
antitrust laws are ones that are sound, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was virtually echoing the heart of the federal government's
case against Microsoft, and the atmosphere here in the company
auditorium went icy at his words.
</P>
<P>
   Gore trooped out to Microsoft as just another candidate for
president. He was following in the footsteps of several of his
rivals, including former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, his sole
Democratic challenger, and a number of Republicans, including Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore had the added burden of representing an administration
that has ferociously pummeled Microsoft in court. Complicating his
task as a candidate is the fact that, as one questioner pointed
out, Gore is probably the most ``technologically savvy'' candidate
ever to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   He also had the misfortune to have had an earlier meeting here
rescheduled so that Monday's visit came just 10 days after Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court found in a
devastating assessment that the company has monopoly control over
PC operating systems and that it wields that power in ways that are
hurt American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, wearing a sweater and slacks, the casual attire that
Microsoft allows its employees, tried at first to avoid commenting
on the case. But the audience relentlessly questioned him about his
views. Isn't government interference more of a threat to consumers
than Microsoft? he was asked. Isn't it a dangerous invasion of
privacy when the government can cull and regurgitate someone's
e-mails to use against them in court?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most pointedly, one employee told Gore that he shared
his Democratic social values and wanted to vote for him but felt
deeply conflicted because of the administration's ``favorable
reaction to a ruling that says we're harming consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, a law professor specializing in anti-trust
cases at George Washington University, said afterward that Gore had
put himself in ``an extraordinarily difficult position,'' but, he
said, ``the issues the case raises are so fundamental to the future
of the company and of innovation that it's perfectly reasonable for
people to ask what his views are.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a precedent for commenting on such cases. When Boeing
acquired McDonnell-Douglas in 1997, Gore came to the home of Boeing
in Seattle and said the United States would fight attempts by
Europe to block the merger. Kovacic said that Gore's advocacy in
favor of Boeing's monopoly, and in favor of the American company's
pre-eminence in the aircraft sector of the economy, stood in stark
contrast to the administration's opposition in the case of
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has a lot of domestic enemies, and a lot of them are
in Silicon Valley, and they have thrown a lot of cash at both
parties, but in particular to the Democrats,'' Kovacic said.
``Microsoft has a legion of enemies who hold it in contempt. And
that's a tricky issue for the White House. Do you attack the
pre-eminent symbol of American information technology success or
safeguard the interests of their Silicon Valley opponents? It's a
tough call.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore turned the conversation to one of values, mentioning
support for research and development, dealing with inequality and
then said: ``And yet another value that I think is important in our
country is competition. And competition can be stifled both by
unwise and unhealthy government action and also by private action
on the part of companies that want to unfairly use market dominance
in one sector to stifle innovation in another sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this grim judgment, Gore has tried to portray himself as
a friend of the high-tech industry, going so far earlier this year
to proclaim himself as the father of the Internet. He has promoted
tax credits for research and development, and Monday he threw
around notions like and quantum computing and Moore's Law with
abandon. He also noted that one of his daughters, Karenna, had
worked briefly at Slate, Microsoft's online magazine. One of his
former employees, Ginny Terzano, once Gore's press secretary, has
just been hired by Microsoft to head its lobbying office in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what kind of affinity Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman, may have for Gore. Gates was not on hand for
Monday's visit, having a prior commitment at a conference. There
has been considerable debate over Gates' political leanings and
speculation that he wants to drag out the lawsuit until a new
president takes office and appoints a new chief of the Justice
Department's anti-trust division.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft gave $1.3 million last year to candidates in both
parties. Microsoft employees have been more generous to Republicans
this year than to Democrats, giving $29,000 to Bush and $13,000 to
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees who attended Monday's session with Gore
reflected the computer industry's stance that elected politics has
little to do with their success. A cluster of employees, who
declined to give their names, said they were more interested in
Gore's views on education and health care than on the anti-trust
case because, as one put it, ``the administration doesn't have much
say in the overall economic growth of the last 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's comments did not appear to win him many friends. ``I
appreciate him being honest,'' said one employee. ``But I'm not
encouraged. He was on the side of the government.''

AIMS SCORES FALL SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 and JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 9 of 10 Arizona high school sophomores failed to meet
minimum mathematics requirements last year on the AIMS test.
</P>
<P>
   On the reading portion of the statewide exam, whose results were
released Monday, 61 percent of students hit or exceeded the
necessary standard. On the writing section, 30 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   State Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham Keegan
called the results ``unsettling'' Monday, but not surprising. This
was the first year the test was given, Keegan said, and some
portions were designed for juniors and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said Arizona's teachers must continue to bring
their lessons into alignment with the academic standards reflected
on the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the students, it's the way we're teaching them,''
Keegan said. ``The schools and teachers out there need our support.
They're our front line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get behind them and give them what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said her department plans to lobby the Legislature to
extend the school year a week and add 24 hours for teacher
training.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants the state to require three years of math in high
school instead of the current two, and to fund after-school and
summer remedial programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change a direction without a map,'' Keegan said.
``This is a map.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials statewide cautioned that many sophomores had
not yet taken the math classes they needed to pass the test.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Russell was one. She had already had algebra and was
taking geometry, but Russell, a junior with a 4.0 average at Cactus
High School in Glendale, said Monday she had never seen some of the
math problems before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `OK, what is this?' I left some of it blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her classmates felt the same, Russell said. Although
Cactus students scored well in the reading and writing sections,
only 13 percent of students met math standards. Russell should get
her score late this week. &QL; 
45,000 TAKE TEST &QL; 
About 45,000 district and charter school students took AIMS _
Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards _ last April in reading,
writing and mathematics. For them, the scores will not count toward
a diploma, though the results will be noted on their transcripts.
They also can retake the test until they get a satisfactory score.
</P>
<P>
   This year's sophomores, who will take the AIMS test in the
spring, will be the first class who must pass it to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Scores fall into four categories: exceeds the standards, meets
the standards, approaches the standards and falls far short of the
standards. In order to ``meet standards'' in each of the three
subject areas, students had to score at least 500 out of a possible
800.
</P>
<P>
   Though students and parents will know what category they fall
into, the general public may not. Due to privacy laws, the
``approaches'' and ``falls far short'' groups will be lumped into
one on the school and district levels.
</P>
<P>
   Individual scores will be sent to parents over the next week by
mail or via their children. &QL; 
`WE HAVE CLEAR PICTURE' &QL; 
Teachers, administrators and state officials said the scores may
not be stellar, but they do provide a bench mark for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just really happy to finally have some information,''
said Linda Bromert, an assistant administrator in Peoria Unified
School District. ``Now we have a clear picture of what we have to
do to ensure the success of all our students.''
</P>
<P>
   Median test scores in the Peoria district exceeded state
averages. Still, Bromert said the district hopes to offer
additional help to students who are having a hard time passing the
test.
</P>
<P>
   But critics still expressed reservations about AIMS, which they
say may be too difficult and may have been launched too quickly.
They also contend that it puts non-English speaking and
special-needs students at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   John Wright, a teacher in the Window Rock Unified School
District and vice president of the state's largest teaching union,
said the test should have been given to younger grades first so
they know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, third-, fifth- and eighth-graders will take
versions of the AIMS test geared to their grade levels. &QL; 
GOOD PERFORMANCES &QL; 
Despite the generally dismal results, many of last year's
sophomores turned in performances worthy of mention.
</P>
<P>
   At Chaparral High School in the Scottsdale Unified School
District, 91 percent of the approximately 450 test-takers met or
exceed the standards in reading. At Tempe Preparatory Academy, a
Tempe charter school, 100 percent of the 30 pupils earned that
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Arizona, 63 percent of test-takers met or exceeded
the reading standards at Patagonia Union High School.
</P>
<P>
   Still, academic advisor Heidi Imhof stressed that AIMS is just
one way of measuring academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a test score. What's important is what kids can
actually do,'' Imhof said.
</P>
<P>
   In writing, Desert Vista High School in the Tempe Union High
School District had 54 percent of its test-takers over the passing
mark; 52 percent did so at Scottsdale's Desert Mountain High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that not all sophomores were going to meet the state
standards,'' Myron Marsh of the Scottsdale district said. &UR; ``But our
results indicate we've had a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one school in Arizona _ University High School in Tucson,
which caters to gifted students _ had a majority of students that
met or exceeded the standards in math. Most schools had 10 percent
or less scoring that high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' said Bob Koch, Dysart Unified School District
board president. &QL; 
POOR MATH RESULTS &QL; 
Approximately 99 percent of 124 Dysart High students failed the
math portion, but Koch said the poor scoring extended beyond his
district's boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that all over this country, children are not
learning as much as they used to to become successful members of
society,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View High School in Mesa was one of the top schools in
math scores; one-third of its students met or exceeded the
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the district said it will need the scores earlier in the
school year if the test is going to help students learn from their
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is you're supposed to remediate between tests,'' Joe
O'Reilly of Mesa Unified School District said.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan also applauded Prescott and Colorado City high schools as
well as Foothills Academy, a charter school in Cave Creek, for
their math scores.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the AIMS scores were supposed to be made public on
Wednesday. But state educators moved up the release after they were
told that a local television station planned to air the scores
later in the day. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans agreed on Monday night to
eliminate or change a series of pro-business amendments in the
year's last spending bills, even though the measures had been
sponsored by their own senators, effectively sweeping away the
next-to-last barrier to a final budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments, or riders, on the Interior Department spending
bill, had been fiercely opposed by environmentalists, and on Monday
night the riders were altered or abolished to the satisfaction of
the White House, said senior administration officials and a top
House Republican.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said last month that he would veto the bill if
it contained the amendments, which he called ``stealth attacks on
the environment.'' A senior White House official said the riders
had fallen to ``public pressure and the sense that the president
wasn't going to live with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., who is chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said, ``We think the Interior issue is
settled.'' But he warned, ``Until it is signed, sealed and filed in
the House, you can't be sure of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress and the White House worked Monday
night on one last multibillion-dollar bargain they needed to
complete a deal: a package of budget cuts and accounting devices,
known collectively as offsets, totaling about $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That would cover the costs of new programs the Republicans want,
along with the spending compromises they struck with the White
House in budget negotiations. It would also give the Republicans
political cover by allowing them to say their spending bills did
not dip into Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the Interior Department riders was reached
during a three-way conference call among the White House budget
director, Jack Lew; Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.; and Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was frustrated by the outcome, said his spokeswoman,
Cynthia Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation ``closed up the things we thought were a huge
problem,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a rider allowing mining companies to dump
thousands of tons of waste on federal land. It would have
effectively erased a 1997 Interior Department ruling limiting dump
sites to five acres per mine. The Republicans agreed to let the
limit apply to all applications for mining permits filed after the
1997 ruling, meaning it would cover more than 300 applications so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Other mining regulations, which would have been nullified by the
riders, will take effect in April. They impose new environmental
restrictions and financial requirements on mining operations to
prevent companies from walking away from played-out mines.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's agreement also appears to end a long and
hard-fought effort by Senate Republicans on behalf of energy
companies. They sought to block the Interior Department from making
companies pumping oil and gas from federal lands pay royalties
based on the market price of the oil. Some companies set the price
themselves, saving a total of about $5 million a month in fees owed
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The new pricing scheme will go into effect March 15. The
chairmen of the Senate and House Appropriations committees said
they would oppose any new attempt to alter it.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also said Monday night that Clinton would kill
any budget deal that contained a proposal by Sen. Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations
Committee, to allow his state's coal miners to keep dumping wastes
in valley streams.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's agreement also eliminated another rider that
would have blocked a rule barring new roads in 40 million acres of
national forest until 2001, when the next administration takes
power.
</P>
<P>
   A few Republican riders remain. One stops the Interior
Department from prohibiting lead mining along the Ozark National
Scenic Riverways in Missouri. Another automatically renews
ranchers' grazing permits on federal lands for 10 years while
federal environmental reviews are conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The final deal also doubled to about $400 million the money that
will go to one of President Clinton's favorite projects, the Lands
Legacy Program, which buys scenic or environmentally sensitive land
threatened by development.
</P>
<P>
   In another policy debate over the spending bills, Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the Banking Committee, and Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers have built a framework for providing
hundreds of millions of dollars in debt relief for 41 of the
world's poorest countries. Under the deal, the International
Monetary Fund would revalue its gold reserves, generating a fund to
provide money that Congress had denied in earlier budget talks.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the White House and the Republicans also agreed to
spend $550 million for those who had heavy losses from flooding
after Hurricane Floyd. The money would go directly to North
Carolina, New Jersey and other hard-hit states.

ARMSTRONG'S FUTURE BRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MALIBU, Calif. _ When Lorenzo Romar resigned as the Pepperdine
men's basketball coach in March to take the head job at Saint
Louis, some returning players wondered how their playing time would
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong wasn't one of them because he didn't play a
minute for the Waves in 1998-99. One of Romar's top recruits the
year before out of Vallejo High, Armstrong didn't qualify
academically and sat out his freshman season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Armstrong could see a lot of playing time at point guard.
Head coach Jan van Breda Kolff is projecting Armstrong to be a
significant contributor when the season opens Nov. 20 against Long
Beach State at Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong is a player . . . we're looking at,'' said van Breda
Kolff, who begins his first season at Pepperdine and seventh
overall as a Division I head coach. ``He has the ability to be a
really special player for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 6-foot-5 and 190 pounds, was recruited by New Mexico,
Oregon, USC and Washington out of high school. Van Breda Kolff said
Armstrong seems to be fitting into the Waves' motion offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves return point guards Tezale Archie and Robert Fomby,
who both saw considerable playing time at the end of last season
when All-West Coast Conference performer Jelani Gardner slumped.
</P>
<P>
   __ World traveler: Gardner reported to the Ft. Wayne Fury of the
Continental Basketball Association, where he's going to try and
impress NBA teams that passed on him in the June draft.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was playing for a pro team in Israel in September before
he came back to Los Angeles, where he lives with his girlfriend and
young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, who averaged a team-leading 13.8 points per game as a
senior and helped lead the Waves to a 19-13 record and their first
postseason appearance in five years, said he was frustrated with
not getting picked in the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is a business once you get out of college,'' he
said.

IBF WILL GIVE TITLE BELT TO LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lawyers for Lennox Lewis and the International Boxing
Federation worked out an agreement Monday that would allow Lewis to
keep the organization's heavyweight world championship belt and
maintain a unified title.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who held the World Boxing Council title, defeated Evander
Holyfield on a 12-round unanimous decision on Saturday night in Las
Vegas to win the World Boxing Association and IBF championships.
But the IBF withheld its belt because Lewis' promoters refused to
pay a $300,000 sanctioning fee directly to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' promoters agreed to pay the sanctioning fee Monday and
mailed the check. The IBF gave Lewis the belt and now recognizes
him as its champion, according to Milton Chwasky, Lewis' New
York-based lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Krovatin, a lawyer for the IBF president, Robert Lee Sr.,
said the $300,000 sanctioning fee for Lewis had arrived at the
group's East Orange, N.J., headquarters. ``If the check clears, the
IBF will confer the belt on Lewis,'' Krovatin said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Lewis, 34, has all three major titles, he must defend
them against the No. 1 contenders from the WBC, WBA and IBF in what
the organizations call mandatory defenses. If Lewis refuses to
fight the mandatory bouts, the organizations can strip him of the
titles, declare them vacant and have other boxers fight for the
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Panos Eliades, Lewis' London-based promoter, said that the WBC
considered the fight against Holyfield a mandatory defense. So
Lewis will not have to fight the WBC's No. 1 contender for another
year. Eliades said he thought the IBF and the WBA should have
box-offs to determine who should fight Lewis for their heavyweight
titles. Eliades will pitch his idea to the WBA at its convention in
Panama next week.
</P>
<P>
   The WBA's mandatory challenger for Lewis is Henry Akinwande. Two
years ago Lewis and Akinwande met in a WBC championship fight and
Akinwande was disqualified for excessive holding and refusing to
fight. ``Akinwande is not a good fight,'' Eliades said. ``No one
wants to see that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fighters who will be lining up for a shot at Lewis in
the next year are David Tua, No. 1 in the IBF; John Ruiz, No. 1 in
the WBC; Michael Grant, No. 2 in the WBC; Vladimir Klitschko, the
World Boxing Organization champion, and Mike Tyson, the No. 1
contender in the WBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Klitschko and he wants to fight Lennox, and Lennox wants
to fight Michael Grant,'' Eliades said. ``We'd love to have those
fights in London. Lennox will fight anybody, but he doesn't want to
fight nobodies. He can't get motivated for those kinds of fights
against guys like Akinwande. But I'll take Grant in London as
Lennox's next fight. I don't think Grant is that good. He's strong,
but he's not very clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiBella, senior vice president of programming for HBO
Sports, said the cable network was not interested in televising bad
bouts just for the sake of Lewis' keeping the titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lennox would like to give up one or more of the titles,
we'd support him,'' DiBella said. ``With or without the belts we'd
be interested in seeing him fight Tua, Grant, Klitschko or Derrick
Jefferson.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lewis will be in New York on Wednesday and DiBella plans to meet
with him to determine what Lewis wants to do. Eliades said Lewis
wanted to remain busy, fighting once every six months, regardless
of what happened with the mandatory title bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is also expected to attend the bout between Grant and
Andrew Golota on Saturday night in Atlantic City, N.J. If Grant
gets past Golota, that could pave the way for a Lewis-Grant bout
early next year. Lewis has already beaten Golota, knocking him out
in the first round two years ago. Golota admitted taking a shot of
lidocaine in his left knee before fighting Lewis that night.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he would like to fight Tyson, because he represents
one of the best fighters of Lewis' era. But Eliades said he didn't
believe Tyson was ready to fight Lewis right now.

EARLY SELECTIONS INSPIRATIONAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an effort to focus on UCLA as quickly as
possible, USC coach Paul Hackett named juniors Brent McCaffrey and
Markus Steele captains for the game just moments after the Trojans
defeated Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   The move might be viewed as inspirational, but it also could be
interpreted as a possible slight at the seniors, who were
criticized earlier this season by Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Player reaction was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hackett's making the decisions and Brent's playing well,
so I guess he deserves it. I was just happy I got to be a captain
twice,'' senior offensive lineman Travis Claridge said. ``I think
it would be cool for all the seniors to go out there, but we can't
do that. In Coach Hackett's defense, guys that are playing well
deserve to represent us.''
</P>
<P>
   Said senior wide receiver Windrell Hayes: ``I wasn't really
surprised. I don't think he goes by seniority. I don't really think
about it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another player, who asked not to be identified: ``I think
a senior deserves to be captain. Of course, we've talked about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seniors _ tailback Chad Morton and free safety David Gibson
_ will also represent USC along with junior strong safety Ife
Ohalete, because they are permanent captains.
</P>
<P>
   __ Collarbone comparison: Hackett said USC and UCLA faced
similar situations by losing their starting quarterbacks with
broken collarbones, although USC lost to Oregon and UCLA defeated
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what happened to us in Oregon. But we were on
the road and they were at home. Washington was nice enough to turn
the ball over four times,'' Hackett said. ``I would say they have a
lot of momentum with (Ryan McCann). They did a good job of
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's shaping up as an exciting game. There's so many
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring on Wolverines? Hackett said he had no objections to
USC's attempts to gain a spot in the Kickoff Classic against
Michigan to open next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be happier if it happens,'' Hackett said. ``We
would start practicing earlier and Carson (Palmer) would get to
practice sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nearing 1,000: Tailback Chad Morton needs 86 yards in USC's
final two games to gain 1,000 yards. He would be the Trojans' third
tailback of the 1990s to reach 1,000 yards, joining Mazio Royster
(1,168 yards in 1990) and Delon Washington (1,109 in '95).
</P>
<P>
   __ Dubious record: For only the fourth time in the USC-UCLA
rivalry, both teams are entering the game with losing records. The
last time it happened was in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   __ Singled out: Hackett was impressed with the efforts of
defensive back Antuan Simmons and converted tight end Matt Welch
against Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons went 72 plays despite having a sore back, and Welch
participated in 48 plays after Antoine Harris went out with a
strained hamstring.

U.S. TO PERMANENTLY CLOSE TROUBLED NUCLEAR REACTOR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ The federal government is planning to
permanently close an aging nuclear reactor at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory that has been shut since 1996 when the
authorities discovered it had been leaking radioactive water into
the ground, federal officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is expected to announce the
closing of the reactor, known as the High Flux Beam Reactor, on
Tuesday, an Energy Department official said. The rest of the
laboratory, which is owned by the department, is to remain open for
scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear reactor was used for more than three decades for
groundbreaking research in physics, medicine and biology. But it
has drawn stiff opposition from its neighbors in Suffolk County, on
Long Island, along with environmentalists and politicians, since
officials learned that tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen,
had been leaking from the tiled tank beneath the reactor that held
spent fuel. The discovery of the leak, and of official inaction
that kept it from being detected earlier, played a major role in
the government's decision in 1997 to dismiss the organization that
had managed the lab for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Energy Department official stressed that the reactor was
not considered unsafe, and said that the decision to close it was
based largely on economic issues. The department, which has been
prohibited by Congress from restarting the lab for the last three
years, has had to spend $23 million a year just to keep the reactor
on ``standby status,'' the official said. And a departmental
analysis determined that reopening the reactor would be even more
costly and take several years, the official added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was not made with any sense that the reactor was
a threat to the public or the environment,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The High Flux Beam Reactor at Brookhaven was much smaller than
nuclear reactors built to create power, but it operated on the same
principle. Atoms of uranium-235, a natural but unstable element,
were used at the reactor to throw off subatomic particles called
neutrons that hit other atoms and split them, releasing still more
neutrons and sustaining a chain reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But if the means of the two types of nuclear plants were
similar, their ends were completely different. Power plants use
nuclear reactions to create heat that can be converted into
electricity; they produce neutrons only to sustain the chain
reaction. At Brookhaven, heat was considered a waste product, and
the whole purpose of the reactor was to make a stream of neutrons.
Those neutrons were then directed against solid objects in a series
of experiments to learn about the internal structures of the
objects.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments that were conducted with the reactor helped create a
number of drugs used to treat bone cancer and other ailments;
others helped scientists learn about the structure of solid
materials.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in December 1996, when officials learned about
the leaking tritium. The 5,300-acre Brookhaven National Laboratory,
in Upton, N.Y., had already been identified as an environmental
problem and declared a federal Superfund cleanup site. It had been
dealing with pesticide contamination of the ground water to its
southeast and chemical-solvent contamination to its southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Energy Department released a report that found
Brookhaven National Laboratory had sometimes sacrificed safety in
the name of science. The report cited the laboratory for failing to
respond to the discovery of high tritium levels as far back as
1986. Furthermore, it said that the lab delayed on promises to
install monitoring wells that could have detected the problem much
earlier than 1996. Associated Universities, the nonprofit group
that had administered the lab since it opened, was replaced by
Brookhaven Science Associates, led by the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   All along, however, the Energy Department has maintained that
the tritium leak posed no serious health risk to neighbors of the
lab. The pool that was leaking was emptied, and the tritium that
remains in the ground will become less radioactive over time,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department official said that the department expected
Brookhaven to remain ``vibrant'' even without the use of the High
Flux Beam Reactor. Last month, the laboratory opened the world's
biggest particle accelerator, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider,
which sends beams of gold ions, at nearly the speed of light, on a
collision course through a 2.4-mile-long tunnel. When the ions
collide, scientists hope they will be able to observe conditions
similar to those that existed at the birth of the universe.
