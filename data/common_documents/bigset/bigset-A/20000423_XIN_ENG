<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Campaigners Call for Protection of Environmental Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi environment experts,
activists, lawyers and judges Saturday at a seminar underlined the
need for proper implementation of the laws which aim at protecting
environment and ensuring people's rights to live in a pollution-
free atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
They also urged for working out an environmental strategy to
reduce pollution which caused a range of hazards to people's
health and habitat. The seminar was jointly organized by the
Ministry of Environment and Forests, Bangladesh Environmental
Lawyers' Association and United Nations Development Program to
mark the Earth Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
Justice A.M. Mahmudur Rahman said the environment issue should
be the prime agenda of the country as the global environment is
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"Protection of environment and safeguarding of the economy
should be the integral part of the government development agenda,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
While addressing another seminar on "Climate Change: How to
Face It" organized by Forum of Environmental Journalists of
Bangladesh to mark the Earth Day, U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh
John Holzman called upon Bangladesh to play its card to bring both
developed and developing nations in the productive and realistic
climate change negotiation by pursuing a win-win approach for
facing the threat of global warning and sea-level rise.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that in Bangladesh, the United States has taken
two initiatives as the U.S. President Bill Clinton announced
during his just-concluded visit, one is that Bangladesh will be
the first country to participate in the Tropical Forest Program of
the United States and the other is Clean Energy initiative.
</P>
<P>
The United States is also working with Bangladesh in studying
climate change and formulating an action plan, he added.

KATHMANDU, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepali environmentalists called
for replacement of fossil fuel to reduce the pollution in the
country at a rally organized here Saturday by the Earth Day-2000
Nepal Committee to mark the earth day.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "Clean Energy to Solve the Problem of Climate
Change," the rally called for replacement of fossil fuel and
complying with pollution standards set by the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of People representing more than 50 organizations,
including an environment conservation society, school and college
students participated in the rally, which was aimed at arousing
people's awareness for environment protection.
</P>
<P>
"We are focusing on air pollution this year," said Amond
Plkhrel, an organizer of the rally.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of polluting vehicles are still plying in the
Kathmandu valley even though the government has taken measures to
ban the vehicles. As a result, the air quality in the valley is
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, when the amount of carbon particles reach
553 per million air particles, there could be serious problems.
They said the current level of particles is 350 per million in the
valley.
</P>
<P>
Some energy experts suggested hydropower should be the primary
energy replacement, as it is the most pollution free. Nepal has a
capacity of 83 million kilowatt in hydropower.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal could set an example to the world if it forgoes fossil
fuel and adopts more environmentally friendly fuel," said Bikash
Pandey, an energy expert.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels
said Saturday they had overrun a strategic military complex in
northern Jaffna peninsula after two days of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam claimed that
they killed at least 1,000 soldiers and captured Elephant Pass
base and the adjoining Iyakachchi camp.
</P>
<P>
"Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass bases forming the giant military
complex of the Sri Lankan army on the gateway to Jaffna fell to
the combat formations of the Liberation Tigers this afternoon,"
said the rebels in a statement from their London office.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate comment from the government.
</P>
<P>
Military Spokesman Brig. Palitha Fernando said he could not
comment on the rebel claims and was waiting reports from the
northern war zone.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's new victory followed a government announcement on
Friday that a retired army general, Rohan Daluwatte, was appointed
to take the combined leadership of three forces as well as the
police.
</P>
<P>
In another major military takeover on Thursday, Deputy Chief of
Staff Major General Janaka Perera was appointed commander of the
army's northern forces to halt an ongoing offensives by LTTE
rebels.
</P>
<P>
General Perera, one of Sri Lanka's most decorated war heroes,
was in charge of the forces that ousted the LTTE rebels from their
stronghold of Jaffna in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the two major appointments seemed to have failed to
reverse the situation in the battle field.
</P>
<P>
"The conquest of Elephant Pass complex, the largest and well-
entrenched military base in the north, signified a major military
victory of the Tigers in the current campaign against Sri Lankan
troops in Jaffna," the LTTE said.
</P>
<P>
It said the fall of this crucial base at the gate of Jaffna
will facilitate the LTTE to gain its strategic goal of retaking
their former stronghold of Jaffna which they lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Elephant Pass is a strategic causeway linking the northern
Jaffna peninsula with the rest of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE did not mention its casualties in the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, earlier on Saturday, the Ministry of Defense in a
statement said at least 62 rebels were killed during the last two
days when they tried to overrun military positions around the
Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
It said two government soldiers were killed and 31 wounded in
fierce battles at the southern end of the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass bases
had a combined strength of about two divisions or at least 15,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have been trying
to seize the Elephant Pass causeway as the first step to regain
control of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The battles around Elephant Pass, which began in last November,
escalated in late March with heavy casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The renewed clashes in northern Sri Lanka came amid moves by
Norway to bring the LTTE and the government here to the
negotiating table. Both sides have agreed to Norwegian involvement,
but dates for direct talks have not been agreed.

<HEADLINE> Russian General Against Talks With Maskhadov of Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian general said Sunday
that he is against talks with Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
because that would mean a betray of the federal army.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Gennady Troshev, commander of the Russian
federal forces in the Northern Caucasus, told NTV television that
his troops the breakaway republic are destroying rebel leaders
Khattab and Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebel ringleaders are concealing themselves in the
Chechen mountains along with the remnants of their groups. "The
task is to find and destroy them," Troshev said, referring to
Khattab and Basayev.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the federal troops would not seek to destroy
Maskhadov, but "he cannot be seated at the negotiating table today.
"
</P>
<P>
He described Maskhadov as a "bandit" because of a statement he
made recently.
</P>
<P>
"Today we can say with pride that the Russians have not won.
Our duty is to beat them. The main task is to weaken and stop them,
and then begin a new war with them. They should be hammered day
and night,every second," Troshev quoted Maskhadov as saying in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
If the federal authorities were to "sit down to the negotiating
table with bandits, this would constitute treachery toward the
army,"Troshev said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Speaker Calls on Israel to Recognize Arab Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Jordanian House of
Deputies (the Lower House of Parliament) Abdu Hadi Majali on Sunday
called on Israel to recognize Arab rights to pave the way for
progress in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal during a meeting with visiting French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine, which was also attended by Jordanian
Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Majali commended France's efforts to back the
peace process in the region and to consolidate friendly ties with
the kingdom in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Vedrine on the current situation in the peace process
as well as Jordan's efforts to push it forward and remove obstacles
from its way, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Majali stressed the necessity for Israel to recognize the Arab
rights, including the withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories
as well as its actual acceptance of the rights of the Palestinians
to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
On Jordan's domestic issues, the speaker said his parliament is
making continuous efforts to update laws and regulations to create
the best environment for investments, and Jordan is keen to further
strengthen its cooperation with France.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vedrine described Jordan as a key player in the
peace process since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
Jordan was the second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace
deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine reaffirmed the principled stand of the French government
to back all efforts aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The French minister is expected to meet Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein before winding up his five-day visit to the kingdom on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Abdullah went to Eilat, Israel, to meet with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on bilateral economic cooperation
and ways of pushing forward the peace process on the Palestinian,
Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by the monarch to Israel since he
ascended to the throne in Febuary 1999 after his father King
Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Somali Factions to Work for Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Sunday urged Somali factions to put the country's
interest above all other considerations and deal with a Djiboutian
initiative with seriousness.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, proposed last year by Djiboutian President
Ismail Omar Guelleh, is aimed at preserving Somalia's unity and
territorial integrity and stemming bloodshed, Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Somali factions will benefit from the
efforts the Djiboutian president has been exerting to help realize
national reconciliation and peace in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Djiboutian peace plan calls on the Somali warlords to
disarm, turn their factions into political parties, and submit to
the authority of a formal legal system. It is aimed at undermining
the power of the warlords who had been the major obstacles to peace
in the civil war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid called on international and regional powers and
organizations to continue offering political and financial aid to
Somalia in an effort to help the country achieve the aspired-for
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since 1991 when former President
Siad Barre was toppled. In 1997, the world community mediated an
agreement among the Somali factions on forming a central
government. But the factions have failed to implement the agreement
due to disputes and distrust.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hopes GCC Meeting to Help Strengthen Inter- GCC Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday hoped the
forthcoming consultative meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) leaders would bring about more cooperation among the Gulf
Arab states.
</P>
<P>
During its weekly session, the Kuwaiti cabinet underlined the
importance of the GCC meeting and expressed hope the meeting's
outcome would meet the "ambitions of the GCC citizens in boosting
inter-GCC cooperation to serve their common interests and jointly
address future challenges."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the six GCC states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- are to gather in
Muscat, capital of Oman, next Saturday for their second bi-annual
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, who
will accompany Emir Sheikh Jaber for the meeting, said Sunday that
this year's consultation is "aimed at exchanging views on Gulf
affairs".
</P>
<P>
The bi-annual summit meeting was proposed by the Kuwaiti Emir
and approved by GCC leaders in December 1998 in Abu Dhabi, capital
of the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The first consultation, held without a fixed agenda in the Saudi
city of Jeddah in May last year, was preceded by a number of
bilateral contacts between the GCC leaders or their
representatives, who reviewed bilateral relations and the then
situation in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
As it was a semi-formal gathering, the GCC leaders had an easy
time in conveying views and suggestions.

<HEADLINE> Barak Terms Jordanian King's Visit as Useful, Important </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that Jordanian King Abdullah's first official
visit to Israel is both useful and important for advancing the ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah ended his visit earlier in the afternoon after a
private meeting with Barak at an Israeli navy base in the Red Sea
resort city of Eilat, about 200 kilometers south of Jerusalem,
where Barak is spending the Passover holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Hashemite ruler received a red-carpet ceremony upon his
arrival at noon. Abdullah's five-hour brief visit was the first of
its kind since he came to the throne after his father King Hussein
died of cancer in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit after his meeting with Abdullah, Barak
said that it is great and he is confident that the relations
between Israel and Jordan will enjoy a healthy development in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is important to keep cooperation at all
levels and between every sector of the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to joint economic projects, Barak pledged that there
will be a marked progress, although it is difficult to bring about
changes overnight, or even in a year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen, who is
accompanying Barak in Eilat, said that during Sunday's
consultations between Israeli and Jordanian officials, economic
cooperation were discussed.
</P>
<P>
According to Cohen, the cooperation includes a joint Eilat-Aqaba
airport, tourism projects in the Dead Sea region, and the
possibility of facilitating the commerce ties between Jordan and
the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah showed great interest in Israel's fish cultivating
farm in Eilat.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on the peace talks both on
the Israeli-Palestinian track and the Israeli-Syrian one.
</P>
<P>
In televised remarks, Barak reiterated that although the door is
still not closed for a possible resumption of the Israeli-Syrian
talks, which broke down in January, there is only a very narrow
crack still left on the door.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak said he appreciated the full support of
Jordanian leaders and Jordanian people for the peace talks between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak said that the two sides might miss another
deadline for signing a framework agreement and a final accord for
final status issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, the return of
Palestinian refugees, water, border, and security.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel and the Palestinians will reach a framework
deal in two or three months and a final agreement at the end of
this year, which is in contrast with the original deadline set in
mid-May and September respectively.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum the two sides sealed last
September, they should agree to such a deal by February 13.
However, their differences over a 6.1 percent Israeli troops
pullback from the West Bank land postponed the February deadline by
three months.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Eilat comes a week before a new session of
peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators is to be
held in Eilat after two rounds in the United States earlier failed
to bring any major breakthroughs. The third round will begin next
Sunday, and is due to continue until May 12.
</P>
<P>
Barak and several ministers in his cabinet saw the king off
later Sunday afternoon as the monarch sailed back to the Jordanian
resort of Aqaba by his royal yacht.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah initially planned to visit Israel in February but put
off his trip because of massive Israeli air strikes against Lebanon
and the impasse in the Palestinian and Syrian tracks of the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Welcomes UAE's Reopening Embassy in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Sunday welcomed the reopening of embassy in
Baghdad, Iraq, by the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the league's headquarters in Cairo,
Abdel-Meguid said the league considers UAE's step as important on
the road to clearing Arab atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The UAE on Thursday reopened its embassy in Baghdad, which had
been closed since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
It became the fourth country after Bahrain, Oman and Qatar from
the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to renew diplomatic
representation in Iraq. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the other two GCC
members, have not re-established diplomatic ties with Baghdad since
the Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said that during his visit to Kuwait, due to start
later Sunday, he would hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
al- Ahmed al-Sabah on Arab situation and the issue of the prisoners
of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has accused Iraq of still jailing 625 people from Kuwait
and some other countries who were detained during Iraq's occupation
of Kuwait from August 1990 to February 1991, which triggered the
1991 Gulf War. The Arab League has made a proposal on the
settlement of the POWs issue and asked Abdel-Meguid to reach a
mechanism in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The talks in Kuwait will also touch on the developments in the
Middle East peace process and the proposal to hold Arab summits on
a regular basis, said the chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid will travel to Bahrain following his tour of
Kuwait.

<P>
The meeting, scheduled for April 24-May 19, will be addressed
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. A total of 18 foreign
ministers and 10 deputy foreign ministers in addition to a number
of senior officials will take the floor, the U.N. confirmed over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The gathering is expected to focus on the treaty's universality,
principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament, the strengthening of the review process and
compliance by non-nuclear weapons states, U.N. Under-Secretary-
General for disarmament Affairs Jayantha Dhanapala said.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear-weapon-free zones, security assurances and safeguards
and peaceful uses of nuclear energy are also expected to be
discussed, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
Nine countries have joined the treaty since 1995,, bringing
total signatories to 187 by January 2000, leaving only four
countries, namely Cuba, India, Israel and Pakistan outside the
multilateral legal instrument.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, the two South Asian
non-NPT states in May 1998 were seen as a challenge to the
international community's efforts to eliminate the threats posed
by weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The significant event following the 1995 review is the
completion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty (CTBT) in
1996. It has been signed by 155 states and ratified by over 50 of
them.
</P>
<P>
The United States, with the largest and most advanced nuclear
arsenal, has not ratified the CTBT. The U.S. Senate rejected it in
late 1999.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged to Save N.Irish Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) - Sinn Fein has urged Britain to act
to save Northern Ireland's stalled peace process as thousands of
Irish republicans marched Sunday to mark the 1916 Easter rising
against British rule.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of supporters at a commemoration in Dublin,
one of a series of gatherings north and south of the border. Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator Martin mcGuinness said: "It is still not
too late to save the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"If the Good Friday Agreement is to be saved it is up to Tony
Blair and his government...The key to the future is in his hand,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has stalled over the lack of progress on
disarmament by Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas, which led
Britain to suspend the power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland
in February.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally, called for an end to
demands for what it termed an IRA surrender as a pre-condition for
restoring home rule.
</P>
<P>
"This farce of demanding IRA surrender must stop,"McGuinness
said in a speech at Dublin's Glasnevin cemetery where a number of
prominent republicans are buried.
</P>
<P>
"If all the guns are to be taken out of Irish politics, and
that is an honorable objective, then the only way to do it is to
prove that politics work, and that politics are allowed to work,"
he added.

<P>
The NPT was opened for signature in 1968 and entered into force
in 1970. By January 2000, a total of 187 parties had joined the
treaty, including the five nuclear weapons states.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, it has seen the biggest increase in the number of
signatories during a review period. Andorra, Angola, Brazil, Chile,
Comoros, Djibouti, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu have
added to the list of signatories, U.N. information shows.
</P>
<P>
Four states have been chosen to remain outside the treaty. They
are Cuba, India, Israel and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Review conferences have been held since 1970 at five-year
intervals. The 1995 conference endorsed the indefinite extension
of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
It decided that review conferences should look forward and back,
evaluate the results of the reviewing period, identify the areas
in which further progress should be sought, and address what might
be done to strengthen the implementation.
</P>
<P>
As agreed upon at the 1995 conference, the first measure
towards implementation was to complete negotiations on a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) no later than 1996.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was opened for signature on 24 September 1996 and has
been signed by 155 states.
</P>
<P>
The international community has a long way to go for global
disarmament as the Senate of the United States, which has the
largest and most advanced nuclear arsenal, rejected the CTBT late
last year.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battling Blazes in Manitoba, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Local Conservation Department said Sunday that the three
fires were spotted near Sprague and Lac du Bonnet.
</P>
<P>
One of the blazes threatened outlying areas of Steinbach late
Saturday before firefighters brought the grass fire under control.
</P>
<P>
"It was a concern at the time, but we put an air tanker on it
and corralled it," said Bob Buck, supervisor of fire programs for
the Conservation Department.
</P>
<P>
The supervisor did not rule out the possibility that all three
fires might be ignited by people. "There hasn't been any lightning
yet, so take it from there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg Police Saturday reported that they averted a
potentially disastrous situation by finding and detonating a cache
of dynamite.
</P>
<P>
The 49 sticks were burned up by the bomb squad under controlled
conditions after Conservation Department officers found the
dynamite in a field near McGillivray Boulevard late in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The local Conservation Department also said this year's fire
season is five weeks ahead of schedule due to the dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
The three blazes are only the latest of the 17 fires discovered
in the past few weeks throughout southern Manitoba, local
officials said.

The corporation is also considering building a water processing
plant which can produce 40,000 cubic meters of potable water each
day,said Petrostrategy.
</P>
<P>
The weekly said that due to the growth of population and
industrial expansion, Algeria strongly needs more potable water.
</P>
<P>
The western region of Arzew, which is an important base of gas
production, is strongly lacking water, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian capital Algiers also has lacked enough water
supply for several years.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the summer of 1998, residents in some
districts of Algiers had only one day of water supply out of every
four days.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pounds Hit Companies Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) - Sterling's strength is hitting
companies hard and forcing more of them into difficulties,
according to the latest Mandis agony index.
</P>
<P>
It shows a 10 percent rise last month in companies in distress,
with the pound - at a 14-year high - the main culprit. The index
is compiled by Mandis Information Services from a databse of
100000 companies.
</P>
<P>
It monitors signs of corporate distress, defined as redundancy
announcements, profit warnings, weak trading statements, plant
closures, investment cutbacks and restructurings.
</P>
<P>
Ray Murphy, managing director of Mandis, said: "The index now
indicates that 32 percent more companies are in difficulties than
was the case in June 1999, the past year's healthiest month."
</P>
<P>
"Despite current high levels of employment and apparent growth,
competitive pressures are biting, particularly among exporters
suffering from the high pound," he added.
</P>
<P>
Underlying situation, it was reported that more than 40000
middle-management redundancies were announced in the first three
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Willem Buiter, a member of the Bank of England's monetary
policy committee, said the pound is between 15 percent and 20
percent overvalued and will fall sharply,forcing the Bank to push
up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the Confederation of British Industry has been
pleading with the Bank not to add to exporters' problems by
raising interest rates again.

<HEADLINE> WFP Food Aid Arrives in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A large convoy with 50 heavy
duty trucks of 580 tons food aid from the World Food Program
successfully passed through the long closed road between Mogadishu
and Baidoa on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The food of maize, sorghum, beans and porridge is destined for
the famine stricken families of Bay and Bakol regions.
</P>
<P>
The large food convoy was accompanied by more than 30 battle
wagons and nearly 400 heavily armed militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Abukar Abdi Shireh, speaking for the businessmen delivering the
food, said they have successfully turned their responsibility of
the convoy over to their representatives in Baidoa at Qardho
village, some 180 Km South of Mogadishu on the road to Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu-Baidoa road, the major economic links in the Horn of
African country, had been out of use because of armed
confrontation and banditry ever since Baidoa has fallen to the
hands of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) in early June last
year.
</P>
<P>
The mission is free from politics and it has been coordinated
by the representatives of Al-Islah and Towfiq together with their
counterparts in Baidoa, said Mr Shireh.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the road has revived the moral of many
businessmen and thousands of ordinary civilians whose lives had
crucially been dependent on the road.
</P>
<P>
But still, the authorities in Baidoa and Wanlewein affirm that
the road would only remain open for the humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The life has been getting difficult for the people in Bay and
Bakol regions day after day ever since the road linking them to
Mogadishu shut down for the serious hostility between the RRA and
Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Both regions depend much of their life on Mogadishu especially
the food and the other commodities. Even though it is said that
the road is open for the humanitarian supplies, still it is
believed that other normal businesses would soon follow.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Economic Delegation Leaves for Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Libya
high-powered delegations are scheduled to meet in Tripoli, Libya
this week to discuss issues on economic cooperation and debt
relief, media here reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Headed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete, the Tanzanian delegation, which
includes the Finance Minister Daniel Yona, Deputy Minster for
Works John Magufuli and government officials from various
ministries left Dar es Salaam for Tripoli on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Before boarding the plane, the Finance Minister was quoted as
saying the two day meeting expected to start on Tuesday will focus
on investment projects including road construction, agriculture,
tourism and debt relief.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is intending to strengthen further the existing
relations between the two countries and to learn experience in
various sectors of the economy from Libya, which is opening up
very impressively and giving attention to a number of Sub-Sahara
countries, said Yona.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Libya has shown great interest in
the tourism industry in Tanzania. The Libya-based Arab Investments
Limited has won the tender for purchasing the Kilimanjaro Hotel,
one of the biggest in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Yona also disclosed that Tanzania borrowed about 43 million U.S.
dollars from Libya for crude oil. Taking into account the
accumulated interests, the debt is extremely high.
</P>
<P>
"We will negotiate during the talks on how best the debt could
be dealt with," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian, French FMs Meet on Bilateral Ties, Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib on Sunday held talks here with his French
counterpart Hubert Vedrine on bilateral relations and obstacles
facing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Khatib expressed satisfaction with the current
bilateral ties, and said Jordan appreciated France's support to the
kingdom in political and economic spheres, Jordan's official news
agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vedrine expressed appreciation for the role of
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein in promoting peace and
stability in the region and in overcoming the obstacles hindering
progress in the peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been a major peace broker between Israel and
Arab countries since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994,
the second Arab country after Egypt to strike such a deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, King Abdullah left here for Eilat, Israel,
for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to promote
bilateral economic cooperation, and for discussions on ways of
pushing forward the peace process on all tracks, namely Israel's
peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to the Jewish state by the 38-year-old
monarch, who assumed the throne in Febuary 1999 after his father
King Hussein Ibn Talal died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine is expected to meet with Abdullah after he is back from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Khatib, Vedrine commended the continuous
cooperation and consultations between Jordan and France, and
reaffirmed his country's serious and continuous willingness to
support Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The french minister arrived in the kingdom on Thursday for a
five-day visit.

<P>
Five people were killed early Saturday in a head-on collision
near Huntsville, 150 kilometers north of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
No one survived the two-car crash, which also caused fire. The
occupants included three men and two women aged from 19 to 37.
</P>
<P>
The pavement was wet and "the two vehicles didn't just glance
off one another," a local police officer Hurry Rawluk was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, another head-on crash claimed the lives of
two in the small Quebec town of Ferme-Neuve. Mayor of Ferme-Neuve
Jacques Beauregard, 54, was one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
A Ferme-Nerve man is facing drunk driving charges following the
hit-and-run incident. The man lost control of his 1988 Chevy
Beretta and hit the ambulance in which the mayor and the driver
were transporting an 87-year-old woman to hospital. The woman also
died.

<HEADLINE> Crime Costs Britain 60 Billion Pounds A Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) - The annual cost of crime in Britain
is 60 billion pounds - more than 1000 pounds a year for each one
in the country, according to a study released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The figure derives from the direct cost of running services,
such as the police and Customs, as well as the indirect costs,
such as the effect on victims.
</P>
<P>
The formula is the result of a four-year study by the leading
economist David Anderson, whose paper "The Aggregate Burden of
Crime" was recently published in the Journal of Law and Economics.
</P>
<P>
The prison population now more than 65000, is a huge
expenditure. Meals alone cost 33 million pounds a year; salaries
for the 43000 staff come to more than 930 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the direct cost of resources devoted to crime
there is a sizable loss of time by people who are potential
victims and even those who have committed crime.
</P>
<P>
Among the major costs are running the prison service (1.9
billion pounds), the police force (7 billion pounds), the courts
and criminal justice system (9 billion pounds), and the private
security industry, including suppliers of guard dogs and CCTV
systems (4 billion pounds).
</P>
<P>
The figure also includes the proportion of NHS (National Health
Services) funding spent dealing with crime-related injuries and
drug rehabilitation - a further 4 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
"Society will never rid itself of crime," says Anderson, "but
when you take into consideration the resources that could be
conserved or reallocated in a crime-free society, the costs are
absolutely staggering."

<HEADLINE> Chaos on Phones in Britain as Numbers Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) - Telephone companies in Britain
spent 20 million pounds on a long advertising campaign to prepare
for its big changes on Easter Saturday to telephone codes, but
still one in three people dialed the wrong number.
</P>
<P>
The Big Number Campaign admitted that a third of all callers in
London had not got the message. And there was no reason to suggest
that their efforts had worked any better in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunication experts believe although the problem could be
tackled by using the national area code, technical changes will
still be required on countless switchboards this week.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lawfor, campaign manager for The Big Number, said the
complexity of the changeover had been unprecedented in Britain
telephone history.
</P>
<P>
Because the changes are a bit of a nuisance and not good news
for most people, they tend to leave it until the last minute until
they sit down to study the changes, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for The Big Number blamed the problems on
"least cost routing" - businesses using different telecom firms
for different types of call to get the best value for money.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Opens Wildlife Protection Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- This north China port city has
opened a hotline dedicated to the protection of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in China, the round-the-clock hotline at
191 was opened earlier this month as part of the plan to implement
China's Law on the Protection of Wild Animals.
</P>
<P>
If any wild animal is found to be in danger, the hotline will
inform the related departments to do what they can to rescue it,
according to the hotline's operator.
</P>
<P>
Occupying 11,919 sq. km., Tianjin has rich wild life resources
in its forests and mountains and along its 153-km-long coast line.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that some 235 varieties of birds have been spotted
in Tianjin, and that despite the city's efforts to protect
wildlife, killing and hunting of wild animals and birds still
occurs occasionally.
</P>
<P>
The hotline will also accept calls relating to illegal sales
and purchases of wild animals.

<HEADLINE> Timepieces Need to Adapt to Changing Lifestyles: Research (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While statistics showed that the share of watches and jewelry
in the U.S. consumer spending for gift purposes increased from 2.7
percent in 1990 to 4.6 percent in 1997, researchers said the
European timepiece market is heavily affected by the development
of fashion trends and the different lifestyles of individual
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Being fashion-conscious, designers are increasingly using
accessories, particularly timepieces, to complement their fashion
items to enhance the design concept," they said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, timepiece purchases are increasingly made by
female customers, accounting for 60 percent in the United Kingdom,
who need to buy watches as gifts or for themselves to match
different style of clothing.
</P>
<P>
Fashion watches and designer clocks are also popular choices
for gifts among youngsters in Japan. Premium watches and clocks
are frequently presented as souvenirs by companies and giant
retailers for business purposes.
</P>
<P>
Another fashion concept is inspired by the increasing rate of
sports participation. Spurred by growing health consciousness and
the promotional campaigns of major sports-related companies, the
demand for sports equipment and related products, including sports
watches, expanded steadily, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, being sporty by wearing a sports watch
has become one of the means of reflecting their lifestyle of
social identity in the community, though consumers may not need to
buy sports watches for particular sport purposes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that boom in information technology and mass
media also impresses the younger generation with different kinds
of products and fashion trends, encouraging them to have their own
personal selections.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the demand for high-tech fashion timepieces has
expanded at a fast pace, sparked by the prevailing concept of
technology in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
Although sales of high-tech timepieces like the mobile phone
watches are discouraged by high prices, high-tech look timepieces
with a futuristic sense are well received in the market.
</P>
<P>
This is especially due to the popularity of information
technology and the Internet, which have made "technology " a
popular concept in the consumer market, the researchers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Timepiece manufacturers have
been urged to adjust their products to the change of lifestyles,
according to a recent research on timepiece market by the Hong
Kong Trade Development Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
TDC researchers said that accuracy and reliability are not by
themselves sufficient to satisfy consumers. Instead, design
concepts and styling, along with reasonable prices, are far more
important in tapping demand, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Timepieces are more than time-tellers now, and no longer mass-
market items," they stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world largest clock and watch exporter with a
total annual timepiece exports of over 42 billion HK dollars (5.38
billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, ranking the world first.
</P>
<P>
And more than 15,000 buyers from all over the world visited
this year's Asian Watch, Clock and Equipment Fair, which was held
at Hong Kong International Trade and Exhibition Center from April
13 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Edward Leung, chief economist of the council who headed the
research, said, "It is of great significance for clock and watch
manufacturers to adapt their products to the changing of
lifestyles to enable Hong Kong to stay with the leading position
in timepiece market."
</P>
<P>
The TDC economist believed that timepiece consumers have been
increasingly affected by the lifestyles that emphasize individual
expression, and that they have changed to buy timepieces that can
match individual tastes.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, timepieces are emerging as a fashion and
consumers often buy inexpensive watches with different designs of
dials, cases and straps as fashion accessories, Leung said.

HANGZHOU, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zhoushan City Intermediate
People's Court in east China's Zhejiang Province sentenced former

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Appeals To Public For Blood Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan authorities have
appealed to the public for blood donations to treat the wounded
soldiers who were suffered in fighting at the key northern
Elephant Pass on Saturday,the state radio broadcast on Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The blood banks will stay open late on Sunday to receive donors,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Palitha Fernando Sunday said Heavy fighting
against the rebels is continuing in the Elephant Pass area. The
troops readjusted their defence line north of Elephant Pass and
were consolidating their new positions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) claimed
Saturday they had overrun two strategic military complex in
northern Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass linking Jaffna Peninsula to
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE added that over 1000 government soldiers were killed
and a large number wounded on Saturday. But Fernando said during
the fighting 49 officers and men were killed and 243 injured.
About 150 officers and soldiers had suffered minor injuries while
more than 150 Tamil rebels had died in the action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, military spokesman Rp. Witana Sunday afternoon said
troops suffered seven officers and 72 other ranks killed, 625
persons injured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The two key military bases had combined strength of about two
divisions or 15,000 - 20,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country since 1983, have been
trying to capture Elephant Pass base causeway as the first step to
return Jaffna Peninsula which were lost to government troops in
May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels launched their operation code-named Oyantha
Alaikal at the Elephant Pass last December.

<HEADLINE> Sixth Patient Dies in Suspended AIDS Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A 40-year-old woman died on
Friday after allegedly participating in a controversial Pretoria
AIDS drug trial which has already claimed the lives of five other
women, the South African Press Association (SAPA) reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Medicines Control Council earlier this month suspended
recruitment of further patients for the study, known as the
FTC-302 trial, which is being conducted Quintiles Clindepharm on
behalf of Triangle Pharmaceuticals, a United States company.
</P>
<P>
Sources at Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria confirmed the death
of the woman due to liver failure, a well-known side effect of the
cocktail that includes Nevirapine and AZT clone, Zerit.
</P>
<P>
The name of the woman, whose death has not been confirmed by
the usual officials due to the Easter weekend, is being withheld
at the request of the family.
</P>
<P>
Drug trial investigator Mariette Botes on Saturday denied that
the patient had ever taken part in the AIDS drug trial.
</P>
<P>
She also denied that the woman had taken any AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
SAPA, however, has a copy of a signed consent form for the
clinical trial signed by the patient and listing Botes as the
investigator.
</P>
<P>
Naomi Mashego, a social worker for the Mental Health Society
who ran a support group in Atteridgeville for people living with
HIV, said the woman had told Mashego that she was taking part in
the trial.
</P>
<P>
The death of the woman prompted political parties to renew
calls for suspension of the trials. But Pan-Africanist Congress
MP Patricia de Lille said suspension of the trials was not
enough.
</P>
<P>
"The government must round up all the people who have taken
part in the trials and examine them for side effects, before more
people die," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also complained that the trials were not properly
monitored.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't have the medical or trial files of the
patients, even after it was specifically requested. Nor do we know
how much money was paid to the doctors to conduct the trials," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Education Is Common Responsibility of All Society:Editorial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, is calling for strengthening and improving
education to create a new prospect for education in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to be published Monday, the daily says that
inspired by Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent speech on
education, all sectors in China have expressed their enthusiastic
support for the development of education.
</P>
<P>
The speech represents the great emphasis on education by the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Jiang Zemin
at the core, and it will have far-reaching significance for the
development of education in China, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang Zemin pointed out the existing weaknesses
in the country's education system, and outlined the orientation,
tasks, and principles for developing education.
</P>
<P>
Education is not only a matter for educators, but also common
responsibility of the Party committees and government at all
levels, as well as that of all society, it says.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the speech calls for accelerating
educational reforms and development, and promoting quality
education, says the editorial, noting that this is a fundamental
principle for revitalizing the Chinese nation through science and
education.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls for further deepening reforms in higher

<HEADLINE> China Scenic Spot and Resort Exhibition Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The China Scenic Spot and Resort
Exhibition closed today in this northeast China port city after
achieving the signing of 450 million yuan worth of letters of
intent on investment and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics indicate that during the four-day event,
1,237 contracts were inked totaling 83 million yuan. More than 50,
000 visitors attended the exhibition, and 4.7 million pamphlets
were issued.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was also visited by delegations from 31
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, the
Macao Special Administrative Region, and foreign businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
Several large investment and Internet companies also
participated in and held promotion activities. Sector insiders
said the exhibition received enthusiastic attention because
enterprises both inside and outside the tourism sector hope to
grab a share of China's fast growing tourism market, which will be
boosted by China's accession to the World Trade Organization and
the opportunities arising from China's drive to develop the
western region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, China's tourism has been growing at a heady speed,
and statistics indicate that in 1999, some 72 million people came
to the country from abroad, up more than 40 times over 1978, and
bringing tourism revenue of 11.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months this year, the country's
international tourism continued to surge. During the period, China
received more than 19 million overseas tourists and earned over 3.
6 billion US dollars, a jump of 15.5 percent and 17.7 percent over
the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Circular on Protecting Fishing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua)-- The Ministry of Agriculture has
issued an urgent circular, urging local fishery offices to use
legal means to overcome local protectionism and protect fishermen'
s interest in the wake of a spate of fishing accidents.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, there have been four major
fishing disasters, causing heavy losses to fishing farms. Pulp
mills and chemical plants which discharge industrial waste water
are the main causes.
</P>
<P>
In February, tens of thousands of fish were found floating on
the Baiyangdian Lake in Hebei Province. The loss was calculated to
be at least 23.85 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In another separate case, fish, crabs, shrimps and shellfish
died in a 149 km section of the Zhanghu River in east China's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that their investigations were made difficult
by obstacles from local governments. Plants that pollute the
environment are usually major tax payers and local governments try
hard to protect them.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicine Acknowledged by World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The efficacy of traditional
Chinese medicine is now being acknowledged by more and more people
around the world, said an official of the State Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Zhixiang, an official with the State Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, noted that traditional Chinese
medicine has been exported to over 130 countries and regions, with
annual foreign exchange earning of 600 million US dollars, a
figure expected to grow each year.
</P>
<P>
China has sent several hundred medical teams and over 10,000
doctors to foreign countries, especially developing countries, to
provide services to the local people.
</P>
<P>
Shen pointed out that by 1998, China had conducted governmental
level exchanges and cooperation on traditional Chinese medicine
with over 40 countries and regions including the United States,
Japan, and France.
</P>
<P>
China and the World Health Organization (WHO) have made
achievements in cooperation in traditional Chinese medicine, and
the WHO now has seven traditional medicine cooperation centers and
three acupuncture training centers in China, in a bid to introduce
and promote traditional Chinese medicine to the world.
</P>
<P>
China has trained nearly 15,000 foreigners from over 130
countries and regions in traditional Chinese medicine in the past
decade, extending the influence of this method of treatment
worldwide.

<P>
Now, most countries and regions worldwide have various kinds of
clinics and research centers devoted to traditional Chinese
medicine.
</P>
<P>
China will continue exchanges with foreign countries in
traditional medicine education and technology research, and also
will consider establishing hospitals in foreign countries, said

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Demolishes Palestinian Homes Near Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army demolished
seven Palestinian homes near Jerusalem on Sunday, drawing sharp
criticism from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army sent several bulldozers at dawn on Sunday to
the Palestinian village of Issawiyeh and took down seven
Palestinian homes, which the army said were built without permits.
</P>
<P>
The army said four of the demolished Palestinian homes, which
have been taken down last Monday, were rebuilt by the owners.
</P>
<P>
The army bulldozers on Sunday also took down several tents set
up last week by supporters of the Palestinian families made
homeless by the army demolishers.
</P>
<P>
Issawiyeh is part of the West Bank land Israel occupied in the
1967 Middle East War. The village falls within expanded city
boundaries claimed by Israel's Jerusalem municipality.
</P>
<P>
"These are private lands and ownership documents are with the
Palestinian owners," Palestinian Minister Without Portfolio Ziad
Abu Ziad was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that "this is a very clear message from (Israeli) Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak who gave the demolition
orders, that he does not want real peace and he wants peace without
giving up occupied land."
</P>
<P>
Ziad said the homes were torn down "under the pretext of not
having building permits, which Israel doesn't grant to Palestinians
anyway."
</P>
<P>
Israel last month rejected the Palestinian demand to hand over
West Bank villages near Jerusalem, including Issawiyeh, during its
third troop redeployment under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal
signed in Egypt last September.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem-based Land Research Center said on Wednesday in
its annual report that Israel had accelerated the demolition of
Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem by 16 percent in 1999,
affecting 330 residents.
</P>
<P>
The report said 36 Palestinian homes were demolished in 1999 in
East Jerusalem compared with 31 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 2000, 14 Palestinian homes have been torn
down in East Jerusalem, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of several sensitive issues that
should be settled in the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel calls all of Jerusalem its eternal capital while
Palestinians envisage the city as a future capital of an
independent Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Largest River on Verge of Going Dry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's largest and only navigable
river, Karoun river, is on the verge of going dry due to unlimited
use of its water.
</P>
<P>
The illegal and unlimited use of water from this river has
pushed down the level of water in the river and jeopardized the
regional environment, Majlis (parliament) member Iraj Sefati
Dezfuli warned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The MP was speaking at a conference held in the southwestern
city of Abadan, Khuzestan province to review the water situation in
the area, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Karoun river, located in southwestern Iran, is 800
kilometers in length and arises from the Zardkouh mountain.
</P>
<P>
Officials are taking necessary measures to combat this crisis
and in the near future the residents of Abadan will be supplied
with potable water through a pipeline, according to Abadan Governor
Muhammad Javad Hazemi.
</P>
<P>
The only source of potable water for the residents of Abadan is
now the Arvandroud river which is high in salinity, he said.

TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Latif Safari, managing director of
Iran's banned reformist daily Neshat (Joy), was sent to jail on
Sunday under a ruling issued by the conservative-controlled public
court in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Safari was convicted of insulting the sanctities and foundations
of Islam, vilifying commanders of the security forces and Majlis
(parliament) deputies and inciting civilians and students to unrest
and strike, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He was tried at Tehran public court last September on 73 counts
of complaints and was sentenced to 30 months in jail. The verdict
was then upheld by Tehran appeals court, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Safari was the second reformist journalist sent to prison
recently.
</P>
<P>
Mashaallah Shamsolvaezin, editor-in-chief of the daily Asr-e
Azadegan (Time of the Freed), was also sentenced to 30 months in
prison for press violations.
</P>
<P>
After the overwhelming victory of the reformists in the February
parliamentary polling, the Iranian pro-reform press came under
mounting pressure of the powerful conservatives, who still dominate
most of the sensitive organs despite a series of setbacks in
elections in past two years.
</P>
<P>
A number of reformist journalists and publishers had been
summoned to courts in the past month on charges of defamation or
propagating against Islamic values while the outgoing conservative
parliament last week passed an amendment to the press law imposing
more restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
Akbar Ganji, another prominent reformist journalist, was
arrested on Saturday for attending a controversial conference in
Berlin organized by the Heinrich Boell Foundation on Iran after the
February elections.
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners have arranged various rallies and demonstrations
throughout the country in recent days accusing reformists of
advocating the American-style reforms in Iran at the conference.

In 1958, 100,000 ex-servicemen were sent to the "Great Northern
Wilderness," a vast marshland in northeastern China's Heilongjiang
Province, and the once-barren area has been turned into one of the
country's largest food producers.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, China announced the unilateral disarmament of one
million troops within three years, and in 1997, announced another
three-year program to demobilize 500,000 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
The government has attached great importance to the relocation
of former army officers, many of whom have become standouts in
various fields. However, along with the establishment of a market
economy in China and the deepening of reforms in all fields, it is
becoming increasingly difficult for the government to help these
ex-officers find civilian jobs without increasing pressure on
local governments and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongbo, a member of the Central Military Commission and
director of the General Political Department of the PLA, was
reported to say that the existing methods of handling demobilized
army officers will have to be reformed, as the old system has
brought increasingly greater pressure to localities and is not
consistent with the new situation.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Wang Zhongyu said a new mobilization and
reemployment system with China's own characteristics, and in
conformity with China's socialist market economy and civilian
personnel system reforms and army officer system reforms, must be
instituted.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Bombing on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel continued its bombardment on
villages in the central sector of south Lebanon Sunday morning,
Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest Israeli raid was focused on the villages of Sahel
Youhel and Mazlat Hamla and hit a vehicle on the road between the
two villages, but no casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
Retaliatory attacks between the Israeli troops and Lebanese
resistance guerrillas intensified after Israel formally notified
the United Nations that it would pull out its troops from south
Lebanon by July after a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak had stressed that his country
would harshly retaliate if the resistance continues firing
Katyushas to northern Israel or causes any casualties to Israeli
targets after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
been leading a guerrilla war aimed to oust the Israeli occupation
forces.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expects Huge Foreign Investments in Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar
Zanganeh stated here on Sunday that his country expects over 10
billion U.S. dollars of direct foreign investments in its oil
industry in the third five-year development plan (2000-2005).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the 5th International Oil,
Gas and Petrochemical Industries Exhibition, Zanganeh called on
Iranian companies to actively participate in big projects in the
coming five years through cooperation with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran signed agreements worth over 1 billion dollars
with foreign companies in oil, gas and petrochemical industries
during the past Iranian calendar year that ended on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The value of agreements to be signed this Iranian year is
expected to be more than two times the figure last Iranian year, he
said, without giving details about the projects to be put on
international tenders.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second biggest producer of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with a production capacity of
4 million barrels per day (bpd) and its actual daily production was
reported to be more than 3.3 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The minister also underlined the need for industrial structural
reforms to adjust the country's energy consumption, saying that the
country needs to spend 3.5-4 billion dollars to import gasoline
during the third five-year development plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Advisor of Commerce Minister and Managing Director of
Iran International Exhibition Company Hossein Ghassemi said that
the country would make efforts to boost the petrochemical industry
in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
He said that output of petrochemical products would reach 35
million tons annually by end of the third development plan from 13
million tons in the last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 domestic companies and 166 foreign companies from 15
countries, mainly Germany, Britain, France, Russia, Canada and
China, put their products on display in the four-day exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Abdullah Arrives in Eilat, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah arrived
in Eilat, Israel, on Sunday for his first official visit to the
Jewish state since taking the Jordanian throne 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The royal yacht carrying the king and Queen Rania was
accompanied by Jordanian patrol boats and was met by vessels of the
Israeli Navy which escorted him to the naval base in Israel's
southern Read Sea resort city of Eilat, about 200 kilometers south
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the naval base, the king and his party were met by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and other Israeli government officials.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival, Abdullah said that he hoped for a breakthrough
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process this year.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian issue is a central one in the Arab-Israeli
conflict and I am very hopeful that his year will witness a
breakthrough that will give hope to the Palestinians in the justice
they seek and to the Israeli people in the security that they
desire," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
"I also hope that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks will be resumed
in the near future in order to capitalize on this historic
opportunity of achieving reconciliation and co-existence," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been stalled in January this
year after the two sides held two rounds of talks in the United
States since last December due to Israel's refusal to promise to
return to Syrian the entire Golan Heights which Israel occupied
during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming address, Barak said the monarch was following
in the footsteps of his illustrious father, King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Barak also paid tribute to Jordan's constructive and
indispensible role in the peace process and said it was incumbent
upon the region's leaders to foster "the solid infrastructure of
peaceful relations between our peoples."
</P>
<P>
"History has shown us that in order for peace to strike deeper
roots it is imperative that more and more people benefit from the
dividends of peace and joint prosperity," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry said that the two are scheduled to hold
talks in the afternoon, presumably on developments on the
Palestinian and Syrian negotiation tracks and Barak will ask for
Abdullah's assessment of the progress on both channels, in light of
Abdullah's close relations with the leaders of Syria and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's one-day visit to Eilat comes a week before a new
session of peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
to be held in Eilat after two rounds in the United States failed to
bring any major breakthroughs in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks focus on a complex array of disputes that
make up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including land, security,
Palestinian sovereignty, water, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements in the territories, the status of Jerusalem
</P>
<P>
Abudllah initially planned to visit Israel in February but put
off his trip because of massive Israeli air strikes against Lebanon
and the impasse in the Palestinian and Syrian tracks of the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army Kills 4 Opposition Militants on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian army killed four members of
the outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) who were trying to
infiltrate into Iranian territories, the state-run television
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A number of mortars, launchers and mobile phones were seized
from the MKO members in two teams, the television quoted an army
commander as saying. But it did not mention when the MKO members
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO launched two mortar attacks on central Tehran
in February and March, one of which close to government buildings
including the Majlis (parliament) premises and presidential office.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a famous political-military group which fought against
the former Iranian shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 and fled into
Iraq following sharp differences with the government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, labeled by Iranian government as a terrorist group, has
carried out series of cross-border attacks on Iran in recent years,
including assassination of senior Iranian officials. In
retaliation, Iranian armed forces also launched several air raids
on the MKO bases in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Talks on Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
began tete-a-tete talks Sunday morning with visiting Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on the latest developments of the Palestinian-
Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who frequently visits Egypt for Mubarak's advice on the
peace process, arrived in Cairo Saturday evening following a three-
day visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting were not immediately available. But
Arafat is expected to brief Mubarak on his talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would also discuss with Mubarak the U.S. overture to more
actively involve in the coming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations,
scheduled to start on April 30 in Eilat in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. confirmed on Friday that it was looking to play a more
active role in the negotiations. "We would be prepared to play a
more involved role at the table with the Palestinians and the
Israelis in the coming weeks and months," U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are discussing the thorniest
issues, including the borders, the fate of Jerusalem, refugees and
Jewish settlements in their final-status talks. They are working to
meet a May deadline for a framework agreement for a permanent peace
treaty to be signed in September.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Government Troops Withdraw From Northern  Base: Army Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brigadier Palitha Fernando said Heavy fighting against the
rebels is continuing in the Elephant Pass area. The troops
readjusted their defence line north of Elephant Pass and were
consolidating new positions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) claimed
Saturday they had overrun two strategic military complex in
northern Iyakachchi and Elephant Pass linking Jaffna Peninsula to
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE added that over 1000 government soldiers were killed
and a large number wounded on Saturday. But the spokesman said
during the fighting 49 officers and men were killed and 243
injured. About 150 officers and soldiers had suffered minor
injuries while more than 150 Tamil rebels had died in the action.
</P>
<P>
The two key military bases had combined strength of about two
divisions or 15,000 - 20,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, who have been fighting for a separate Tamil
state in the north and east of the country since 1983, have been
trying to capture Elephant Pass base causeway as the first step to
return to the Jaffna Peninsula which were lost to government
troops in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels launched their operation code-named Oyantha
Alaikal at the Elephant Pass last December.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Works Out Five-Year National AIDS Strategic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's National AIDS Control
Council has come up with a national AIDS strategic plan which is
aimed at preventing and controlling the scourge for a period of
five years, the People daily said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The plan's major objective is to reduce the national prevalence
of HIV/ AIDS by the year 2004 and increase the level in provision
of quality care and support activities for the infected and
affected, the council said.
</P>
<P>
According to the council, the AIDS disease has so far killed
approximately 250,000 people with another 300,000 being infected
annually. At present, about 500 AIDS related deaths are reported
to occur daily which is about 20 deaths an hour.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the strategic plan will require around
2.3 billion shillings (about 30 million U.S. dollars) for both
the recurrent and investment costs, a large chunk from the
country's national budget.
</P>
<P>
In response to the epidemic and obstacles faced in stemming it
in Kenya, advocacy and promotion of behavioral change will be
given prominence in terms of finance and work force.
</P>
<P>
Other priority areas in the plan include prevention of blood
infection and the reduction of STD infections, the prevention of
mother to child infection, research activities, care and support
of the infected and affected.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the priority activities will be
undertaken within Kenya's Health Policy Framework Paper, with a
theme of "investing in health" , which involves the role of all
sectors in the society, the council said.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Against Partial Annulment of Parliamentary Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Iranians have demanded
the conservative-dominated Guardians Council (GC) to change its
decision to annul results of the sixth parliamentary elections,
held in February, in certain constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians, from Damavand and Firouz-Kuh constituency in
Tehran Province, have sent a letter to Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei in which they urged a change in the
GC decision, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the angry Iranians charged that the inspectors
sent by the GC to look into the veracity of the elections in their
constituency were not "impartial and free of factional loyalties."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GC has not yet informed the Interior Ministry of
the reasons behind the annulment of the election results in the
constituencies, said Governor of Damavand, Mohsen Safari.
</P>
<P>
As watchdog of the elections, the GC has recently canceled votes
in a number of constituencies around the country, stirring up a
series of protests that led to some arrests.
</P>
<P>
The measure also caused a conflict with the Interior Ministry,
which, as the organizer of the elections, has repeatedly expressed
its regret over and anger at the GC decision.
</P>
<P>
The elections resulted in a landslide victory of reformists
allied to President Mohammed Khatami, ending a long time
conservative majority in the legislative body.

<HEADLINE> King Abdullah Arrives in Eilat, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Abdullah arrived
in Eilat, Israel, on Sunday for his first official visit to the
Jewish state since taking the Jordanian throne 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The royal yacht carrying the king and Queen Rania was
accompanied by Jordanian patrol boats and was met by vessels of the
Israeli Navy which escorted him to the naval base in Israel's
southern Read Sea resort city of Eilat, about 200 kilometers south
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At the naval base, the king and his party were met by Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and other Israeli government officials.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming address, Barak said the monarch was following
in the footsteps of his illustrious father, King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry said that the two are scheduled to hold
talks in the afternoon, presumably on developments on the
Palestinian and Syrian negotiation tracks and Barak will ask for
Abdullah's assessment of the progress on both channels, in light of
Abdullah's close relations with the leaders of Syria and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's one-day visit to Eilat comes a week before a new
session of peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
to be held in Eilat after two rounds in the United States failed to
bring any major breakthroughs in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks focus on a complex array of disputes that
make up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including land, security,
Palestinian sovereignty, water, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements in the territories, the status of Jerusalem
</P>
<P>
Abudllah initially planned to visit Israel in February but put
off his trip because of massive Israeli air strikes against Lebanon
and the impasse in the Palestinian and Syrian tracks of the peace
process.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak apparently passed a verbal
warning from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud during Lahoud's visit to Egypt on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly cautioned him not to use Palestinian refugees
in south Lebanon to continue fighting against Israel after its
unilateral withdrawal by July, and not to disarm and arrest Arafat
loyalists in the camps, a Palestinian source said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Arafat recently refused to order his men inside the camps in
south Lebanon to hand their arms to the Lebanese authorities.
Palestinian sources said Fatah loyalists inside the camps would
defend themselves against any Syrian or Lebanese attempt to replace
them with pro-Syrian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli government officials have responded with cautious
optimism to last Thursday's White House meeting between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright phoned Barak Saturday
night to brief him about the Clinton-Arafat meeting. U.S. peace
mediator Dennis Ross will arrive in Israel later in the week to
furnish a more detailed briefing to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks between Israeli and Palestinian
delegations led by chief negotiators Oded Eran and Yasser Abed
Rabbo is scheduled to start in Eilat next Sunday and to continue
until May 12.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordan's King Abdullah will arrive by yacht Sunday morning in
Eilat, on his first state visit to Israel. Barak will greet the
Hashemite ruler in a reception at a navy base in the southern town.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, the two will hold a closed discussion,
presumably on developments on the Palestinian and Syrian
negotiation tracks. Officials in Israel's Foreign Ministry
predicted that Barak will ask for Abdullah's assessment of progress
on both these channels.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Tensions remain high in south Lebanon as heavy fighting
continued over the weekend. Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas fired
several Katyusha rockets Saturday at Israel Defense Forces and
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army positions in the eastern and
western sectors of Israeli-occupied security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, at least one Hezbollah guerrilla was killed after two
Israel Air Force Apache helicopters destroyed a mobile Katyusha
launcher in the Nabatiya area in the central sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IDF officials stated that they plan to demolish all
outposts in the buffer zone after the army's withdrawal this July,
to prevent leaving anything that can be used by Hezbollah.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Philippines' Hostage Rescue Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Four Muslim rebels and three
Philippine government soldiers have been killed so far in the on-
going hostage rescue operations, which entered the second day
Sunday in Basilan, the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Three government soldiers were wounded in the rescue operations
as of Saturday afternoon, the government said in a report.
</P>
<P>
But the pursuing government troops failed to recover the bodies
of the Abu Sayyaf elements as the gunbattle was in progress, it
said.
</P>
<P>
About 500 government troops launched attacks on the Abu Sayyaf
camp in the hinterlands of Basilan early Saturday, after
negotiations over the release of 27 hostages held by Abu Sayyaf
rebels since March 20 failed.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the rebels claimed to have beheaded two of 29
hostages because the government rejected its demand for the
release of two Abu Sayyaf rebels and three international
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
An army officer said they were exerting efforts to rescue some,
if not all, of the hostages presently in the hands of the Abu
Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government troops have captured three
satellite camps of the extremist group in Mt. Ponoh Mahijid in
Sumisip town, Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel group threatened to behead five hostages
Monday if the government refuses to abort their offensives.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Urges Filipinos to Keep Faith in Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada asked the Filipino people Sunday to keep their faith in
him as he will do his best to lead them towards a better future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Easter Sunday service in Manila, Estrada said
that while his administration has laid down the foundations for
economic improvement, it still needs time to make the masses feel
the benefits of a better economy.
</P>
<P>
"I only ask you now to have faith in me," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also asked the people to do their part as well through
sacrifice and solidarity with each other, stressing that he cannot
do the job alone.
</P>
<P>
"We must practice sacrifice and solidarity. We must unite. As
president, I cannot deliver the people from poverty alone. All
citizens must contribute for the good of society," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada made the appeal to Filipinos when his popularity
declined steeply in the past six months. Citing the slow pace of
economic recovery in the country, opposition forces recently even
urged Estrada to resign.
</P>
<P>
But in his speech, Estrada said the economy is slowly
recovering, with growth rates rising, prices of basic goods
remaining stable, and foreign exchange reserves going up to 16
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
These, he said, were a far cry from the negative growth rate
and high inflation and interest rates that hounded the economy
when he assumed office on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said he will fulfill his campaign promise to uplift the
quality of their lives.
</P>
<P>
"I was elected president on the basis of my promise to rescue
the poor. I know my countrymen have high expectations that I will
realize that pledge. I have not turned my back on that promise,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But he asked the masses to give him more time to fulfill his
promise.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot solve these problems in one or two years' time. Yet I
remain resolved to fulfill my promise to uplift the lives of the
poor. I only ask for some more time," Estrada said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Welcomes Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda Investment Authority
(UIA) will try to woo the white farmers from South Africa and
Zimbabwe next month when it launches an investment drive of
Southern Africa, the New Vision daily reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting an investment mission to South Africa and
Zimbabwe next month and if we meet any white farmers they will be
welcome," the report quoted UIA Executive Director Maggie Kigozi
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, agro-processing, fish and horticulture are among
the most promising sectors in Uganda, said Kigozi, adding that
UIA is intent on bringing in large commercial farmers to start
nucleus farms.
</P>
<P>
Uganda also has an urgent need to develop service sector
because the investors now ask about schools for their children
and medical facilities, the UIA boss said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Zimbabweans would find the facilities they need
in Uganda and they would do much better in the east African
country because the climate in Uganda is much better than that in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is now paying special attention to agricultural
modernization. Early this year the government announced the
strategy to modernize the sector. Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni urged local farmers last week to adopt advanced
techniques to develop the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
White commercial farmers in Zimbabwe have had their farms
ransacked by black land squatters over the past few weeks in a
bid to evict them and redistribute their land to thousands of
landless people.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Takes New Move to Curb Road Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Traffic Section will from
next Tuesday have its own anti-corruption team operating
incognito inside public service vehicles, the Sunday Nation
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Traffic Commandant Samuel Angote said Saturday the team would
arrest public service vehicle operators who break the law and
policemen who try to conceal such offences.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Angote as saying his officers will travel
as passengers and arrest both the givers and takers of bribes.
</P>
<P>
"The internal team will focus particularly on the behavior of
our officers, besides supplementing regular operations by the
criminal investigation department of the Kenya Anti-Corruption
Authority officers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new move comes in the wake of a public outcry following
complaints that road carnage is largely abetted by police
officers who take bribes and allow mini-buses and buses to flout
traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
In less than one month, Kenya registered two worst ever road
accidents --
</P>
<P>
a head-on collision of two buses killing 76 people in western
Kenya on March 29 and a bus-lorry head-on crash along
Nairobi-Mombasa Highway killing 73 passengers on April 20.
</P>
<P>
Angote said the team, together with the special mobile vehicle
 inspection unit which launched on March 31, would help reduce the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents in Kenya were mainly caused by speeding,
overloading and careless driving. It is reported that a total of
2,823 people died in 2,292 accidents in 1999 and 2,972 were
killed in 2,220 accidents in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Approves Purchase of Russian T-90 Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has given
the green light to the finalization of an arms purchase contract
which will help the country to acquire 310 T-90 main battle tanks
from Russia, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A price negotiating team from the Indian Defense Ministry has
left for Moscow for final rounds of talks with M/S RVZ,
manufacturer of the Russian tanks, and the first batch of these
heavy tanks are likely to be inducted within this year, the PTI
quoted official sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of the Russian T-90 tanks will give the Indian
army's strike corps an edge over Pakistani formations, which have
recently been armed with Ukrainian T-80U tanks, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Security of the Indian cabinet has approved a
proposal for the outright purchase of 124 T-90 tanks, while the
rest 186 currently remain in semi-knocked down and completely
knocked down state, said the PTI.
</P>
<P>
Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes was quoted as saying
that comparative analysis suggested the Russian T-90 tanks were "
superior to all known tanks in Pakistan's armory."
</P>
<P>
However, he clarified that the T-90s were not purchased as a
replacement for the country's indigenous "Arjun" main battle tank,
which is currently under development.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, the government's nod to purchase T-90s
has come after three of these tanks underwent peak summer trials
in Rajasthan during May-June 1999 and further trials in October-
November 1999, which were witnessed by senior army and defense
ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Based on these trials the army headquarters prepared a general
staff evaluation report recommending the induction of the T-90
tanks last December, the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Might Find It Difficult to Service Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh might find it difficult
to service foreign debt two decades from now unless measures were
taken to replenish its foreign exchange reserve, the Financial
Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed by Bangladesh Bank Governor Mohammad
Farashuddin here Saturday at a roundtable meeting on Foreign Aid
and Development in Bangladesh, according the report.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting arranged by the Bangladesh Development
Committee at its office here, Farashuddin said the country would
have to pay some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars annually as debt
servicing liabilities (DSL) after 20 years from now.
</P>
<P>
Although the DSL record of the country is currently "very good,
" Bangladesh is likely to face problems if it fails to achieve an
increase in export income, remittance and foreign direct
investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said Bangladesh is now spending about
10 percent of its current expenditures annually to service its
cumulative foreign debt amounting to 15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said many countries in Latin America are spending almost 50
percent of their expenditures just to service their foreign debts,
adding: "We are utilizing the aid money more efficiently than
other nations."
</P>
<P>
He said the country has already started borrowing from Ordinary
Capital Resources, the commercial lending arm of the Asian
Development Bank, as its Asian Development Fund is drying up. In
such a situation, it will be impossible for Bangladesh to increase
the rate of savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Farashuddin said an increase in remittance income could reverse
the situation. If the remittance income can be increased to three
billion dollars, the country will require no foreign aid, he said.

<HEADLINE> Standard Chartered Bank to take over Grindlays' Operations in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh operations of the
ANZ Grindlays Bank of Australia are going to be taken over by the
Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) under a deal providing for the
similar takeover of other Grindlays operations in the Middle East
and South Asia, the Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The integration process of the two leading banks' operations in
Bangladesh as well as in other parts of South Asia and the Middle
East will start soon after the signing of the deal this week, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The SCB became the highest bidder, quoting 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars, after the ANZ Banking Corporation decided to sell out its
subsidiary. A European bank and an American bank had also
participated in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
The ANZ Grindlays Bank emerged as the largest foreign bank
operating in Bangladesh in early 1990. The bank, which was able to
attract more than 440 million U.S. dollars in deposits and made
advances worth 280 million dollars, made a profit of more than 20
million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The SCB expedited its Bangladesh operations mainly in 1993
bringing in modern technology. Automated Teller Machine and
electronic banking products were among the technologies pioneered
by the SCB in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The SCB, which attracted deposits worth 220 million dollars and
made advances worth 160 million dollars, posted a profit of 14
million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Grindlays Bank, with its 15 branches across Bangladesh, has
employed more than 400 people while the SCB, with six branches,
has employed more than 200 people.

</P>
<P>
The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said
Saturday that they had overrun the strategic Elephant Pass base
and the adjoining Iyakachchi camp after two days of heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
In a statement from their London office, the LTTE claimed that
they killed at least 1,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
It said the fall of the Elephant Pass at the gate of Jaffna
will facilitate the LTTE to gain its strategic goal of retaking
their former stronghold of Jaffna which they lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said Saturday night in a statement that
troops had "readjusted their defense lines north of Elephant Pass"
and were now consolidating their new positions.

<P>
It gave the death toll among the security forces as 49 while it
also said 150 LTTE rebels were killed during the fierce fighting
involving mostly mortars and artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, had been trying

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Up Due to Fuel Price Hikes </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate scaled a
new high of 4.64 percent for the week that ended April 8 following
a sharp increase in prices of kerosene and cooking gas across the
country, an official release said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate spurted to 4.64 percent for the week
that ended April 8 from 4.22 percent for the previous week mainly
on account of a 2.5 percent jump in the index for fuel, power,
light and lubricants, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
The upward movement in the index for energy was aided by a 41
percent increase in kerosene prices and a 10 percent rise in the
prices of liquefied petroleum gas, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Wholesale Price Index for All Commodities for the week rose
by 0.5 percent to 148.9 as against 148.2 the previous week.

the San Antonio Spurs 72-70 in their playoff opener at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Neither team played at full strength. San Antonio's Tim Duncan,

spearheading a strong defensive effort.
</P>
<P>
Miami rookie Anthony Carter had 10 points and seven assists.
Mourning had 20 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Detroit star Grant Hill, slowed by a bone bruise in his left
foot, scored only 13 points and had six turnovers. Jerry
Stackhouse led Detroit with 23 points.
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, Karl Malone scored a career playoff-high 50
points, breaking a 16-year-old Utah team record as Jazz thrashed
SuperSonics 104-93 in Game 1 of the best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old forward was in classic form. His 50 points came
on 18-of-32 shooting and he added 12 rebounds in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek collected 13 points and John Stockton added 10
for the Jazz, who also got seven points and 10 rebounds from
reserve center Greg Ostertag. Gary Payton led Seattle with 24

<HEADLINE> Nakamura Breaks Women's 50m Backstroke Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 23 (Xinhua) -- World silver medallist Mai Nakamura
clocked 28.67 seconds to break the world record of 28.69 seconds
in the women's 50-meter backstroke time trial race at the Japanese
national swimming championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The previous world record of 28.69 seconds was set by Nina
Jivanevskaia of Spain at the Spanish national championships in
Madrid on April 8.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura, 20, also rewrote her own Japanese record of 29.11 set
at the national championships here last year.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura, the winner of the 100m silver and 200m and 400m
medley relay bronze medals at the 1998 world championships in
Perth, became the first Japanese to set a record after Masami
Tanaka's 200m breaststroke shortcourse record at the world
championships a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The women's 50m backstroke is not an Olympic event at the
Sydney Games, but it will become an official event at the 2001
world championships in Fukuoka, western Japan.

<HEADLINE> Karpov, Khalifman Win Openers in JAPFA Chess Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Grand
Master Anatoly Karpov and successor Alexander Khalifman, both of
Russia, won their matches in the opening of the JAPFA Classic
International Tournament 2000 in Bali, Indonesia, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Sunday, Karpov, the FIDE
world champion from 1975 to 1985 and from 1993 to 1999 before
Khalifman took over, outclassed host player Ruben Gunawan in the
47th step in four hours 23 minutes in the English opening.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Khalifman speeded up to beat International
Master Zaw Win Lay of Myanmar in the 21st step using the French
opening in only one hour and 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's top player Utut Adianto, who used the Queen Indian
opening, was able to slightly outshine Gilberto Milos Jr. of
Brazil in the 23rd step. But Milos did not give up easily and
managed to force Utut to draw in the 37th step.
</P>
<P>
At another table, Grand Master Judit Polgar of Hungary, who is
the only women's player in the 16th category tournament, struck in
the 24th step to tie with Jaan Ehlvesdt of Estonia by using the
Modern opening.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Jan Timman, who used Caro Kann opening, also had to tie
with Yasser Seirawan of the United States in the 43th step.
</P>
<P>
In the opening ceremony early Saturday, Indonesian Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputri said she was pleased to be able
to meet Karpov in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud that I can meet with the Grand Master. So far, I
have only heard and read about Karpov, but now I can meet him in
person here in Bali. I also appreciate the presence of other
players," she was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Megawati also hoped that chess could be played at the grass
roots level as well as at the elite level.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this, I have suggested the Indonesian Chess
Federation to set up a special chess school or include the sport
in school's curriculum," she added.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Haunt Indonesian Thomas, Uber Cups Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian badminton team is
still worrying about the injuries suffered by key shuttlers with
only 20 days to go to the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals in Kuala
Lumpur next month, according to the Jakarta Post Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) doctor Michael
Triangto said that five shuttlers are still recovering from
enduring injuries.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles shuttler Taufik Hidayat is still suffering from
back muscle pain, while men's doubles specialist Tony Gunawan is
still bothered by an injury to his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, Cindana Hartono is still plagued with a
left calf injury, and doubles players Cynthia Tuwankotta has pain
in her sacrum and Vita Marissa is being treated for right shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to speed their recovery, but it's quite
difficult. We try to make them feel better than yesterday and
enable them to perform their best," he said.
</P>
<P>
Michael said Taufik has been undergoing physiotherapy to cure
his back muscles and Tony is responding well to his therapy.
</P>
<P>
"Tony is able to move as usual but he still feels the pain. We
just hope he can overcome it and play well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Michael said Cindana needed more time to cope with her trauma
after falling during a simulation in February prior to the Uber
Cup qualifying round in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"She has been able to run fast but when the coach asks her to
play, she is unable to overcome her barrier. She moves very slowly
and is always in doubt," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar confirmed that Cindana would miss the Uber Cup
Finals due to the injury.
</P>
<P>
Michael said: "Vita is still being observed, especially her
nerves. She suffered a relapse since the Japan Open early this
month which made her motion range narrower than usual. Cynthia
needs to stretch and sit-up more after training sessions to help
her overcome the inelastic difficulty in her back."
</P>
<P>
PBSI training director Christian Hadinata said the association
would only send athletes in fit physical condition.
</P>
<P>
"We need honesty from athletes. If they are really injured,
they must take the risk of being excluded from the team. I don't
want injured shuttlers on the team which may burden their
teammates. It will also create an uncomfortable situation for
coaches and officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christian said PBSI has yet to name the shuttlers despite the
deadline from the International Badminton Federation on April 24.
</P>
<P>
"We will send the list on Monday but we'll pick the selected
shuttlers after the simulation at the Pajajaran Stadium in Bogor,
West Java, on April 27," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares to Open Second-Board Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China will create favorable
market conditions for the development of the "new economy" by
adjusting the structure of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment is expected to achieved mainly with the
establishment of a second-board for technology issues, "China
Daily" quoted Gao Xiqing, vice-chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
The second board will be opened immediately after preparations
for legislation and technical arrangements are completed. The
second-board markets are especially helpful for technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
These companies are usually desperate for capital in their
initial stages of development. But most of them are not big or
profitable enough to raise funds by listing on main boards.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the CSRC supports all enterprises that are acceptable
to the stock market. The commission will continue to encourage
domestic companies to list on overseas capital markets.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 mainland companies have been on the Hong Kong
stock exchange or on foreign bourses in New York, London, Tokyo
and Singapore. A few companies in the information technology
sector, including the Internet company Sina.com, went public on
Wall Street's NASDAQ market and Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise
Market.
</P>
<P>
"We will help mainland companies increase their fund-raising
volumes in these markets," Gao said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Marks Asia-Africa Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The 45th commemoration of the
historic Asia-Africa Conference was held in Bandung, about 180 km
southeast of Jakarta, on Saturday with Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid calling for strengthening economic ties among
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The commemoration of the conference should become a benchmark
for the economic awakening among developing countries, especially
Indonesia. The spirit of the conference must be far more important
than its ceremonial commemoration," Wahid was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony took place at the Gedung Merdeka, where the first
Asia-Africa Conference was held in 1955. Leaders from 29 countries
took part in the first conference, which was initiated by India,
Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Pakistan and Indonesia, and was officially
opened by Indonesia's first president Soekarno.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the conference spirit, the Asia-African countries
should have a non-hegemonic formula for their foreign affairs
policies. Such non-hegemonic foreign affairs policy was well
formulated by the late Mao Zedong," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid acknowledged the Asia-Africa Conference was a very
valuable heritage from Soekarno.
</P>
<P>
"The conference was the first concrete step for nations in Asia
and Africa to promote and enhance unity as new emerging nations,
seeking world justice and peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also said he hoped that the 50th commemoration of the
Asia-Africa Conference would be attended by the heads of state,
which would be significant for Indonesian people to wake up from
their "sleep."

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorian Shrimp Export Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's shrimp export dropped to
99 million U.S. dollars during the first quarter of this year,
down 46 percent from the year-ago level, the Ecuadorian Exports
Federation said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian Aquaculture Chamber Chairman Jorge Illinworth said
the drop in shrimp exports was caused by the presence of a white
spot virus discovered in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the sales at the end of this year would not
exceed 300 million dollars, as the white spot virus is present in
almost all the shrimp ponds and only 50,000 hectares of the
country's 180,000 hectare shrimp ponds are cultivated.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's shrimp export has been on the decline in recent years,
from 885 million dollars in 1997 to 872 million dollars in 1998,
and to less than 600 million dollars in 1999, according to the
country's central bank.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Reports Deficit in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's foreign trade ran a
deficit in the last three consecutive years, according to the
latest figures published by the country's Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The deficit stood at 1.231 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, 1.697
billion dollars in 1998 and 1.22 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has attributed its poor performance in foreign trade to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis and the economic
sanctions imposed on it by some Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's main traditional export items are agricultural
products, timber and marine products.
</P>
<P>
The unitary structure of Myanmar's export commodities has to
some extent brought about a negative effect on the country's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has taken measures to tackle the problem,
including adopting a "export more, import less" strategy and
encouraging domestic production of import-substitute goods.
</P>
<P>
As a result of these efforts, Myanmar's foreign trade deficit
dropped by 466 million dollars in 1999 as compared with 1998.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang's Import And Export Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Statistics from local customs
showed that the import and export volume of northwest China's
Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Region reached 413 million U.S. dollars
in the first three months of the year, up some 40 percent over the
same period last year, with export standing at 245 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the January-March period, Xinjiang's general trade export
increased by 90 percent, accounting for half of Xinjiang's total
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Imports and exports of Xinjiang's state-owned and collectively-
owned enterprises made up 90 percent of Xinjiang's total foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Xinjiang regional foreign trade and economic
cooperation department said that Kazakhstan remains a major trade
partner of Xinjiang. Trade between Xinjiang and Kazakstan amounted
to 200 million dollars during the January-March period, accounting
for half of Xinjiang's total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Xinjiang's foreign trade with the Republic of Korea,
Indonesia, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia also increased.
</P>
<P>
The officials said cotton remains Xinjiang's major export
commodity, with cotton exports reaching 100 million dollars, or
nearly 30 percent of its total foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
However, experts estimated that Xinjiang's cotton export will
decline in the coming months as cotton inventories are reduced.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Greater Agro-Investment in Africa: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China encourages its agricultural
companies to intensify their investments in Africa, China Daily's
Business Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Continual economic growth in the continent is expected to
create new opportunities for Chinese agricultural companies to tap
the 30.29-million-square-kilometer market composed of 56 economies,
the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government is encouraging the country's companies
to intensify their business integration with African economies and
setting up joint ventures with local co-operative partners, as
China enjoys good long-term political relationships with them,
the paper quoted Chen Xiaoru, an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese-invested companies engaged in production of farm
machinery, agricultural processing and entrepot trading targeted
for the world market will find immense business potential," she
said.
</P>
<P>
African economies, as a whole, saw their year-on-year gross
domestic product (GDP) growth at 3.1 percent in 1999, and 4
percent growth is likely this year, which will allow them to
import more and engage in more overseas economic co-operation, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture in Africa is largely oriented towards production of
coffee, tea, peanuts, wheat, barley and corn, with many of the
farms set up and under controls of American and European farmers.
Grain was still in short supply on the continent, Chinese experts
said.
</P>
<P>
China had helped African countries set up a total of 87
agricultural projects with its donations until early 1980s when it
altered foreign economic co-operative policy from sole donation to
mutual beneficiary pursuits.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of Chinese bank soft loans, the country's
fisheries and other agribusiness companies have gone to 13 African
countries to set up 23 fishing projects, operate farms under
contracts and to open farm machinery joint ventures dovetailing to
local needs since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that at least 401 State-owned enterprises
were set up under approval of the MOFTEC in Africa by the end of
June last year, with a 671 million US dollars committed investment
reported.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Arrives in Kuwait to Discuss POW Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid arrived here late Sunday for a three-day
visit primarily aimed at discussing the issue of Kuwait's prisoners
of war (POWs).
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Abdel-Meguid told reporters that the AL is keen on
exerting every possible effort to solve the problem of the Kuwaiti
POWs and third country nationals held captive in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League is "currently employing intensive
efforts in cooperation with all parties to resolve this issue," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that contacts were also made with Iraqi government in
order to convince Baghdad to positively react to all Arab and
international bids to end the ordeal of those still in captivity.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists there are over 600 Kuwaiti and third country
nationals who are still detained in Iraqi jails. Iraq denies the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid is due to meet Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-
Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold talks with Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Besides the POW issue, Abdel-Meguid said before the visit that
his talks with Kuwaiti officials would also tackle means of
coordination and consultation regarding a number of Arab issues and
the situation in the Middle East and the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> 4 Reformist Papers Closed Down by Iran's Conservatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative public court on
Sunday closed down four newspapers amid a new wave of crackdown on
reformists, the main supporters of the reform programs of President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Head of the branch 1408 of Tehran public court, named only as
Saremi, ordered the daily Fath (Conquer), Asr-e Azadegan (Times of
the Freed) and the bi-weekly Iran Farda (Iran Tomorrow) to halt
their publications immediately until further notice, Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Reza Jalaei, a member of the editing board of Fath said
that the daily has received a notice from Saremi, who also called
on director general for domestic press at the Ministry of Culture
and Islamic Guidance to prevent the publications of the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The public court on Sunday night also ordered another
reformist daily Aftab Emrouz (Today's Sun) to shut down. A member
of the daily's editing board confirmed the court order, but said he
had no more information about the charges against the daily.
</P>
<P>
Fath is a substitute for the banned Khordad daily whose Managing
Director Abdollah Nouri, a former interior minister, was jailed for
insulting Islamic sanctities and system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Editor-in-Chief of the Asr-e Azadegan Mashaallah
Shamsolvaezin was jailed after an appeal court rejected his defense
against the charges of publishing articles against the regime.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the banned reformist daily Neshat (Joy)
Latif Safari was also sent to jail on Sunday under a ruling issued
by the conservative-controlled public court in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of crackdown on reformist press and journalists
came after Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a
severe warning to the press on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that some of the country's newspapers are
becoming "enemy strongholds," and they are "doing the same thing"
as U.S., British and Israeli agencies.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who dominate most of the state organs but
suffered a series of setbacks in elections in the past two years,
launched desperate attacks on the reformists, who won a landslide
victory in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of reformist journalists and publishers had been
summoned to courts in the past month on charges of defamation or
propagating against Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative parliament last week passed an
amendment to the press law imposing more restrictions on the press.
</P>
<P>
Akbar Ganji, another prominent reformist journalist, was also
temporarily jailed on Saturday for attending a controversial
conference on Iran in Berlin after the February elections.
</P>
<P>
Hardliners have arranged various rallies and demonstrations
throughout the country in recent days, accusing reformists of
advocating U.S.-style reforms in Iran at the conference.
</P>
<P>
They have called on all of the seminaries in the country to
close down on Monday to denounce the reformists for attending the
Berlin conference and reformist dailies for publishing articles
against Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The reformists in reply accused the conservatives of trying to
hinder the formation of the new reformist-dominated parliament and
of undermining Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the unusual closure of four newspapers in
one day indicated the seriousness of power struggles in the country
following the reformists' victory over the conservatives.

AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel
Ilah al-Khatib said on Sunday that Jordan and France are identical
in views on a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with his French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine, al-Khatib said the two sides hold that Mideast
peace should be based on international resolutions and Israel's
pullout from the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
He said Vedrine's visit to Jordan comes at a time when the two
countries are strengthening ties and heading for the creation of a
true partnership.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib said the two countries' views were completely
identical with regard to the Middle East peace process and to the
need of realizing a just and comprehensive peace acceptable to all
the peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vedrine commended the Jordanian-French ties which
he described as politically deep and progressively developing in
economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Jordan's role and efforts to speed up the peace
process in the region, adding that France is working with all
parties concerned in a bid to overcome difficulties that may
obstruct the peace drive.

The French minister arrived in Amman on Thursday for a five-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Talks With French FM on Bilateral, Mideast Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Sunday held talks with visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine on bilateral ties and ways of reviving the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Both Abdullah and Vedrine voiced hope that the parties concerned
in the peace process would strive to remove obstacles and work for
a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the region, Jordan's
official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed ways of promoting the peace talks between
Israel and its Arab neighbors, namely the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon, Petra said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah thanked member states of the European Union, France in
particular, for their efforts to promote the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The monarch also expressed his satisfaction with the current
status of ties between Jordan and France, and called for the
establishment of more joint ventures between the two countries as
the kingdom has set economic development as its top priority.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said France and Jordan enjoyed close relations and the
two countries had carried out effective and constructive
cooperation in both bilateral and international issues.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the role of Jordan, under the leadership of
King Abdullah, as a major peace broker between Israel and its Arab
neighbors since the kingdom singed a peace treaty with Israel in
1994, the second Arab country after Egypt to strike such a peace
deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Vedrine had held talks with his Jordanian
counterpart Abdel Ilah al-Khatib and Speaker of the House of
Representatives Abdu Hadi Majali on bilateral ties and the Middle
East peace making.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister is expected to end his five-day
visit to the kingdom on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Harare Bomb Blast Causes Extensive Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The bomb blast which shook central
Harare on Saturday night extensively damaged property at Curious
Sculpture gallery along Samora Machel avenue.
</P>
<P>
Officer Commanding Province at Harare Central Police station
Emanuel Chimwanda Sunday told the Zimbabwe News Agency that
although no assessment of the damage had yet been done by the
owner of the gallery, there had been extensive damage.
</P>
<P>
"There are no suspects as yet as police investigations are
continuing.  We have employed a number of experts, forensic
scientists, army engineers from the bomb disposal section who are
picking up shrapnel from the debris.
</P>
<P>
Although no conclusions have been reached as of now, it seems
the explosive was home-made," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said some windows at the offices of the Associated
Newspapers Group which publishes The Daily News were slightly
damaged and so were those at Standard Chartered Bank near the
gallery.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like somebody knew what he was doing and was trying
to send a message," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the attack was aimed at the independent
newspaper, " The Daily News" for its highlighting of political
violence and farm invasions which have been taking place for the
past three months and have resulted in the deaths of two white
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Political violence has been on the rise in Zimbabwe in
anticipation of the parliamentary elections scheduled to take
place in May.
</P>
<P>
The violence has resulted in the deaths of two members of the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change through a petrol bomb
thrown into their car.

OTTAWA, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada's University of Guelph in
southern Ontario will open a Web site in May for information about
rural areas in the country, the Canadian Press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Rural Canada Bibliography Project will facilitate rural
research and development, providing information ranging from
farming to poetry.
</P>
<P>
This will be a dream where "someone in the Okanagan, for
example, who needs to find information about rural women and
farming could use the Rural Canada Bibliography search engine and
quickly get a list of references," Professor Mark Waldron of the
university was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Each of Canada's 13 provinces and territories will have at
least one person gather and feed rural information into the
database of the project, according to the professor.
