<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- James Mouton hit a two-run single in the 10th
inning off Trevor Hoffman as the Milwaukee Brewers rallied for a
6-5 win over the San Diego Padres on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Marquis Grissom's error in the top half helped San Diego
take a 5-4 lead, the Brewers won it.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman (4-5) struck out the first two batters before giving up
a single to Luis Lopez. Grissom hit a routine grounder to shortstop
Damian Jackson, who fielded the ball cleanly, but threw it past
second baseman Bret Boone, putting runners and second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton then hit Hoffman's first pitch into left field to drive
in the winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic (5-3) got the win despite allowing pinch-hitter
Dave Magadan's RBI single. That followed Grissom's two-base error
that let Wiki Gonzalez reach third on a line single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Casanova went 3-for-5 with a two-run homer in the fourth
and an RBI double in the sixth inning for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's solo homer off Juan Acevedo in the eighth tied the
game at 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers had gone ahead 4-3 on Burnitz's run-scoring grounder
in the seventh followed a throwing error by third baseman Phil
Nevin.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres scored two runs in the third off Milwaukee starter
Paul Rigdon, but could have had more.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens doubled and took third when Damian Jackson reached on
first baseman Richie Sexson's error. Jackson was caught stealing
just before Ryan Klesko hit a sacrifice fly. Nevin followed with
his 28th homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In the Brewers' fifth, pitcher Jay Witasick deflected Mark
Loretta's shot back up the middle with his leg. The ball rolled
toward first base where Klesko made a diving tag to nip Loretta.

<HEADLINE> China Releases U.S. Poet  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A Boston poet detained in China for more than two
weeks arrived in the United States on Saturday, grateful for the
outpouring of international support for his case and concerned that
family and friends could be targeted by Chinese police.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me I have to leave ... because they say the American
people and the American government are involved with my case and
wanted the Chinese to let me go as soon as possible,'' Bei Ling
said after arriving in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Police released Bei, the editor of a dissident literary journal,
on Saturday, and sent him back to the United States, removing an
irritant in shaky but improving China-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by mobile phone on the way to Beijing's airport, Bei
said Chinese and U.S. diplomats arranged his release to smooth the
way for President Jiang Zemin's trip to New York next month for a
U.N. summit and talks with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Police also freed Bei's brother, Huang Feng, late Friday, a
little more than a week after he was detained as part of the
investigation. Bei remains concerned that authorities could
retaliate against his family in China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time, my brother could end up in jail,'' Bei said.
</P>
<P>
   Bei's arrest Aug. 11 drew angry publicity in the United States
that threatened to undo months of diplomacy aimed at repairing ties
between the countries. Well-known authors demanded his release in
essays appearing in major U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Bei, a poet, has lived in the United States since 1988. He has
edited the literary journal Tendency, and he and others have
routinely smuggled copies of the journal into China for
distribution among Chinese intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bei agreed to leave China as a condition for his release and it
was uncertain when he would be allowed to return. Police put him on
an Air China flight bound for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to leave. I have no choice,'' Bei said at the departure
hall of Beijing's Capital Airport. ''If I didn't leave I would have
gone to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei, 40, said he was not mistreated while he was in detention,
he had eaten well and the prison was fairly clean.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest came amid a broadening crackdown by the communist
government on the publishing industry. Chinese leaders fear that
criticisms of the government and calls for political change,
however mild, could further incite workers and farmers already
protesting corruption, layoffs, taxes and stagnating incomes.
</P>
<P>
   In a provocative -- and what he later called a naive -- move, Bei
had 2,000 copies of the August issue of Tendency printed in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The issue included works by Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet
Seamus Heaney, an introduction to underground Chinese literature
and a poem by Liu Xiaobo, a dissident literary critic. It also
contained a photo of Wang Dan, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square democracy protests who now lives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bei said police accused him of illegal publishing and told him
if he refused to go to the United States he would face three to 10
years in prison. As part of his release, police fined him $24,000,
only $1,200 of which he was able to pay, and they made him pay for
his plane ticket to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Being kicked out was better than going to jail, Bei said. ''I
just never imagined that China was still so strict.''
</P>
<P>
   One of two plainclothes police officers who escorted Bei from
detention to the airport and through customs said the poet was
under a six-month parole while the investigation continued. He and
Bei said there was a chance that the poet could return to China in
the future -- as long as he didn't break the law.
</P>
<P>
   Bei said his brother had no connection to the journal but had
been detained because ''he helped me get things.''
</P>
<P>
   Before bringing him to the airport, police allowed Bei to meet
with his brother and parents to say good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   ''My biggest wish is that one day soon I will be able to come
back to the motherland,'' Bei said.

<HEADLINE> Reds 3, Marlins 2  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Pete Harnisch pitched six innings despite a 2-hour,
40-minute rain delay in the second inning, and the Cincinnati Reds
needed just five hits Saturday night to beat the Florida Marlins
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 35,392 was the largest of the season for
Florida. Only about 5,000 fans remained when play resumed after a
thunderstorm, and Marlins starter Jesus Sanchez was taken out of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Harnisch returned to the mound after the long delay and shut
out Florida over the next 4 1-3 innings. He allowed five hits and
one run.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch improved to 6-2 with a 2.88 ERA in 11 starts since
spending eight weeks on the disabled list with weakness in his
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves, Cincinnati's fourth pitcher, got the final four
outs for his 22nd save in 26 chances. The Reds won their third in a
row, and the Marlins have lost three in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Florida ended a scoreless streak of 23 innings when Mark Kotsay
homered in the first. Preston Wilson's infield single drove in a
run in the eighth, but with runners at first and third, Mike Lowell
grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Larkin hit his 11th home run to give Cincinnati a 1-0 lead
in the first. Kotsay snapped a 1-for-17 slump with his 11th homer
in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati scored twice in the sixth to take a 3-1 lead. Larkin
walked and Alex Ochoa singled against Vic Darensbourg. Chris Stynes
greeted Braden Looper with an RBI single, and when center fielder
Wilson threw wildly to the infield, Ochoa came home from first with
an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds overcame a mental mistake by catcher Jason LaRue in the
sixth. When Wilson struck out for the second out with Henry
Rodriguez on first, LaRue tossed the ball to the ground and headed
for the dugout, thinking the inning was over, and Rodriguez raced
to second.
</P>
<P>
   But center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. chased down Lowell's 400-foot
fly to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Former Reds slugger Tony Perez, inducted into the Hall of
Fame this year, was honored before the game. Perez is now a special
assistant to Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski. ... Marlins
LF Cliff Floyd, sidelined since July 29 with a knee injury, is
expected to rejoin the lineup next week. ... Florida RHP Alex
Fernandez, who underwent season-ending shoulder surgery July 20,
said he's recovering well and hopes to pitch again by next May. ...
The Marlins passed the one-million mark in home attendance. ... The
Reds have played in front of 31 sellout crowds, 28 on the road.

<HEADLINE> Stewart-Frascatore Argue in Dugout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Toronto pitching coach Dave Stewart had
to be restrained in the Blue Jays dugout during an argument with
reliever John Frascatore on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was physically held back from going after Frascatore by
bench coach Lee Elia and catcher Alberto Castillo before the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras showed an angry Stewart exchanging words with someone
out of sight in the tunnel leading to the Toronto dugout. After the
game Stewart confirmed he was yelling at Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   ''John can never have my information again,'' Stewart said.
''John knows it all. Let him figure it out. From now on John
Frascatore is a pitching coach for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the argument was over pitch selection in the
seventh inning. Frascatore came in to face pinch hitter Chad
Curtis, and he walked Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made a trip to the mound, and Frascatore got the next
batter, Luis Alicea, to ground out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a pitcher for 16 years and I never had a run-in with
anyone,'' Stewart said. ''This is a first. I'm embarrassed that it
took place in front of people in Toronto and sports viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Frascatore refused to say what precipitated the argument.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nothing,'' Frascatore said. ''Once you walk out of the
dugout, it's over. There's nothing there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was something that happens in the heat of the moment. We're
in a pennant race. Stew and I are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto manager Jim Fregosi said the argument would not fester.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're both very much competitors,'' Fregosi said. ''In the
heat of battle they exchanged a few words. I talked to both of
them. It's over as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Frascatore is 1-3 with a 5.59 ERA in 50 appearances for the Blue
Jays this season.

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) --President Clinton appealed to the leaders of this
oil-rich nation Saturday to set aside political acrimony so that their citizens
can lift themselves from poverty and isolation, calling Nigeria ''a pivot point
on which all Africa's future turns.'' Standing in the cavernous National
Assembly chamber Clinton praised President Olusegun Obasanjo's leadership in
stabilizing Nigeria. One of Clinton's purposes in coming was to encourage a
tender democracy to take root here in Africa's most populous nation.

season Saturday night when he easily won the goracing.com 500. The victory gave
him a season-sweep on the 0.533-mile bullring -- the first driver to pull off
the feat since Dale Earnhardt did it in 1987 -- and his ninth career win on the
concrete. Wallace, also the winner last week at Michigan, is the first driver
this season to win in consecutive weeks. More importantly, though, the Ford
driver closed the gap in the race for the Winston Cup championship. Wallace came
into the race in fifth place in the standings, 352 points behind leader Bobby
Labonte. Wallace remained in fifth after the win, but closed the gap to 290

<HEADLINE> Joined Fires Gaining Western Ground  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Wildfires have burned together in
southwestern Montana's Bitterroot Valley and along the Continental
Divide, forming the nation's largest fire group, a federal official
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, South Dakota's governor urged residents
of the central and southern Black Hills to evacuate, and potential
evacuation plans were ready for two small towns threatened by a
blaze in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Bitterroot Valley fire and the Mussigbrod fires in the Big
Hole River drainage covered an estimated 247,000 acres, said E.
Lynn Burkett of the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the biggest fire complex in the region. It's a lot,
and with a fire of that size and magnitude it will take a
significant fall weather event to stop it -- like rain or snow,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of rain or snow, a ''red flag'' alert was posted
Saturday, warning Montana and surrounding states of scattered dry
thunderstorms -- with lightning, gusty wind and low humidity --
through the weekend as a cold front rolled through, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters on the Mussigbrod fire pulled back because of
winds, and one crew had to wait out the weather in a safety zone.
Aircraft operations were suspended because of dense smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bitterroot Valley and Mussigbrod fires were started by
lightning on July 31. Since then,the Bitterroot fires had destroyed
about 70 dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The Interagency Fire Center on Saturday reported 82 fires
nationally on Saturday, most of them in the West. They had spread
across 1.5 million acres and more than 13,000 firefighters were
assigned to battle them.
</P>
<P>
   Montana had 25 fires on nearly 660,000 acres,
</P>
<P>
   Wind had already started gusting above 30 mph early Saturday in
south-central Washington, as National Guardsmen joined firefighters
trying to keep a 110,000-acre blaze away from two small towns.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Saturday, a ridge stood between the Washington fire
and Prosser, a town of about 5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't want it to pop over that ridge top,'' said
fire information officer Cynthia Reichelt.
</P>
<P>
   An evacuation plan had been prepared for Prosser and nearby
Mabton, which has about 1,700 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared for that, but we haven't had to go there yet
and hopefully we won't have to,'' Reichelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had it half contained by Saturday night and were
hoping to have it completely contained by Sunday, said Mark
Clemens, spokesman for the state Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, Gov. Bill Janklow urged evacuations in the
Black Hills after erratic winds nearly doubled the size of the
Jasper forest fire to 30,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday it blew to the east. At night it went west. Today it
went north and northeast,'' Todd Phillipe, a spokesman for the U.S.
Forest Service, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Janklow declared an emergency and promised to arrest motorists
or anyone else who didn't belong in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho had 26 major fires covering 700,000 acres, including the
nation's biggest single fire, which had blackened 180,000 acres of
the Salmon-Challis National Forest near the Montana state line.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials announced that more of the Salmon-Challis would
be closed Monday, meaning about half of the 5-million-acre forest
would be off limits to hunters, fishermen and campers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Montana fires was an 84,000-acre blaze near Townsend,
between Helena and Bozeman, that over the past couple of weeks has
shut down a major power line and separated ranchers from their
cattle herds.
</P>
<P>
   Air tankers poured 60,000 gallons of retardant on the fire to
help protect the Grassy Mountain subdivision, where residents have
been ordered to leave, information officer Troy Crown said. The
tankers dropped 52,000 gallons on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 15 mph were well under the predicted 35 mph, and light
rain helped keep the fire intensity low, Crown said
</P>
<P>
   The weather was going to make firefighting doubly difficult and
''all fire lines are bracing'' for the passing weather front, said
Ed Bloedel, a Bitterroot National Forest official.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not putting any crews in where those conditions may get
them in trouble,'' he said.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Millions of anti-disaster army
reservists were called to help combat floods Sunday, after four
days of heavy rain soaked the region, engulfing rivers and causing
landslides.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were confirmed killed and three others missing in
rain-swollen rivers or landslides. Hundreds of homes were
submerged, vast rice fields were flooded and sections of major
roads and rail lines were washed away.
</P>
<P>
   The unseasonable rain storms, which began Thursday, drenched
most of South Korea, especially the country's southwestern region
where rainfall measured up to 22.8 inches.
</P>
<P>
   A flood warning was issued for tens of thousands of people
living along the Kum River in the southwestern region. Officials
said the river threatened to overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lee Han-dong ordered 3.5 million members of the
civil defense corps to report to work to help control flood damage.
The corps consists of army reservists aged between 35 and 50.
Nearly 20,000 government officials were on alert.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expected the storm to continue through Monday.

United, Pilots Reach Settlement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A tentative agreement was reached Saturday in a contract
dispute between United Airlines and its pilots which had forced the world's
largest airline to cancel or delay thousands of flights. The two sides met
around-the-clock over the past two days, guided by the National Mediation Board.
The key issues remaining in the talks were security and pay. A spokesman for the
pilots, Herb Hunter, would not provide any details of the agreement, which he
said is retroactive to April 12. The agreement will be presented to the pilots
next month.

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Wildfires have burned together in southwestern
Montana's Bitterroot Valley and along the Continental Divide, forming the
nation's largest fire group, a federal official said Saturday. Elsewhere in the
West, South Dakota's governor urged residents of the central and southern Black
Hills to evacuate, and potential evacuation plans were ready for two small towns
threatened by a blaze in Washington. The Bitterroot Valley fire and the
Mussigbrod fires in the Big Hole River drainage covered an estimated 247,000
acres, said E. Lynn Burkett of the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho.

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) --President Clinton appealed to the leaders of this
oil-rich nation Saturday to set aside political acrimony so that their citizens
can lift themselves from poverty and isolation, calling Nigeria ''a pivot point
on which all Africa's future turns.'' Standing in the cavernous National
Assembly chamber Clinton praised President Olusegun Obasanjo's leadership in
stabilizing Nigeria. One of Clinton's purposes in coming was to encourage a
tender democracy to take root here in Africa's most populous nation.

Nader Hails WTO Protesters

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Green Party presidential hopeful Ralph Nader said Saturday
that last fall's World Trade Organization protests were a watershed in American
history, and he hopes the same populist wave responsible carries him to the
White House. Nader was still exulting from the biggest event of his campaign. On
Friday night, 10,000 people paid $7 each to hear him at the Memorial Coliseum in
Portland, Ore. He said Democratic nominee Vice President Al Gore and Republican
nominee George W. Bush could not have drawn that many people without help from
big-money contributors.

Her 64-year-old husband, James Reynolds, was among the survivors.

China Releases U.S. Poet

   BEIJING (AP) -- A Boston poet detained in China for more than two weeks
arrived in the United States on Saturday, grateful for the outpouring of
international support for his case and concerned that family and friends could
be targeted by Chinese police. Police released Bei Lang, the editor of a
dissident literary journal, on Saturday, and sent him back to the United States,
removing an irritant in shaky but improving China-U.S. ties. Speaking by mobile
phone on the way to Beijing's airport, Bei said Chinese and U.S. diplomats
arranged his release to smooth the way for President Jiang Zemin's trip to New
York next month for a U.N. summit and talks with President Clinton.

Wallace Wins Goracing.com 500
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) -- Rusty Wallace became the first four-time winner of the
season Saturday night when he easily won the goracing.com 500. The victory gave
him a season-sweep on the 0.533-mile bullring -- the first driver to pull off
the feat since Dale Earnhardt did it in 1987 -- and his ninth career win on the
concrete. Wallace, also the winner last week at Michigan, is the first driver
this season to win in consecutive weeks. More importantly, though, the Ford
driver closed the gap in the race for the Winston Cup championship. Wallace came
into the race in fifth place in the standings, 352 points behind leader Bobby
Labonte. Wallace remained in fifth after the win, but closed the gap to 290
points.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Mariners finally found some offensive pop again as Alex

the second time in 12 games, 11-5 over the Chicago White Sox on Saturday night.
John Halama (11-6), pitching for the first time in 10 days, gave up a single to
Frank Thomas with two out in the first inning and then retired 16 straight
batters before Tony Graffanino opened the seventh with a single.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung appointed a
career diplomat as his new national security adviser Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ha-joong, 53, chief presidential protocol secretary since
1998, succeeded Hwang Won-tak as the president's national security
adviser. Hwang, a retired army general, served in the post for one
year.
</P>
<P>
   The new national security adviser began his government career in
the foreign ministry in 1973. Before joining the presidential staff
in 1998, he had served as a diplomat in the United States, India,
Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   Two other presidential staffers in charge of educational,
cultural, labor and welfare affairs were also replaced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffle of the presidential staff followed a major
reorganization of the government three weeks ago, in which eight of
the 18 Cabinet members were replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the shake-up was part of the
president's effort to accelerate reform. A recent series of public
polls show people feel the Kim government is behind schedule in
economic and other reforms.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in Costa Rica  </HEADLINE>
By MARIANELA JIMENEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A small airplane with 10 people on
board, including eight foreign tourists, crashed near a volcano in
a mountainous area of Costa Rica on Saturday. It was not known if
there were any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-seat Caravan plane, operated by the company National
Aerial Services, was flying between the northern region of La
Fortuna, where the Arenal volcano is located, and Tamarindo, a
beach town on the Pacific coast, when it crashed, said Costa Rican
Interior Minister Rogelio Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off from the capital, San Jose, at 12:15 p.m.,
stopping briefly in La Fortuna, where a Japanese passenger
deplaned, officials said. Air traffic controllers lost contact with
the plane at 1:30 p.m. and alerted rescue authorities, who had not
yet reached the scene early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos said at least 200 additional rescue workers would head for
the area at dawn Sunday. He said the plane had been spotted, but it
was not known if there were survivors.
</P>
<P>
   On board the airplane were the pilot and co-pilot, both from
Costa Rica, and eight foreigners, including two women who local
police and the Red Cross said were from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Residents heard an explosion at the time of the crash and saw
flames coming from the Chato hills, in the vicinity of the volcano,
local police official Walter Navarro said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HILO, Hawaii (AP) -- A search on Saturday failed to locate a
woman missing from the crash of a small sightseeing plane off the
coast of Hawaii Island.
</P>
<P>
   The eight people who survived Friday's crash were released from
Hilo Medical Center on Saturday, nursing supervisor Steve Palmore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The missing woman was identified by police as Laveta Rose
Reynolds, 61, of North Collinsville, Okla. Her 64-year-old husband,
James Reynolds, was among the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's search effort was hampered by murky ocean conditions
and overcast skies, Assistant Fire Chief Crist Pung said. The
search was expected to resume Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter and rescue boat were used to rescue the survivors.
The 10-seat Piper Navajo Chieftain owned by tour and charter
company Big Island Air ditched in the ocean 200 yards from Honoli'i
Point, about four miles from Hilo International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Robert Crispin
said the pilot was headed for the airport after shutting down his
right engine, which had caught on fire. But with only one engine
running, the plane didn't have enough power to make it to the
airport, so the pilot had to set it down in the water, Crispin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Nicholas A. Vanus had reported engine problems, saying he
was going to ditch the plane, said Tom Hada, a Hawaiian Airlines
pilot who was waiting for takeoff from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knew he was going down,'' Hada said. ''This guy was real
calm. He had it together. He was definitely in control of the
situation, and he did a terrific job.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication Mrs. Reynolds got out of the plane
before it sank in more than 100 feet of water, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reynolds couldn't swim, her daughter, Anissa Reynolds, told
Honolulu television station KHNL.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's always been deathly afraid of the water,'' Anissa
Reynolds said. ''She doesn't even like to go on a boat. She's
terrified of the water, so she can't swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Island Air owner Tom Beard said the flight originated from
Keahole-Kona International Airport, on the other side of the
island.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Nigeria Democracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- President Clinton, who bypassed oil-rich
Nigeria during his first African tour because the nation was then
under autocratic rule, assured President Olusegun Obasanjo that his
country won't face its difficulties alone.
</P>
<P>
   At a state dinner on Saturday, Obasanjo gave a lengthy toast
welcoming the American president, his daughter Chelsea and a large
U.S. delegation. He called Clinton, ''my friend, a friend of Africa
and, indeed, the acknowledged friend of people of African descent,
wherever they might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his toast to Obasanjo, assured Nigeria that it would
get help and support from the United States as it moves toward
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will stand by a nation, any nation, and
especially Nigeria, that faces its responsibility as bravely as the
people of this nation have in the last few years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From now on the fates of Nigeria and the United States,
economic and otherwise, are tied together.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton plans to visit a village outside of Abuja and
address a women's development center before departing for Tanzania,
where he will meet Monday with Nelson Mandela, who is trying to
broker peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said while he bypassed Nigeria during his initial 1998
tour because it was under the rule of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, he
always hoped to return as president and ''visit a Nigeria worthy of
its people's dreams.'' He said Nigeria is progressing toward that
goal, calling its current government ''the most important
democratic transition in Africa since the fall of apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo won office last year after Abacha's death and led to a
quick turn to democracy. One of the purposes of Clinton's visit is
to encourage democracy to take root here in Africa's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   On his trip home to Washington, Clinton plans a stopover in
Cairo where he'll meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that he didn't have hopes the meeting would
yield a Mideast breakthrough, but was meeting Mubarak because it is
''inconceivable'' to pursue peace in the region without Mubarak's
support.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The smash Harry Potter books, about an apprentice
wizard and his friends at the Hogwarts Schools of Wizardry and
Witchcraft, have caused a boom in applications to Britain's Magic
Circle society.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the society's Young Magicians Club has increased
by 25 percent since the popularity of the four J.K. Rowling books,
with 50 of the 250 members joining in the last few months, said Roy
Marsh, the club's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not been cool for kids, particularly older kids, to be
into magic,'' Marsh said. ''The Harry Potter books have swept this
away. It's now cool again to believe in magic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Circle, whose members include magician David
Copperfield, requires all successful applicants to sign pledges
preventing them from disclosing tricks of the trade to nonmembers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Young Magicians Club are between the ages of 10
and 18.

<HEADLINE> Unless more rainy weather comes, allergy sufferers can expect fall misery </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - After a rainy, cool summer, hay fever
sufferers in New Jersey could be especially miserable this fall,
unless Mother Nature cuts them a break - by dumping even more rain
here over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Above-average rainfall, particularly this month, combined with
record-cool weather last month, have helped ragweed and other such
pollen-producers to thrive. At the same time, the limited number of
sunny days in the ''heat of summer'' kept ragweed, outdoor molds
and other allergy triggers from drying out and burning up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything's growing like crazy,'' said Dr. Catherine
Monteleone, an allergist/immunologist and associate professor of
medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey
in New Brunswick. ''Now if we start getting dry, windy days in the
fall, all that pollen is primed to be released.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragweed, in particular, produces large amounts of pollen that is
very light and can be carried for miles through the air. A leafy
green plant with a yellow crown that can reach several feet tall,
it grows wild in fields, yards and even sidewalk cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Monteleone said the best hope for the roughly 10 percent of
people with seasonal hay fever is just what everyone's been
complaining about: rainy weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rain washes the pollen out of the air, so if we get lots of
rain, people will suffer less,'' Monteleone said.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure what kind of weather the late summer and
early fall will bring, but there's no question the state hasn't had
much of a summer so far.
</P>
<P>
   New Brunswick tied the record for the coolest July in the 108
years records have been kept, with an average temperature of 71.4
degrees - more than three degrees below the norm, according to
assistant state climatologist Keith Arnesen.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the average temperature in July was even lower, 70.8
degrees, also more than three degrees below the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very unusual combination of spring and summer,''
Arnesen said, with March through June posting warmer-than-usual
average temperatures statewide.
</P>
<P>
   After the cool July weather, the average temperature in New
Brunswick so far in August is about 1.5 degrees below normal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, precipitation has been well above normal since June.
The statewide average rainfall that month, 4.32 inches, was
two-thirds of an inch above normal, while July's 5.34-inch
statewide average was almost an inch above normal. Through early
last week, New Brunswick had received 6.21 inches of rain in
August, nearly 50 percent more than the norm for the entire month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite similar weather throughout much of the Northeast,
Arnesen noted that for the entire United States this January
through July ''turns out to be the warmest first seven months of
any year on record.''
</P>
<P>
   If September turns out to be warm and dry here, Monteleone says
allergy sufferers can take several steps to reduce their exposure
to ragweed:
</P>
<P>
   -At home and in the car, keep windows shut and air conditioning
on. That can decrease the amount of pollen coming into a home
ten-thousandfold.
</P>
<P>
   -Avoid doing yardwork or exercising outside until early evening,
when pollen levels fall. Consider wearing a face mask while
gardening.
</P>
<P>
   -Wipe down pets' fur with a damp cloth when they come indoors.
</P>
<P>
   -Shower before going to sleep to prevent bringing pollen into
the bed.
</P>
<P>
   For people who know their allergies generally are bad in the
fall, Monteleone said the best thing is to see a doctor as soon as
possible to try one of many relatively new medications on the
market. They include eyedrops, nasal sprays and allergy pills that
don't have the unpleasant side effects, particularly drowsiness,
that earlier pills did.
</P>
<P>
   Monteleone noted that medications have improved so much that
many allergists have seen the portion of their practice devoted to
giving allergy shots drop from 50 percent to about 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Whitman complies with ethics rules but law says she doesn't have to </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman returns to the
Statehouse Monday after a California trip spent mountain biking
near San Francisco and politicking in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For her time off, Whitman took vacation days, just like any
other state employee.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike any other worker on the public payroll, the governor
didn't need to use personal time for her days spent as the
Republican Party cheerleader outside the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The law that mandates personal time for personal business
applies to only state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is not hired to do a job - she's elected. In the state's
conflict of interest law, that's a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Every governor since the law was created in 1972 has complied,
but they do so saying the measure does not specifically apply to
the chief executive, said Rita L. Strmensky, director of the
state's Executive Commission on Ethical Standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been arguments made that the governor is not
subject to the law because the governor is the only elected
official in the executive branch, all others are employees,''
Strmensky said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no special rule that applies to the governor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the ethics law says personal business should be done
on personal time. State employees who engage in political
activities - fund raising, campaigning, public speaking - during
normal work hours, must use vacation days or take a leave of
absence
</P>
<P>
   The administrative ethics code for the governor's office says
that rule applies to all employees and mirrors the language in the
state law, Strmensky said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, no mention is made for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply not clear if the Legislature intended to govern
the conduct of the governor by the ethics law. There is a valid
legal question here,'' Strmensky said.
</P>
<P>
   As New Jersey's first woman governor, Whitman became a popular
Republican standard-bearer, buoyed in part by the national
reputation that followed her early income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   By one count, Whitman has visited more than 25 states
campaigning for state and national Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she has fastidiously maintained a self-imposed
wall between public and partisan travel, Whitman spokesman Pete
McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She always takes that time as vacation time and doesn't have a
large entourage with her,'' McDonough said. Her expenses outside
the state are always covered by a candidate or political party in
those cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not proper to be campaigning at the taxpayer's expense,''
he said. ''Any elected official that did is foolish. It's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's visit to Los Angeles to offer the Republican spin on
the Democratic convention was no exception, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee paid her expenses, and
Whitman's office submitted a vacation request. As governor, Whitman
is eligible for 20 vacation days, three personal days as well as
paid sick time.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough, the only staff member to accompany her, said he took
vacation time as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republican convention in Philadelphia, Whitman followed
her same rule, but again enjoyed one notable exception allowed by
state law.
</P>
<P>
   All the time she spent hosting the Republican delegates in their
New Jersey hotel, Whitman was not a partisan politician, but
technically still the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Cherry Hill, she's still the governor. She's not the
governor when she's out of state,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and some of her paid staff members did take personal
time for their days at the Republican convention, but only those
who were there for purely political reasons, McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Many staff members accompanied Whitman to the convention hotel
were doing their state jobs, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scheduler still needs to make the governor's schedule.
That's clearly government work,'' McDonough said. ''She is still
the governor, and it has to be done.''

<HEADLINE> Fake Air Controllers Alert in UK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Britain's air traffic watchdog has issued a safety
alert after an accelerated number of instances in which radio
hackers have posed as controllers and given false instructions to
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In all 20 cases reported in the United Kingdom so far this year,
the pilots determined the instructions were bogus before acting on
them, the Civil Aviation Authority said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But, in its safety circular, the agency noted ''a significant
increase in the number of reported occurrences of unauthorized and
malicious transmissions being made on U.K. air traffic
frequencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, only three such cases were reported, but the number
rose to 18 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation authority noted it did not consider the problem a
major safety issue since, before taking any action, pilots are
required to read back instructions to controllers, who then can
countermand the bogus information. The radio hackers also often use
incorrect technology, which immediately tips off pilots, the
authority said.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Dawson, president of the Guild of Air Traffic
Controllers, warned trouble could be ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a criminal act which could ultimately result in a
serious accident,'' Dawson said. ''The problem is that the people
making these spurious calls are mobile and can be very difficult to
trace.''
</P>
<P>
   The portable transmitters used by the hackers are supposed to be
operated only with a license, but they can be bought by mail-order
for as little as $450.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is clearly a safety concern, and there need to be
stricter controls on the sale of this equipment,'' said Carolyn
Evans, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots'
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Times reported that a plane landing at East Midlands
Airport was given bogus instructions by a hacker last month.
</P>
<P>
   The genuine controllers did not hear the false transmission and
were alerted only when they heard the plane's crew speaking to
someone else, the newspaper said. Realizing the aircraft could be
in danger, a controller issued the frantic instruction ''Respond to
my voice only!''

<HEADLINE> Exercise Aids Transplant Patients  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Exercise is good for your organs, even if the
organs originally were someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's beneficial for a lot of reasons -- to play basketball, or
go back to work, or just live your life,'' said NBA All-Star
forward Sean Elliott, who has a kidney transplanted from his
brother, Noel.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott had developed a progressive disease, focal segmental
glomerular sclerosis, which reduces the kidneys' ability to filter
the body's waste products. ''I started retaining a ton of water,''
he said. ''I lost my appetite. I became fatigued and started lying
in bed a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, 1999, Elliott had the transplant that let him start
rebuilding his career and his life. ''A month out of surgery, I
felt great -- but extremely out of shape for me. It took me seven
months to make it back to playing the game of basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is the first professional athlete to return to a sport
after receiving an organ transplant. But his return to exercise
after a transplant is not unusual. Doctors commonly recommend
physical activity for patients with transplants.
</P>
<P>
   A study in The New England Journal of Medicine in January 1999
found that heart transplant patients who did aerobic training
gained greater endurance after six months, compared with patients
who did not take part in the exercise program. Researchers at the
University of California at Los Angeles concluded ''exercise
training increases the capacity for physical work.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have found similar benefits for patients with
other transplants. For instance, an Austrian study published in
1998 in the American College of Chest Physicians' journal, Chest,
found that stationary bike training improved the performance of
lung transplant recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Transplantees these days are not only encouraged to exercise,
they are encouraged to compete. They even have their own version of
the Olympics, the World Transplant Games, open to people with a
functioning organ transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the world games, which will be held in 2001, were
this year's U.S. games, organized by the National Kidney
Foundation. They were held in June at Disney's Wide World of Sports
Complex in Orlando, Fla., with Elliott as the official leading
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, transplantees have special needs in exercise. Chief
among them is a greater need to stay hydrated. The requirement is
partly a response to the drugs the patients take to suppress their
immune systems, so their own bodies don't reject the donated
organs, said Dr. Sharon Hunt, a heart transplant cardiologist at
Stanford University. ''They all have a mild compromise in kidney
function,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drink about a gallon of water a day, at least,'' Elliott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart transplant patients may never reach the exercise ability
of similar people who have their own hearts, although the
difference might not be noticeable except to an elite athlete, Hunt
said. ''They can't quite run the same marathon, but I'm guessing 80
percent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted hearts don't function quite the same to exercise,
Hunt said. They don't immediately respond to stress by beating
faster, because nerve connections needed to do this are not there,
she said. Instead, the heart responds initially by contracting
harder to pump blood, and starts to beat faster after a few minutes
in response to higher levels of the hormone adrenaline, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other transplantees should have no such limitations on their
performance, said Dr. Lew Teperman, director of transplantation at
New York University. But the patients may have lingering problems
from the disease that forced them to get the transplant, he said.
For instance, former diabetics with a transplanted pancreas may
have compromised hearts or blood vessels from the diabetes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, people should not see transplant patients as any less
able than people with all their original organs, said Corinne
Carson, a 29-year-old Washington woman who received a liver
transplant in 1994. In the season after the operation, Carson
played basketball at Marymount University in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Carson tried out for the Women's National Basketball Association
in 1997. But she didn't make the WNBA cut, and she suspects
officials' perception of her health was a reason why. ''I had a
couple of coaches tell me that if I get on someone's team, you are
going to raise insurance prices,'' she said. ''They don't
understand I have no restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Carson is thinking about trying out again. ''I can
outplay the majority of girls out there, but I don't want my
transplant held against me,'' she said. ''I just want a fair
tryout. If I make it, I make it. If I don't, I don't.''

<HEADLINE> A Birth Every 24 Seconds in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's population is growing by one baby
every 24 seconds, the government announced Sunday, saying the
population at of Jan. 1, 2000, reached 65,205,000.
</P>
<P>
   The official census report from the Central Agency for
Mobilization and Statistics estimated an increase to 113 million by
2029.
</P>
<P>
   The census said there has been an average annual increase of
1.235 million -- an average of one birth every 24.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The increase in the population is significant, but not
alarming,'' said Ihab Oloui, chairman of the agency, at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 65.2 million Egyptians, an estimated 1.9 million live
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The last government census in 1996 put Egypt's population at
slightly above 59 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 percent of the total population live in Cairo and
the Delta region, ''an indication of the disproportion in
demographic placement.'' Oloui said.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest population density is in the southern Sinai region.

<HEADLINE> Over a quiet beach, a loud debate about access  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A compromise plan for access to one of New
Jersey's most protected beaches has managed to anger both
conservationists and fishermen, who had been on opposite sides of
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to limit access by
beach buggies to Holgate Beach, a 3-mile piece of federally
protected wilderness at the southern tip of Long Beach Island.
</P>
<P>
   Motorized vehicles would be banned from land above mean high
tide, which is owned by the federal government, but not from land
below mean high tide, which is owned by New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups are angry that the Fish and Wildlife
Service gave up its original proposal to ask the state to join in
the ban, a step that would have exiled motorized vehicles from
Holgate Beach altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilderness Society, a conservation group, urged the
government to stick by its initial proposal. The group complained
that ''motorized trespassers'' are spreading garbage and disturbing
several federally protected species, including the piping plover, a
small bird.
</P>
<P>
   ''No longer is Holgate a place where visitors can find solitude
and remoteness that wilderness is supposed to provide,'' the group
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But some fishing groups say even the revised Fish and Wildlife
proposal is unnecessary and could, depending on tides, stop
fishermen from driving their equipment to favorite fishing spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the heavy tackle and coolers - and presumably you're
going to carry a big fish back too - it's a long, tough walk,''
said Bob DeLeonard, president of the New Jersey Beach Buggy
Association, which represents surf fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the government designated as wilderness more than 6,600
acres of the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge - including
the 3-mile stretch of Holgate Beach. A prior law, the 1964
Wilderness Act, barred use of motor vehicles in wilderness areas.
The Fish and Wildlife Service says beach buggies have therefore
been illegal on Holgate Beach for 25 years, although a ban was
never enforced.
</P>
<P>
   A 1989 compromise between the government and fishermen keeps
vehicles out of the Holgate area from April 15 to Sept. 1 every
year, during breeding season of the piping plover. But fishermen
still can drive onto the beach in the fall, their prime season.
</P>
<P>
   A new battle began in 1997, when Congress directed the Interior
Department to prepare 15-year plans for each of the nation's 514
national wildlife refuges.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the Forsythe refuge called for adding 16,900 acres
to its current size of 43,656 acres, creating new trails, fishing
piers, hunting areas and visitors centers - and closing the Holgate
wilderness area to motorized vehicles year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Fish and Wildlife Service would close
federal land near beach dunes to motor vehicles and seek a license
from the New Jersey Tidelands Council to close state-owned land
closer to the surf.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service held public meetings in Cape May,
Atlantic and Ocean counties and received more than 1,600 letters,
many objecting to the proposed ban on motor vehicles on Holgate
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the service issued its scaled-back proposal that has
satisfied neither side in the debate: Holgate Beach above mean high
tide would be closed year-round to motor vehicles, but no effort
would be made to ban vehicles on state land below mean high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the refuge manager would try to introduce ferry service to
carry fishermen and others from populated Long Beach Island to the
southern tip of the Holgate Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision is due by the Fish and Wildlife Service next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge is named for a former congressman, Edwin B. Forsythe,
described by DeLeonard as ''an avid beach buggy surf fisherman.''
DeLeonard said Forsythe, who served from 1970 until his death in
1984, would be ''shocked and dismayed'' that beach buggy access to
Holgate Beach is now threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Saxton, R-Mount Holly, succeeded Forsythe in Congress
and has sided with fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unreasonable to impose this kind of restriction on a
historic, beneficial use of public lands,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fears Rise on Lebanon Frontier  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATIMA GATE, Lebanon (AP) -- As the Israeli patrol jeep
approached, kicking up white dust, Mohammed Khalil swung into
action. The 24-year-old man grabbed a rock the size of a football
and hurled it over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an enemy that occupied our land and expelled us from
our homes,'' said the bearded Shiite Muslim, a coffee vendor,
dusting off his hands. ''That's the least we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the rock bounced harmlessly off the bulletproof
windshield and the jeep sped on. But things don't always end so
peacefully, and the daily stonings, fire-bombings and verbal taunts
are turning the Fatima Gate into a flash point.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has reported more than 370 incidents to the United
Nations since it withdrew in May, ending 24 years of military
involvement in Lebanon. By Lebanese and Israeli count, eight
Israeli soldiers and a dozen Arabs have been injured. Israel says
it has had enough and insists the Lebanese authorities keep the
peace. Lebanon says it won't act as Israel's policeman.
</P>
<P>
   The fear on both sides is that an incident could get out of hand
and draw Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas into a renewal of
the fighting that raged for 18 years until the Israelis left.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has sent peacekeeping troops into the former
Israeli zone but has steered away from the former crossing point at
Fatima Gate. It too has hinted that the Lebanese should take
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.N. is not responsible for guarding the border,'' said
Timur Goksel, adviser to the commander of the 5,000-member U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Border monitoring is our function. Border security is
essentially a national responsibility,'' Goksel said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government has sent 1,000 soldiers and policemen
south but is staying away from Fatima Gate, confining itself
largely to two bases in towns near the border.
</P>
<P>
   So Hezbollah guerrillas remain in charge at the Fatima Gate,
where some Lebanese homes are just a few paces from the fence and
the red roofs of the Israeli village of Metulla are an apple grove
away.
</P>
<P>
   Unarmed guerrillas wearing civilian clothes walk back and forth
along the former crossing point, recognizable only by their two-way
radios.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere along the border, the guerrillas are quick to turn
people away from the fence, but here, stone-throwers are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is happening is just a symbolic expression before the
cameras,'' Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The spot is weighted with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers say the gate was named for a peasant girl whose
wounded mother cried out for her after the two were caught in a gun
battle along the fence between Israeli troops and Palestinian
guerrillas in 1976. The woman was taken to Israel for treatment and
the next day an Israeli soldier called out to Fatima that her
mother was fine.
</P>
<P>
   It also became known as the Good Fence, where Lebanese living in
the occupied border zone used to cross into Israel for jobs and
medical care, and where last May some 6,000 former Israeli-allied
militiamen and their families fled into exile in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Today, parents bring their children to walk and take pictures.
Scouts and school children come by the busload.
</P>
<P>
   Stonings ebb and flow depending on the crowd size and mood.
Weekends are generally busier.
</P>
<P>
   In the most serious incident, Israeli soldiers opened fire June
24 when two men tried to climb over the fence. Three Jordanian
trade unionists, part of a delegation shouting insults at the
Israelis, were injured along with one Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, a crowd was preparing to throw a firebomb when
soldiers opened fire, injuring a Canadian and a Lebanese journalist
and a Lebanese teen-ager who was throwing stones.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes stones hit soldiers, injuring them. Sometimes the
soldiers throw stones back.
</P>
<P>
   A local contractor has donated piles of stones and gravel, which
are regularly replenished.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors just come to gaze into Israel. And on the other
side, Lebanese exiles come to stare at their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The 700-yard (637-meter) strip on the Lebanese side has become a
promenade. Stalls sell juice, coffee, tea, biscuits and corn on the
cob. Three Hezbollah stalls play tapes of guerrilla anthems and
speeches, and sell Hezbollah flags, baseball caps, tapes and
posters.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Said, the Palestinian-American writer, tossed a stone
here last month. He explained later: ''The spirit of the place
infected everyone with the same impulse, to make a symbolic gesture
of joy that the occupation had ended.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. May Be Key To House Control  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A first-term congressman in a fickle
district, Democratic Rep. Joe Hoeffel was explaining his vote
against cutting taxes on Social Security benefits when the fax
machine spit out a Republican attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wrong to punish seniors with a tax on those hard-earned
benefits,'' read the GOP charge.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Hoeffel told reporters questioning him in the
basement of the county courthouse that Republicans were ''pandering
to seniors'' with a tax cut. The legislation, he said, shortchanged
Medicare by taking away a guaranteed source of its funding.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel's ability to persuade voters with his argument in one of
the nation's classic swing districts will go a long way toward
determining whether he can defeat his moderate Republican rival,
state Sen. Stewart Greenleaf.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a personal battle, strategists in both parties agree
the race is one of about 30 most likely to determine whether
Democrats or Republicans win control of the House on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   From the well-manicured lawns on Philadelphia's Main Line to the
grittier precincts around Norristown, Pennsylvania's 13th
Congressional District is so politically competitive it has sent
four different representatives to Congress in the last five
elections.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, Lawrence Coughlin, held the seat for nearly a
quarter century before retiring in 1992. His departure set off a
series of close elections in the changing district, often in rough
harmony with national trends.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, won the seat in 1992,
the year Bill Clinton was elected president. But she unexpectedly
voted for a tax increase as part of Clinton's budget package --
including the tax on some Social Security benefits that Hoeffel
recently voted not to repeal -- and lost the seat in the GOP
landslide of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, Jon Fox, held sway for two terms before losing to
Hoeffel in 1998, when Democrats unexpectedly won seats nationwide
but fell short of regaining control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   This time, predicts Mark Gersh, a strategist and longtime
adviser to House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, ''neither side is
going to win by more than a few (percentage) points.''
</P>
<P>
   The district is Republican by registration, moderate by
ideology, better educated than the nation as a whole, according to
strategists on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a race closely watched by both parties, the candidates
are getting high-profile help. Speaker Dennis Hastert and Majority
Leader Dick Armey both have campaigned for Greenleaf. Sen. John
McCain, who showed strong support from independents during the
presidential primaries, also stopped in the district on his way to
the Republicans' convention this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel joined Clinton at a fund-raiser in Philadelphia earlier
in the year, netting more than $100,000 for his campaign. He's also
been visited by Gephardt and Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., leader
of the party's campaign money operation in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Soft spoken, Greenleaf has a self-deprecating side. He said that
anyone who blinked would have missed his brief appearance at the
GOP convention podium.
</P>
<P>
   To the relief of party officials in Washington, he won a primary
over a conservative challenger, and other Republicans point to
polls showing Hoeffel under 50 percent in support, a traditional
sign of danger for an incumbent. At the same time, GOP strategists
fret privately that Hoeffel had more than $800,000 in the bank as
of June 30, compared to slightly more than $400,000 for Greenleaf.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to separate himself from the party's conservatives in
Congress, Greenleaf described himself as a ''social moderate'' on
women's and children's issues and the environment and said he will
not ''rubber stamp'' anything.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said he will stress three issues this fall:
Social Security and Medicare, education, and cutting taxes while
paying attention to the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would pay off the debt,'' Greenleaf said. But at the same
time when opportunity arises for tax cuts ''you have to jump at it.
You have to grab any middle class tax reduction'' that's available.
He supported recent GOP legislation to reduce the so-called
marriage penalty, adding that 62,000 taxpayers in his district
would have benefited had Clinton not vetoed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel voted against the GOP marriage penalty bill, well aware
that voting for a tax increase -- rather than a tax cut -- did in
Margolies-Mezvinsky, the last Democrat to hold the seat.
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances are different now, he said, ''She said up to
the day of the vote she would vote no,'' then cast her vote in
favor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That last-minute switch, he added, ''allowed the Republicans to
call her a liar, and that's what many did, for 15 months.''
</P>
<P>
   In his case, he noted he's voted consistently against GOP tax
cut proposals and in favor of more modest Democratic alternatives.

<HEADLINE> Tribute for UK Trapped Airmen  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD MIDDLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- With the laying of wreaths and a
Scottish piper's lament, Britain's Royal Air Force paid tribute
Sunday to four World War II airmen whose bodies were trapped inside
an Icelandic glacier for nearly 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The men's remains were retrieved last week during a three-day
expedition to the wreckage of their Fairey Battle bomber plane,
which crashed in May 1941.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the four were accorded full military honors at a
commemorative service at Reykjavik's Fossfogur cemetery attended by
their relatives, RAF officials and dignitaries from several
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is bringing an issue to a final close. It now means that
we have been given a final resting place,'' said Arthur Fickling,
the namesake nephew of the plane's pilot, Arthur Round of
Wellington, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most poignant offerings was a bouquet of six red roses
sent from New Zealand by Round's childhood sweetheart, 83-year-old
Nan Poole. ''Thanks for many happy memories, dear 'Arsa,' your old
pal Nan,'' the card read.
</P>
<P>
   The airmen's plane crashed in thick fog shortly after takeoff
from Akureyri airport in north Iceland. The site near the glacial
summit of a 4,000-foot mountain was located two days later and a
short funeral service was held, but the spot was quickly lost in a
blanket of snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
   It was rediscovered last year by Icelandic historian Ordur
Geirsson after a 20-year search, inspired by tales of Round's
aviation skills.
</P>
<P>
   During a 15-minute service at a simple Lutheran church, prayers
were said Sunday for Round, who died two days after his 19th
birthday, and his three English colleagues -- radio operator
Reginald Hopkins, 21, of Southampton, Flight Sgt. Keith Garrett,
22, of Worksop, and Pilot Officer Henry Talbot, 24, of North
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the central altar were a raised candle ringed by red
carnations and four other candles, representing the dead airmen.
</P>
<P>
   After the service, the 150-strong congregation walked the short
way to the communal grave site, where the headstones have been
engraved with the RAF's motto in Latin, translating to ''through
difficulties to the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   As a piper began to play ''Flowers of the Forest,'' a lament
dating from the Battle of Flodden in 1513, a RAF Nimrod flew
overhead, followed in its tribute by an Icelandic coast guard
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   As the noise of the aircraft died away in the still, overcast
morning, 10 relatives stepped forward to lay their own personal
wreaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always felt that there was much more to my uncle's death
than my family were told at the time,'' said Keith Slaney of
Costhorp, England, named after his uncle, airman Keith Garrett.
''Now that we have had this service to go to, it closes the final
chapter.''

<HEADLINE> Ga. Reps Don't Fly Stage Flag  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Often lost among the four flags standing
outside Rep. Cynthia McKinney's Washington office is the one that's
missing.
</P>
<P>
   In McKinney's doorway, you can find banners of the American
Stars and Stripes, the Olympic games, DeKalb County, Ga., and one
commemorating prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   But the official flag of Georgia -- the one that includes a large
Confederate X -- is nowhere to be found, even though state flags are
customary office decor for members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney and fellow Georgia Democrat John Lewis, a former civil
rights leader, choose not to display the flag because they find it
divisive. Yet it's a quiet protest -- one that was never really
announced.
</P>
<P>
   If asked, they'll share their opinions that the banner should be
redrawn, that the current version was adopted in 1956 as an act of
racist defiance against school desegregation rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be laid to rest,'' McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes down to it, Lewis and McKinney know the matter
is out of their hands. They're reluctant to carry the cause much
further and are perfectly willing to leave it up to the Democratic
governor and Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of now, I don't plan to get up there and fight,'' Lewis
said. ''I'll fight on an individual level for myself, and the day
may come when it may be needed for me to play a much more involved
role. But there's very little we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some critics of the state flag contend that now is
the perfect time to take aim. After all, it's an election year, and
the Confederate banner over South Carolina's Capitol created quite
a stir when George W. Bush and John McCain went to that state in
pursuit of the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only Georgia and Mississippi feature the Confederate emblem
on their official flags -- and it's much larger on Georgia's.
</P>
<P>
   The other 11 members of the state's Congressional delegation
display the flag, including Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop, who
like McKinney and Lewis is black. Bishop declined to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The flag was also one of the first pieces of decoration that
arrived at the Washington office of Democrat Zell Miller, appointed
last month to fill the Senate vacancy left by the death of
Republican Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former two-term governor, almost lost his re-election
bid after leading an unsuccessful crusade in 1993 to change the
flag. Now he faces another campaign in November against former Sen.
Mack Mattingly for the right to finish the four years left on
Coverdell's term.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by Georgia State University earlier this year indicates
the flag issue could be political poison. In that poll, 56 percent
wanted to keep it the way it was, and only 31 percent wanted to
change it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might be the right thing to do. But if there's not a lot of
public support behind you, it's the sort of thing politicians would
like to avoid,'' Michael Binford, a Georgia State political
scientist, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans figure Georgia's Democrats are trying to have
it both ways. They argue they're trying to use the flag as a tool
to attack GOP supporters yet avoid messing with it, fearing the
wrath of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're serious about it, they should come up with a
formula,'' said Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican who says he would
like the Legislature to call meetings to discuss the matter. ''The
lack of leadership is astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston said he suspects Democrats might be forming a
''backroom plan'' to wait until after the November elections and
then call a statewide referendum for 2002, when Gov. Roy Barnes
leaves office and a successor is chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would bring out the vote and help their side,'' Kingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the South Carolina primary was any indication, the matter
could be hashed out before then -- especially if Georgia lives up to
its billing as a ''battleground state.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president,
has already criticized Bush's position not to meddle in South
Carolina's affairs. Such a fight could be headed to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been some previews.
</P>
<P>
   In March, students at Centennial High School in Fulton County
voted against flying the state flag at the building. And earlier
this month, the NCAA Executive Committee turned down calls by civil
rights group to move three upcoming Final Four basketball
tournaments out of Atlanta because of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Georgia flag was at the center of a spat between
lawmakers in Georgia and New York. Gov. George Pataki approved its
removal from the New York Capitol, and two Georgia lawmakers
retaliated by taking down New York's flag from their Capitol
rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pranksters, Georgia Senate Minority Leader Eric
Johnson, said he expects the issue will emerge again soon -- and
once again, he'll oppose any change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pickup trucks, deer hunting, barefoot girls and boiled peanuts
-- that's what the flag represents to the vast majority of
Georgians,'' Johnson said. ''Nobody looks at it as a symbol of
hate.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Crunch Hits Numbers Crunchers  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's numbers crunchers quietly
churn out data vital to tracking the economy's pulse and making
informed policy and business decisions. But they may have to pare
back if Congress doesn't come up with more money soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached the point where -- it's not the rubber hitting
the road. It's the rim hitting the road,'' said Robert Shapiro, the
Commerce Department's under secretary for economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bureau of Economic Analysis, one of the department's main
numbers-crunching units, the budget has declined in real, inflation
adjusted terms by 12 percent over the last five years, agency
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the BEA produces the Holy Grail of economic
statistics: the Gross Domestic Product, the total output of goods
and services within the United States. It's just one of the reports
the Federal Reserve looks at when making interest rate policies --
decisions that affect millions of consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   BEA's current budget is $43.8 million. The House voted to
provide another $43.8 million to BEA in fiscal year 2001, which
begins Oct. 1, an amount that Shapiro said would cause cutbacks to
the agency's economic data. The Senate Appropriations Committee,
meanwhile, has proposed $48.3 million -- close to the nearly $49
million President Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   BEA's funding issue probably won't be resolved until sometime
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can no longer guarantee the timeliness and frequency of
these economic measures if Congress were to go ahead and cut BEA
again in real terms as the House mark would do,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   If BEA doesn't get more money this year, Shapiro said the agency
is considering a number of possibilities including: producing two
estimates of GDP per quarter instead of the current three; doing
the trade report quarterly rather than monthly; and producing state
personal income reports annually instead of quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce also is looking to get more money for numbers crunchers
at its Census Bureau, whose economic data includes reports tracking
housing, construction and retail activity. It also teams up with
the BEA for the monthly trade report.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is small change -- in a huge budget of over $1.7 trillion
-- to produce the basic data that the economy runs on,'' Shapiro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a leading group of economists, the National
Association for Business Economics, said topping their list of
concerns is adequate funding for the government's numbers
crunchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''These data are critical to maintaining the prosperity that we
have enjoyed,'' said Diane Swonk, president of NABE and chief
economist for Bank One Corp. ''They shape business policy and
provide the very core of policy-making decisions.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Vote in Marrred Elections  </HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAABDAT, Lebanon (AP) -- With security forces guarding towns and
polling stations in central and northern Lebanon, Lebanese voted
for parliamentary representatives Sunday in an election sure to
pack the legislature with pro-Syrian representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical of elections held since the end of the 1975-1990
civil war, there were limited complaints about irregularities,
including the presence of uncertified ballots, the absence of names
on voters' lists, forged voter registration cards and the lack of
secrecy in casting ballots leaving voters open to intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints, the polling was peaceful and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   The capital Beirut and the eastern and southern provinces will
vote next Sunday. It will be the first time in nearly three decades
that southern regions near the border with Israel will vote, an
event made possible by the Israeli withdrawal from a border buffer
zone in May.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, some 286 candidates -- most of whom had
Syria's tacit approval -- contested 63 seats in the 128-member
legislature for the provinces of Mount Lebanon and North Lebanon,
the Christian heartland where 1.3 million Lebanese over the age of
21 were eligible to vote. Polling stations in Mount Lebanon's four
electoral districts and the North's three districts opened at 7
a.m. and closed at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Christian groups had called for a boycott of the
elections to protest what they described as Syria's packaging of
the ballot to ensure a loyal parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But their call went largely unheeded, and the voting is expected
to ensure a four-year parliament packed with pro-Syrians. Syria is
the main power in Lebanon with 30,000 troops deployed across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Initial results were expected as early as Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 soldiers on Sunday manned checkpoints and major
road intersections or patrolled in armored vehicles to ensure
violence-free balloting. Police were in charge inside polling
stations. Weapons licenses were canceled and about 120 people have
been arrested for violating the ban. All nightclubs and restaurants
in Mount Lebanon and the North have been ordered closed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Armenian quarter of Bourj Hammoud, opponents mobbed the
car of an Armenian candidate on a list headed by legislator Nassib
Lahoud, a former ambassador to Washington battling against Interior
Minister Michel Murr.
</P>
<P>
   President Emile Lahoud was among the morning voters, casting his
ballot at a polling station in the post office at his Mount Lebanon
hometown of Baabdat, 10 miles northeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud,'' a beaming Lahoud told reporters later. ''This is
the first time I've voted in my life,'' said Lahoud, a 64-year-old
former army commander who could not vote in the past because of
military regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud called on voters not to be swayed by the influence of
money. ''He who buys you can sell you. ... Vote your conscience,''
said Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for the good people,'' George Massoud, a 70-year-old
grocer said as he opened his store for business after casting his
ballot in Baabdat.
</P>
<P>
   Druse leader Walid Jumblatt charged that the government was
heavily involved on the side of his challengers. ''They are
hysterical. They lost their nerve,'' he said of the campaign
against him in the Chouf district.

<HEADLINE> Russian sailors honored at U.S. Naval Submarine Base  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROTON, Conn. (AP) - The 118 sailors who perished two weeks ago
aboard the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk were honored Saturday
during a ceremony at the U.S. Naval Submarine Base.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people attended, including former submariners, sailors
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   John Carcioppolo, commander of the Groton Navy base and a former
Chief of the Boat on the U.S.S. Dallas, and other members of the
Submarine Veterans Inc., of Groton and the Submarine Veterans of
World War II organized the mid-morning service along the Thames
River.
</P>
<P>
   Taps was played as the crowd stood near the USS Nautilus
Memorial, and a bell was struck 118 times to pay homage to the
Russian sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we drop the political differences of the two countries
that were almost enough to escalate to the point of war,''
Carcioppolo said. ''We are here to honor and pay our respects to
other submariners that are now on eternal patrol.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kimo Ward of Montville, the memorial service was an
opportunity to pay tribute to all submariners who have perished at
sea, including former friends as well as adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping a wreath in the river, Ward said the fate of the Kursk
brought back painful memories of friends who died aboard the
Thresher, which sank more than 30 years ago, killing all on board.
The United States has lost two nuclear submarines at sea - the
Thresher in 1963 and the Scorpion in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, a retired sonar technician, was involved in the searches
for both, which took place in the days after the submarines
disappeared. Neither was ever found.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just another needless tragedy,'' Ward said of the
Kursk. ''But this is also something that you have to deal with
because we know it can happen at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian nuclear sub sank in the Barents Sea two weeks ago
after two explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian experts have not conclusively determined what was
responsible for the blasts. Military officials say the most likely
scenario was that the Kursk collided with another vessel, most
likely a foreign submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Both Britain and the United States denied their submarines
collided with the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the most likely reason for the sinking was an
internal malfunction and explosion in the submarine's torpedo
compartment. Russian officials also have not ruled out the
possibility that the Kursk hit a World War II-era mine.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese tradition develops into modern American sport  </HEADLINE>
By MIRANDA LEITSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The 12 young men and women grip their paddles,
holding them at a slight angle above the water and awaiting the
start. They have sweated and strained nine weeks for this moment -
their first dragon boat race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meep,'' the start signal blares, and they are storming across
Meadow Lake in their 2,000-pound boat decorated with a red dragon's
head and tail, racing in the Hong Kong dragon boat festival.
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ''Paddle! Paddle! Go! Go! Go!'' mix with drum beats,
resounding over the lake.
</P>
<P>
   It's over in less than four minutes, and Carol Chang, the team's
pacesetting drummer, leads the Xtreme NY club in a cheer for its
third place finish. ''Extreme!'' the dripping wet crew shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The paddlers at the mid-August meet in New York's borough of
Queens were vying in the ancient Chinese sport of dragon boating -
more than 2,000 years old - and now one of America's fastest
growing sports.
</P>
<P>
   From San Francisco to New York, and along the Mississippi River
in places as unlikely as Dubuque, Iowa, more than 400 teams across
the country are dragon boating, said Iowan Gary Carstens of the
United States Dragon Boat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Most dragon boating hotspots are in the Midwest, which has 275
teams. Nearly 70 teams train in New York City, and some 80 teams
practice in and around Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it. I want to win as much as anybody else, but I love
the team community. And even though I come out four days a week, it
is with people I like,'' said Ginny O'Hare, 33, co-captain of New
York's Wall Street Lions crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had never heard of it before,'' said Ellen Tacelosky, 32, a
banker from Arlington, Va., whose D.C. Dragons team paddles on
Washington's Anacostia River. ''It is very, very hard, and it
hasn't gotten better. But it's a great workout on the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the sport - which traditionally has a crew of 18
paddlers, a steerer and a drummer setting the pace - is
synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the paddles combine as one big paddle, and that's what
moves the boat forward,'' said Xtreme NY co-captain Kang Ko, 30, of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's a matter of speed. Paddlers use a combination
of strokes to propel the 38-foot-long canoes. Sharp slices through
the water make for a quick start or a run for the finish; deeper
pulls maintain a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Xtreme NY team had 12 paddlers in its 500-meter race.
Usually, a team has two rows of nine paddlers each competing for
250, 500 or 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   The sport has attracted great interest outside the Asian
community, and Carstens noted that mostly non-Asians compete in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the sport is the promotion of Asian culture,'' said
Tim Woo, 37, of Flushing, Queens. But, he added, ''even in New
York, where I would say you have the highest Asian-American
participation, it's only 30 to 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragon boating began in China with the legend of Qu Yuan, a
poet-statesman who drowned himself in the Milo River in Central
Hunan province more than 2,000 years ago to protest government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Qu's bereaved countrymen rowed boats in the river, beating their
paddles against the water to frighten fish and dragons away from
his body.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of our lives,'' said May Wong, a Hong Kong native
now living in New York. ''I like it because it brings out Chinese
traditions and Americans can join in. They can learn something
about the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to trace the roots of the sport in the United
States. A Philadelphia rowing team was given a dragon boat in 1983
by a Hong Kong group, said Bill Toole of the Philadelphia dragon
boat team. An early dragon boat festival in New York in 1991 -
sponsored by a Hong Kong group - sparked further interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went from an event to promote Hong Kong to becoming a
community thing,'' said Henry Wan, chairman of the Hong Kong Dragon
Boat Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Paddlers say one reason for the sport's popularity is that it
does not require too much skill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only so many people can play soccer, rugby or baseball, but
everyone can paddle,'' said Carstens, 48. ''You don't have to go
out and kill yourself. It's good for you mentally, good for you
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a team in Cedar Rapids where the youngest person is
62,'' said Carstens. ''Their motto is: 'We can do everything for a
minute and a half.'''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Asks For Help  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Behind the throng of poor and unemployed
straining to catch a glimpse of President Clinton in his passing
motorcade, a white banner summed up the hopes of many Nigerians:
''This is the time to cancel Nigeria's debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled by staggering loan payments accumulated under brutal
dictators of the past, Nigeria has asked Clinton to help them fight
alarming poverty by canceling its share of the West African'
nation's estimated $32 billion in international debt.
</P>
<P>
   In an impassioned speech at a banquet held in Clinton's honor
Saturday night, President Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's first
civilian leader in 15 years, blamed unpaid debts for entrenching
the divide between rich and poor in Nigeria and other impoverished
African states. The U.S. share of Nigeria's debt is estimated at
close to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The transfer of wealth from the very poor to the very rich
must stop,'' Obasanjo said, calling debt cancellation a ''moral
responsibility and a humane duty.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reward for Obasanjo's earlier pledge to work to
''bring an element of stability'' to skyrocketing world oil prices,
Clinton has said the United States will offer relief and debt
rescheduling if Nigeria fights corruption and uses its savings to
improve roads, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''I agree that we should help you with the debt burden, as long
as you are going to spend the savings of the debt on the real human
and economic longterm needs of the people of Nigeria,'' he said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Since Obasanjo won elections in 1999 ending years of military
rule, U.S. aid to Nigeria has grown from almost nothing to about
$170 million a year -- making it the biggest U.S. aid recipient in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration has consistently rejected calls for
the sweeping debt cancellation that African governments argue they
need to overcome poverty, AIDS and a legacy of dictatorships and
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria says it will remain unable to rebuild the roads, clinics
and schools left to decay by a succession of military regimes.
</P>
<P>
   The government says debt payments soak up much of state oil
revenues, the world's sixth-largest. The civil service teeters on
collapse and Nigeria can afford to spend only $1 per person
annually on health compared, compared to the $60 minimum
recommended by the U.N. World Health Organization, Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and teachers go unpaid, universities are without books
and sometimes sell diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some foreign diplomats and Nigerians fear that debt relief
intended to help the poor could end up enriching crooked government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has made fighting corruption a priority, yet civil
servants still routinely demand bribes and Nigerian newspapers are
filled with allegations of government graft.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent 77-page letter to Clinton, Gani Fawehinmi, a
well-known opposition activist, asked the United States to forgive
past loans but warned them against granting any in the future,
saying there was nothing to prevent officials from stealing more.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you insist on advancing with such (future) loans, then you
must understand that you are on your own and that Nigerians cannot
accept any responsibility for them,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian Presidential Spokesman Doyin Okupe said Sunday his
government was pleased with the growing U.S. commitment to Nigeria,
which he hoped would overcome Clinton's refusal to cancel Nigerian
debt by providing spinoff economic benefits in oil, agriculture and
other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the debt question is not fully addressed as most
people would have expected, there is now some light at the end of
the tunnel,'' Okupe said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lauds Nigeria Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Africans must ''break the silence'' about
AIDS or risk losing hard-fought democratic and economic gains,
President Clinton said Sunday as the White House announced more
than $20 million in U.S. aid to fight AIDS, malaria and other
diseases devastating Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every country, in any culture, it is difficult, painful, at
the very least embarrassing, to talk about the issues involved with
AIDS,'' Clinton said after touring a health center in the Nigerian
capital and hearing the stories of several people living with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a throng of singing children, Clinton earlier trudged
through the Nigerian village of Ushafa, past mud brick huts and
flimsy metal sheds, with scrawny chickens scattering in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to help you build your economy, educate your children
and build a better life,'' he told villagers, wearing a
cream-colored royal African robe given to him by the village chief.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS killed 2.8 million people worldwide last year, and is now
the leading cause of death in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In sub-Saharan Africa, 13 million children have lost a parent to
AIDS, and the disease is reducing life expectancies and dimming
development hopes across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a child
die of AIDS?'' Clinton asked. ''We have to break the silence about
how this disease spreads and how to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, which is primarily transmitted sexually in Africa, is
entirely preventable, Clinton reminded his audience.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.6 million Nigerians, 5.4 percent of the population, are
afflicted with AIDS. That puts the country on better footing than
many of its neighbors with higher infection rates, but in danger of
letting the disease gain ground, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''AIDS can rob a country of its future,'' Clinton said. ''I know
you are not going to let that happen to Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's two-day stay in Nigeria is intended to underscore U.S.
approval of the 15-month-old democratic government in Africa's most
populous nation, with 123 million people.
</P>
<P>
   He promised continued U.S. help, but did not, as Nigerian
President Olusegun Obasanjo had hoped, agree to cancel or cut the
nearly $1 billion U.S. portion of Nigeria's $32 billion foreign
debt, a move that would require congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to business executives later Sunday, however, Clinton
said he supports reducing the debt, but only if Nigeria spends the
extra money on improving lives and diversifying the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be a dividend to democracy for the people of
Nigeria,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by daughter Chelsea, began his day with
services at a Baptist church in Abuja, and then ventured outside
the capital to get a firsthand look Sunday at both the pageantry
and poverty of life in Ushafa, a pottery-making center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Nigeria to express the support of the people of the
United States,'' Clinton told villagers from a makeshift platform.
''We support your democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Khairat Abdulrazaq Gwadabe, who represents the village in the
Nigerian Senate, said she explained Clinton's visit to villagers
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to translate it as the king of the world himself is
coming. The president of the world is coming to their chief,''
Gwadabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said they hoped Clinton's visit would translate into a
new school, a factory or some other investment, although they were
unclear on how that might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hajiya Haunwa Mohammad, 42, said if Clinton could help ease
Nigeria's debt, she might earn more money selling sugar and other
products. Her four daughters, ages 8 to 23, might also go to
school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, my children don't go to school because I have no money
for their school fees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's brief African tour will also take him to Tanzania on
Monday. Former South African President Nelson Mandela invited
Clinton there to help preside over a planned peace ceremony to end
seven years of civil war in neighboring Burundi. Hopes for a
cease-fire agreement faded this week and negotiators began work
Sunday on a less ambitious pact. Clinton still plans to go out of
respect for Mandela's efforts so far, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours in Tanzania, Clinton plans to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo to discuss the status of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace peace process.

<HEADLINE> All Major Moscow TV Knocked Off Air  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Fire spread Sunday through the Ostankino
television tower, the world's second-tallest freestanding
structure, knocking out most TV channels in the Russian capital and
sending a plume of smoke over the city.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,771-foot futuristic tower, shaped like a giant needle, is
a popular tourist attraction, with an observation deck and
restaurant about two-thirds up its height. The fire started well
above that level and officials said all visitors were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   But some five hours after the fire broke out at 3:30 p.m., the
fire had spread to the platform as well as farther up the tower's
spire.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started about 1,520 feet above ground and firefighters
had problems fighting the blaze because of the difficulty of
hauling equipment including chemical fire extinguishers to that
height. The tower's spire is narrow at that point and the cramped
quarters hampered movement.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of fire engines and ambulances were parked at the bottom
of the tower, which was lighted by at least three searchlights, as
officials tried to figure out a way to fight the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow flames licked from the glassed-in platform as darkness
fell on the city. Thousands of people thronged to the base of the
tower, gathering in a carnival atmosphere, drinking beer, laughing
and a few dancing to transistor radios.
</P>
<P>
   A huge helicopter capable of dropping water from a giant bag was
brought to the scene but it was not immediately deployed. Smaller
helicopters occasionally circled the tower as firefighters tried to
assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but initial
reports said it apparently was started by a short-circuit in
equipment belonging to a paging company.
</P>
<P>
   The fire caused most television service to the capital and its
surrounding region to go off the air, including the three major
channels NTV, RTR and ORT, and several smaller channels. NTV later
was able to broadcast its news programs via the facilities of a UHF
channel unaffected by the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of other parts of the country reported they were
receiving all channels as usual. Spokesmen for the channels could
not immediately be reached for comment on whether backup equipment
was available or on how long the outage might last.
</P>
<P>
   The tower also contains circuitry for law-enforcement agencies
and emergency services, news reports said, but the extent of that
damage was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin held consultations late Sunday with
Communications Minister Leonid Reiman on restoring broadcasting and
ensuring communications for emergency services, news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Ostankino tower was erected in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Journalist in Texas and New York dies of rare bone cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Karen Potter, who spent a decade
covering Texas politics for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and later
worked as the managing editor/features at the Times Union in
Albany, died Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Potter died at her home after battling a rare form of bone
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Gov. Ann Richards said Potter, who was raised in
Oklahoma and trained in Texas, stood out from the statehouse press
corps in Austin as ''a little more gracious in her manner, a little
more thoughtful in her questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Karen was a plain solid citizen, one of the most balanced
people I ever met. She had such a cool hand,'' said Molly Ivins,
author, syndicated political columnist and a colleague of Potter's
at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Potter completed dual degrees in journalism and marketing at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fort Worth paper, she became the youngest state Capitol
bureau chief at 30 and won numerous journalism awards for her
investigative work.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the Times Union in 1995, Potter produced an
award-winning series on domestic violence, nurtured in-depth
projects on autism and hospice care, introduced long human-interest
narratives told in short chapters and encouraged a whimsical take
on celebrity, popular culture and fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   ''No editor was held in higher regard,'' said Jeff Cohen, Times
Union vice president and editor. ''She was kind and careful. One
reporter told me her side of the newsroom, the Features Department,
was Shangri-La.''
</P>
<P>
   Potter's husband, Steve Campbell, is a Times Union sports
columnist. Their daughter, Olivia Sarah, is 11 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Services will be held Tuesday at Jonesville United Methodist
Church.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A homeless man stabbed a Parks Department
maintenance worker who tried to move him out of a public bathroom
in Central Park Sunday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   William Gillum, 49, allegedly stabbed Terry Richards, 36, in the
forearm inside a public bathroom near the tennis courts at 93rd
Street on the west side of the park at 11:45 a.m., said police and
Parks Commissioner Henry Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Richards ''asked him to leave, he refused, he tried to remove
him and he was stabbed with a knife,'' Stern said. ''Despite his
injuries, he chased his assailant.''
</P>
<P>
   Police apprehended Gillum in the park's North Meadow at 97th
Street. He was charged with assault and criminal possession of a
weapon, said Officer Joseph Cavitolo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, a temporary Parks employee, was in stable condition,
Cavitolo said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern emphasized that there was no danger to those who use
Central Park, but said his department and the police would step up
efforts to prevent homeless people from loitering there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a park cleaner and he was doing his job when this
happened,'' Stern said. ''This is not a situation that any park
user is likely to get into.''

   An analysis of statistics since the law took effect Sept. 1,

   Although nearly one-third of indictments for first-degree murder
are in Manhattan and the Bronx, their district attorneys oppose
capital punishment and have never sought an execution.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk and Monroe counties demanded the death penalty in the
highest percentage of cases among counties with at least five
indictments for first-degree murder. The counties also have
contributed four of the six men on death row: three from Suffolk
and one from Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suffolk and Monroe counties are the Texas and Florida of New
York state. They help show that where defendants live is
determining whether they might die,'' said Rochester lawyer Donald
M. Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Relin, Monroe County's district attorney, disputed that.
</P>
<P>
   ''To analogize us with Texas and Florida is absurd in every
sense of the word,'' he said. ''We're not here because we're
looking for ways to give someone the death penalty. We're here
because we're seeking justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics matter because if the state Court of Appeals
finds that the six men now on death row were denied their
constitutional right to equal protection, it could throw out the
capital law and reverse their death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors find the figures problematic. ''I think it
raises a very good issue,'' said Erie County District Attorney
Frank J. Clark, who has asked for the death penalty in one of 10
first-degree murder cases. ''I don't know if I have a definitive
answer to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors who vigorously seek the death penalty say
they're protecting their communities from the most vicious
criminals and believe the state Court of Appeals, which could hear
the appeal of the first death row inmate next year, will find no
unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have two defendants in different geographical
locations who commit the same crime, and one faces the death
penalty and one doesn't,'' said Batavia lawyer D. Michael Murray,
who has represented four capital defendants. ''That seems to
indicate that we have a death penalty statute that should be
declared unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr. said the
lopsided figures featuring his Long Island county are statistical
blips that will even out as more capital cases go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to be a sicko if you enjoy the death penalty,'' he
said. ''If you've ever been involved in the process, it's like
combat; you don't want to go back again. But there's no longer a
debate on whether we should have the death penalty. They've given
us the law and it's up to us to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York hasn't executed anyone since Eddie Lee Mays went to the
electric chair in 1963 for killing a woman in a Harlem tavern
robbery. Despite attempts to bring back capital punishment after
the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a ban in 1976, two successive
Democratic governors - Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo - repeatedly
vetoed death penalty legislation over two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But George Pataki, a Republican, defeated Cuomo in 1994 with a
pledge to enact a capital law. Pataki signed the law two months
after he was sworn in, making New York the 38th state with the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   New York's capital law allows grand juries to bring charges of
first-degree murder against defendants who commit an intentional
murder accompanied by at least one of 12 aggravating factors, such
as a death during another felony.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have 120 days after arraignment to decide whether to
seek the death penalty. If they do, defendants potentially face a
two-part trial.
</P>
<P>
   If jurors convict a defendant of first-degree murder, they
convene in a penalty phase to decide punishment: life in prison
without the possibility of parole or death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   When the law was passed, opponents fretted that prosecutors
would apply the law with gleeful abandon to show voters that they
are tough on criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the law took effect, prosecutors have sought death for 40
defendants. When opponents compare that figure with 3,794 arrests
for second-degree murder through June 30, they concede that
prosecutors have exhibited restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shows that there definitely has not been a rush, that
district attorneys have been exercising judgment and discretion in
determining whether or not to go for the death penalty,'' said
retired Court of Appeals Judge Stewart F. Hancock Jr. of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hancock believes his former colleagues could overturn the
capital law because of the seeming geographic disproportion in
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Capital defense lawyers in other states have argued
unsuccessfully before the U.S. Supreme Court that geographic
disparity violates sections of the U.S. Constitution that ban cruel
and unusual punishment and guarantee equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   But Hancock believes New York's highest court could decide that
state residents are entitled to more protection under similar
clauses of the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''In interpreting the state constitution, they can give greater
constitutional protection than the U.S. Supreme Court gives. They
can't give less, but they can give more,'' said Hancock.

<HEADLINE> 5 Hostages Freed in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Five foreign hostages released by
Muslim rebels walked into freedom Sunday looking stunned, some in
tears and leaving family members still captive in the jungle on a
remote Philippine island.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf separatist guerrillas released the four women and
one man after Libya agreed to pay $1 million for each, negotiators
said. The rebels were still holding seven other Westerners and 12
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan Ambassador Saleem Adam dismissed allegations that his
country was trying to improve its international image by
bankrolling the ransom. ''This is a humanitarian mission, he said.
''It has no other motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedom was bittersweet for the former hostages, most of whom
wore flip-flops and carried their meager possessions in rice sacks
when they met their ambassadors after stepping off helicopters in
the port city of Zamboanga, not far from the island where they were
held.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not happy because there are people left behind,'' said
French citizen Marie Moarbes. ''It's not finished yet for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The others freed were Sonia Wendling of France, South African
Monique Strydom, German Werner Wallert, and Maryse Burgot, a French
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son is still there. You don't expect me to be happy,''
Wallert said. Strydom's husband also remains a hostage.
</P>
<P>
   An envoy said Wallert and his son, Marc, cried and embraced for
a long time before parting, each insisting that the other should
go. Finally, the envoy led the father away. Wallert's wife, Renate,
was freed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Wendling, rubbing her eyes in apparent disbelief, said she could
never forget her four months in captivity. ''I don't know how to
describe the experience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was much more upbeat later on a Philippine Air Force
cargo plane that ferried the released hostages to the Philippine
city of Cebu, where they were to spend Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   They clinked cans of soda and wolfed down cheeseburgers and
pizza, their first meal since leaving the rebel camp some six hours
earlier. But mostly they talked on and on about their experiences
to diplomats and relatives on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The former hostages and their ambassadors ignored the plane's
uncomfortable seats and its occasional bumps and dips as they
celebrated. Moarbes clutched a teddy bear given to her by her
father as the two talked animatedly for the entire one-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   All but the journalist were kidnapped April 23 while vacationing
at a Malaysian diving resort and brought by boat to Jolo, an
impoverished island near the Philippines' southern tip. Burgot was
seized with two other French television journalists last month when
they visited the rebel camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller of two Muslim rebel groups in the
southern Philippines, says it is fighting for an independent
Islamic state. The government insists the organization is a group
of bandits practicing kidnapping and piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been holding the hostages for months in a jungle
on Jolo, 580 miles south of Manila. Before the kidnapping they were
estimated to number about 500 in the province but have grown to
5,000 as many recruits have been attracted by the large ransom
payments, a military official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still in captivity are one French, one German, two Finns and one
South African kidnapped from the Malaysian resort, the two French
journalists, and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who went to the
rebel camp to pray for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said a ''global
agreement'' had been reached for the release of all the other
hostages within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we're hopeful we will be able to work for the release of
all the Sipadan hostages within one week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The military estimates the rebels were paid more than $5.5
million for the earlier release of nine Malaysians and the German
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have insisted on freeing the hostages in batches to
avert any military attack.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages freed Sunday were to be flown the next day to
Tripoli to meet with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Libya has
long-standing ties to Muslim rebels in the mostly Catholic
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Libya has helped mediate between Muslim guerrillas
and the Philippine government and helped build schools and mosques
in the impoverished south.
</P>
<P>
   But Libya also has been accused of training rebels from the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, another separatist group fighting for an
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   A Libyan man attempted to hold up a large picture of Ghadafi at
Zamboanga's airport as the hostages arrived Sunday, but Philippine
troops pulled it down.
</P>
<P>
   The five former hostages were to spend Sunday night in Cebu
because the final South African hostage, Callie Strydom, might be
released Monday, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hugged each other, and he told me I should go, that he will
be released tomorrow,'' said his wife, Monique Strydom, whom the
rebels released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Tripoli, the government said it would have no comment until
all the hostages were freed, but people in the streets were
delighted at their country's role.
</P>
<P>
   ''The release is something wonderful and a victory for Libya and
the hostages, especially because one of them is of Arab origin,''
said 43-year-old taxi driver Khalifa el-Radhi. ''We welcome these
Libyan efforts that support human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki welcomed word of the
hostages' freedom, as did French President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe a fan of the winning Williams?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Has John McEnroe mellowed enough to become a fan
of women's tennis?
</P>
<P>
   With all the excitement surrounding Grand Slam-winning sisters
Venus and Serena Williams, ''the men may eventually have to sue for
equal pay,'' McEnroe told The New Yorker magazine for a story in
the issue due out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the former champ - who has sometimes denigrated the
quality of the women's game - said ''any good male college player
could beat the Williams sisters and so could any man on the senior
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams won this year's Wimbledon title. Her younger
sister, Serena, won last year's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis commentator Mary Carillo, a McEnroe friend, says he's
recently become far more respectful of women's tennis. Once, she
recalled, he told her ''he had no interest in calling women's
tennis because he's not a woman and doesn't understand what it's
like to have monthly periods.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, who is captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team and plays on
the senior tour, says he still responds to hecklers and slams his
racket around during games, partly because he feels fans enjoy his
on-court antics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel an obligation,'' he said. ''They want to see
personalities, which is O.K. so long as you don't go over the line,
as I used to do regularly, of course.''

<HEADLINE> Thruway offers cheaper gas due to summer subsidy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gas at Thruway rest stops is about a nickel
a gallon cheaper than outside the highway because of a Thruway
Authority program that's subsidizing $900,000 in gas stations'
rent.
</P>
<P>
   The Authority eliminated rent at gas stations to pass on savings
to customers and encourage travel at a time of high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot cheaper than where we just came from,'' said
Jeffrey Kimball. He and seven people from the Watertown area
stopped at the Guilderland rest stop and filled their van with
regular unleaded priced at $1.569 per gallon. Back home, he said,
similar fuel is $1.71 to $1.75 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers on the Massachusetts Turnpike - where Mass Pike
officials say concession revenues are flat this summer - might find
Mobil gasoline 12 cents a gallon more expensive. In Massachusetts
and New York, toll road stations are able to set rates based on
prices in the off-highway areas of their market.
</P>
<P>
   While summer is coming to an end, it's unclear whether the
subsidy has brought more tourism and traffic, but gasoline
deliveries are up for most of the Thruway's 28 stations - in some
cases markedly.
</P>
<P>
   In June, deliveries rose 13 percent from June 1999, although in
July they rose just 3 percent. However, last year's Woodstock
performance drew thousands of extra motorists, while this year's
June numbers include the Friday of the July 4th weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen a lot of increase in travel,'' said Mike Reagan, a
supervisor at the Pattersonville Sunoco. ''We thought it was going
to decrease because of the gas cost increase. I think it's because
the Thruway dropped the price ... Personally, I think that's the
best thing the Thruway's ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant revenues also rose in June, jumping by 7 percent at
HMSHost Corp., the operator of several eateries, to $5.2 million.
McDonald's revenues increased 6.97 percent in June to almost $3.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   But travelers spent less on eateries in July, which saw a
decline of 7.4 percent, to $6.9 million, for HMSHost and about 2.2
percent, to almost $4.1 million, at McDonald's.

<HEADLINE> Englewood schools asks students to prove residence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Parents of Englewood public school
students will be asked to prove that their children live in the
city before classes begin or start looking for a new school.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven months, hundreds of Englewood parents have
found themselves entangled in an aggressive reregistration campaign
initiated by a homeowners group that claimed tax money was being
spent on hundreds of out-of-district students illegally attending
city schools.
</P>
<P>
   School officials want all of the district's 2,770 students to
reregister with proof they live there. So far, only two students
have been found who are not residents, but school board members are
considering offering a bounty of $250 to $300 dollars to people who
turn more in.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of 56 children who graduated in June also will have to
come up with proof - or be held responsible for the tuition of
every year their children spent in the schools. Per-pupil tuition
is about $10,000 for high school, slightly less for elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could I possibly ever come up with 12 years worth of
tuition?'' Gracey Alexander, the mother of recent graduate Cynthia
Alexander, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   School district officials say ensuring that all students are
from the city is important, because those who aren't are getting a
free education, further crowding schools and taking teachers' time
away from children of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe we just need this for a couple of years,'' said board
member David Matthews. ''Sometimes you need a shock to the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have pointed out that the Bergen County city has gone to
great lengths to attract pupils from outside the district. For 15
years, Englewood has fought a court battle to stop the
predominantly white borough of Englewood Cliffs from pulling its
students out of a high school whose enrollment is primarily black
and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing to me that we spend so much money trying to get
students to come here, and here we are spending so much money and
time trying to kick kids out,'' parent Ella Jackson said at a
recent meeting with school board members. ''Do we want in, or do we
want out?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the effort targets illegal residents and
underprivileged children suspected to be coming from the Paterson,
Union City or the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ''The victims are going to be those immigrants who don't have
documents and are afraid to come forward, and I find that
objectionable,'' said Michael Kaufman, who has two children in the
schools and three who graduated from them. ''It's not like people
are sneaking in from Alpine.''
</P>
<P>
   About 320 families who failed to respond to four letters asking
them for proof of residency will receive letters this week
notifying them that their children will not be allowed to attend
Englewood schools.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have 21 days to appeal the ''de-enrollment,'' during
which time their children can attend classes.

<HEADLINE> Mayor says school vouchers 'becoming close to a moral issue'  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD PYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Citing studies that he says show widespread
support for school vouchers among minority families, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Sunday he does not understand why people with the
means to send their children to private schools should deny poor
families the same opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vouchers are becoming close to a moral issue,'' Giuliani said.
''A growing number of people ... realize that the best answer for
upward mobility is a good education. The public school system in
general is not providing that.''
</P>
<P>
   About 165,000 people in New York City sought vouchers last year
while only 2,500 were available, Giuliani told reporters outside a
Roman Catholic church where he attended Mass with his newly
appointed police commissioner, Bernard Kerik.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should give them freedom of choice,'' Giuliani said. ''We
supposedly believe in freedom of choice for other things. I don't
understand why politicians oppose freedom of choice for education,
particularly when it affects the poorest children.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was ''not surprised'' by a recent Harvard
University study that found black males performed better in private
schools. Other recent surveys, he said, have shown minorities
favoring by 60 or 70 percent the idea of vouchers for children to
attend private or parochial schools at taxpayer expense.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of vouchers say they offer low-income families a
much-needed alternative, but the concept is opposed by teachers'
unions and other public education advocates who worry vouchers
would hurt poor children by weakening public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush backs vouchers for children in
schools that don't show improvement over three years. Democratic
Vice President Al Gore opposes anything that ''diverts funds (from)
public schools.'' His running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, has backed vouchers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall spokeswoman Sunny Mindel said the mayor previously has
spoken out strongly in favor of vouchers, which he originally
opposed before changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Kerik said their visit to the Holy Name of Jesus
church in Manhattan, with a mixed congregation that is about half
Hispanic, was part of a continuing effort to improve the police
department's strained relations with minorities.
</P>
<P>
   As he did on a visit last week to a black Baptist church in
Brooklyn, Kerik told parishioners that good community-police
relations were a matter of ''working together,'' which prompted a
burst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want the police to respect everyone more, then you have
to respect them more,'' said Kerick, who also put in a plug for
police recruitment, saying the department had job opportunities for
applicants with ''integrity and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere I've gone in the last week, everybody I've talked
to ... everybody's saying the same thing - we have to talk, we have
to listen,'' Kerik said after the service. ''And if people would
just get away from the agenda-seekers, and the people out there
trying to start problems, ... (and) listen to the real people in
the community that do not have agendas, I think there will be a
great working relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Brian Jordan, a Franciscan friar who officiated at the
Spanish-language Mass, said he had invited Kerik after reading that
the new commissioner visited the church in the East New York
section of Brooklyn, where Jordan once lived.
</P>
<P>
   Of the police, Jordan said, ''they have to take responsibility
for some of the problems they've caused, but they have a right to
defend themselves when they are unjustly criticized.''

<HEADLINE> Somalia Inaugurates President  </HEADLINE>
By OSMAN HASSAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Somalia inaugurated its first
president in almost a decade Sunday in a colorful ceremony attended
by four African leaders, a display of regional support for which
Somalis were desperate.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Somalis glued to their televisions, President
Abdiqasim Salad Hassan said he would stand up against nepotism,
injustice and tribalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will safeguard the rights of every Somali
citizen, giving special consideration to the rights of women and
all other ill-treated ones,'' said Hassan, who defeated 15 other
candidates in presidential elections early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance at the ceremony were the presidents of Yemen,
Sudan and Eritrea, as well as the prime minister of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's inauguration brought joy to Somalis who have barely
slept since the election began in Arta, a small town in neighboring
Djibouti where the 13-day-old Somali Parliament is currently
sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Like the election, the inauguration, which involved artists,
singers, poets and musicians from both Somalia and Djibouti, was
broadcast live on television in Somalia. Hassan, a member of the
powerful Hawiye clan, walked along a red carpet, placed his hand on
the Koran and was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want a government ... police for security and schools for
our children,'' chanted hundreds of men, women and children as they
celebrated on Mogadishu's dusty streets, which so often in the past
have been scenes of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been in a sort of captivity. We need the government to
bring us freedom,'' Hassan Mohamed Ali, a businessman in the
central town of Baidoa, said over the telephone as people
celebrated in the street outside his house.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has been synonymous with chaos and violence and has had
no central government since opposition leaders joined forces to
oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Factional leaders then
fought with each other, turning the Horn of Africa nation into
battling fiefdoms ruled by heavily armed militias.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's election of 58-year-old Hassan, who promised to
bring economic recovery and peace to the nation of 7 million, came
as a result of a conference that began in Arta on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh, it was
the 13th attempt at finding a peaceful solution to Somalia's lack
of government.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism aside, some observers warned that many hurdles to peace
lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''The search for peace and prosperity in Somalia will not be
smooth nor will it be achieved quickly. Formidable challenges are
waiting the new Somalia administrative structure,'' David Stephen,
the United Nations' observer to the peace process and one of the
few Westerners involved, said in his opening address.
</P>
<P>
   At some point soon, after a prime minister and cabinet have been
appointed, the new assembly will have to move to Somalia and it is
then that the body will be truly tested. On their return home, the
president and his 245 legislators face the daunting task of
persuading faction leaders opposed to the peace process to respect
them.
</P>
<P>
   And the parliament, which will be penniless and encountered with
a virtually destroyed infrastructure, will have to recruit the
militiamen who cruise the streets into a new national security
force and then set about collecting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those opposed to the peace process are the leaders of the
breakaway regions of Somaliland and Puntland, self-declared
President Mohamed Ibrahim Egal and Col. Abdullahi Yussuf,
respectively. The pair have established relative stability and
their own administrations in the northern regions.
</P>
<P>
   Egal says he will not join the peace process until there is
peace throughout Somalia, so the two ''governments'' can talk,
while Yussuf has rejected the process because many faction leaders
did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   However, representatives and traditional leaders from both
regions have played a significant role in the Djibouti conference
and new assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The president and assembly, which is designed to represent
Somalia's clan structure, are expected to be in power for a
three-year transitional period.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance were representatives from the Organization of
African Unity, the Arab League, Kenya and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Weather Service: Rains leave state susceptible to new flooding  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEPTUNE, N.J. (AP) - Projections by the National Weather Service
indicate New Jersey faces the possibility of widespread floods
should the state be hit by a tropical weather system.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five inches of rain - more than half the annual average -
have fallen in New Jersey from spring to summer, according to the
weather service.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a rain event with 5 inches, we'll have major flooding,
possibly record-setting floods in some places,'' Jim Eberwine, a
meteorologist with the weather service's Mount Holly forecast
office told the Asbury Park Sunday Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we get a 10-inch rain event, we'll see floods of record,''
Eberwine said. Such a rain could raise some rivers to the highest
levels ever, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eberwine said the weather service recently prepared computer
models because of the recent rainfall totals. The 5- and 10-inch
rainfall scenarios are based on a 12-hour time period.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tropical Storm Floyd dumped 6 to 10 inches of rain on
parts of the state within a 12-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Iovino, a meteorologist also at the weather service's Mount
Holly office, said Floyd struck on the heels of a drought. The
state's rivers and reservoirs were substantially below normal
levels last September when Floyd hit. This year, the rivers and
reservoirs are well above normal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a rare case when you're coming out of a summer with
reservoirs at or near capacity,'' Iovino said. Evaporation and
increased water use usually draw down reservoirs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters have predicted as many as 10 major storms could
result from this year's Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from
June through November.

<HEADLINE> 'Bring It On' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three cheers for ''Bring It On.''
</P>
<P>
   The spoof about high school pep squads competing for a national
championship debuted as the top film at the box office over the
weekend with $17.4 million in revenues, according to studio
estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Snipes' spy thriller ''The Art of War,'' about a United
Nations agent caught up in turmoil over China trade relations,
premiered in second place with $11.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The mobster comedy ''The Crew,'' this month's second new movie
featuring a geriatric foursome, opened at No. 7 with $4.1 million.
The movie stars Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya and
Seymour Cassel.
</P>
<P>
   The other old-timers flick, ''Space Cowboys,'' held strongly at
No. 4 with $6.6 million, raising its take to $63.8 million in four
weeks. Last weekend's top movie, ''The Cell,'' dropped to third
place with $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bring It On,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, had an average gross of
$7,311 in 2,380 theaters. ''Art of War'' averaged $4,259 in 2,630
theaters, and ''The Crew'' averaged $2,715 in 1,510 locations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The girls ruled the box office,'' Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie attendance,
said, referring to the pep squad spoof.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had real female appeal, and there's not been a lot this
summer targeted at women and girls,'' he said. ''When you starve an
audience for something, they will come out and see it when you
finally tap into that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bring It On'' will turn in a decent profit for distributor
Universal, since the movie cost just $10 million to make. The
movie's success bucks an underachieving box-office trend for other
teen satires such as ''Election,'' ''Drop Dead Gorgeous'' and
''Dick.'' Dunst co-starred in the latter two.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Chairman Stacey Snider said the movie's marketing --
which played up the rivalry between Dunst's white squad and their
black hip-hop competitors -- helped broaden the audience for ''Bring
It On.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was that idea, just bring it on,'' Snider said. ''There was
an attitude to the marketing campaign that distinguished this film
from the sort of vanilla, homogenized teen comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Abraham, one of ''Bring It On's'' producers, said the movie
offered audiences a ''bit of a guilty pleasure. It's kind of
raucous. It smells like fun, it smells like teen spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   After a month of slumping revenues compared to last summer, the
top 12 movies this weekend grossed an estimated $75.7 million,
virtually dead even with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   With one weekend left, Hollywood's summer take will come in
about $200 million below last year's record $3 billion. That would
be the industry's second-best summer ever in terms of revenue, but
higher ticket prices mean attendance could be off by 10 to 15
percent over last year, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Bring It On,'' $17.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Art of War,'' $11.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''The Cell,'' $9.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Space Cowboys,'' $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''The Original Kings of Comedy,'' $6.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''What Lies Beneath,'' $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7 (tie). ''The Crew,'' $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   7 (tie). ''The Replacements,'' $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps,'' $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''Autumn In New York,'' $3.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Israel Nixes Egypt's Jerusalem Plan  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Egyptian plan to share sovereignty in
Jerusalem with the Palestinians is unacceptable, the top Israeli
negotiator said Sunday, because it involves Israel relinquishing
sovereignty over the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Differences over who would control the compound, known as Haram
as-Sharif to the Arabs, broke up last month's U.S.-sponsored Camp
David summit, according to negotiators. The continued dispute
remains a key obstacle to convening a second peace summit, even
though the sides made strides in other areas toward achieving a
permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It was Israel that pressed the Egyptians to lead an Arab
initiative to come up with a plan that would be acceptable to both
sides. And Ben Ami, the acting Israeli foreign minister, emerged
optimistic last Thursday from meetings with the Egyptian
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Sunday, Ben Ami said the latest plan was unacceptable
because Israel could not back a plan that did not leave the Temple
Mount -- the site of the Jewish temple sacked and burned by Rome in
70 A.D. -- under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not acceptable to us that Israel's holy sites would be
under someone else's sovereignty,'' Ben Ami told Israel radio.
'Holy sites' he said, included ''the site of the temple.''
</P>
<P>
   He refused to outline the specifics of the Egyptian plan.
According to an Israeli television report, Israel would control
Jewish holy sites, the Palestinians would control Muslim holy sites
and an international commission would supervise all other sites in
the Old City -- which altogether encompasses less than half a square
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by an interviewer, Ben Ami conceded that Israel does not
consider the two mosques atop the mount -- considered the third
holiest site in Islam -- to be part of a Jewish ''holy site.'' That
leaves open the possibility that Israel would offer the
Palestinians sovereignty over the mosques but not the land under
them.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier Israeli proposal would have left the Temple Mount
under overall Israeli sovereignty while relinquishing the
day-to-day religious administration of the mosques to the
Palestinians. Israel was also willing to discuss proposals that
would transfer other areas of the Old City to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat rejected that plan. In recent
weeks, his negotiators have suggested they could concede to Israel
control of the Jewish quarter and the Western Wall -- a remnant of
the temple that draws hundreds of thousands of Jewish penitents
each year. But the Palestinians continue to insist on absolute
control of the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli negotiators at Camp David said they felt Arafat was
ready to compromise but that he feared negative reaction in the
Islamic world should he concede anything on Haram as-Sharif. That
led Israel to press Egypt -- a leader in the Arab and Islamic world
-- to come up with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians made progress at Camp David: They
came close to an agreement on a permanent border and the future of
Jewish settlements in heavily Palestinian areas, and they outlined
solutions to the issue of Palestinian refugees who want to return
to land that is now part of Israel. Taboos were also broken on
Jerusalem, with Israel offering limited Palestinian sovereignty in
some areas for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said ''the ball was
now in Arafat's court,'' and that he expected the Palestinian
leader to make a decision in the coming weeks.

<HEADLINE> Small Plane Crashes in Costa Rica  </HEADLINE>
By MARIANELA JIMENEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- About 200 rescue workers climbed the
mile-high Arenal volcano Sunday after rescue planes spotted the
wreckage of a small aircraft that went down the day before with two
pilots and eight foreign passengers on board.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers had not yet arrived at the site, but authorities flying
overhead saw no signs of survivors, said Jorge Jimenez, spokesman
for the Red Cross, which is organizing rescue efforts. Previous
reports said emergency flares were fired in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-seat Caravan plane, operated by the company National
Aerial Services, or Sansa, was flying between the northern region
of La Fortuna, where the volcano is located, and Tamarindo, a beach
town on the Pacific coast, when air traffic controllers lost
contact about 1:30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On board were the pilot, Karl Acevedo Nevermann, co-pilot
William Bobadilla, both from Costa Rica, and eight foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The plane originated in the capital, San Jose, at 12:15 p.m.,
stopping briefly in the town of La Fortuna de San Carlos, in La
Fortuna, where Japanese passenger Masaru Hamatani, 52, got off,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither rescue officials nor Sansa would release any information
on the nationalities of the other passengers Sunday, saying they
were waiting until their fate was known.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez said the destroyed plane was spotted 330 feet beneath
the crater of the Arenal volcano, located 60 miles north of San
Jose, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site was in an area that normally takes about three
hours to reach by foot from the nearest village, Jimenez said. He
said the trek was made more difficult Sunday because the area was
still littered with hot lava and rocks from an eruption of the
volcano last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers on Saturday climbed the nearby Chato mountain
after receiving an emergency signal from the plane that seemed to
be coming from that area. They changed their route Sunday after
rescue planes spotted the wreckage on the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's crash was apparently the second deadly encounter in
less than a week with the 5,360-foot Arenal volcano. A tour guide
died on Thursday from injuries suffered while hiking when the
volcano erupted.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston woman and her daughter hiking with the guide were
burned by the falling lava and rocks and flown to a hospital in
Texas for treatment. The volcano has been active since 1968.

<HEADLINE> Court documents indicate mob boss tried to expand Camden influence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Federal court documents indicate that south
Jersey-Philadelphia mob boss Ralph Natale tried to expand his
influence here even before he started dealing with Mayor Milton
Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Sunday's editions that
Natale and several associates met at least twice with Camden
Councilman James Mathes Jr.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents obtained by the newspaper that are part
of two ongoing criminal cases, at one of those meetings, the
councilman and a female friend picked out a $2,000 diamond ring
that was later given to her.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said the offering was part of an effort to
influence Mathes to help award city contracts to businesses linked
with Natale and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into corruption in Camden resulted in the
indictments of Milan and Natale and nearly a dozen of his
associates. Milan is awaiting trial on federal corruption charges.
Natale has agreed to testify for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reviewed of hundred of pages of FBI memos,
affidavits and partial transcripts of conversations secretly
recorded during the investigation in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations recorded indicate how the mob intended to provide
shoddy materials and inferior workmanship in the construction deals
in order to increase its profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not building the pyramids,'' Natale said in one
conversation. ''If it only last five years, that's not a problem
... Cosmetically, it'll look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathes served on the city council between 1986 and 1997 and was
council president until December 1995. He refused to discuss the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to talk about it,'' he said. When asked about
the ring, he told the newspaper, ''I've never done anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Mathes Sunday were
unsuccessful. There was no telephone number listed under his name.
</P>
<P>
   Mathes, who has not been charged in the investigation, now works
as an affirmative action officer for the Camden school system. His
employment records, along with records of contracts awarded by the
Board of Education, were subpoenaed earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebel Leader Has Unlikey Path  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- His AK-47 rifle swings awkwardly
against his diminutive body as he walks, and Philippine government
officials once poked fun at his limited education and country ways.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, Muslim rebel commander Galib ''Robot''
Andang appears to have out-bargained the government by winning $1
million for each of five foreign hostages released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So far, his Abu Sayyaf rebels have received an estimated $11
million for the kidnapping of 21 people on April 23 from a
Malaysian diving resort -- with several hostages still unreleased.
</P>
<P>
   Andang has been called the Bill Gates of the underworld by a
Philippine lawmaker, loves the limelight and often poses for photos
with a wide boyish grin, his arm wrapped around an unwilling female
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists visited his camp on remote Jolo island, he
laughed as his men stole their cameras and wallets. He warned one
cameraman that ''if you come back here again, you'll never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Although not a senior Abu Sayyaf commander, Andang has managed
to retain control over the captives since their abduction, earning
the ire of four other rebel commanders on Jolo who feel they've
been cut out of most of the ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The other Abu Sayyaf leaders made lofty political demands, such
as formation of an independent Islamic state, early in the hostage
negotiations. But Andang soon controlled the talks with a
single-minded pursuit of cash, negotiators say.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought orange, coffee and mango plantations from the
government for his relatives, including his four wives -- at least
three of whom were obtained by kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Andang's power has grown as the massive ransom payments on
impoverished Jolo have attracted new recruits to the Abu Sayyaf,
with its membership rising from about 500 before the abduction to
about 5,000 now, according to military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Andang's past. He is believed to be in his
late 40s and to have attended only primary school.
</P>
<P>
   He told negotiators his grandmother and other relatives were
killed in fighting decades ago between Muslim rebels and government
troops. In the early 1980s he joined the Moro National Liberation
Front, another rebel group which later signed a peace treaty with
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Andang then hoped to return to a normal life. He applied for a
government amnesty, but the application was not accepted and he was
forced to remain in the jungle, MNLF chief Nur Misuari says.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of Andang's nickname, ''Robot,'' has been clouded by
lore.
</P>
<P>
   Andang claims it is a shortened version of ''Robocop,'' inspired
by his supposed fierce fighting ability. But provincial Governor
Abdusakur Tan says it originated when Andang worked for several
years as a servant for Tan's family and would dance robot-like in
an imitation of Michael Jackson at the request of Tan's son.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother gave him that nickname,'' Tan said Sunday. ''He's
come a long way since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, the Philippine government declined an offer from a
well-known movie actress to exchange a ''week of pleasure'' with
her for the release of the hostages. In a radio interview Saturday,
actress Marinella Moran said she would also marry Andang.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am willing to give myself to Commander Robot so there will
finally be peace,'' she told radio station DZBB.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado said he
appreciated Moran's offer, but would pass.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't look good in the eyes of men, in the eyes of God,''
he said. ''As a self-respecting government, we should not allow
this, especially now that we're seeing a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran initially made the offer in exchange for the release of
just the 12 Filipino Christian evangelists but later expanded it to
include the foreigners as well.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at DZBB were skeptical of Moran, and noted she was
about to release a new, soft-porn movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''She could just be trying to catch media attention,'' said
editor Nimsa Razelo.

<HEADLINE> Notebook of Clinton's Africa Trip  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   USHAFA, Nigeria (AP) -- President Clinton appeared reluctant at
first, but he ultimately bowed to the will of the village elder
Sunday and donned the flowing robe of Ushafa's royal family.
</P>
<P>
   After touring Ushafa, famous for its pottery, Clinton was
showered with gifts from Chief Mohammadu Baba. Among them was a
flowing cream-colored ''babun riga'' for him, and a two-piece wrap
for his daughter, Chelsea. With the help of two women, Chelsea
eagerly tried on the skirt, called a ''zani,'' and the shoulder
throw, a ''gele.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched Chelsea's zeal and under Baba's gentle urging,
he caved. Off came his brown sport jacket, on went the robe, up
went his thumb -- prompting loud cheers of delight from the crowd.
Clinton tried to squeeze on an accompanying blue cap as well, but
it was too small.
</P>
<P>
   The president kept on the robe for a few minutes as he continued
his tour. A dancer in a bright blue striped costume trimmed in
straw leapt and stomped in greeting. As Clinton walked through the
village, a throng of children hovered happily at his knees,
singing: ''We are happy, we are happy to see your face.''
</P>
<P>
   The robe is the second in Clinton's collection. He received --
and wore -- a pale blue robe while visiting a village in Senegal in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   For a few seconds Sunday, Jesse Jackson was president.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was slated to speak ahead of Clinton during a gathering
of Nigerian and American business leaders. The man who introduced
Jackson closed by inadvertently saying, ''I present the president
of the United States ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is as good a place as any to be introduced as the
president,'' joked Jackson, who sought the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1984 and 1988. He turned to Clinton and quipped,
''Long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson went on to praise Clinton for being so interested in
Africa, saying, ''His being here is kind of a sonic boom in world
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Because he has blazed a trail, it will never be as it once
was,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's speech, the crowd serenaded him with, ''For He's
a Jolly Good Fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to Nigeria's three major ethnic groups, President
Olusegun Obasanjo gave Clinton three African names.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can now call himself Sodangi, a Hausa name meaning
''lover of people,'' Okoro, the Ibo name for ''man of the people,''
and Omowale, Yoruba for ''child that has returned home.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo bestowed the names on Clinton during a state dinner
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very glad to have a Nigerian name,'' Clinton said -- and
asked Obasanjo for a copy of his remarks ''so that when we go out
tomorrow, I can introduce myself properly to the people of your
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not publicly mention the names Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Americans Experience Life in Iraq  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASRA, Iraq (AP) -- A horde of small children rushed to greet
five American activists Sunday as the activists went to clean a
primary school in a working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of
this southern Iraqi city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We love American children,'' sang the barefoot children.
</P>
<P>
   After six weeks in Basra, the activists from the Chicago-based
Voices in the Wilderness, which opposes U.N. sanctions against
Iraq, have become household names.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans came to Basra in mid-July intent on experiencing
firsthand the discomforts of a country that has been under siege
from sanctions for a decade. They chose the low-income
al-Jumhouriya neighborhood, where nearly 200,000 residents live on
meager food rations and deal with regular power cuts and sewage
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The activists are Kathy Kelly of Chicago; Lisa Gizzi of St.
Paul, Minn.; Mark McGuire of Winona, Minn. and Tom Jackson and
Lauren Cannon, both of Dover, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth member, Ken Hannaford-Ricardi of Worcester, Mass., was
unable to tolerate life in al-Jumhouriya, a labyrinth of mostly
one-story crumbling brick houses bisected by open sewage and dotted
with dumps of uncollected garbage. He stayed for only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, bore the brunt of Iraq's
1980-1988 war with Iran and then the 1991 Gulf War. The wars
devastated its infrastructure, and the sanctions imposed for Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait have made rehabilitation almost impossible.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. missiles slammed al-Jumhouriya on Jan. 25, 1999, killing 11
people, injuring 59 and demolishing dozens of houses. U.S.
officials have said it was likely that U.S. jets targeting Iraqi
air defense installations as part of a southern no-fly zone
misfired.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. activists have become a familiar sight in
al-Jumhouriya. Like the Iraqi families they are staying with, they
sleep on the roof at night to escape excessive heat during power
cuts that last up to 14 hours, bathe by dumping bowls of water over
their heads and use fans to cool their faces and drive off insects.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, they meet for their Arabic class. Kelly, Cannon
and Gizzi have picked up enough colloquial Arabic to communicate
with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Because two of them have already contracted diarrhea, the
Americans now drink bottled water -- their only luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Many families come to the Americans for help, but there is
little Kelly and her group can do. Umm Mohammed wants medicine to
alleviate her arthritis. University students visit them for books,
newspapers or magazines. Such items are banned by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have only seen a few old books in this neighborhood,''
Cannon said.
</P>
<P>
   After they end their mission in early September, the activists
plan to stage a demonstration outside the White House and auction
hundreds of fans on the Internet to highlight the plight of the
Iraqis. They also plan to give fans free of charge to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the U.S. presidential candidates and
State Department employees who staff the Iraq desk.
</P>
<P>
   For Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the activists will
take a mat sewn by teen-age girls made of small plastic bags. They
are the same bags in which rationed powdered milk is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The propaganda in the United States tells the American people
that there is only one person (President Saddam Hussein) who lives
here,'' Kelly said. ''The Americans do not know that here in Iraq
are 22 million people deprived of education, employment, clean
water, power supply and other essential services.''
</P>
<P>
   Voices has led more than 30 delegations of U.S. citizens to Iraq
to see the effects of the sanctions. Their tours include visits to
pediatric wards of dying children and inoperative water treatment
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Bad water has created an epidemic of dysentery and infectious
diseases, resulting in thousands of child deaths. UNICEF says the
number of infant and child deaths in Iraq has doubled in the decade
since the sanctions began.

<HEADLINE> Yellow Page Consultants sparks many complaints from businesses  </HEADLINE>
	   By The Associated Press:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yellow Page Consultants, a Glastonbury, Conn. company that
advises businesses on saving telephone pages advertising money, is
facing numerous complaints in Connecticut and Massachusetts of
dishonest sales pitches and meaningless consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses also accuse the company of confusing contract
terms and aggressive collection practices.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen clients have filed complaints with the Connecticut
Department of Consumer Protection; twice that number have
complained to the Attorney General's office, The Hartford Courant
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Superior Court, Yellow Page Consultants is a leader among
business-to-business firms in suing clients who have balked at
paying bills - 160 since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In court records and interviews with The Courant, many clients
charge they were misled into signing a binding contract and learned
- sometimes years later - that they were obligated to pay Yellow
Page Consultants any time they reduced, moved or eliminated a
yellow page ad. The bills came even if the change had nothing to do
with YPC's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the advice amounted to little more than telling them to
shrink their ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Telling me that a little ad costs less than a big ad is
nothing,'' said Sebastian N. Giuliano, a Middletown lawyer who
represents Omni Home Health Service, a YPC client. ''I can save you
money on gas: Drive less.''
</P>
<P>
   David M. Ford, YPC's founder and president, dismissed complaints
against the company and said he would not discuss them in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to respond to baseless allegations,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said his 10-year-old company has thousands of satisfied
clients and complaints are generated by a tiny fraction of clients
who simply refuse to pay their bills. He said all clients receive
in-depth consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said the vast majority of yellow page advertisers are
oversold and said his company offers detailed information on how
clients can run smaller ads without losing their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said almost every client who has accused Yellow Page
Consultants of improper business practices ultimately resolved the
dispute by making a payment to the company. Only a handful have
gone to trial, where judges and juries have been split on the
enforceability of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Among the complaints, Paul Poulin said he rejected YPC's advice
seven years ago to shrink the ads for his East Hartford carpet
cleaning business, and assumed his dealings with YPC were done.
</P>
<P>
   When he shrank one ad and eliminated another, more than two
years after meeting with YPC's salesman, Poulin was sued for more
than $2,600. In a letter to the state Attorney General's office,
his lawyer said Ford threatened to ''bury'' Poulin in legal fees if
he didn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Ford said the allegation was not true and that
Poulin's lawyer had an unspecified ''ax to grind.'' Poulin said he
settled the case for less than $500.
</P>
<P>
   John Buster, president of Bedworks Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.,
said he made no changes to his yellow page ads. But he received a
bill last year for $28,000, under a contract provision that made
him liable for half the savings he would have realized if he had
used the ads prepared by Yellow Page Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gay, president of The Jester's Court, a Manchester
banquet hall, said YPC tried to intimidate him into paying a $1,700
bill several years ago. Gay said in a complaint to the Attorney
General's office that his lawyer was told that if Gay fought the
bill, Yellow Page Consultants would sue him and use the proceedings
to expose an embarrassing personal secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I knew what it was,'' Gay said of the secret.
</P>
<P>
   Ford cites praising letters from clients such as Gerry Amodio,
co-owner of Amodio Moving in New Britain. Amodio said he cut his
yellow page bill from $225,000 a year to $168,000, without any
drop-off in calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's office, which for several years has
worked to mediate disputes involving Yellow Page Consultants,
recently revived a broader investigation of the company's business
practices, based on a spate of new complaints.

<HEADLINE> Heart Study Looks at Education  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM (AP) -- Highly educated people are more likely to be
alive a year after suffering a heart attack than those whose
schooling ended after 12 years, new research suggests.
</P>
<P>
   While it is known that more educated people and those with
higher-status jobs are less likely to get heart disease, to have a
heart attack or to die from the disease, experts have not known
whether those factors influence how well people survive once
they've had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   But an international study presented Sunday found that heart
attack survivors with higher socioeconomic status and better jobs
did better than poorer ones in each of the nine countries examined.
The study also found that socioeconomic status mattered more in
some countries than others.
</P>
<P>
   The study, presented at the opening of a four-day conference of
the European Society of Cardiology, used education as an indicator
of socioeconomic status.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Australia and Poland, the highly educated
didn't have much of an edge, the study said. But in Italy, Sweden
and Britain, they were much more likely to make it than those who
had left school earlier, the study by scientists at Duke University
Medical Center found.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the more educated people were, the better off they
were. People who dropped out of school after eight years were five
times more likely to die within a year of their heart attack than
those who had had 16 years of education.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors could be to blame, including increased
stress, poor understanding of the disease process and not making
the necessary lifestyle changes needed to promote a better outcome,
said the study's leader, Duke heart researcher Dr. Connor O'Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very interesting that education is affecting prognosis
after a heart attack. Everybody had their education long before
they got their heart attack, and they all were in the same position
when the study started,'' said Dr. Harry Hemmingway, a researcher
at University College, London University, who studies psychological
and social influences on heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people only wake up once they've had a heart attack, but
there is no conventional wisdom on how socioeconomic status affects
heart attack survival because there have been very few studies,''
said Hemmingway, who was not connected to the study.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of 11,326 people from the United States, Canada,
Britain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Poland and Italy,
job status -- considered a reflection of education level -- also made
a difference in surviving after a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Managers fared best, followed by craftsmen, then clerical
workers, laborers and homemakers. Homemakers were most likely to
die within a year of their heart attack -- four times more likely
than managers.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to other studies, the scientists also found that living
alone didn't appear to matter. Those living alone did die sooner
after their heart attack than those with company at home, but most
of that can be explained by their age, O'Shea said. He said studies
that have concluded the opposite were much smaller and did not
adjust their findings well enough to eliminate the influence of
being older.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get older, people around you die and you end up living
alone, but living alone in itself is not an independent risk
factor'' for dying after a heart attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemmingway said several of the studies that have found that
living alone influences heart attack survival did take age into
account. He said the Duke findings on that factor are not
definitive, but lend weight to the theory that it doesn't matter.

<HEADLINE> Navy Photographs Gulf Air Wreckage  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- U.S. Navy divers photographed the sunken
engines and other fractured sections of Gulf Air Flight 072 Sunday,
shooting still pictures and videotapes of the wreckage before it is
lifted from the shallow sea floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You guys find that other piece I was talking about -- piece
with the shaft? It's around here somewhere ... maybe here,'' one
diver says to his colleagues before bobbing beneath the surface. A
few seconds later, he's back. ''Hey, right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy divers accompanied an investigator from the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board, all part of the early stages
of the probe into Wednesday's crash of the Airbus A320 that killed
all 143 people aboard. Bahrain, which has close ties with the
United States and is home base to the U.S. Navy's 5th fleet,
appointed NTSB investigator Frank Hilldrup the chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The ''black boxes'' -- flight data and cockpit voice recorders --
could provide crucial information in pinpointing why the airliner
nose-dived into the shallow Gulf waters off the coast of Bahrain.
The recorders were expected to arrive at NTSB headquarters in
Washington later Sunday for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim al-Hamer, chairman of the investigating committee, said
the boxes appeared to be in good shape and that his team -- in its
second full day on the job -- has not ruled out any possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hope to learn what happened between the time pilot
Ihsan Shakeeb aborted his landing at Bahrain International Airport
without explanation and 60 seconds later when the plane hit the
sea. Gulf Air's chief pilot Hameed Ali has said the speed and
altitude of Shakeeb's aborted landing would be investigated, but
said no error was spotted in Shakeeb's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a routine autopsy performed Thursday on Shakeeb's
remains had been turned over to investigators, according to Gulf
Air spokesman Chris Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Gulf Air Chief Executive Sheik Ahmed bin Saif Al
Nahyan said Sunday the airline had turned over to investigators all
records and files relevant to the crashed Airbus A320 and its crew.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini Coast Guard divers also were in the water Sunday,
retrieving more personal belongings of those aboard. Temperatures
that topped 104 degrees in the shade combined with stifling
humidity meant teams on the water were being rotated every 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Divers were trying to work quickly to complete their task before
the shifting sand covered debris. Still, Bahraini civil defense
chief Col. James Windsor said he expected the site work to continue
all week.
</P>
<P>
   Though floating debris had been removed soon after the crash so
it wouldn't be swept away with the tides, authorities had been
waiting for the investigation team before removing sunken items.
The Bahraini divers, Windsor said, were retrieving suitcases,
clothing, purses, as well as more human remains.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the bodies has made identifying them
emotionally and practically difficult.
</P>
<P>
   At least five Egyptians were believed to have been misidentified
and mistakenly buried, three of them in Bahrain and two in Saudi
Arabia, Egyptian Embassy spokesman Mohammed al-Tawargy said.
</P>
<P>
   Families of four of them, he said, have decided to leave the
remains where they were when an exhumation attempt found them
already decaying. The family of the fifth was hoping to secure
fingerprint records in Egypt that could be checked against the
remains so they could plan a Christian burial.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be sadly difficult,'' al-Tawargy said. The remains
had been placed into the ground without a coffin in accordance with
Islamic funeral rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of three Egyptians were flown back to Cairo, a day
after 56 sets of remains were returned along with most relatives
who had come to collect them.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven sets of remains had not been identified by Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Speculation on Kenya Priest's Murder  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Speculation surrounding the death of an
outspoken American priest increased Sunday with local media reports
that documents found on his body linked two Kenyan cabinet
ministers to violent tribal clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Kaiser had intended to hand the documents over to
a government commission looking into the clashes, which took place
in Rift Valley Province between 1992 and 1997, the independent
Sunday Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the special commission earlier this year,
Kaiser, a Minnesota native who had worked in the East African
nation for 36 years, had already accused two cabinet ministers of
fomenting the bloody clashes. He had said the ministers had stolen
land from those forced to flee the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Neither minister was named in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Sunday Nation said an autopsy Saturday
revealed that the 67-year-old priest was shot by a high-velocity
rifle, normally used by police or Kenya Wildlife Service rangers.
His body was found along a highway with a head wound early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A set of bloodstained fingerprints were also found on the
body,'' the paper quoted a source at Lee Funeral Home, which
carried out the autopsy, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan human rights activists immediately called the death of
Kaiser, a vocal critic of Kenya's human rights record, a political
assassination. The Kenya Human Rights Network said it would set up
an independent citizens' inquiry into the priest's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Standard, also an independent newspaper, said letters
to the World Bank, government officials and a notice of intention
to sue the Attorney General were among the documents found on his
body.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, President Daniel arap Moi said he was saddened by
the killing. He criticized the politicization of the death during a
public address in the coastal city of Mombasa, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police could not be immediately reached to verify the reports,
and there was no independent verification of the information.

<HEADLINE> Grand jury requests Washington Township mayor's bank records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - As part of a recently initiated
investigation into land deals in this Gloucester County town, a
federal grand jury has asked to see the bank records of Mayor
Gerald Luongo, according to law enforcement authorities and a
federal document.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena, obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer, is part of
two investigations - one federal and one state - that focus in part
on a low-income housing project that was the town's first attempt
at providing affordable housing, according to law enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said another facet of the
investigation is a housing deal that led to a $900,000 profit for
several people connected to Luongo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office is prohibited from giving information
about ongoing investigations and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Luongo also declined to comment to the newspaper and referred
questions to his attorney, Carl Poplar. Poplar said his client did
not know that investigators had subpeonaed the bank records.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began investigating the land deal after town officials
contacted them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a letter has surfaced that shows a private developer
was carving up planned profits on the land long before the township
bought it with taxpayer money, according to Township Council
President Matthew Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   The Inquirer reported last year that eight investors - four who
had connections to Luongo - bought 28 acres of farmland for
$400,000 then, the same day, sold the parcel to a builder of
low-income housing for $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper, three weeks later the township not
only bought 13 acres of the 28-acre tract for $90,000 more than
builder M. Brad Ingerman had paid for the entire parcel, but also
lent the builder $1.9 million to build low-income housing. The loan
was at 3 percent interest, with no principal or interest due for 32
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ingerman declined to comment to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Marines Ground 3 Types of Aircraft  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps announced Sunday the
temporary grounding of all 11 of its MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor
aircraft, the hybrid airplane-helicopter that has been under
increased scrutiny since one crashed during a training exercise in
April, killing all 19 Marines aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to suspend Osprey flight operations was made late
Friday by the Naval Aviation Systems Command, which also ordered
the Marines to temporarily ground its fleet of CH-53E Super
Stallion transport helicopters and AH-1W Cobra attack helicopters,
spokesman Lt. David Nevers said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevers said the most significant of the three actions was the
grounding of the workhorse CH-53E Super Stallions, because it is
likely to take longer to get them back in the air than either the
Ospreys or the Cobras.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Osprey's problem is likely to draw the most
public attention, in part because of recollections of the April
crash -- the worst Marine helicopter loss in more than a decade --
and in part because some members of Congress have criticized the
Osprey program as too expensive and technically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies like
an airplane. It is built by Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey fleet was taken out of operation for about two months
after the April crash in Arizona. Investigators determined the
crash was caused by mistakes made by the pilot and co-pilot, not a
mechanical problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Ospreys resumed flying in June.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, an Osprey made a precautionary landing at Camp
Lejeune, N.C., and a subsequent maintenance inspection revealed
that a coupling on the aircraft's drive shaft had failed. The
coupling was repaired and the Osprey returned to its home base at
Marine Corps Air Station New River, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the interests of safety, they will check the other
aircraft's couplings'' before returning them to flight, Nevers
said. He said he could not estimate how long they would be out of
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines are counting on the Osprey to eventually replace the
corps' Vietnam-era CH-46 helicopters as the primary means of
transporting troops into combat from ships offshore. The Marines
plan to buy 360 Ospreys, and the Air Force plans to buy 50 for its
special operations forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has not yet made a final decision to
enter full-rate production of the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ground three types of Marine Corps aircraft,
albeit for unrelated reasons, puts an unusually large portion of
the Marine aviation fleet out of operation. In July, 106 of the
Marines' AV-8B Harrier fighter jets were grounded because of an
engine bearing problem. Thirty of the Harriers have since returned
to flight, but that leaves the majority of the fighters still
grounded.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ground all 165 of the Marines' CH-53E Super
Stallions was based on findings from the investigation into the
Aug. 10 crash of a Navy MH-53E mine-sweeping helicopter off the
coast of Corpus Cristi, Texas, in which four people were killed.
Nevers said investigators found a bearing problem, but he was not
sure of the exact nature of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Super Stallions currently are on overseas deployment with
Marine Expeditionary Units, Nevers said.
</P>
<P>
   The corps' 198 AH-1W Cobra attack helicopters were grounded
after it was discovered this week that some older rotor blades may
be susceptible to cracking. Each Cobra will undergo a one-time
inspection to identify and replace, if necessary, the suspect
blades, Nevers said. Eight are currently deployed abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobras are likely to undergo ''a relatively quick fix,''
Never said, and return to normal operations.

<HEADLINE> Egyptians Helped Shape Bahrain  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK AL-ISSAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- They opened the first school here in
1917, provided Bahrainis with scholarships and helped plan
Bahrain's agricultural and health care strategies. Decades later,
the Egyptian presence in this tiny Gulf island is still strong,
with many holding senior jobs in ministries and official
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel at home here. I've been here for 20 years. Bahrain
embraces every Arab and this gives Arabs a sense of strength,''
said Dr. Ahmed el-Garf, a professor at Bahrain University and
chairman of the Egyptian Club in the capital, Manama.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 143 people who died when Gulf Air Flight 072 crashed off
the Bahrain coast last week, 63 were Egyptians, most of them
working and living in Bahrain -- and becoming an integral part of
life in this leading regional financial center.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large majority of Bahrainis received their education in
Egypt in the old days and others were trained at Egyptian police
and military facilities,'' said Mohammed el-Tawargy, the press
counselor at the Egyptian Embassy in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   So good are Bahraini-Egyptian ties that the Bahraini government
is considering allowing Egyptians into the country without a visa,
a first for Arabs in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proves Bahrain's leading role in strengthening Arab
nationalism. Bahrain is setting the standard for other Arab nations
with this step,'' said el-Garf of the Egyptian Club, a cultural
center where seminars and sports events are held.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians arrived in Bahrain long before the 1932 discovery of
oil, setting up schools and launching agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Egyptian presence had a great influence on Bahrain and the
Gulf in general. It spread Arab nationalism across the region and
the Egyptian media played a large part in this,'' said Essa Amin,
president of Bahrain's Historical and Archaeological Society.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1930s to the present day, Bahraini students have
traveled to Egypt to pursue their studies, Amin said. In the past,
he said, the Egyptian government sent tutors to Bahrain and offered
scholarships to Bahrainis to study at Al-Azhar, mainstream Islam's
most prestigious Islamic institution.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many Egyptians travel to the Gulf in search of a higher
source of income to fulfill dreams of buying homes and setting up
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Bahrain from other Gulf nations, el-Tawargy
said, is that here a majority in the 5,000-strong Egyptian
community hold senior jobs. By comparison, of the 850,000 Egyptians
living in Saudi Arabia, only 15 percent hold senior jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Egyptians branched into the industrial sector
with the discovery of oil and then into the country's medical and
judicial fields. The Gulf state, where oil is expected to dry up by
the end of the decade, has been transformed from a nation of
fishermen, pearl divers and tailors into a modern commercial hub
with international banks, high-rise buildings and Western fast-food
restaurants. Egyptians have flowed along with those changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Egyptian presence is a chosen one; it's a quality presence
and Egyptians are trusted here,'' said Hafez Imam, deputy head of
news at the Akhbar Al-Khaleej daily and an Egyptian who has been in
Bahrain for the past 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Africa Must Face AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Africans must ''break the silence'' about
AIDS or risk losing hard-fought democratic and economic gains,
President Clinton said Sunday as the White House highlighted more
than $20 million in U.S. aid to fight AIDS, malaria and other
diseases devastating Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''In every country, in any culture, it is difficult, painful, at
the very least embarrassing, to talk about the issues involved with
AIDS,'' Clinton said after touring a health center in the Nigerian
capital and hearing the stories of several people living with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's two-day stay in Nigeria was intended to underscore
U.S. approval of the 15-month-old democratic government in Africa's
most populous nation, with 123 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Along with dealing with the heavy themes of AIDS and debt
relief, Clinton used the trip to get to know a country he
deliberated bypassed on his last trip to Africa, in 1998, when it
was under a military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a throng of singing children, he trudged through the
Nigerian village of Ushafa on Sunday, past mud brick huts and
flimsy metal sheds, with scrawny chickens scattering in his path.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to help you build your economy, educate your children
and build a better life,'' he told villagers, wearing a
cream-colored royal African robe given to him by the village chief.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS killed 2.8 million people worldwide last year, and is now
the leading cause of death in Africa. The Clinton administration
will spend $9.4 million this year for AIDS and HIV infection
prevention and care in Nigeria, $8.7 million more for polio
eradication and $2 million toward prevention of malaria.
</P>
<P>
   In sub-Saharan Africa, 13 million children have lost a parent to
AIDS, and the disease is reducing life expectancies and dimming
development hopes across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it harder to talk about these things than to watch a child
die of AIDS?'' Clinton asked. ''We have to break the silence about
how this disease spreads and how to prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS, which is primarily transmitted sexually in Africa, is
entirely preventable, Clinton reminded his audience.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.6 million Nigerians, 5.4 percent of the population, are
afflicted with AIDS. That puts the country on better footing than
many of its neighbors with higher infection rates, but in danger of
letting the disease gain ground, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''AIDS can rob a country of its future,'' Clinton said. ''I know
you are not going to let that happen to Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised continued U.S. support for Nigeria's transition to
democracy, but did not, as Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo had
hoped, agree to cancel or cut the nearly $1 billion U.S. portion of
Nigeria's $32 billion foreign debt, a move that would require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to business executives later Sunday, however, Clinton
said he supports reducing the debt, but only if Nigeria spends the
extra money on improving lives and diversifying the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be a dividend to democracy for the people of
Nigeria,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by daughter Chelsea, began his day with
services at a Baptist church in Abuja, and then ventured outside
the capital to get a firsthand look Sunday at both the pageantry
and poverty of life in Ushafa, a pottery-making center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Nigeria to express the support of the people of the
United States,'' Clinton told villagers from a makeshift platform.
''We support your democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Khairat Abdulrazaq Gwadabe, who represents the village in the
Nigerian Senate, said she explained Clinton's visit to villagers
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to translate it as the king of the world himself is
coming. The president of the world is coming to their chief,''
Gwadabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said they hoped Clinton's visit would translate into a
new school, a factory or some other investment, although they were
unclear on how that might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hajiya Haunwa Mohammad, 42, said if Clinton could help ease
Nigeria's debt, she might earn more money selling sugar and other
products. Her four daughters, ages 8 to 23, might also go to
school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, my children don't go to school because I have no money
for their school fees,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's brief African tour will also take him to Tanzania on
Monday. Former South African President Nelson Mandela invited
Clinton there to help preside over a planned peace ceremony to end
seven years of civil war in neighboring Burundi. Hopes for a
cease-fire agreement faded this week and negotiators began work
Sunday on a less ambitious pact. Clinton still plans to go out of
respect for Mandela's efforts so far, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours in Tanzania, Clinton plans to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo to discuss the status of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace peace process.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Vote Marred by Allegations  </HEADLINE>
By RODEINA KENAAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAABDAT, Lebanon (AP) -- With security forces guarding towns and
polling stations in central and northern Lebanon, Lebanese voted
for parliamentary representatives Sunday in an election sure to
pack the legislature with pro-Syrian representatives.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical of elections held since the end of the 1975-1990
civil war, there were limited complaints about irregularities,
including the presence of uncertified ballots, the absence of names
on voters' lists, forged voter registration cards and the lack of
secrecy in casting ballots leaving voters open to intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints, the polling was peaceful and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   The capital Beirut and the eastern and southern provinces will
vote next Sunday. It will be the first time in nearly three decades
that southern regions near the border with Israel will vote, an
event made possible by the Israeli withdrawal from a border buffer
zone in May.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's voting, some 286 candidates -- most of whom had
Syria's tacit approval -- contested 63 seats in the 128-member
legislature for the provinces of Mount Lebanon and North Lebanon,
the Christian heartland where 1.3 million Lebanese over the age of
21 were eligible to vote. Polling stations in Mount Lebanon's four
electoral districts and the North's three districts opened at 7
a.m. and closed at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Michel Murr said voter turnout was estimated
at up to 57 percent in Mount Lebanon and 46 percent in North
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The election process was smooth and very successful. There
were no incidents. There were no dead or injured people,'' Murr
told a news conference late Sunday. Official results were expected
Monday morning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Christian groups had called for a boycott of the
elections to protest what they described as Syria's packaging of
the ballot to ensure a loyal parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But their call went largely unheeded, and the voting is expected
to ensure a four-year parliament packed with pro-Syrians. Syria is
the main power in Lebanon with 30,000 troops deployed across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 soldiers on Sunday manned checkpoints and major
road intersections or patrolled in armored vehicles to ensure
violence-free balloting. Police were in charge inside polling
stations. Weapons licenses were canceled and about 120 people have
been arrested for violating the ban. All nightclubs and restaurants
in Mount Lebanon and the North have been ordered closed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Armenian quarter of Bourj Hammoud, opponents mobbed the
car of an Armenian candidate on a list headed by legislator Nassib
Lahoud, a former ambassador to Washington battling against Interior
Minister Michel Murr.
</P>
<P>
   President Emile Lahoud was among the morning voters, casting his
ballot at a polling station in the post office at his Mount Lebanon
hometown of Baabdat, 10 miles northeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud,'' a beaming Lahoud told reporters later. ''This is
the first time I've voted in my life,'' said Lahoud, a 64-year-old
former army commander who could not vote in the past because of
military regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud called on voters not to be swayed by the influence of
money. ''He who buys you can sell you. ... Vote your conscience,''
said Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I voted for the good people,'' George Massoud, a 70-year-old
grocer said as he opened his store for business after casting his
ballot in Baabdat.
</P>
<P>
   Druse leader Walid Jumblatt charged that the government was
heavily involved on the side of his challengers. ''They are
hysterical. They lost their nerve,'' he said of the campaign
against him in the Chouf district.

<HEADLINE> Casual attire to become a no-no at Middlesex County Courthouse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - After Labor Day, employees wearing
denim clothing to work at the Middlesex County Courthouse could get
a dressing-down.
</P>
<P>
   The courthouse's 580 workers were notified by memos included in
recent paychecks the manner of dress is going more formal as of
Sept. 5, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Robert Longhi, the assignment judge for
Middlesex County, felt employees should dress professionally.
Courthouse officials said the policy is aimed at ensuring a
dignified, professional atmosphere at the courthouse complex.
</P>
<P>
   That means jeans, shorts, shirts without collars, sweat pants or
clothing bearing sports and corporate logos will become out of
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Comfort will too, says Henry Crawn, 29, who often wears jeans
and a T-shirt to work in the 37-year-old building where he is a
judiciary clerk. Crawn said the building's air conditioning
frequently fails, and temperatures rise in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's leaving me in a situation where I'm going to go out and
have to purchase more clothes,'' Crawn told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the most part, I sit in a cubicle, and nobody sees me,''
he said. ''How I dress shouldn't affect my work productivity at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers who violate the dress policy may be sent home to change
and could risk having the time deducted from their vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with unions representing courthouse workers consider
the policy unnecessary and cite concerns about the expense of
workers having to buy new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Some union representatives say the manner of dress should be
flexible and based on the type of work employees do. The
Communications Workers of America Local 1034, which represents 20
computer technicians and other staff, filed a grievance, calling
the issue something that should be negotiated in a labor contract.

<HEADLINE> Little League Dreams in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- No, actor and former Little Leaguer
Kevin Costner said, when asked if he had ever been to Williamsport.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I've dreamed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Costner's allusion to his movie, ''Field of Dreams,'' also was a
reflection of what goes through the minds of Little Leaguers around
the globe. After 54 years, 12-year-olds still lay in bed in wonder
of making it to Howard J. Lamade Stadium in August.
</P>
<P>
   While the world around it has changed immeasurably, Williamsport
maintains a sense of innocence, a place where hot dogs still cost
75 cents, a soda goes for a quarter, and kids still whoop and
holler and cry when the final out is made.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing Little League Baseball in the new century
is how to preserve its history and protect its relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the World Series will change dramatically. A
new stadium is under construction, allowing the Series to double to
16 teams.
</P>
<P>
   With that come concerns that the corporate world eventually will
force itself into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a fair concern,'' Little League president and CEO
Stephen Keener said. ''I think it's incumbent upon us to keep the
proper perspective. We've worked very hard to try to keep the focus
on kids playing the game on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as officials dealt with controversy on two fronts last
week, it was the kids who stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   There was the team from Vancouver, Wash., which drew its
inspiration from Tyler ''TJ'' Jacobs, a 6-year-old recovering from
brain surgery. Vancouver also earned praise for not laying down in
its preliminary round finale, something that -- because of the
Series' complex tiebreaking formula -- would have clinched it a
berth in the U.S. Pool final.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Little Leaguers from Maracaibo, Venezuela,
who arrived with one bat but wound up winning the title, beating
Bellaire, Texas, 3-2 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a team that has a bunch of fighters,'' Maracaibo
manager Eduvino Quevedo said. ''They're from a very poor
neighborhood in Maracaibo and they don't give up very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Quevedo, following Maracaibo's 5-4 win over Tokyo in the
International Pool final, who celebrated by hugging every player on
the field -- including Tokyo's.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mavarez, who pitched a four-hitter and struck out
Bellaire's Hunter Johnson for the final out with runners at the
corners, called it a big step in his baseball career because not
many kids have an opportunity to pitch on such a grand stage.
</P>
<P>
   It was a challenging two weeks for Little League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Along with sidestepping criticism over its tiebreaking rule, the
Little League board took steps to return to girls-only softball
after the Philippines forfeited the championship game of the Little
League Softball World Series over boys competing for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   Keener acknowledged the tests Little League faces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time you are a program with the magnitude of Little League
Baseball, our program is going to be challenged by the same social
and economic challenges that many other organizations and countries
feel,'' he said. ''Our challenge is to adapt to those.''
</P>
<P>
   Costner, one of three enshrined in Little League's Hall of
Excellence last weekend, was left awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the idea that it stays here, and it's something that
one anticipates to come to,'' Costner said. ''The birthplace, it's
all very appropriate. You should hold on to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Bellaire pitcher Ross Haggard said it best, when asked
what it took to get to Williamsport.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't think it's impossible to get here,'' Haggard said.
''Because that's what we thought, and we got here.''

<HEADLINE> Tensions Flare After Kosovo Death  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKULANOVO, Kosovo (AP) -- A car driven by an ethnic Albanian
struck a group of Serbian children playing in a Kosovo field
Sunday, killing one and injuring four. Serbs in this province
divided by ethnic hatred quickly charged that the killing was
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Protesting a lack of security, angry Serbs attacked U.N. cars
and peacekeepers' vehicles after the hit-and-run attack, breaking
windshields. Both the United Nations and the peacekeepers ordered
their forces to withdraw from the area.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said the car turned off the road and ran the
children down in a field near the village of Skulanovo, about nine
miles south of Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Nikolic, 8, was killed instantly, while two others,
identified as Marko and Jovica Talic, were seriously injured and
taken to the Russian military hospital at Kosovo Polje. Two others
children, Srdjan Krstic and Ivca Talic, were treated and released,
according to the Belgrade-based Beta news agency. The ages of the
injured children was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman, Maj. Scott Slaten, said peacekeepers had
arrested the driver of the vehicle. U.N. officials said he was an
ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic hatreds run deep in Kosovo. An estimated 10,000 ethnic
Albanians were killed by Serb forces during Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists in the
province. After NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw
last year, tens of thousands of Serb residents fled and ethnic
Albanians began attacking Serbs as revenge.
</P>
<P>
   A top leader of moderate Kosovo Serbs, Orthodox priest Sava
Janjic, said Sunday's incident has ''horrified the Serb
community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The attacker deliberately hit the children,'' he told a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having their vehicles attacked, an international
official said, a U.N. police officer who went to the hospital to
see the injured children was punched in the face by a relative of
one of the victims. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our troops were ... stoned, cars were demolished,'' said Maj.
Marko Lahtinen, a member of the Finnish contingent with the
NATO-led force. ''The local population was behaving aggressively,
but we didn't use force at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   A demand from villagers that no Albanians be allowed to use the
road through the community was rejected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. statement said the regional homicide squad was
investigating the killing and ''an international judge and
international prosecutor will be brought onto the case.'' U.N.
officials said the suspect would likely be charged with vehicular
homicide and driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident with possible ethnic motives, a Serb man
was shot in the head and killed in the village of Crkvena Vodica,
NATO officials said. Nine Serb children were injured in the same
village, about seven miles northwest of Pristina, earlier this
month, after unidentified assailants hurled grenades at a crowded
basketball court.

<HEADLINE> Twins 7, Tigers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Midre Cummings hit a game-winning RBI single
in the 10th inning and Ron Coomer had three RBIs as the Minnesota
Twins beat the Detroit Tigers 7-6 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones (0-3), after blowing a one-run lead in the ninth,
issued a pair of one-out walks in the 10th. Matt Lawton hit an
infield single to load the bases before Denny Hocking struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings then lined a 2-2 pitch to left to give Minnesota its
30th come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, batting leadoff for the first time this year, went
3-for-6 with a homer for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley hit a two-run homer and Bobby Higginson's sneaky
slide highlighted a series of comebacks for Detroit, which lost for
just the 10th time in 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Carrasco (4-3) struck out two in a perfect 10th inning
for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-5, Minnesota scored a run in the ninth off Jones to
tie the game. Cummings singled with one out and moved to third on
Ron Coomer's single. David Ortiz then hit a slow groundout to
third, allowing Cummings to score.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer had tied the game in the eighth with an RBI double
and Deivi Cruz put Detroit ahead 6-5 with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took 4-3 lead in the sixth on Higginson's unique
slide at the plate. Higginson hit a one-out single and advanced to
third on a wild pitch and a groundout. Matt Kinney then threw a
pitch that got away from catcher Danny Ardoin for a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin got to the ball quickly and threw to Kinney covering the
plate, well ahead of Higginson. But Higginson -- in mid-slide --
stopped his right foot short of Kinney's tag, popped up and snuck
his left foot onto the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota came back to take a 5-4 lead in seventh on Coomer's
two-run double off Nelson Cruz -- a line drive that right-fielder
Rich Becker misplayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton doubled in the first, moved to third on Denny Hocking's
sacrifice bunt and scored on Adam Bernero's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit came right back in the second on Easley's two-run homer,
his 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer hit a sacrifice fly in the third to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took a 3-2 lead in the fifth when Jose Macias tripled
and scored on Javier Cardona's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton hit his 10th homer on the first pitch from Bernero in the
bottom of the inning to tie the game again. It increased his
career-high RBI total to 79.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota evened its record against Detroit at the
Metrodome at 56-56. ... Both starting pitchers, Kinney and Bernero,
were looking for their first career wins. ... Lawton batted third
in 121 of the 122 previous games he started. He batted sixth once.
... It was Jones' third blown save this season in 39 chances. ...
Tigers' starter Dave Mlicki pitched in a rehab assignment Sunday at
Class-A West Michigan. Mlicki is recovering from a severe sinus
infection, which required surgery. ... The Tigers are attempting to
become the first team since the 1996 Red Sox to finish the year
above .500 after being 14-games under at one point in the season.
... With four games left in August, the Tigers have ensured
themselves of their third straight winning month. The last time
Detroit had winning records in three straight months was in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 7, Cubs 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kerry Wood struck out 11 for his first
double-digit strikeout game in almost two years, but his bullpen
failed him as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied for a 7-6, 10-inning
victory over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 6-6, pinch-hitter Jeff Branson walked to lead
off the 10th against Todd Van Poppel (2-4) and advanced on Adrian
Beltre's sacrifice and Bruce Aven's groundout. Branson then scored
on a 2-0 wild pitch to Alex Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters (5-2) picked up the win with two innings of two-hit
relief and Jeff Shaw pitched the 10th for his 21st save in 28
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers rallied from a 5-3 deficit to take a 6-5 lead in the
eighth on Eric Karros' two-run single and Beltre's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Brown, called up from Triple-A Iowa on Sunday, hit his
second major league home run and first this year, with two outs in
the eighth off Fetters to tie the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers loaded the bases with one out in the ninth against
Kyle Farnsworth, but he got Karros to hit into an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Aven hit a pair of homers off Wood, a solo shot in the third and
a two-run shot in the fifth, raising his season total to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who left with a 5-3 lead, posted his 10th career
double-digit strikeout game and first since Aug. 31, 1998, when he
struck out 10 Cincinnati Reds. Wood gave up three runs on five hits
and three walks in seven innings of his 17th start. He missed all
of 1999 following elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Matthews Jr. hit a solo homer and Eric Young had three
hits, including an RBI double for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson hit an RBI double with one out in the second. Wood
reached on an infield single and Young doubled to score Huson. Wood
scored on Joe Girardi's groundout to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Aven's first homer of the game -- and first with Los Angeles --
made it 3-1 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews hit his third home run and first left-handed with one
out in the third to make it 4-1. Damon Buford added an RBI single
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Aven's second homer scored Beltre, who singled, and pulled the
Dodgers within 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and starter Ismael Valdes were
both ejected in the bottom of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes threw a pitch near Mark Grace's head to lead off the
Cubs' fifth. After home plate umpire Mark Wegner warned Valdes,
Johnson came out to argue and was tossed during the discussion. On
a 3-1 count, Valdes then hit Grace in the right arm and Wegner
immediately ejected Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgers' fifth, Wood threw a pitch near Cora's head, but
Wood was not warned at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes gave up five runs on eight hits and two walks over
four-plus innings, striking out two, and fell to 0-3 in six starts
since rejoining the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wood batted left-handed against Valdes for the second game
to protect a strained left oblique, which put him on the DL from
July 30-Aug. 21. He batted right-handed against lefty reliever
Carlos Perez. ... Aven, who was acquired from Pittsburgh on Aug. 6,
was called up Aug. 24 and played in his second game for the
Dodgers. It was his first two-homer game since June 13, 1999, when
he did it for the Florida Marlins against the New York Mets. ...
Perez, who started the second game of Friday's doubleheader, made
his eighth relief appearance this year Sunday. ... Beltre's single
in the fifth extended his hitting streak to a career-high nine
games.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Get Atlanta's TE Santiago  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- After a month of auditions for a third
tight end, the Dallas Cowboys acquired O.J. Santiago from Atlanta
on Sunday for two late-round draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   A season-ending injury to Mike Lucky early in training camp left
Dallas without a backup to David LaFleur and Jackie Harris. Lucky
was to have joined LaFleur as a second blocking tight end on as
much as 20 percent of the Cowboys' new offense.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' search included trading for one candidate, claiming
another off waivers, signing three players and looking at another
already on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were leaning toward keeping two -- a blocker to back
up and complement LaFleur and a receiver to back up Harris. Then
the Falcons called Saturday and, after a few hours of negotiations,
Dallas agreed to give up a fourth-round pick next year and a
seventh-rounder in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''They'd been watching us bring in tight ends, so they saw we
were potentially interested,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago caught 27 passes for 428 yards and five touchdowns in
1998, the year Atlanta reached the Super Bowl. His blocking also
helped Jamal Anderson lead the NFC in rushing.
</P>
<P>
   His most memorable contribution to the Falcons that year,
however, may have been inventing the ''Dirty Bird'' dance that
became their trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Santiago had 15 catches for 174 yards. He'll be a
free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very comfortable he'll be able to walk in and
contribute immediately,'' coach Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the 53-man roster limit, Dallas cut 18 players.
Offensive lineman Tony Hutson and fullback Ryan Neufeld were the
only members of last year's team to be released.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 7, Braves 2  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals finally showed they could
win a series at Turner Field, and the Atlanta Braves were left
clinging to the slimmest of leads in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile pitched an eight-hitter and the NL Central-leading
Cardinals scored three runs in both the seventh and eighth innings,
beating Atlanta 7-2 Sunday for their first series victory at the
stadium since it opened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis took three of four games from the Braves, also winning
their first season series (4-3) since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the New York Mets defeated Arizona 2-1 to pull within
a game of Atlanta. It's the smallest margin since July 1, when the
Braves also led by a game. The Braves, going for their ninth
straight division championship, have held at least a share of first
since April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch was delayed 2 hours, 32 minutes by rain, marking
the second time in the series that a game was held up more than two
hours because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta starter John Burkett allowed only two hits through six
innings, leaving with a 2-1 lead, but St. Louis thrived against the
Braves' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg (2-3) surrendered the lead by giving up three
runs in the seventh, including a two-run double by Placido Polanco.
The next inning, Mike Remlinger gave up Mike Matheny's two-run
single before Polanco followed with another double, driving in his
third run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kile (15-9) needed only 102 pitches for his fourth complete game
of the season. He also became St. Louis' second 15-game winner, a
day after Garrett Stephenson got there first.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves jumped ahead 2-0 in the third, thanks to a pair of
perfectly placed hits. Walt Weiss doubled to the gap in
right-center, the ball dropping between Jim Edmonds and J.D. Drew.
Then, Burkett beat out a broken-bat blooper that just cleared the
infield dirt before it was fielded by second baseman Fernando Vina.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's hit scored Reggie Sanders from third, giving the
Atlanta pitcher his first RBI since 1996. Rafael Furcal followed
with a sacrifice fly that brought home Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett was perfect through three innings, but he plunked Vina
with a pitch leading off the fourth and it wound up costing the
Atlanta starter his only run. Vina moved to third with two outs and
scored when Craig Paquette barely beat out a slow roller between
the mound and third-base line.
</P>
<P>
Notes: St. Louis began the day with a 7&AMP;frac12;-game lead over Cincinnati
in the Central. ... Braves CF Andruw Jones didn't play, ending a
301-game streak that was second-longest in the majors behind Sammy
Sosa. .... Cardinals C Carlos Hernandez left the game in the fifth
inning with a lower back sprain. ... Burkett's RBI was his first
since May 3, 1996, when he played for Florida. He spent the past
three years in the American League. ... St. Louis had seven hits
over the final three innings against Ligtenberg, Remlinger and Gabe
Molina.

<HEADLINE> Study: FBI Has Expanded Officers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of FBI intelligence officers has
grown almost fivefold during the Clinton administration, but
internal security and terrorism cases accounted for only 45 of the
FBI's 12,730 convictions in 1998, a Syracuse University research
center reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The research center cautioned that convictions may not be the
best measure of the effectiveness of the FBI intelligence effort,
and an FBI executive said the small number may reflect the bureau's
success in preventing actual terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh has publicly stated that the bureau is
putting top priority on thwarting foreign spies and preventing
terrorist attacks, but hard data about the change in emphasis has
been sparse because so many of the operations are classified.
</P>
<P>
   Citing federal employment data, Syracuse's Transactional Records
Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) said the total of FBI intelligence
officers increased from 224 in 1992 to 1,025 in 1999, but their
exact duties are not known.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant FBI Director John Collingwood said in an interview
that these are intelligence analysts and that their increase is
mirrored by an increase in field agents assigned to hunt spies and
battle terrorists but that those personnel figures remain secret.
</P>
<P>
   The new intelligence analysts were hired ''as part of our effort
to use our information more effectively across programs, as opposed
to limiting its use within one program,'' Collingwood said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Justice Department inspector general criticized
the national security division for not sharing key intelligence
information about China.
</P>
<P>
   So Freeh carved two new divisions out of the national security
division: a counterterrorism division and an investigative support
division. Collingwood said analysts are assigned to all three, but
most are in the investigative support division.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all part of our effort to play a larger role in the
intelligence community in counterintelligence and counterterrorism
activity, to identify, prevent and disrupt terrorists,''
Collingwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The TRAC study said Justice Department records show that in 1998
there were 37 terrorism convictions and eight internal security
convictions from FBI cases. There was no earlier Justice data on
terrorism cases because the category was only recently employed,
but national security convictions totaled seven each in 1992 and
1993, four in 1994, 12 in 1995 and eight each in 1996, 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, drug cases, bank robberies and bank fraud were still
the three categories producing the most FBI convictions, accounting
for 54 percent of the 12,730 that year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The low number of terrorism convictions is a good thing, not a
bad thing,'' Collingwood said. ''We're now working with the CIA and
foreign agencies to disrupt terrorists before they can carry out
their actions and preferably before they get inside the United
States. Figures on those actions aren't recorded, because they are
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the statistics can understate anti-terrorist
efforts. ''We recently convicted a gang in the Pacific Northwest of
bank robbery and their convictions will show up that way, but they
were robbing banks to support their terrorist activities,''
Collingwood said.
</P>
<P>
   The TRAC study itself said, ''The number of criminal
prosecutions of spies and terrorists is not a very good index of
FBI concerns, ... because these kinds of cases frequently are not
brought into open court.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found evidence that more time was being spent
developing all kinds of cases, because the percentage of FBI cases
that U.S. attorneys agreed to prosecute rose from 41 percent in
1992 to 49 percent in 1998. Also the conviction rate for defendants
in all kinds of FBI cases improved from 67 percent in 1992 to 76
percent in 1998. Median prison sentences rose from 18 months to 25
months.

<HEADLINE> Saints Cut Quarterback Tolliver  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, a 10-year
veteran who had been with the New Orleans Saints since 1998, was
one of 17 players cut Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver, one of the few holdovers from the Mike Ditka years,
was competing with Aaron Brooks and Jake Delhomme to back up
starter Jeff Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not so much what Billy didn't do as what Jake and Aaron
did do,'' coach Jim Haslett said. ''They're young guys that you
hate to let go. We think they're going to be pretty good players in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints traded a third-round draft pick and linebacker K.D.
Williams to Green Bay on July 31 for Brooks and tight end Lamont
Hall. Delhomme signed as a free agent out of Southwestern Louisiana
and started the final two games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Billy's good for a football team,'' Haslett said.
''He'd be good to have around here. He's a true professional. He's
a great teacher. I think he'll be a good coach someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver can still play in the league, Haslett said, and he did
not rule out his return to the Saints. There was discussion about
keeping all four quarterbacks, he said. Because of injuries and
other needs, however, they decided to go with three.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on who is the No. 2 quarterback has not been made.
</P>
<P>
   Also cut were veteran fullback Aaron Craver, running back
Wilmont Perry, fullback Michael Blair, defensive ends D.J. Cooper
and Bobby Setzer, cornerback Shannon Garrett, guard Robert Hunt,
safety Eric Johnson, centers Jason McEndoo and Tom Schau,
linebackers Ron Merkerson, Joe Tuipala and Philip Ward, tackle
Chase Raynock, tight end Dave Stachelski and wide receiver L.C.
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were expected to keep either Perry, a fifth-round
draft pick in 1998, or Craver, who started 10 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided we were going to keep one or the other based on how
they performed in the last game,'' Haslett said. ''Neither one did
a great job when they were in.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was to keep six receivers, including free agent
Ryan Thelwell, who has played impressively, and only four running
backs.
</P>
<P>
   The release of Perry, Craver and Blair left the Saints with only
four running backs: starters Ricky Williams and Terrelle Smith and
backups Chad Morton and Brian Milne. Smith and Morton are rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ''You try not to be too emotional about it,'' said Craver. ''I
don't want anybody feeling sorry for me, so I wished everybody good
luck and left.''

<HEADLINE> Webb Hangs On to Edge Meg Mallon  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Karrie Webb, trying to make LPGA
history, settled instead for winning another tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Webb shot an even-par 72 Sunday for a four-round total of 265,
tying the Oldsmobile Classic record of 23 under by Lisa Walters in
1998 at Walnut Hills Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Australian star held on for a two-stroke
victory over fast-closing Meg Mallon who shot a 66.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think anybody had a chance with Karrie today,'' said
Mallon, who has nine comeback victories during her career. ''Maybe
a bit of complacency held her down.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb went into the final round with a commanding eight-stroke
lead over Mallon and Cristie Kerr. At the time, it seemed like her
biggest task would be breaking her own LPGA record of 26 under, set
last year in the Australian Ladies Masters.
</P>
<P>
   But she never could get her game in gear.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's third round Webb birdied three of the first four
holes. On Sunday, she was struggling right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have a lot of adrenaline today,'' said Webb, who has
six wins this year, including two majors, and leads the LPGA money
list. ''I was just a little flat. My whole game was flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble came on the third hole where Webb drove into the left
rough, to a lie that left the ball below her feet. Her second shot
rolled over the green, into some rough on the back side. A chip and
two putts later, she had her first bogey.
</P>
<P>
   In the early rounds, whenever Webb made a bogey, she responded
with a birdie on the very next hole. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Webb did birdie No. 6 with a chip within 4 feet, only to give it
back with a three-putt bogey at 9 to make the turn at 1-over 37.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's frustration continued on the back side. She was splitting
the fairways with powerful drives of 280 yards, but the rest of her
game was just so-so.
</P>
<P>
   At the 13th, an uphill par-3, Webb went with a 4-iron off the
tee. But she hit it so fat the ball just barely cleared the pond
full of ducks fronting the green. Her chip from a mushy lie landed
20 feet from the pin, and Webb needed two putts to get down.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was back to 22 under, and her lead was reduced to just
three strokes over Mallon who was playing in the twosome just ahead
of Webb and Kerr. And her frustration was beginning to show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Swing at it,'' Webb yelled to herself after leaving her second
shot at No. 15 about 35 feet below the pin.
</P>
<P>
   A roar from the crowd up ahead told Webb that Mallon had birdied
No. 16 to go 20 under, cutting her lead to two strokes. This time,
Webb was up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-iron on the 175-yard 16th left Webb 15 feet from the pin. As
she marked her ball, Webb could see clearly on a greenside
leaderboard how close Mallon had drawn. She responded by draining
the putt for her last -- and most important -- birdie of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the biggest key there,'' Webb said. ''If I didn't
make birdie there, it was going to be really tight. That gave me a
three-shot lead with two to play -- which is no guarantee. But it at
least made me feel a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   That putt looked even bigger after Mallon hit a wedge inside 3
feet for another birdie at No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Webb won $112,500, giving her $1.68 million so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of earning this victory, Webb had a round of 11
under, setting a tournament record and matching the LPGA record by
Annika Sorenstam in 1999. Webb's 23 under after 54 holes also was a
record, breaking her own mark by one stroke.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Scaled Back  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TOMLINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Mediators trying to end Burundi's
seven-year civil war were unlikely to work out a cease-fire before
President Clinton's visit Monday and worked for a less ambitious
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Former South African President Nelson Mandela had set Monday as
the deadline for an agreement to stop the fighting between the
Tutsi-dominated government and Hutu rebels. Plans called for
Clinton and leaders of 12 African nations to witness the signing
ceremony Monday evening in this northern Tanzanian town.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, however, have avoided tying Clinton's
Arusha visit to a signing. They say only that the president, who
was flying from Nigeria early Monday, wants to show his support for
Mandela's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to go to Arusha was made irrespective of whether
or not there was to be a signing,'' Susan Rice, assistant secretary
of state for African affairs, said at a news conference in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Burundian and Western diplomats close to the Burundi talks
admitted Sunday that a cease-fire, the Tutsis' key demand, could
not be reached. Talks were going into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Sunday night, gunfire and tracer bullets lit the sky
over Burundi's capital as Hutu rebels attacked one of Bujumbura's
suburbs on the eve of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Gasenyi, about five miles from the city center,
lasted about an hour. By midnight Sunday, the city was calm, though
nervous soldiers and police patrolled the streets. Most residents
stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time the rebels, who are attacking from
hide-outs in the hills surrounding the lakeside capital, have
launched an assault on Bujumbura. No report on casualties was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders were still boycotting the peace talks in Arusha.
Senior Burundian officials said there were reports that rebel
leaders may be secretly in Arusha, ready to join the talks at the
last minute, but there was no confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a breakthrough, negotiators hoped for a limited
agreement on issues such as the ethnic breakdown of a future
national assembly and how Hutus would be eventually integrated into
the military
</P>
<P>
   The agreement may also include a commitment by the two sides to
seek a cease-fire to the conflict that has killed more than 200,000
people, mostly civilians, since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said a political agreement would allow Mandela to narrow the number
of groups involved in the negotiations and then focus solely on a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Tutsi political parties, seven Hutu parties, President
Pierre Buyoya's government and the Tutsi army have been discussing
a peace agreement for more than two years and there was a
heightened sense of urgency Sunday ahead of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the usual pre-agreement panic. They are now getting down
to serious negotiations,'' said one Western observer. The observer,
who did not want to be named, added that a 167-page draft produced
by the mediators was being used in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   While the power-sharing agreement appeared to take shape Sunday,
the lack of progress on a cease-fire threatened to derail the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya repeatedly has said that without an end to the attacks by
Hutu rebels, he cannot sign a power-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsi extremists in the tiny central African country have
threatened to stage a coup if they perceive an agreement as giving
away too much.
</P>
<P>
   A small Tutsi elite has controlled most of Burundi's government
and industries since independence in 1962. A Hutu won the first,
and only, democratic election in 1993, but was assassinated three
months later by Tutsi paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Tutsis have controlled the political and economic
life in Burundi, while Hutu rebels operating from bases outside the
country have fought for the restoration of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Burundian Tutsis, however, fear they will meet the same
fate as Rwanda's Tutsi minority, which in 1994 were victims of a
Hutu government-orchestrated genocide that left more than 500,000
people dead.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Rebels Attack Suburban Town  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Gunfire and tracer bullets lit the
night sky over Burundi's capital Sunday as Hutu rebels attacked one
of Bujumbura's suburbs on the eve of a peace agreement that is
supposed to end the country's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Gasenyi, about five miles from the city center,
lasted about an hour. By midnight Sunday, the city was calm, though
nervous soldiers and police patrolled the streets. Most residents
stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time the rebels, who are attacking from
hide-outs in the hills surrounding the lakeside capital, have
launched an assault on Bujumbura. No report on casualties was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were running high in the country as President Pierre
Buyoya, the army and 19 Hutu and Tutsi political parties and
interest groups were preparing to sign a peace agreement in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha in the presence of President
Clinton and other world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two main rebel groups, who took up arms after Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated the first democratically elected
president, a Hutu, in 1993, have refused to sign. The absence of a
cease-fire has given Burundians little hope that war would
immediately come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have died since the fighting began.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tutsi hard-liners who feel the country's
power-sharing agreement is favoring the Hutu majority called for a
boycott of commercial activities on Monday to protest the signing.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the University of Bujumbura, most of them Tutsis,
warned commuters that cars and buses would be stoned. The students
have been boycotting classes since last week to protest the
government's inability to curb rebel attacks and Buyoya's decision
to enter an agreement with Hutu leaders blamed for anti-Tutsi
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The students are backed by several Tutsi political parties and
groups, who have stepped up opposition to Buyoya and demands that
he step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''The signing of the agreement is not a problem. The problem is
who will lead this country,'' said Samson Ntunguke, a businessman
and a member of the opposition Tutsi Parena party led by former
President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't trust Buyoya from what we have seen of him,'' he
said. That echoed the sentiments among many middle-class Tutsis who
blame Buyoya for rushing the first free elections in 1993, then
orchestrating a coup three months later that triggered the Hutu
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Former South African President Nelson Mandela has been mediating
the talks in Arusha. He is trying to cut a deal among the Burundian
negotiators on who would lead the country during a three-year
transition period after the agreement is signed Monday. Most Tutsi
parties as well as some Hutu politicians are opposed to Buyoya.

<HEADLINE> Twins 7, Tigers 6, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Midre Cummings was as much a fan Sunday as he
was the hero.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings hit a game-winning RBI single in the 10th inning and
Ron Coomer had three RBIs as the Minnesota Twins beat the Detroit
Tigers 7-6 in a seesaw game at the Metrodome filled with great
plays and clutch hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fun to watch and even more exciting to play in,''
Cummings said. ''It was just a well-played ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones (0-3), after blowing a one-run lead in the ninth,
issued a pair of one-out walks in the 10th. Matt Lawton hit an
infield single to load the bases before Denny Hocking struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings then lined a 2-2 pitch to left to give Minnesota its
30th come-from-behind victory and third win in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're just trying to get a base hit there, which makes it
that much easier,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Midre's such a professional hitter,'' Lawton said. ''He knows
what to do there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, batting leadoff for the first time this year, went
3-for-6 with a homer for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like it,'' Lawton said. ''I get a lot of at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley hit a two-run homer and Bobby Higginson's sneaky
slide highlighted a series of comebacks for Detroit, which lost for
just the 10th time in 28 games. The Tigers were trying to move
above .500 for the first time since Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good game to watch if you're a fan,'' Tigers manager
Phil Garner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We let them off the hook today,'' Higginson said. ''We had
plenty of opportunities to win the game, but we didn't get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hector Carrasco (4-3) struck out two in a perfect 10th inning
for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-5, Minnesota scored a run in the ninth off Jones to
tie the game. Cummings singled with one out and moved to third on
Ron Coomer's single. David Ortiz then hit a slow groundout to
third, allowing Cummings to score.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer had tied the game in the eighth with an RBI double
and Deivi Cruz put Detroit ahead 6-5 with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took 4-3 lead in the sixth on Higginson's unique
slide at the plate. Higginson hit a one-out single and advanced to
third on a wild pitch and a groundout. Matt Kinney then threw a
pitch that got away from catcher Danny Ardoin for a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin got to the ball quickly and threw to Kinney covering the
plate, well ahead of Higginson. But Higginson -- in mid-slide --
stopped his right foot short of Kinney's tag, popped up and sneaked
his left foot onto the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something that I've practiced before,'' Higginson
said. ''It's just something where your instincts take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinney thought he was out.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he came in I got him on the right leg before he decided
to jump over,'' Kinney said. ''But, it doesn't matter now.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota came back to take a 5-4 lead in seventh on Coomer's
two-run double off Nelson Cruz -- a line drive that right-fielder
Rich Becker misplayed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton doubled in the first, moved to third on Denny Hocking's
sacrifice bunt and scored on Adam Bernero's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit came right back in the second on Easley's two-run homer,
his 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer hit a sacrifice fly in the third to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took a 3-2 lead in the fifth when Jose Macias tripled
and scored on Javier Cardona's sacrifice fly. Center-fielder Torii
Hunter made a running, diving catch on Cardona's line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm turning into on Torii's biggest fans out there,'' Lawton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton hit his 10th homer on the first pitch from Bernero in the
bottom of the inning to tie the game again. It increased his
career-high RBI total to 79.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota evened its record against Detroit at the
Metrodome at 56-56. ... Both starting pitchers, Kinney and Bernero,
were looking for their first career wins. ... Lawton batted third
in 121 of the 122 previous games he started. He batted sixth once.
... It was Jones' third blown save this season in 39 chances. ...
Juan Gonzalez went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts, ending his
21-game road hitting streak. ... Detroit pitchers issued 10 walks.
Nelson Cruz walked four in 2 1-3 innings, after walking just six in
33 previous innings this year.

<HEADLINE> David Copperfield Sues Insurance Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Magic didn't get his $500,000 back, so David
Copperfield is turning to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Copperfield, 43, filed a lawsuit against Fireman's Fund
Insurance on Friday, claiming the company improperly denied a claim
stemming from his ordeal in getting equipment he used in his shows
back from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, papers that permitted the magician to
shuttle more than $4 million worth of equipment in and out of
Russia without paying taxes disappeared after his final performance
in Moscow in December.
</P>
<P>
   Without the papers, the sealed trucks containing the equipment
could not legally leave the country. Copperfield later learned the
papers were being held by a company he believes is linked to the
Russian mafia. Company officials said they would destroy his
property if he didn't pay to have the papers returned.
</P>
<P>
   Copperfield hired a firm that retained an ex-KGB officer to help
with the negotiations. In January, the company agreed to return the
papers in exchange for payment. Copperfield subsequently filed an
insurance claim seeking reimbursement of $506,343 spent retrieving
the property.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Fireman's Fund denied payment, saying the magician's
policy did not cover losses resulting from ''seizure or destruction
of property by orders of governmental authority.''

<HEADLINE> Pearl Jam Urges Safety at Concerts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- After being horrified by a fatal
stampede at one of their performances, Pearl Jam is taking steps to
avoid another tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The band has asked fans planning to attend a concert at the
Saratoga Performing Arts Center to leave blankets at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we have
witnessed a number of injuries as a result of blankets being used
as trampolines at concerts,'' said Kelly Curtis, manager for the
grunge rock group.
</P>
<P>
   Small beach towels and ponchos were suggested as alternatives to
blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam requested the precautionary blanket ban two months
after nine fans died in a frenzied crush at a concert in Denmark.
After Pearl Jam's 1992 show at the Saratoga center, metal barriers
were installed to prevent stage rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the company that manages the center's
outdoor rock shows banned blankets, but backed down after a public
outcry.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Cut Pederson, 16 Others  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles released quarterback
Doug Pederson, who started nine games last season, as they trimmed
their roster to the NFL limit of 53 players Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, who had not started an NFL game before he was signed
by the Eagles as an unrestricted free agent prior to the 1999
season, was used as a mentor to aid in the development of Donovan
McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb is now the starter for the Eagles; Pederson is out of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   ''With having three veteran quarterbacks, and with the
improvement of the young quarterbacks, along with Doug's desire to
play, we decided it was mutually beneficial for Doug,'' head coach
Andy Reid said. ''There's not enough money to pay Doug for what he
did for us last year. This is the best thing for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, who has drawn interest from Cleveland, had drawn boos
at Veterans Stadium, and even in the preseason every incomplete
pass was greeted by catcalls, though Reid downplayed the idea that
the fans' unhappiness played into the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the development of quarterbacks Koy Detmer and
Ron Powlus, who joined the Eagles after a stint in NFL Europe, made
Pederson expendable. The Eagles attempted to trade Pederson but
were not able to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Detmer and Pederson were virtually even on the depth
chart. Detmer, now the No. 2 quarterback behind McNabb, signed a
three-year contract extension Sunday that keeps him an Eagle
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a good mentality that relief pitchers need,'' said
Reid. ''He doesn't need a lot of reps to get ready. He knows the
system. We'll be fine there.''

   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Rudy Boesch survived a celebrity's welcome
in his hometown after a reunion with his fellow ''Survivor''
castaways in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a lot younger-looking in person,'' said a 9-year-old fan,
who posed with the 72-year-old retired Navy SEAL for a picture at
the airport Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Amid handshaking and backslapping, Boesch and his wife, Marge,
made their way to a black chauffeured limousine hired by CBS and
looked forward to heading home to Virginia Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll give us a chance to wash our clothes,'' quipped Boesch.
</P>
<P>
   But he will soon resume the whirlwind publicity tour he has been
on since the ''Survivor'' finale last week.
</P>
<P>
   After Rudy Boesch Day at a military base on Tuesday, they're off
to Minneapolis where Boesch will make a personal appearance on
behalf of one of the show's sponsors. A ''Survivor'' seminar will
follow in Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Kill at Least 17 in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen killed at least 17 people in two
separate massacres Sunday, one of which officials attributed to
right-wing paramilitary militias.
</P>
<P>
   The killings come three days before President Clinton is to
visit Colombia to discuss U.S. anti-narcotics aid to the
drug-producing nation.
</P>
<P>
   In one attack, gunmen seized, interrogated and then executed 10
residents of two poor neighborhoods in the Caribbean coastal town
of Cienaga, Magadalena State police told The Associated Press.
Police were investigating whether the attack was carried out by
paramilitary militias or rival left-wing guerrillas. Both groups
are active in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, suspected rightist gunmen raided two barrios along a
nine-mile stretch of highway outside the Pacific port of
Buenaventura, killing seven people and leaving their bodies along
the road. The killers painted nearby buildings with the initials
AUC, the Spanish initials for the paramilitary umbrella group
calling itself the United Self-defense Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   During his one-day stop in Colombia on Wednesday, Clinton will
meet President Andres Pastrana to discuss a $1.3 billion U.S.
anti-narcotics aid package for Colombia and its Andean neighbors
recently approved in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The aid is being provided despite objections by international
human rights organizations. The groups have urged Clinton to
withhold U.S. assistance until Pastrana takes firmer action to curb
the paramilitary forces, which have ties to the country's military.

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Bernie Williams drove in the
go-ahead run in a three-run eighth inning as the New York Yankees
came from behind to defeat the Oakland Athletics 7-5 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir (8-3) walked David Justice to start the eighth and
Jose Canseco singled. After Jose Vizcaino came in to run for
Canseco, Tino Martinez lifted a routine fly ball to center field.
But Terrence Long struggled with the ball in the sun, then dropped
it after trying to make a basket catch, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Luis Sojo hit a slow bouncer to third, which Eric
Chavez picked up and threw past first baseman Mike Stanley. Sojo
was credited with a single and an RBI, and the throwing error
allowed a second run to score to tie it 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius was walked intentionally to set the stage for
Williams, hitting for Clay Bellinger. Williams grounded into a
force play, allowing Martinez to score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Justice added an RBI double in the ninth for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle (4-4) won for the second time in three decisions.
He allowed five runs on six hits and four walks in seven innings,
striking out six.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle won his two first starts after joining the Yankees on
July 18, but was 1-4 in his next six starts before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera recorded the final four outs for his 29th save in
34 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland starter Gil Heredia failed in his fifth attempt for his
career-high 14th victory despite pitching 6 1-3 effective innings.
He allowed three runs on six hits with two walks and two
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia is 0-2 with three no-decisions since recording his 13th
victory on July 30 against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley gave the A's a 3-0 lead in the first with his 12th home
run. After Randy Velarde doubled and Adam Piatt walked, Stanley hit
an 1-0 pitch from Neagle into the left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Fasano hit his seventh homer of the year, a solo shot with
one out in the second to put Oakland up 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got a run back in the third. Luis Polonia walked,
stole second and continued to third when the throw went into center
field. Derek Jeter followed with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, New York drew within 4-3 on a run-scoring single
by Jorge Posada and Bellinger's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Piatt's fifth homer of the season in the fifth gave the A's a
5-3 edge.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees have won nine of the last 10 season series with
the A's. ... Sojo extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13
games with a bunt single in the second. ... The A's' 189 homers are
the fifth-best total in Oakland history. ... The A's, who made four
errors, have a major league-high 121 this season after committing
just 122 all of last year. ... Stanley broke an 0-for-17 slump with
his first-inning homer. ... Justice was hitless in 14 at-bats
before his ninth-inning double. ... Brosius appeared in left field,
as a defensive replacement, for the first time since Sept. 22,
1997, with the A's.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Ray Durham hit a tiebreaking homer in the eighth
inning and Chicago held Seattle to four hits for the second time
this series as the White Sox beat the struggling Mariners 2-1
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners lost for the 12th time in 14 games, including a 4-1
defeat Friday night when they had four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Durham, who was ejected in the ninth inning Saturday for arguing
after being called out on strikes in an 11-5 loss, hit his 15th
home run of the season into the right-field stands off Freddy
Garcia (4-4) with one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Lowe came out of the bullpen for Chicago and started in
place of James Baldwin, whose start was moved back to Tuesday night
because of a tired arm. Lowe gave up one run, four hits and two
walks in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Lorenzo Barcelo (2-1) pitched three perfect innings of
relief for the win. Keith Foulke pitched the ninth for his 24th
save in 29 opportunities. It was his second save in the series and
his fourth save this season against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox improved to 23-11 in one run games, the best
record in the majors. The Mariners dropped to a major league-worst
9-21 in one-run contests.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took a 1-0 lead when Paul Konerko led off the
second with his 15th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tied the score in the fifth. Mike Cameron singled,
stole second and came home on Mark McLemore's single.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Chicago loaded the bases on Herbert Perry's
single, Chris Singleton's fielder's choice and walks to Jeff Abbott
and Mark Johnson. But Garcia got Durham to ground out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Tony Graffanino was thrown out at the plate by
shortstop Alex Rodriguez when he attempted to score from second on
third baseman Carlos Guillen's error on Carlos Lee's ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez doubled to lead off the fourth and was at third with
one out, but Lowe got John Olerud on a line drive and Guillen to
ground out.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: White Sox SS Jose Valentin, who didn't start for the second
straight game because of an inflammation in his pelvic area,
grounded out in the eighth as a pinch-hitter and had his
career-high 13-game hitting streak broken. He remained in the game
at shortstop after he pinch hit. ... Lowe made his seventh career
start and his second this season. ... Chicago won the season series
from Seattle 7-5. It's the first season series the White Sox have
won from the Mariners since 1994, when they won nine out of 10. ...
Guillen committed his team-leading 15th error of the season in his
64th game. ... The crowd of 45,525 was the second largest in 107
games at Safeco Field. The largest Safeco crowd was 45,552 on
opening day this season. ... Garcia's eight innings pitched was his
longest outing of the season. His previous longest start was seven
innings.

play, we decided it was mutually beneficial for Doug,'' head coach
Andy Reid said. ''There's not enough money to pay Doug for what he
did for us last year. This is the best thing for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederson, who has drawn interest from Cleveland, had drawn boos
at Veterans Stadium, and even in the preseason every incomplete
pass was greeted by catcalls, though Reid downplayed the idea that
the fans' unhappiness played into the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the development of quarterbacks Koy Detmer and
Ron Powlus, who joined the Eagles after a stint in NFL Europe, made
Pederson expendable. The Eagles attempted to trade Pederson but
were not able to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Detmer and Pederson were virtually even on the depth
chart. Detmer, now the No. 2 quarterback behind McNabb, signed a
three-year contract extension Sunday that keeps him an Eagle
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got a good mentality that relief pitchers need,'' said
Reid. ''He doesn't need a lot of reps to get ready. He knows the
system. We'll be fine there.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton labels Senate opponent ''Bush-Lite''  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton pressed her attack
Sunday on Republican Senate rival Rick Lazio's tax-cut plan,
calling it a ''tax scheme'' and saying the congressman was trying
to be ''Bush-Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lazio took his fund-raising bandwagon to the first
lady's new hometown in Westchester County, a move designed to
highlight her lack of New York roots.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's second day campaigning with her mother, Dorothy
Rodham, an apparent effort on her part to stress her own family
values which have come under question because of her support for
her husband through the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At two upstate venues, Clinton slammed Lazio, saying the Long
Island Republican congressman, who has been in Congress for eight
years, had voted eight times for budgets that would hurt New York.
She added the state already does not get its fair share from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, he tried this week to be Bush-Lite,'' she told
crowds of a couple hundred people at stops in Kingston and in
Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In the first lady's adopted hometown of Chappaqua, Lazio agreed
that New York gets shorted by Washington but laid the blame at the
feet of President Clinton and took a familiar dig at Hillary
Clinton's recent move to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted to be here in Chappaqua, in my home state, in
my back yard,'' Lazio said at one of four fund-raisers he was
scheduled to attend Sunday. ''We're here to talk about ... the
basic inequity of sending $15 billion more to Washington than New
York gets back. It's at its worst point now, ever, under the
Clinton administration and we need to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar themes arose in Clinton's stop, as well. She reminded
the crowd of Lazio's four-year service to former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich as deputy whip, asking if it was mainstream to vote for
''Republican budgets that would have slashed $270 million from
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has traveled the state aboard his campaign bus called
''The Mainstream Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you try to match his rhetoric and his record, things just
don't add up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said the ''tax scheme'' Lazio released last week didn't
add up and his cost figure of $776 billion over 10 years was too
low. She said the real cost was more than $1 trillion, a price the
country might not be able to afford and edging up on Texas Gov.
George W. Bush proposed $1.3 trillion tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The New York Daily News, Newsday, other experts say the real
cost would be over one trillion dollars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own tax-cut plan is at about the same level as Vice
President Al Gore's - in the neighborhood of $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Maurice Hinchey introduced Clinton first in Kingston
and later in Newburgh, calling her one of the best women living in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When she wasn't attacking her opponent, Clinton said she would
support scholarships for those who will teach for four years and
work to ensure health coverage for all.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also told supporters she would strive to address
the national debt, save social security, modernize medicare and
give targeted tax cuts to working families. She did not mention how
she planned to pay for her plans, only that she would fight to get
more money from Washington.

<HEADLINE> State to review homeowners' claims of rip-off  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A state housing agency will review
homeowners' claims that they are paying more than advertised to
live in problem plagued condominiums partially paid for with state
money.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the Spring Hollow II condominiums told the Times
Herald-Record of Middletown that kitchen cabinets fell from the
walls, grass and weeds grew through the concrete floor, pipes leak,
doors don't close, windows leak and railings wobble.
</P>
<P>
   Added to those woes, the homeowners say they spent nearly twice
as much for their condominiums - about $110,000 - as the local real
estate market commands and pay $300 to $400 more per month than
expected. Some of the homeowners are paying $1,200 a month for the
condos assessed at $60,500.
</P>
<P>
   The project was funded in part by the state Affordable Housing
Corporation, which loaned each homeowner $25,000 toward the
purchase of the condo, built by Upper West Side developer Marco
Ricotta.
</P>
<P>
   The office of state Housing Finance Agency CEO Stephen J. Hunt
declined to answer specific questions from the Record but issued a
statement on Aug. 22 defending the Affordable Housing Corporation's
Affordable Home Ownership Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it recently became aware of ''information about
construction defects,'' and once it completes a review would
''explore the appropriate remedies in an effort to resolve the
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricotta declined to answer questions from the newspaper. His
lawyer referred questions to another lawyer who was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got took,'' said home buyer Anthony Hodge of 37 Woodlake
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Some owe mortgage companies $90,000 or more but resales at
Spring Hollow's first phase range from $40,000 to $77,000. The
average selling price of a condo in Middletown was $56,300 in the
first half of 1999, $63,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Thomas Kirwan of Newburgh said the grant program
should be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sounds like this (developer) blew one by the state,'' he said.
''It's an awful waste of taxpayer money, in addition to these
people getting screwed.''

<HEADLINE> Orlando Brown Not Among Browns Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Browns offensive tackle Orlando
Brown, unable to play since being hit in the right eye by a
referee's penalty flag in December, was placed on the physically
unable to perform list Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The expected move means Brown cannot practice or play for the
first six weeks of the season. After that, Brown could remain on
the PUP list or be placed on the non-football injured reserve list.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is the team could release Brown, who signed a
six-year, $27 million free-agent contract before last season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 6-foot-7, 350-pound offensive tackle, suffered the eye
injury during a Dec. 19 game against Jacksonville when referee Jeff
Triplette accidentally hit him with a penalty flag weighted with
BBs.
</P>
<P>
   He has been restricted from running or lifting weights since
being injured. Brown has attended practices and meetings, but not
traveled with the team for exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing has changed with his status,'' Browns coach Chris
Palmer said at a Sunday news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Brown shoved Triplette to the ground as he left the field. The
lineman said later his reaction came out of fear because his father
was blinded by glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   The league initially suspended Brown indefinitely, but lifted
the penalty in late February. Triplette has not been reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is considering filing a lawsuit against the NFL and has
retained lawyer Johnny Cochran to explore that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns placed Brown on the physically unable to perform list
in July, but the team had to make another decision on his status
Sunday because of roster cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns made 18 other roster moves Sunday. Released were
tight ends Kyle Allamon and Randy Palmer; linebackers Jeff Kerr,
Jason Kyle, Tony McCombs and Ryan Taylor; defensive linemen Bill
Duff and Jeff Dyra; wide receivers Damon Dunn and Ronnie Powell;
defensive backs Corey Ivy and Tony Maranto; running back Rahshon
Spikes; and punter John Ballantyne.
</P>
<P>
   The team also placed running back Madre Hill on the injured
reserve list with a neck injury. Linebacker Kendall Ogle was placed
on that list with a hip injury and offensive lineman Noel
LaMontagne was placed on the reserve-non-football injury list.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer also said the team was placing defensive back Tim McTyer
on injured reserve. McTyer has a shoulder injury and Palmer said an
MRI would be performed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Players on injured reserve are out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   One player who survived the cut was running back Terry Kirby,
last year's starting tailback. Kirby came into training camp as the
backup to Errict Rhett, but lost that spot to rookie Travis
Prentice.
</P>
<P>
   ''You (the media), were the only ones who had him cut,'' Palmer
said of Kirby. ''He has value as a third-down back. He's done a
very nice job and has accepted his role.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts left the Browns with 10 offensive lineman, 10 defensive
backs and 11 defensive lineman, surpluses considering the team only
has five wide receivers, five linebackers and two tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going to be heavy in a position, you want to be
heavy on the defensive and offensive lines,'' Palmer said. ''It's
what's up front that counts. Big people are hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the Browns' 13 draft picks made the club.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer also said the team was scanning the waiver wire to
possibly pick up a backup quarterback for starter Tim Couch.
Veteran backup Ty Detmer has been lost for the season with a
ruptured Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said one of the players the Browns are considering is
quarterback Doug Pederson, waived Sunday by Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Cut Seven Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Chargers cut wide receiver Charlie Jones
and made seven other roster moves Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, drafted in the fourth round out of Fresno State in 1996,
was the Chargers' top punt returner this summer. But the team was
expected to cut him after trading an undisclosed late-round draft
choice to the Miami Dolphins for Nate Jacquet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Jones played 54 games with the Chargers, making
129 catches for 1,736 yards and nine touchdowns. His best season
was 1998, when he had 46 receptions for a team-high 699 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a dislocated hip in the preseason last year and had
only 10 catches for 90 yards and nine punt returns for 93 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting Jones, the Chargers released six other
players: guard Wilbert Brown; cornerback Shad Criss; linebackers
Michael Hamilton, Shannon Taylor and Deon Humphrey; and center
Jason Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the team said it had reached an injury settlement
with linebacker Richard Hogans.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 USC 29, No. 22 Penn St. 5  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Sultan McCullough proved he's more
than a track star playing football.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore tailback had a career-high 128 yards rushing as
No. 15 Southern Cal beat No. 22 Penn State 29-5 Sunday in the
Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, playing Penn State's style of smash-mouth football,
outrushed the Nittany Lions 164 yards to 6, the lowest total for
any Penn State team under Joe Paterno.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say I'm just a track star. They say, 'Oh, he's fast,
but all he can do is run track,''' said McCullough, a sprinter on
USC's track team. ''I want to show everybody I can do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who emerged as the starter in training camp, had 413
yards last season and never carried more than 21 times before
getting 29 carries against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said we had three runners and one would establish himself as
the tailback and Sultan took a big step,'' USC coach Paul Hackett
said. ''He's one of the fastest guys around, but he made some tough
runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Carson Palmer also showed some toughness. Palmer,
playing his first game since breaking a collarbone in the third
game last year, was 10-of-20 for 87 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''He handled the football team the way I wanted him to,''
Hackett said. ''He handled the offense the way the leader has to.
That was more important than how much passing he did.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst season-opening loss for Penn State since a 44-6
defeat against Nebraska in the 1983 Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled a homecoming for Penn State's Rashard Casey.
The senior quarterback, who grew up in nearby Hoboken, played his
first game since being charged with assaulting an off-duty police
officer in May.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was 7-of-24 for 106 yards. He was replaced by Matt Senneca
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a tough outing for him for a lot of reasons,'' said
Paterno, who is starting his 35th season. ''He had a tough
preseason. Now that he has this out of his crawl, he can come home
and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State came out tentative, and USC capitalized early. The
Nittany Lions committed two false start penalties in the first
three plays, then made a crucial mistake on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Frank Strong, a late scratch from the starting lineup,
burst up the middle and easily blocked David Royer's punt, and
Sandy Fletcher returned it 6 yards to give USC a 7-0 lead just 2:15
into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these kids haven't played a lot of football,''
Paterno said, trying to explain the early jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, which lost nine starters on defense, including
Courtney Brown and LaVar Arrington, didn't seem like it had an
overhauled defense early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   An interception by Bhawoh Jue gave the Nittany Lions possession
at USC's 38, and a late hit out of bounds by Ryan Nielson on Casey
set up Ryan Primanti's 37-yard field goal that cut it to 7-3 with
7:37 left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense couldn't provide any more big plays, and Penn
State's offense, which was expected to be the team's strength,
actually surrendered more points in the first half than the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Polamalu intercepted a badly thrown pass by Casey and
returned it 43 yards to give USC a 20-3 lead with 2:37 left in the
second. David Newberry missed the extra point.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first interception returned for a touchdown against
Penn State since USC's Quincy Harrison did it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   USC, which has struggled in games played on the East Coast,
didn't seem affected by the cross-country journey. The Trojans
played Big East-type football and pounded it at Penn State before a
Kickoff Classic-record crowd of 78,902.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-play, 73-yard drive capped by a 2-yard run by Petros
Papadakis made it 14-3 with 1:44 left in the first. The drive
consisted of three passes and seven runs, including five carries
for 41 yards by McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   ''His tough runs over and over set the tone,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allowing touchdowns on a punt block and an
interception, Penn State's offense committed five false starts, and
gained just 87 total yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their defense really didn't do anything to disrupt us. We
disrupted ourselves by jumping offsides and not getting where we
need to be at time, and not making the right calls,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   The 393 combined yards were the fewest in Kickoff Classic
history.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno remains seven victories shy of breaking Bear Bryant's
Division I-A record of 323.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Keep Searcy Spot Open  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars will keep a
roster spot open while Pro Bowl right tackle Leon Searcy
rehabilitates the injury to the tendon above his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Coughlin made the decision this weekend. He said
conversations with doctors made him believe Searcy can return by
late November, when the Jaguars figure to be in the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've talked to players, I've watched Leon work out, and I've
talked with him at great length,'' Coughlin said Sunday after the
Jaguars trimmed their roster to 53 players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm cautiously optimistic. I believe he'll be prepared to play
in late November.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Jaguars placed Searcy on injured reserve to save a
roster spot, he would have been lost for the season. Searcy said he
waged a full-fledged campaign with Coughlin last week for a spot on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth-year veteran tore his quadriceps in one-on-one drills
July 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''The healing is a lot further along than the doctor expected,''
he said recently. ''His statement to me was, 'It would be crazy if
you go on IR.' It was real positive, real uplifting, and I'm going
to run with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin will monitor Searcy's progress and said he will have to
meet deadlines on several milestones during the rehab process. One
of the key points will come after the eighth game of the season,
Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also said other injuries could dictate a change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a situation that's totally in Leon's control,''
Coughlin said. ''This team has to play, play well and play without
injuries for everything to work out. If we have too many nicks that
go two or three weeks and we don't have enough players to practice,
those circumstances will be difficult to deal with.''

malaria and other diseases devastating Africa. ''In every country, in any

the issues involved with AIDS,'' Clinton said after touring a health center in
the Nigerian capital and hearing the stories of several people living with the

second-tallest freestanding structure, trapping four people in an elevator and
knocking out most TV channels in the Russian capital Monday. Firefighters have
had trouble fighting the fire, which started Sunday about 1,520 feet above
ground, due to the difficulty of hauling chemical fire extinguishers and other
equipment up so many flights of stairs. The tower's spire is narrow at that
point and the cramped quarters hampered movement. The fire has been burning and
TV stations have been out for almost 12 hours.

cars and peacekeepers' vehicles after the hit-and-run attack, breaking
windshields. Both the United Nations and the peacekeepers ordered their forces
to withdraw from the area. U.N. officials said the car turned off the road and

   DETROIT (AP) -- Mixing his religion with politics as never before, vice

that he hopes his candidacy as an Orthodox Jew will reinstate ''a place for
faith in America's public life.'' By the time Lieberman left some 500
congregants of the Fellowship Chapel, he had been feted as a civil-rights
freedom fighter, sheathed in African kente cloth as if he were one of their own
and embraced as a man of faith -- never mind from a different faith. Lieberman
is the first Jew to run for national office on a major party ticket.

<P>
   ASSIRA ASHMALIA, West Bank (AP) -- A botched raid on an Islamic militant
hide-out in this West Bank village ended Sunday with three Israeli soldiers dead
-- all possibly by friendly fire -- and Palestinian officials angry at how
Israel handles threats to peace between the two peoples. The target of the
nighttime raid was Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a fugitive at the top of Israel's
most-wanted list, blamed for two 1997 bombings that killed at least 21 Israelis.
The raid comes a month after Israeli and Palestinian negotiators broke new
ground at the Camp David summit and just before President Clinton returns to the
region to push for more advances.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Midre Cummings hit a game-winning RBI single in the 10th
inning and Ron Coomer had three RBIs as the Minnesota Twins beat the Detroit
Tigers 7-6 in a seesaw game at the Metrodome filled with great plays and clutch
hits. ''It was fun to watch and even more exciting to play in,'' Cummings said.
''It was just a well-played ballgame.'' Todd Jones (0-3), after blowing a
one-run lead in the ninth, issued a pair of one-out walks in the 10th.

<HEADLINE> Wright, Farmer Among Steelers Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Anthony Wright began the Pittsburgh Steelers'
training camp with the intention of being the 2001 starting
quarterback and ended it without a job.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who said in July he was convinced he would be in the
running to start next year, was among 13 players cut Sunday. Wright
not only couldn't beat out Kordell Stewart and Kent Graham, who are
currently sharing the starting job, he couldn't hold off Tennessee
rookie Tee Martin to be the No. 3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a fifth-round draft choice not highly regarded by many
NFL teams because of his sometimes erratic arm, is the third
quarterback to unexpectedly make the Steelers' roster in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it was Pete Gonzalez, who is no longer with the
team and was cut this summer by Indianapolis. Last year it was
Wright, who wasn't drafted after South Carolina won only one game
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you looked at the statistics, they would certainly bear out
probably more in Anthony's favor,'' coach Bill Cowher said Sunday.
''But you have to also realize Anthony's had two years in this
system. ... (Tee) has a little bit of a presence, and I guess that
had a lot to do with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who led Tennessee to the national championship a year
after Peyton Manning left, was 2-of-10 for 53 yards in Friday's
17-10 preseason loss to Washington. Wright was 2-of-7 for 39 yards
and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something about the guy (Martin),'' Cowher said.
''He's not ready to play right now. He would be the first one to
admit that. He has some of the intangibles that I think are hard to
describe. He has a chance to be a good player in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers, who rarely cut draft picks in their rookie season,
also waived wide receiver Danny Farmer, a fourth-rounder from UCLA
who was beaten out by veteran Courtney Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Steelers cut tight end Jason Gavadza, a sixth-round
pick from Kent State. Two of the nine picks in the first draft led
by new director of football operations Kevin Colbert are off the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was injured for much of camp and, when he did practice,
dropped a noticeable number of passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing Courtney did, he came in and went about his business
like a professional and took advantage of the opportunities that
were presented to him,'' Cowher said. ''You would have liked to
have seen Danny at full strength for the five (preseason) games.''
</P>
<P>
   Other veterans waived were Anthony Brown, who started much of
last season at right tackle but became expendable when Marvel Smith
was drafted; safety Lance Brown; defensive lineman Ernie Brown;
linebacker Gabe Northern; offensive lineman Greg Huntington;
linebacker Chad Kelsay; tight end Matt Cushing; and Pepe Pearson,
the former Ohio State running back who was cut by his eighth team
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Northern was signed away from the Buffalo Bills as a free agent,
but was injured for much of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Also waived was rookie free agent offensive lineman Hank Fraley.
The Steelers will add Fraley to their practice squad if he clears
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie fullback Dan Kreider and defensive tackle Al Lucas also
were waived.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys, Cops To Meet After 2 Years  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- For the first time in over two years, John and
Patsy Ramsey are scheduled to meet Monday with investigators to
discuss the unsolved slaying of their daughter, JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who authorities say are still under suspicion in the
6-year-old's 1996 slaying, last met with police in June 1998. They
have rejected all other proposed meetings over the terms of the
interviews, including all attempts to interview them separately --
until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys are scheduled to answer questions Monday in Atlanta
in separate sessions with a seven-member investigative team led by
Boulder, Colo., police Chief Mark Beckner, their attorney, L. Lin
Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Ramsey will be interviewed first and then John, as Boulder
police requested, Wood said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time limit on the interviews, which will be
videotaped and transcribed by a court reporter at Wood's office.
Wood said the interviews could take about two days.
</P>
<P>
   ''John and Patsy agreed to each and every condition imposed by
the police department, and we imposed no conditions ourselves,''
Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Ramseys will terminate the interviews immediately
if they are ''attacked, abused or treated unfairly,'' Wood said.
Otherwise, they will help with any ''legitimate investigative
effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the Ramseys agreed to the interview in hopes of
getting police to move past a theory that they could have played a
role in their daughter's death. ''John and Patsy realize they need
the Boulder Police Department to find the killer of their
daughter,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found strangled and beaten in the basement of her
family's Boulder home Dec. 26, 1996. No suspect has ever been
named, and the Ramseys deny any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury convened in 1998 to investigate JonBenet's death
but didn't return an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, the Ramseys' Atlanta-based attorney, said he advised the
couple not to meet with police because he was concerned about ''the
potential for innocent people to be caught up in a web of an
overzealous prosecutor and unobjective or less than objective
police officials.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be safe to say there's probably no lawyer who
would recommend they participate in this kind of interrogation,''
Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood will attend the interview along with an investigator the
Ramseys hired to work on the case. The couple and their son, Burke,
moved from Boulder to Atlanta after JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner declined to comment on the Ramsey interview.
</P>
<P>
   While the interview may not conclusively establish the Ramseys'
innocence, the couple may help their image by signaling to the
public that the investigation remains open, said University of
Georgia criminal law professor Ron Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   ''The willingness of John and Patsy to sit for interrogation,
which they are not required to do, does impress many people as
conduct which is inconsistent with guilt,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Odom Put on IR as Bucs Trim Roster  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay hoped Jason Odom would be its
starting left tackle. Instead, Odom will miss the season after
being placed on injured reserve Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen players were waived, non of them well-known veterans.
Two others were placed on the reserve list with non-football
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Odom missed all but two days of training camp because of lower
back pain. He started the first three games of 1999 at right
tackle, but sat out the remainder of the year with a back problem
that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Confident he would return from his injury, the Bucs signed Odom
to a three-year, $10 million contract in February and planned to
move him from right to left tackle with Paul Gruber's future
uncertain after breaking his right leg in last year's
regular-season finale.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all of us, including Jason, felt IR was the way to
go,'' coach Tony Dungy said. ''We didn't feel that good about his
prospects of playing real soon.''
</P>
<P>
   With Odom out, the left tackle job belongs to Pete Pierson, who
started two playoff games after Gruber was injured. George Hegamin
will be the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy waived offensive tackles John Blick and Kendall Mack;
defensive linemen Carl Bradley and Chartric Darby; tight ends Jason
Freeman, James Whalen and Henry Lusk; cornerbacks Deshone Mallard
and Earthwind Moreland; wide receivers Daniel Jones, Yo Murphy and
Drew O'Connor; linebacker Bobbie Howard; safety Jeff Popovich; and
running back Ketric Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Shevin Smith, who dislocated his left big toe in the
third preseason game, was waived after reaching an injury
settlement. Fullback Kevin McLeod was placed on
reserve/non-football illness, and linebacker LB Shawn Stuckey was
put on reserve/non-football injury.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Violent Crime Rate Plunges  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The violent crime rate declined by 10.4
percent last year, the largest one-year drop in the 26-year history
of the government's largest crime survey, the Justice Department
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The property crime rate fell 8.9 percent from 1998 to 1999,
according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' national crime
victimization survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated there were 28.8 million violent and
property crimes in 1999, the lowest figure since the survey was
begun in 1973, when it found an estimated 44 million crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The violent crime rate decline began in 1994. The decline in the
overall property crime rate extends back a quarter of a century --
to 1974, the statistics bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The declines were no surprise -- either in the short- or
long-term.
</P>
<P>
   As with earlier, similar reports, President Clinton called the
figures ''further proof that the Clinton-Gore administration's
anti-crime strategy of more police on our streets and fewer guns in
the wrong hands has helped to create the safest America in a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   At Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush's
headquarters, spokesman Ray Sullivan said, ''It's typical for the
Clinton-Gore administration to take credit for good things in
America but ... much of the credit for the decline in crime has to
go to governors and local officials who have passed tougher laws,
longer prison sentences and lowered parole rates.'' As governor of
Texas, Bush started toughening criminal and juvenile justice laws
shortly after taking office in 1995, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Academics have cited a wider set of causes, including the aging
of Baby Boomers past the crime-prone years, a subsiding of the
crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s, antigun campaigns by
local police and federal gun controls, crime prevention programs
aimed at young people, and a healthy economy producing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''While these numbers are heartening, there is a great deal more
work to be done,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 survey figures confirmed preliminary FBI figures for
1999 released in May. The FBI data showed the total of seven major
violent and property crimes reported to police dropped for an
eighth consecutive year in 1999, down 7 percent from the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics bureau's survey is the government's broadest
measure of crime because it is based on regular interviews
throughout the nation with more than 77,000 people over age 11.
Thus it collects data not only on crimes reported to police but
also on the larger number that go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI data is based on reports made to 17,000 police agencies
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 44 percent of violent crimes were reported to police,
and only 34 percent of property crimes, the statistics bureau
found. The most frequently reported crime in the survey was motor
vehicle theft; the least reported was personal theft.
</P>
<P>
   Murder, by far the least frequent but best reported of major
crimes, shows up only in the FBI reports, because the statistics
bureau records only crimes reported firsthand by victims it
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The survey estimated that last year there were 32.8 violent
crimes for every 1,000 Americans over age 11, down from 36.6 in
1998. The largest previous one-year drop from was from 10.04
percent from 1994 to 1995, when victimizations declined from 51.8
to 46.6 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Property crimes were estimated to have declined from 217.4 per
1,000 people in 1998 to 198.0 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that overall, 54 percent of violent crime
victims knew their assailant in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 7 out of 10 rape or sexual assault victims could identify
the offender as an acquaintance, friend, relative or intimate. At
the opposite end of the scale, just under half the victims of
aggravated assault and only one-third of the robbery victims knew
their assailant.

<HEADLINE> BCA Classic Delayed By Lightning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Michael Vick's sophomore debut was
delayed Sunday night when lightning and heavy rainstorms rolled
into the area just as the Georgia Tech-Virginia Tech game was set
to kick off.
</P>
<P>
   With the Hokies lined up to kick off to the Yellow Jackets and
start the Black Coaches Association Classic, thunder rumbled in and
lightning bolts lit up the sky around Lane Stadium with a packed
crowd of 55,000 cheering.
</P>
<P>
   When the officials waved the players off the field at 8:08 p.m.,
everyone on the field dashed off and headed back through the
tunnels leading to the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the crowd eventually headed for cover once the
heavy rain and hail began falling as the thunder and lightning
continued near the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy storms and hail were expected to last at least through
8:45 p.m., according to the Virginia Tech sports information
office.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Smith, Virginia Tech's sports information director, has
been with the school for 26 years and said he couldn't recall a
home game being delayed by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The last I-A game delayed by lightning was BYU at New Mexico on
Oct. 17, 1999. The game was delayed at the start of the second half
for 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word when the BCA Classic would begin.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Cops Eye Motorized Scooter Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Colo. (AP) -- The scooter craze spreading through North
America's cities has hit a curb in this northern Colorado town.
</P>
<P>
   The old-style, human powered scooters aren't the problem, police
say. It's the zippier new motorized versions, and police are asking
officials to specifically ban them from all Windsor streets,
sidewalks and trails.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just not aware of the normal rules of the road,''
Police Chief John Michaels said of scooter riders. ''We haven't had
any accidents yet, but there is the potential for tremendous
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In Windsor, like many cities, toy vehicles already are forbidden
in the streets, including kick-powered scooters, which are
basically narrow skateboards with handles. Most motorized vehicles
are already outlawed from many cities' sidewalks, including
Windsor's, but police say scooter riders aren't abiding by the law.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ordinance, now being considered by the city
council, would specifically target motorized scooters in the town
of 6,800 with fines up to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Windsor riders aren't the only ones being warned.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson County, officials warned suburban Denver riders
last year that its deputies would strictly enforce existing laws
effectively prohibiting motorized scooters on sidewalks and
streets.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, riders are required to register their motorized
skateboards or motorized scooters as motorcycles, have them
inspected and become certified motorcycle riders. Gerry McNamara,
education and training chief at the Vermont DMV Enforcement and
Safety Division, said the reason was that scooters best fit the
motorcycle classification.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is kind of foolish. Kids are trying to have some fun. Why
kill it?'' said Russ LaHart, general manager of Sterling Equipment
of Vermont, which advertises one motorized board for $599 as ''The
ultimate skate board.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why you would need a motorcycle license to
drive a skateboard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scooters have become particularly popular on campuses and in
crowded cities like New York and San Francisco where traditional
transportation can been difficult. The motorized scooters are
powered by batteries or gas and feature lightweight foldable frames
that make them easier to carry.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen different companies now make the scooters,
with prices ranging from $60 for kick-powered scooters to $1500 for
some motorized ones.

   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Rescuers confirmed Sunday that all
10 people on board a small plane that slammed into a volcano in
northern Costa Rica were killed, airline officials said. Three
Americans were among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 rescue workers who climbed the lava- and rock-littered
side of Arenal volcano found the wreckage of the 15-seat,
single-engine Cessna Grand Caravan plane, owned by National Aerial
Services, or Sansa. The plane had gone down Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A Sansa spokeswoman told The Associated Press that the rescuers
working 60 miles north of the capital, San Jose, found the bodies
of the plane's two Costa Rican pilots and eight foreign passengers.
Because of bad weather the bodies would not be recovered until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the eight passengers were Steven Bohmer, Helena Bohmer,
and Christopher Damia of the United States; Canadian Terry Pratt;
and Silvia Rhissiner and Catherine Shoep of Switzerland, said Sansa
official Eveleyn Saldana. The pilot and co-pilot were identified as
Karl Acevedo Nevermann, 22, and William Bobadilla.
</P>
<P>
   Saldana said the airline would release the names and
nationalities of the two remaining victims after their relatives
had been contacted. The hometowns of the U.S. victims were not
given.
</P>
<P>
   Two bodies were found inside the airplane, according to the Red
Cross. Television footage showed other bodies scattered on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was between the northern region of La Fortuna, where
the mile-high volcano is located, and Tamarindo, a beach town on
the Pacific coast, when air traffic controllers lost contact about
1:30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The flight originated in San Jose at 12:15 p.m., stopping
briefly in the town of La Fortuna de San Carlos, where Japanese
passenger Masaru Hamatani, 52, got off, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross spokesman Jorge Jimenez said the destroyed plane was
spotted 100 yards beneath the volcano's crater.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site was in an area that normally takes about three
hours to reach on foot from the nearest village, Jimenez said. He
said the trek was made more difficult Sunday because the area was
still littered with hot lava and rocks from an eruption of the
volcano last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers on Saturday climbed the nearby Chato mountain
after receiving an emergency signal from the plane that seemed to
be coming from that area. They changed their route Sunday after
rescue planes spotted the wreckage on the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane was manufactured in 1998 and had 792 hours of
flight time, said Sansa spokesman Olman Fonseca.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's crash was apparently the second deadly encounter in
less than a week with the Arenal volcano. A tour guide died on
Thursday from injuries suffered while hiking when the volcano
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old Boston woman and her 8-year-old daughter, who were
hiking with the guide, were flown to a hospital in Texas for
treatment of second- and third-degree burns from the falling lava
and rocks. The volcano has been active since 1968.

Gunmen Kill at Least 17 in Colombia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen killed at least 17 people in two separate
massacres Sunday, one of which officials attributed to right-wing paramilitary
militias. The killings come three days before President Clinton is to visit
Colombia to discuss U.S. anti-narcotics aid to the drug-producing nation. In one
attack, gunmen seized, interrogated and then executed 10 residents of two poor
neighborhoods in the Caribbean coastal town of Cienaga, Magadalena State police
told The Associated Press. Police were investigating whether the attack was
carried out by paramilitary militias or rival left-wing guerrillas. Both groups
are active in the region.

Clinton Highlights AIDS Assistance
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Africans must ''break the silence'' about AIDS or risk
losing hard-fought democratic and economic gains, President Clinton said Sunday
after touring a health center in the Nigerian capital and hearing the stories of
several people living with the disease. AIDS killed 2.8 million people worldwide
last year, and is now the leading cause of death in Africa. The Clinton
administration will spend $9.4 million this year for AIDS and HIV infection
prevention and care in Nigeria, $8.7 million more for polio eradication and $2
million toward prevention of malaria.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- A tentative contract agreement between United Airlines and

work to do on its image. United and its pilots reached a contract agreement
yesterday, ending a four-month dispute that had forced the airline to cancel or
delay thousands of flights. The agreement still must be approved by members of
the pilots union, which could begin voting as early as Oct. 23. For most of this
month, about 192 of United's 2,400 daily flights were canceled each day.

Botched Raid on Islamic Hide-Out Kills 3
</SUBHEAD>

   ASSIRA ASHMALIA, West Bank (AP) -- A botched raid on an Islamic militant
hide-out in this West Bank village ended Sunday with three Israeli soldiers dead
-- all possibly by friendly fire -- and Palestinian officials angry at how
Israel handles threats to peace between the two peoples. The target of the
nighttime raid was Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, a fugitive at the top of Israel's
most-wanted list, blamed for two 1997 bombings that killed at least 21 Israelis.
The raid comes a month after Israeli and Palestinian negotiators broke new
ground at the Camp David summit and just before President Clinton returns to the

TV Tower Fire Traps 4 in Russia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Fire engulfed the Ostankino television tower, the world's
second-tallest freestanding structure, trapping four people in an elevator and
knocking out most TV channels in the Russian capital Monday. Firefighters have
had trouble fighting the fire, which started Sunday about 1,520 feet above
ground, due to the difficulty of hauling chemical fire extinguishers and other
equipment up so many flights of stairs. The tower's spire is narrow at that
point and the cramped quarters hampered movement. The fire has been burning and
TV stations have been out for almost 12 hours.

Gas Prices Rise Slightly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gas prices rose nearly 2 cents per gallon
nationwide in the past two weeks, ending a nine-week decline as Labor Day
weekend approaches, an industry analyst said today. The average price for a
gallon of gasoline climbed to $1.55 per gallon because of the rising cost of
crude oil, said analyst Trilby Lundberg. The 1.87 cent increase comes after more
than two months of declines, in which the average price dropped 18 cents per
gallon due to refiners and marketers maximizing delivery, Lundberg said.

Woods Wins NEC Invitational
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Racing the clock because of a storm delay that suspended
the NEC Invitational final round for nearly three hours tonight, Tiger Woods
took eight holes to get untracked and then cruised to another landslide victory,
this time by 10 strokes. He probably could have won this one in the dark. In a
fitting conclusion, his wedge into the 18th green emerged from the darkness and
dropped 2 feet from the hole. Fans saw a silhouette of the best player in the
world walk down the fairway, and some flicked their lighters like they were at a
rock concert. Even in overwhelming victory, Woods can still put on a show.

<HEADLINE> Woods Versus Garcia Is Prime Time  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- Perhaps the people putting together
Tiger Woods' latest prime-time show should have waited a little
longer to pick his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Bob May and Woods going at it in a real ''Battle of
Bighorn.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what ABC viewers will get Monday night when Woods
returns to prime time after a year of winning almost everything in
the daytime. Instead, he'll face Spain's Sergio Garcia in a
scheduled 18-hole made-for-television match.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was picked long before May staged his thrilling and
memorable duel with Woods in the PGA Championship. And the mediocre
way Garcia has played this year has done nothing to boost any claim
to a budding rivalry with Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves little at stake at Bighorn Golf Club except some
television ratings and $1.5 million in prize money in an event that
is more packaged entertainment than competition.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and a bit of pride, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to lay down for him, that's for sure,'' said
Woods, who earned $1 million on Sunday with an 11-stroke victory in
the NEC Invitational in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely to match the drama of the PGA, where Woods and
May went head-to-head down the stretch at Valhalla Golf Club. But
it is a chance for viewers to bond again with Woods in a show that
begins at 8 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   It worked last year, when Woods beat David Duval in the
inaugural match, and enough people tuned in to give it a 6.9
national rating and a 12 share. And ABC is hoping it will work
again, although it was CBS that televised the real drama in the PGA
only eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why we're playing -- to get people involved in the
game,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   For what will be 3&AMP;frac12; hours or less work at Bighorn, the winner
will take home $1.1 million, while the loser will have to console
himself with $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   While Duval was competitive last year -- losing 2-and-1 at
Sherwood Country Club -- this year's match at first glance appears
to be more of a mismatch. Garcia has not won this year, and
struggled over the weekend in the Reno-Tahoe Open while Woods was
dominated the far more prestigious NEC Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia got the nod largely because he is also represented by the
IMG sports agency that handles Woods, and because his enthusiastic
play on the course might add a spark missing with the wooden Duval
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young, charismatic,'' Woods said. ''Even though he hasn't
played up to his standards, he's still playing good enough. And in
a match play situation, anything can happen. That's the beauty of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the way Woods has played this year, pairing him with
anyone might be considered a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the final score of the made-for-television event
matters much, anyway. Like the old Shell Wonderful World of Golf
matches, it is merely a showcase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that people like to watch Tiger play and like to watch
Sergio play, too,'' Garcia said. ''It is good for golf and good for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   That might have been different a year ago, when Garcia took
Woods down the stretch in the 1999 PGA Championship before losing
by a shot. At the time, Garcia was widely heralded as Woods' new
rival, though he has done little since to claim that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ''Showdown at Sherwood'' at least paired Woods and
Duval, who was the No. 2 player at the time. It was the first
prime-time golf match and held viewers despite having to fill time
between shots with taped interviews and information about the Met
Life blimp.
</P>
<P>
   The first two holes of Monday's match will be taped before the
show actually goes live, and lights have been set up on the
finishing holes in case the match goes the distance under darkening
desert skies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, plans are to have live microphones on the
players, although Woods doesn't usually engage in much idle
chitchat in any competition.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks Cut Peterson, 14 Others  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Kicker Todd Peterson was among 15 players
released by the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a six-year NFL veteran who was third in the league in
scoring among kickers last season, was released partly for
financial reasons. Kris Heppner, a free-agent from Montana, will
take Peterson's job, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson hit 34 of 40 field goal attempts last season and had
134 points overall. He has made all 181 of his career point-after
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson attempted only two field goals in preseason games -- a
miss from 52 yards and a successful 22-yarder -- while Heppner's
only preseason attempt was good from 28 yards out. Heppner also
twice outdueled Peterson in post-practice contests, during which
both kickers alternated attempts at varying distances.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The nation's second-largest school district
is short 40 principals with just two weeks to go before classes
begins, and the district's new superintendent is calling on retired
administrators to step in.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the top posts remain open at 31 elementary schools and
seven middle and high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School
District.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a principal shortage, and we've had it for two years
in a row,'' Superintendent Roy Romer told Sunday's Los Angeles
Times. ''Half of it is due to retirement. The rest is due to the
fact that principals are moving to central offices because of the
new opportunities and pay increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the shortage stems from a reorganization of the
711,000-student district which created 11 sub-districts and a
number of new administrative posts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our decentralization, we took the opportunity to get new
blood into management, which is a good thing,'' Romer said.
''What's bad, is that it creates a vacancy we need to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools anticipate being without a permanent principal
until October.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said the district is ''putting intensive work'' into
professional development academies and other career training
programs for teachers who want to move into administrative
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Until the positions are filled, interim principals will be
expected to take up the slack by coordinating curriculum and by
developing and launching reform programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Brent, president of the Associated Administrators of Los
Angeles union, said some teachers and parents are concerned about
the responsibilities being placed on unqualified temporary
replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need strong principals in place when schools need them
most,'' Brent said. ''Not people who don't know how to organize a
school, or who are without experience in dealing with parents, or
who are easily intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   California also has struggled to get enough teachers into its
growing schools; it expects to need 300,000 additional teachers
over the next decade alone. In an effort to ease that shortage,
Gov. Gray Davis last month approved more than $2.4 billion in
educational incentives, including higher starting pay and better
benefits, to draw teachers and keep them.

<HEADLINE> Quinney, Driscoll Lead US Amateur  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- It took all day for James Driscoll to
make a couple of putts in his match with Jeff Quinney. Because of
that, the 100th U.S. Amateur had to wait another day to crown a
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Staging a comeback worthy of Tiger Woods, Driscoll won the final
three holes of regulation to force a playoff with Quinney before a
second threat of bad weather suspended play Sunday after 38 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wished we could have finished it tonight,'' Driscoll
said. ''Not because I might have had the momentum, but just to get
it over with tonight would have been better.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinney, of Eugene, Ore., and Driscoll, of Brookline, Mass.,
were to resume the title match at the par-3, 193-yard 3rd hole on
the Upper Course at Baltusrol Golf Club at 9 a.m. Monday. Both
parred it twice Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, whose putter had failed him repeatedly over the first
34 holes of the scheduled 36-hole championship match, made a
sliding 8-footer for birdie at the 17th and then nailed a 5-footer
for par at 18 to win the holes and send the match to extra holes.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old University of Virginia graduate said he never
focused on all his near misses, knowing one more would give Quinney
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of me might have been thinking deep down that I was due
to hole a putt, but as soon as you say that you're not going to
make the putt,'' Driscoll said. ''You have to go through the same
routine and hope it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't finish the job,'' said Quinney, a 21-year-old
who will be a senior at Arizona State. ''You know I bogeyed 16 and
18, missed the fairways. I'm trying to keep my head high. I'm still
in there. This is not over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods rallied from 2-down with three to play to be Steve Scott
in the 1996 Amateur and rallied from 4-down with 10 to play to beat
Trip Kuehne 2-up in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Going to 39 holes guaranteed Quinney and Driscoll will tie the
U.S. Amateur record for the longest title match. Sam Urzetta beat
Frank Stranahan in 39 holes in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Going extra holes was the last thing anyone expected after
Quinney, who had staged impressive comeback wins in the third round
and the quarterfinals, made a short 2-footer for par at the par-3
15th to go 3-up with three to play.
</P>
<P>
   However, Driscoll, turned the tables on him much to the delight
of his family and relatives who shouted ''Way to go James'' after
every big shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never really thought I had blown it because the match was
never over,'' Driscoll said. ''But I was definitely disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A bad drive and chip cost Quinney No. 16, and Driscoll won the
last two holes.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll actually hit two great shots at the par-5 17th, coming
out of a bunker from 50 yards to about 8 feet and making the
birdie. Quinney had already been conceded a par.
</P>
<P>
   For a split second, it appeared Driscoll lost the championship
at the 18th when he blocked his drive right into trees with the
ball coming to rest against a pine cone.
</P>
<P>
   However, Quinney's drive hit a tree limb and came to rest on the
edge of the fairway about 300 yards from the hole. Both reached the
green in three and Driscoll tied the match by making a 5-foot par
putt with ball doing a 360 around the hole before falling in.
</P>
<P>
   Quinney nearly ended the match on the 37th hole when his hot
shot out a greenside bunker hit the pin and stopped inches from the
cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was up tight, pretty much a gimme putt,'' Quinney said. ''I
knew I had to get up and down. It was a tough shot though, one you
probably get up and down five of 10 times. But it came out nicely.
I thought it was going in the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The players showed a lot of sportsmanship at the 38th hole,
conceding short putts so neither would lose on a shot like that.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of lightning had forced a 40-minute suspension
earlier in the round and when the threat returned around 7:14 p.m.,
play was suspended for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Quinney had held the lead from the first hole of the morning
round until being tied at the 36th hole, in large part because
Driscoll missed seven putts from 8 feet or less, including six from
5 feet or less.
</P>
<P>
   When Driscoll missed a 4-footer for birdie at No. 11 and then
bogeyed 14, it seemed Quinney was ready to be crowned the 100th
Amateur champion.
</P>
<P>
   Quinney combined a 2-under round in the morning with Driscoll's
putting woes on the hilly 6,887-yard course to take a 2-up lead.
</P>
<P>
   Quinney's lead reached 4-up after Driscoll bogeyed the first two
holes in the afternoon, missing putts of 8 and 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hole of the match might have been the 8th in the
afternoon. Leading 3-up, Quinney three-putted for a bogey after
conceding Driscoll a 2-foot bogey putt.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 7, Reds 6  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Mike Lowell homered with one out in the bottom of
the ninth inning as the Florida Marlins overcame five RBIs by Dante
Bichette to beat the Cincinnati Reds 7-6 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who had won three straight, blew a 6-3 lead in the
eighth inning a stranded a season-high 14 runners.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell hit his 18th homer on a 3-1 pitch from Danny Graves
(10-5) as Florida snapped a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miceli (6-3) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Florida tied the game with three runs in the eighth inning.
Lowell and Derrek Lee singled, and pinch-hitter Mark Smith followed
with an RBI double. The Marlins made it 6-5 when third baseman
Chris Stynes bobbled Kevin Millar's grounder for an error. Luis
Castillo's grounder deflected off Stynes' glove for a game-tying
single.
</P>
<P>
   It was just Castillo's 10th RBI of the year. He is trying to
avoid the major league record for fewest RBIs in a season for a
player with at least 450 at-bats. San Diego's Enzo Hernandez set
the record with 12 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin left the game after
dislocating the middle finger on his left hand batting in the fifth
inning. X-rays were negative and his status is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette hit a three-run homer, sandwiched between a disputed
ruling and a bench-clearing confrontation, which put Cincinnati
ahead 5-3 in the seventh inning. Bichette also had an RBI single
and a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Dempster took a 3-1 lead into the seventh, but came
unraveled following a disputed call on an attempted forceout at
second base.
</P>
<P>
   Umpire Ian Lamplugh ruled shortstop Andy Fox pulled his foot off
the base prematurely on Ken Griffey Jr.s grounder, although replays
showed otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   After Marlins manager John Boles argued briefly, Sean Casey
singled home a run and Bichette hit his 16th homer, his first in
110 at-bats, to put the Reds ahead 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, Dempster hit Michael Tucker in the back with
a pitch, and both benches emptied when Tucker started toward the
mound and shouted at Dempster. No punches were thrown and no one
was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Preston Wilson made the score 1-1 leading off the
fourth with his 22nd homer. It was his first homer in 36 games and
140 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored twice in the sixth to take a 3-1 lead. After
Henry Rodriguez doubled and Wilson walked, Lee singled home a run
and Mike Redmond hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey Jr. made a circus catch in center in the second inning
to rob Fox of a hit. Sprinting to his right, Griffey jumped and
stretched horizontal to the ground to make the grab.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pokey Reese, who missed the last nine games with a strained
hamstring, entered the lineup in the fifth inning to replace
Larkin. ... Larkin has eight hits in 17 at bats (.471). ... Smith's
double was his 11th pinch-hit this season, tied for third in the
Marlins' record book. ... The two teams combined for five
intentional walks, tying the high in the majors this season. ...
Redmond went 0-for-2 and is in a 1-for-15 slump.

<HEADLINE> World Religious Leaders To Gather  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 1,000 religious leaders gather Monday
at the United Nations for the Millennium World Peace Summit to
discuss solutions to conflicts -- including those that threaten to
divide their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say they hope the summit, which runs through
Thursday, will result in resolutions on peace, poverty and the
environment, as well as the formation of a permanent council of
religious leaders to advise the United Nations on preventing and
settling disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby of The Waldorf-Astoria hotel, where most summit
participants are staying, barefoot monks mingled with white-robed
swamis on Sunday. Inca Indians in wool tunics and tasseled hats
looked in wonder at the processions of veils, caps and turbans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll continue to look for solutions until the peace comes,''
said Eritrean Bishop Zekarias Yohannes, who plans to meet with
Ethiopian leaders during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peace is very dear to us,'' said Kawmar Ohiah Kamaruzaman, a
Muslim professor from Malaysia. ''We can't get it in one sitting.
But if there is any chance we should grab it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the difficulty of achieving any consensus was highlighted
when participants learned earlier this month that conference
organizers had not invited the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan Buddhist
leader and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, to the first two days of the
conference for fear of offending China. The seven-member Chinese
delegation to the summit accused the Dalai Lama last week of
''creating turmoil in Tibet,'' from which he fled in 1959 after an
abortive uprising against China's occupation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, summit general secretary Bawa Jain said an
eight-person delegation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders had been sent
by the Dalai Lama, and that two of them would be speaking in the
General Assembly hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't want it to get into anything political,'' said
Jain, a member of the Jain faith from New Jersey by way of India.
''I've made that clear to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, pro-Tibetan groups said, planned demonstrations
protesting the Dalai Lama's exclusion were still on.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tensions, many participants say that given the
number of conflicts with strong religious components -- from Sierra
Leone to the Balkans -- they wouldn't miss a chance to form
alliances for peace.
</P>
<P>
   An interfaith coalition organized the program and invited
high-ranking religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The delegations from China and Vietnam were the only ones
chosen by their governments,'' said Dena Merriam of the summit
executive council.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders on the program: Cardinal Francis Arinze,
president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interreligious
Dialogue; Cambodian Buddhist leader Samdech Preah Maha Ghosananda;
the Grand Mufti of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric; Israeli Chief Rabbi Meir
Lau; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Evangelist Anne Graham Lotz, the Rev.
Billy Graham's daughter; and numerous indigenous leaders including
Chief Oren Lyons, faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders who declined include Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I,
who sent a videotaped message, and Jerusalem Mufti Ikrema Sabri,
who has refused to meet with Rabbi Lau.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is not an official summit sponsor, which has
received funding from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, Better World
Fund and others. Turner, who once said that Christianity was ''for
losers,'' will give the keynote address.
</P>
<P>
   Still, organizers say the meeting was a response to a call from
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is scheduled to speak
Tuesday. The first two days of the summit will be held in the U.N.
General Assembly chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Even a limited U.N. connection has placed the meeting in the
midst of international political strife.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official advised conference organizers that China would
be outraged by an invitation to the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers invited him only to the last two days of the
conference -- being held at a New York hotel, away from the United
Nations. He declined.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu said the exclusion
''totally undermines the integrity of the United Nations and the
credibility of the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants welcome the opportunity for interreligious dialogue
on a grand scale, but some observers question how much progress can
make in four days.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Divinity School professor David Little said he hopes
religious leaders will discuss subjects they often avoid, such as
their communities' treatment of minorities who have become the
leading victims of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he wants to see leaders make tough political
choices about who will serve on an advisory committee to the United
Nations and their ongoing responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The institutionalization of an advisory committee is
enormously important,'' he said, ''if the summit is not to be seen
as a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''

<HEADLINE> UK Seeks Soldiers' Release in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Efforts to win the release of 11 captive British
soldiers in Sierra Leone have begun, in cooperation with the
government of the ravaged West African country, the British
government said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials said the leader of the British team, which was
captured Friday, had been in contact and had said all were being
fed and well-treated.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in early Monday editions of several newspapers said the
government had sent a special military team to Sierra Leone to
stand by in case they were needed for a rescue. Two police hostage
negotiators reportedly also went along.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry declined to comment on any military
mission. But it said a team of ''varying makeup'' had been sent to
help win the men's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident we can secure their release through
discussion with their captors, and the team was sent in order to
aid that process,'' a spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 soldiers from the Royal Irish Regiment lost contact with
their base on Friday around the towns of Masiaka and Forudugu, 45
miles east of Freetown, force commander Brig. Gordon Hughes said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter search failed to find any trace of them. A later
radio message from the group had indicated they were being held
against their will, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said in London.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have made contact with those who appear to be holding'' the
men, a Defense Ministry spokesman said, but ''discussions are at a
very early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Britain was ''working closely with the government
of Sierra Leone to try to bring this to a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, British force spokesman
Capt. John Price confirmed that ''efforts are still going on to
secure their safe release. Negotiations are going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The British troops were stationed at Benguema, 25 miles east of
Freetown, where British instructors are training Sierra Leonean
army recruits. They were accompanied by a government soldier, who
was acting as their guide and was also believed to have been
captured.
</P>
<P>
   The troops disappeared in an area occupied by a small and
ruthless renegade faction of fighters known as the West Side Boys,
Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Until June, the West Side Boys were part of a fragile
pro-government alliance fighting Sierra Leone's feared
Revolutionary United Front rebels. But the faction fell out with
the authorities after allegedly attacking other pro-government
fighters and carrying out a spree of carjackings, robberies and
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sierra Leone's civil war began in 1991, the rebels have
killed and maimed tens of thousands of people in an attempt to gain
control of the government and the country's lucrative
diamond-mining regions. They have abandoned three peace treaties,
the latest signed July last year.
</P>
<P>
   Britain sent 1,000 soldiers to Freetown when the RUF rebels
restarted the conflict in May. The rebels seized 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and advancing toward the capital. While the troops
ostensibly went to evacuate foreigners and secure the airport,
their presence did much to stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were eventually released and a successful rescue
operation was mounted to free 233 other U.N. troops surrounded in
rebel territory. A ragtag alliance of pro-government forces, backed
by Britain, meanwhile began pushing the rebels away from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   When the British forces withdrew in mid-June, they left behind
soldiers to train Sierra Leone army recruits. Britain has also
donated arms and equipment and sent military advisers.

<HEADLINE> NFL Cuts Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the things that hurt Dan Reeves in Denver and New York
was trying to get involved in personnel decisions as well as
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he released cornerback Michael Booker, his first-ever
draft pick as the Atlanta Falcons' coach and general manager in
1997. Reeves had obtained the pick in a trade with Seattle, which
used it to take another corner, Shawn Springs, who has made the Pro
Bowl twice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely, anybody is tough (to release) when you draft
them,'' Reeves said. ''When you get a high draft choice your
expectations of them and their expectations of themselves are
extremely high.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we made the deal for Ashley Ambrose, it made it extremely
difficult from a salary cap standpoint for Michael unless he played
extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves blamed some of Booker's problems on injuries, but his
fate was apparently sealed when he was beaten last week for a
68-yard touchdown by Jacksonville's Alvis Whitted.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves also cut two of this year's picks, cornerback Anthony
Midget, a fifth-rounder, and wide receiver Mareno Philyaw, taken in
the seventh round. But they were low choices. Booker was taken with
the 11th overall choice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent first-rounder, wide receiver Marcus Nash, was
released after reaching an injury settlement with Baltimore. He
broke his jaw early in training camp and never got much of a look.
</P>
<P>
   Nash was Denver's first-round pick in 1998 after being one of
Peyton Manning's favorite targets at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there were only a few surprises as all 31 NFL teams got
down to the 53-player limit.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City axed 12-year veteran cornerback Cris Dishman, who
was beaten out by Eric Warfield.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman started all 16 games last year in his only season with
the Chiefs, making five interceptions and totaling 84 tackles. With
the Houston Oilers, Washington Redskins and Chiefs, he had 42
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He was beaten out in training camp by Eric Warfield, a
third-year cornerback from Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Cris has had a great career in the NFL, but we're
going in another direction,'' coach Gunther Cunningham said. ''The
ball is in Eric Warfield's court and we'll see what he does with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons traded tight end O.J. Santiago, a key player on
their NFC championship team two years ago, to Dallas for two draft
picks.
</P>
<P>
   Denver sent cornerback Chris Watson, who sparkled on returns as
a rookie last year, to Buffalo for an undisclosed draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland placed tackle Orlando Brown on the physically unable
to perform list. Brown has been unable to play since being hit in
the right eye by a referee's penalty flag in December, and his
career is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Brown cannot practice or play for the first six weeks of the
season. After that time, Brown could remain on the PUP list or be
placed on the non-football injured reserve list.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, who started seven games
last year for New Orleans, was let go by the Saints. That left Jake
Delhomme and Aaron Brooks as the backups to Jeff Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not so much what Billy didn't do as what Jake and Aaron
did do,'' coach Jim Haslett said. ''They're young guys that you
hate to let go. We think they're going to be pretty good players in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year veteran Doug Pederson, who began last season as
Philadelphia's starting quarterback, was released by the Eagles,
leaving Koy Detmer as Donovan McNabb's backup. Pederson or Tolliver
could be headed to Cleveland, where Tim Couch needs a veteran
backup after a season-ending injury to his backup, Koy Detmer's
brother Ty.
</P>
<P>
   Former Notre Dame QB Ron Powlus made the Eagles as the
third-stringer.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle let go of veteran kicker Todd Peterson, who apparently
was beaten out by Kris Heppner.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the cuts reflected lost hopes or fond memories.
</P>
<P>
   New England, desperately seeking a running game, released
veteran back Raymont Harris, who sat out last season with a stress
fracture in his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was so much about him (playing poorly) as the
promise of younger players,'' coach Bill Belichick said, referring
to Kevin Faulk and J.R. Redmond, the Patriots' only remaining
runners. ''It ends abruptly for a lot of these players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also placed offensive tackle Adrian Klemm, their
first-round choice this year, on the physically unable to perform
list, and kept four quarterbacks: Drew Bledsoe, John Friesz,
Michael Bishop and rookie Tom Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina released 11-year veteran Anthony Johnson, who in 10 NFL
seasons had 2,854 yards rushing, 1,120 of them in 1996, when he
filled in for the injured Tshimanga Biakubutuka and helped lead the
second-year Panthers to the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was probably particularly painful because he's meant an
awful lot to the club over the years,'' coach George Seifert said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago released tight end Ryan Wetnight, a seven-year veteran
who had 38 receptions last year. The Bears went with Alonzo Mayes,
a fourth-round pick in 1998; John Allred, a second-round pick in
1997; and rookie Dustin Lyman, a third-round pick this year.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego released Charlie Jones, the team's top receiver two
years ago who suffered a dislocated hip last year and had only 10
catches for 90 yards and nine punt returns for 93 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay hoped Jason Odom would be its starting left tackle,
but he will miss the season after being placed on injured reserve
with a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   The most bizarre episode on cutdown day came in Washington,
where coach Norv Turner reluctantly released former Arena League
running back Chad Dukes. He reclaimed him five hours later when he
realized he had a roster spot because guard Tre Johnson was
suspended for the opening game for running into an official.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told Chad when he left at about 10:30, I was going to do
everything I could to get him back on the team,'' coach Norv Turner
said. ''I didn't know it was going to be at 3:30.''

<HEADLINE> Notes from Sunday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Orioles:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays placed RHP Tanyon Sturtze on the
15-day DL with a strained ribcage muscle. The injury occurred
Saturday. ... His place on the roster was filled by RHP Tony Fiore,
who pitched three scoreless innings Sunday in his major league
debut. ... The Devil Rays went 5-8 on their 13-game road trip. They
also fell farther behind Baltimore in their bid to leave last place
in the AL East for the first time since April 16.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: OF Albert Belle was rested Sunday, ending his string
of 232 straight games. He last sat June 11, 1999. ... SS Melvin
Mora has hit in 21 of 29 games with the Orioles. ... Mike Kinkade
got two hits in his final game before joining the U.S. Olympic
baseball team. ... RHP Mike Trombley worked a perfect eighth inning
and has fanned five of the last six batters he's faced.
Blue Jays-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays are hoping for a lift out of Joey
Hamilton in September as the right-hander comes back from rotator
cuff surgery. Hamilton has allowed seven hits in 12 innings over
his first two starts since coming off the disabled list on Aug. 19,
and the Blue Jays hope he can give staff ace David Wells some help
down the stretch in the wild-card race. ... The rest of the
schedule would seem to bolster Toronto's playoff hopes. Toronto has
17 of its final 29 games at home, and the Blue Jays have won 10 of
their last 14 at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers hoped to have Darren Oliver back in the
rotation in September, but the left-hander's rehab from weakness in
his throwing shoulder has been up and down. Oliver allowed seven
runs and 10 hits over 4 2-3 innings in Saturday night's start for
Double-A Tulsa. Oliver returned to Arlington on Sunday and his
status will be evaluated over the next few days. Oliver has been on
the disabled list since Aug. 1 and his last victory was May 31. ...
Injured C Ivan Rodriguez had a smaller cast placed on his broken
right thumb and is currently in his native Puerto Rico visiting
relatives. He will return to Arlington on Wednesday to have team
medical personnel check on how well the thumb is healing.
Red Sox-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox failed to win the 2000 season series against
Kansas City after dominating the Royals the previous two years. In
1998 and '99 the Red Sox went 16-5 against KC. ... SS Nomar
Garciaparra's three hits Saturday night made him the third player
in Red Sox history to record 50 multihit games in four consecutive
seasons. The others were Ted Williams and Wade Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals have begun hyping OF Mark Quinn for AL
rookie of the year. An 11th-round choice in the June 1995 draft,
Quinn ranks among rookie leaders in home runs, average, doubles,
extra-base hits, total bases and outfield assists. The team came
under media criticism for not trying to make Quinn's case. ...
After starting the year 2-11 on the road, the Royals have gone
27-27 away from home.
Tigers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Todd Jones blew his third save this season in 39
chances Sunday. ... Starter Dave Mlicki pitched in a rehab
assignment Sunday at Class-A West Michigan. Mlicki is recovering
from a severe sinus infection, which required surgery. ... The
Tigers are attempting to become the first team since the 1996 Red
Sox to finish above .500 after being 14 games under at one point in
the season. ... With four games left in August, the Tigers have
ensured themselves of their third straight winning month. The last
time Detroit had winning records in three straight months was in
1988. ... Detroit pitchers issued 10 walks Sunday. Nelson Cruz
walked four in 2 1-3 innings, after walking just six in 33 previous
innings this year.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Minnesota evened its record against Detroit at the
Metrodome at 56-56. ... OF Matt Lawton, who hit leadoff Sunday,
batted third in 121 of 122 previous games he started. He batted
sixth once.
Yankees-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: OF Paul O'Neill was not in the lineup because of his
sore right hip pointer. He has missed four games, and could miss
the Seattle series as well. ... RHP Ramiro Mendoza will throw from
the mound Monday or Tuesday. Mendoza has been on the 15-day DL
since July 30 with tendinitis in his right shoulder. ... 2B Chuck
Knoblauch, who was hit by a pitch on his left knee in a minor
league rehab assignment Friday, will get a couple more days off,
then get sent to Triple-A Columbus to continue his rehab. ... Torre
responded to a published report that he was on the critical list to
return as manager next season by saying ''I may retire, or I may
not retire. Let's see what they print about that. I haven't said
anything and I don't know where they get that stuff.'' Torre said
he has made no plans either way. ''I don't feel any different than
I did at this time last year,'' he said. ''I'm very content. My
wife wants me to retire right now, but she won't force me, and I
still have that fire in my belly. When it stops being fun, that's
when I'll stop.''
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi got the day off Sunday and will try to
get an MRI done on his sore left shoulder either Monday or Tuesday.
''He's a little sore, so we're going to be on the safe side,'' A's
manager Art Howe said. A's trainer Larry Davis said the MRI wasn't
critical and that it would be done ''if there was time. The results
would help us manage his injury on a daily basis.'' ... RHP Jon
Ratliff was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento and will pitch out of
the bullpen. Ratliff has pitched eight years in the minors, in the
Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves' organizations before signing as a
free agent with the A's this year. ''With Omar (Olivares) going so
long yesterday, we needed somebody who could give us some
innings,'' Howe said. ''He's been one of our most consistent
starters at Sacramento this year.'' Ratliff was 8-3 with a 3.02 ERA
in 17 starts for the Rivercats. He also had one save. ''He was
definitely on our list for September,'' Howe said. ''He's just up a

the game at shortstop and flied out in the ninth. ... RHP Sean Lowe

Jackson's 1982 team record of 156 strikeouts, and Troy Glaus (131)
might break Bobby Knoop's 1966 record of 144 strikeouts by a
right-handed batter. ... It was business as usual for Troy Percival
when he came off the DL by pitching an inning Saturday night and
giving up a two-run homer to Travis Fryman. Percival is 0-7, with a

''Absolutely not.''

pitched his first complete game of the season Sunday in his third
appearance in a week. He lasted six innings Monday in losing to
Atlanta 7-4, then pitched one-third of an inning a night later in
the 12-inning game in which C Brent Mayne was the winning pitcher.
... 1B Todd Helton went 4-for-10 in the Rockies' three-game sweep
of Pittsburgh. His two-hit game Sunday was his 54th multiple-hit
game this season. Helton said, ''I felt good, I felt like I let it
go. The past few days, I've been so conscious of not swinging at
bad pitches, but I just decided to let it go and see what happens.
I got here by being aggressive and it felt good.'' ... The Rockies
have won six of eight and are two games over .500 for the first
time since July 19.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pirates pitchers retired the side in order only once
in Sunday's 9-2 loss to Colorado and have done so only five times
in 52 innings. They have had a 1-2-3 inning only twice in 33
innings. ... The Pirates have not won a game in which they led the
entire way since Aug. 5. ... Pirates RHP Kris Benson threw Sunday
as scheduled and will start Tuesday against the Giants. The start
was moved back two days so Benson could rest a tired arm. He is
winless since July 8. ... OF Brian Giles failed to get a hit Sunday
for only the second time in 14 games. ... Of the mounting criticism
of the now last-place Pirates, general manager Cam Bonifay said,
''It's very bothering to me that we've had the type of year we've
had. People want to say negative things about the things that have
happened this year, and they have the right to do so, but the job
of the general manager is to stay positive and focused.''

the Mets catcher in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Mike Hampton, one of baseball's best-hitting pitchers,
took it easy at the plate in his first game since being sidelined
by a cracked rib. Hampton skipped batting practice, then bunted
foul for strike three his first time up. He hit a routine fly ball
in his other at-bat. ''I didn't swing hard. I'm not going to
overswing the rest of the year,'' he said. Hampton, who throws
lefty but bats righty, is 17-for-60 (.283) this season. ''I think
I'll just try to hit it to the right side from now on,'' he said.
... The Mets have won 17 of their last 21 games at Shea Stadium.

Estes (12-4, 4.10) is 10-2 with a 3.89 ERA over his last 17 starts.
... RF Ellis Burks wasn't in the starting lineup Sunday. His .350
batting average would rank fourth in the NL, but he doesn't have

lead has been 3 1-2 games.

in 24 of 26 games since he joined Philadelphia.
Cardinals-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: C Carlos Hernandez sustained a freak back injury
while hitting in the fifth inning. After taking ball four,
Hernandez took a step toward first base but suddenly pulled up, in
obvious pain from a lower back sprain. He walked gingerly off the
field, assisted by a trainer and coach, and was sent back to St.
Louis to get checked by team doctors. ''It might be something that
keeps him out for a while,'' manager Tony La Russa said. ...
Catcher Keith McDonald, playing at Triple-A Memphis, was told to
meet the team in Florida for Monday night's game against the
Marlins in case Hernandez is put on the disabled list. Eli Marrero,
doing an injury rehab assignment at Memphis after tearing a
ligament in his left thumb, should be ready to rejoin the team by
next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: CF Andruw Jones finally got a day off to rest his sore
right hamstring, ending a streak of 301 consecutive games. That was
the second-longest active streak in the majors behind Sammy Sosa's
368. Until Sunday, Jones was the only major leaguer to play every
inning of every game this season. He had not missed a game since
Sept. 15, 1998. Despite the nagging pain, he was in the midst of an
eight-game hitting streak (16-for-40). ... RHP John Burkett, who
didn't get a decision after leaving with a 2-1 lead, was going for
his ninth win, which would have matched his total from each of the
last three seasons. His last time with double-figure victories was
1996, when he posted an 11-12 record with Florida and Texas. ...
Manager Bobby Cox remains tied with Tommy Lasorda at 1,599
victories, 14th-most in baseball history.
Padres-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Trevor Hoffman picked up his 263rd career save out of
301 chances Sunday, tops on the career list of save percentages at
.874. ... RHP Woody Williams is 13-5 since Sept. 3, 1999. ... San
Diego is 15-6 on Sundays. The only other day the Padres have a
winning record is Thursdays (7-5). ... 3B Phil Nevin has reached
base safely via a hit or walk 47 consecutive games since July 3. He
is six games shy of tying Shawn Green's major league-best 53-game
streak earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: John Snyder's 1-2-3 first inning was rare. Entering
Sunday's game, he posted a 10.06 ERA in the first inning of 17
starts this season. ... Snyder retired the first 10 batters he
faced and did not allow a hit until Nevin's single in the fourth.
... Snyder had not won since June 22.

<HEADLINE> Palestininan Hopes to Clear Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- An Egyptian-born Palestinian prisoner
who will testify in the Lockerbie bombing trial said in a
television interview broadcast Sunday that he has no information
about the attack and hopes to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Abu Talb, who is serving a life sentence for bombing
American and Jewish targets in Europe, was an early suspect in the
investigations into the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight
103. The attack killed 270 people over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've suffered a lot, and my family has suffered a lot because
of this, so I feel I have to go and tell the world that I'm
innocent, I have nothing to do with this,'' he said in an interview
with Swedish television's TV4 news from a maximum-security prison
just south of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The report said police will have to charter an aircraft to take
Abu Talb to the Netherlands, since no commercial airliner is
willing to fly him.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the two Libyan defendants in the Lockerbie trial,
which began on May 3 in the Netherlands, have indicated they would
try to implicate Abu Talb and nine other suspects. They hope to
cast enough doubt on the prosecution's case to win a dismissal. The
prosecution countered by calling him as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Talb, who came to Sweden in 1983, said he has no information
to offer when he testifies on Sept. 7 except to proclaim his
innocence. But, he said, he fears for the safety of his wife and
three children because unspecified terrorist groups may think he
gave information to prosecutors after they called him as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think I have squealed, that I know something I don't
know,'' he said, according to a transcript of the interview
provided to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Talb, who was convicted of terrorism by a Swedish court in
1989, was linked to the Lockerbie bombing after he was sighted in
Malta in the weeks before the bombing and Swedish police found a
diary in his apartment with the date Dec. 21 circled.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb detonated 38 minutes after the New York-bound plane's
takeoff from London's Heathrow airport. The plane started its
journey in Malta, where the defendants worked in the Libyan Arab
Airlines offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyan defendants, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, have pleaded innocent. They blame Palestinian
terrorists operating in Germany at the time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being conducted by a special Scottish court sitting
at Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air base about 50 miles east of The
Hague.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Opposition Leaders Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Police have released five leaders of Yemen's
largest opposition group after detaining them briefly on charges of
meeting without a permit, police and party officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist party leaders were released Saturday, a few hours
after police detained them. They had been meeting in the southern
city of Aden to prepare for a national convention scheduled for the
capital, San'a, on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   A Socialist party official said the detentions were aimed at
obstructing the convention. But a government official denied the
accusation, saying Yemeni authorities have supported the party
financially.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist party has often accused the government of
undemocratic practices. It boycotted last year's presidential
elections.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Aliens Riot in Australia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Illegal immigrants angry that their
applications to stay in Australia were refused rampaged through a
detention center, torching buildings and throwing rocks at staff,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 80 immigrants were involved in the rioting. The unrest
started Saturday and continued into Monday at Woomera detention
center, a former rocket testing range in the Australian Outback,
800 miles west of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''One canister of tear gas was used to quell a group of people
who were intent on stoning buildings, throwing rocks and implements
at the staff of the center,'' Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruddock said fences at the detention center had been breached,
and the refugees were using pickets from the fences as weapons.
Extra staff members were sent early Monday to help contain the
violence. No illegal immigrants escaped, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was reported injured in the unrest, which saw the rioters
set fire to two recreational buildings, a dining room and a washing
area, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The center houses about 800 illegal immigrants, many of them
from Mideast countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan. Ruddock
said most of those involved in the riot have had their applications
to stay in Australia as refugees refused.
</P>
<P>
   In June, about 500 detainees staged a mass breakout to protest
conditions at the camp.

<HEADLINE> Hopson Gets Cut by The 49ers  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A little more than a week after he had
emergency gall bladder surgery on a team trip to Seattle, the San
Francisco 49ers waived guard Tyrone Hopson.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson was one of 13 players cut by the 49ers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hopson felt ill at the team meal before the Seahawks game on
Aug. 19, and was taken to a local hospital, where gall stones were
discovered. Last week, he said he thought he would be out for about
a month.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers apparently decided that was too long to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel he may have a fairly lengthy recovery period,'' 49ers
coach Steve Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no big names or real surprises among the others cut
Sunday. They were tight end Shonn Bell, defensive tackle William
Carr, wide receiver Dwight Carter, linebacker Jim Emanuel, wide
receiver Chafie Fields, tackle Dan Goodspeed, safety Ronnie Heard,
defensive back Kelly Herndon, safety Marcus Hill, defensive back
Fred White, fullback Joshua White, and injured linebacker Joe
Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also put tight end Terrence Dupree on injured reserve.
Defensive tackle Jason Tenner was placed on the reserved-left squad
list.
</P>
<P>
   The list was more notable for who the 49ers kept. The team will
carry four quarterbacks, led by starter Jeff Garcia, then Rick
Mirer and draft picks Tim Rattay and Gio Carmazzi.
</P>
<P>
   Carmazzi, the team's third-round pick out of Hofstra, was hailed
as San Francisco's quarterback of the future. But he has been
disappointing in the preseason and slow to pick up the 49ers'
system. Seventh-round pick Rattay, out of Louisiana Tech, has fared
better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 49ers kept all 11 of their draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers kept just two tight ends, starter Greg Clark, who has
been nursing a calf injury, and second-year man Justin Swift. That
was to make room for six running backs and the extra quarterback,
Mariucci explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a little heavy, as you know, at quarterback and running
back, which means you have to go short in another area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the running backs, the 49ers retained rookies Paul Smith,
a fifth-round pick who also has been hobbled by a calf injury, and
rookie free agent Jonas Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a perfect world we don't have to play them this season''
because starter Charlie Garner will handle the job, Mariucci said.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks' Durazo in Car Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Erubiel Durazo
sustained minor injuries during a three-car crash Sunday that
seriously injured another driver.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, 26, was driving a Nissan Xterra sport utility vehicle
southbound on 7th Street at Buckeye Road when he became involved in
the crash with a Toyota Corolla and a Cadillac Cimarron.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police were investigating to determine the cause of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   During the crash, the Xterra rolled onto the passenger side.
Durazo and his mother, Maria Durazo, were taken to Good Samaritan
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Fire Department Capt. Doug Mummert said Durazo had minor
injuries and did not appear to aggravate the wrist injury that has
kept him out of the Diamondbacks lineup recently. Durazo was
wearing a cast on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Durazo had cuts and bruises on her hands, but they did not
appear serious, Mummert said. A third passenger in the Xterra was
not injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the Toyota, 22-year-old Margarita Estrada, was
taken to Good Samaritan where she was listed in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the Cadillac was not hurt.

<HEADLINE> BCA Classic postponed by lightning  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Michael Vick's run at the Heisman Trophy
will have to wait a week.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's Georgia Tech-Virginia Tech game was postponed by
game and school officials after severe thunderstorms and lightning
rolled into the area just as the teams were lined up for the
opening kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting about an hour as thunder rumbled in, lightning
bolts lit up the sky and heavy rain pelted Lane Stadium, Virginia
Tech athletic director Jim Weaver announced the postponement at
9:08 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is another round of storms more severe than the first
one, so the game is postponed,'' Weaver said. ''We will talk about
the possibility of rescheduling, of maybe playing the first weekend
in December.''
</P>
<P>
   With the field soaked and puddles forming near the sidelines,
Weaver said he did not want to risk injuries. Vick, the Hokies'
sensational quarterback who led the team to the national title game
in 1999, will now make his much anticipated sophomore debut
Saturday against Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech athletic director David Braine, Weaver, referee Dan
Blum and game organizers met during the storm and decided against
trying to play the game Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both teams play next Saturday and that field is not going to
be playable,'' Weaver said.
</P>
<P>
   While Weaver hopes to eventually play the game, Braine isn't so
sure, especially about the December date. The Yellow Jackets play
rival Georgia on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a good idea. Our reasons for playing a
preseason game were because we had an inexperienced quarterback,''
Braine said. ''He will have 11 games by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Braine said teams won't get the $600,000 they were promised if
the game isn't played, but added: ''We didn't play this game for
money anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the schools would have to petition the NCAA to play
on a Friday because that is the night high schools play their
games.
</P>
<P>
   The decision whether or not to play could have national title
implications. The Hokies were ranked No. 11 in the AP preseason
poll, while the Yellow Jackets return 18 starters from last year's
8-4 squad. George Godsey, who steps in for the departed Joe
Hamilton at quarterback, had his debut as the new starter delayed a
week. The Yellow Jackets play Central Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the UCLA at Miami game was postponed on Sept. 26
because of the threat of Hurricane Georges and rescheduled for Dec.
5. When the Bruins came to Miami they were 10-0 and bidding for a
berth in the national title game at the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Miami won 49-45 and denied UCLA of a perfect regular season and
probable matchup against Tennessee in the Bowl Championship Series'
title game.
</P>
<P>
   When the storm hit Sunday night, players, officials and
photographers dashed off the field and headed for shelter. The
Yellow Jackets stood under a tent and makeshift garage, the Hokies
in a small tunnel. Both teams eventually ran across the field to
the tunnel leading to the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 p.m., and with the rain intensifying, most of the crowd of
55,000 had taken shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Smith, Virginia Tech's sports information director, has
been with the school for 26 years and said he couldn't recall a
home game being delayed by lightning or postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The last I-A game postponed was the UCLA-Miami game.
</P>
<P>
   The last I-A game delayed by lightning was BYU at New Mexico on
Oct. 17, 1999. The game was delayed at the start of the second half
for 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really looking forward to playing this game,'' Georgia
Tech coach George O'Leary said. ''We had been called off the field
for lightning before, but we had always been called back.''

<HEADLINE> John Paul Praises Youth Visitors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II basked Sunday in the
success of the church's latest World Youth Day, lauding the
''joyous and peaceful'' young pilgrims who took part.
</P>
<P>
   The six-day gathering peaked Aug. 19-20. An estimated 2 million
pilgrims camped out overnight outside Rome to pray and celebrate
Mass with John Paul -- one of Europe's biggest youth assemblies
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their great numbers made a vivid impression on all,'' John
Paul said Sunday, speaking to faithful gathered in the courtyard of
his summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joyous, peaceful young people, ready to smile and say hello,
respectful of the city and of nature,'' the pope said. For the
pilgrims, he said, the event was ''only the first step in the path
that must be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The young people for a time matched -- or outnumbered -- the
vacation-time population of Rome. The city managed the throngs with
few reported problems. The gravest was a subway escalator that
bucked under the weight of young pilgrims, throwing and injuring
several.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul started the Youth Day tradition in 1984. The largest
gathering was in the Philippines in 1995, when 4 million young
people attended.

<HEADLINE> Russia TV Tower Fire Traps 4 People  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Fire spread relentlessly through the Ostankino
television tower, the world's second-tallest freestanding
structure, and blazed into the early morning Monday as hopes faded
for four people believed trapped in an elevator hundreds of feet
above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which began Sunday afternoon, cut almost all
television service in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12 hours after the blaze broke out in the upper
reaches of the 1,771-foot futuristic tower, flames and smoke had
spread down to about 380 feet above the base. Firefighters were
unable to work above that level because of searing heat and heavy
smoke, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths or injuries were reported. But fire department
spokesman Nikolai Sarychev said Sunday night that three
firefighters and an elevator operator were believed to be trapped
in a lift that was stuck at about 860 feet -- far higher than the
level where work reportedly was stopped on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The ITAR-Tass news agency also reported that several government
workers at the tower had not been heard from since the fire
started.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old tower in Moscow's north -- a futuristic needle on
a flaring base that resembles the flames of a launching rocket --
was a source of pride for many in the shabby city. Only the CN
tower in Toronto, Canada, is taller among the world's free-standing
structures.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian tower's great height also made it
extraordinarily trying for firefighters, who had to climb dozens of
flights of stairs while weighed down with heavy protective clothing
and hauling extinguishers and other gear. Into the night, dozens of
tired, smoke-stained firefighters in heavy rubber coats sat on the
grass around the tower.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, but initial
reports said it apparently was started by a short-circuit in
equipment belonging to a paging company.
</P>
<P>
   When the blaze broke out about 3:30 p.m. Sunday, visitors to the
popular Russian tourist attraction were evacuated from the
observation deck and restaurant that perch about two-thirds of the
way up the tower.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started well above that level but spread to the
restaurant and below as well as farther up the tower's spire.
Yellow flames licked out and smoke billowed from much of the tower,
which looms over a large park area.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people thronged to the base of the tower, gathering
in a carnival atmosphere, drinking beer, laughing and a few dancing
to transistor radios. But the crowds were later pushed back by
police, and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was quoted by the news agency
Interfax as saying civilians would be cleared from a 1,600-foot
radius around the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns were rising that the intense heat of the long-lasting
fire could cause structural weaknesses in the tower. Luzhkov,
though, was quoted as saying the danger of it falling ''practically
does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire came on the heels of the sinking of the nuclear
submarine Kursk with 118 men aboard, underlining the chain of
disasters that have wracked Russia in recent years as its
infrastructure crumbles due to lack of money. It also follows this
month's bombing of a busy underground passage in Moscow that killed
12 people.
</P>
<P>
   The fire caused most television service to the capital and its
surrounding region to go off the air, including the three major
channels, NTV, RTR and ORT, and several smaller channels. NTV later
was able to broadcast its news programs via a UHF channel
unaffected by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of other parts of the country reported they were
receiving all channels as usual. It was not clear how long channels
might be off the air or whether sufficient backup equipment was
available.
</P>
<P>
   The tower also contains circuitry for law-enforcement agencies
and emergency services, news reports said. The extent of damage to
those circuits was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin held consultations late Sunday with
Communications Minister Leonid Reiman on restoring broadcasting and
ensuring communications for emergency services, news agencies
reported.

<P>
   BODRUM, Turkey (AP) -- The coast guard searched Sunday for 17
missing illegal immigrants feared drowned after their boat capsized
during an attempt to reach Greece. Eight other dead bodies already
had been recovered, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A passenger swam ashore Saturday, hours after the ship went
down. That brought to seven the known survivors of the shipwreck,
which took place off the Greek island of Kos in the Aegean sea,
Turkish navy Sgt. Avni Cindik said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was en route from Turkey to Greece with 31 illegal
immigrants -- 18 Iraqis, eight Iranians and five Afghanis -- plus the
captain when it sank. The two-day-old search was concentrated along
the Turkish shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't expect to find anyone in open seas,'' Cindik said.
''Their bodies should be washed ashore by now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police arrested three Turkish smugglers who allegedly
organized the trip. The captain, who is expected to face criminal
charges, said smugglers had offered him $1,000 for each person he
smuggled into Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East and Asia
cross illegally from Turkey to Greece each year on the way to

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A main bridge in southern Taiwan collapsed
Sunday, sending drivers and passengers fleeing their cars and
racing to safety as chunks of concrete dropped into the water
below.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed, but 22 people were taken to hospitals after
330 feet of the Kaohsiung-Pingtung bridge collapsed. The injured
were in stable condition with sprains and cuts, firefighters and
paramedics said.
</P>
<P>
   No cars were found in the river after four hours of searching
with divers, boats and a helicopter, said Lee Ching-pin, a fire
official from Pingtung.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described a rumbling sound as the four-lane bridge
broke and concrete fell into the river. Cars crashed against the
railings and more than a dozen hung precariously on the tilting
span.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was under investigation. President
Chen Shui-bian ordered authorities to determine whether shoddy
construction was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second-largest city, is about 120 miles
south of the capital, Taipei. The 1.2-mile bridge is the main
thoroughfare into Kaohsiung from neighboring Pingtung county.
</P>
<P>
   Public works and infrastructure in Taiwan have come under fire
since a massive earthquake last year that killed about 2,400
people. The earthquake revealed many buildings to have been
constructed with shoddy materials.

   The Commonwealth, an association comprising Britain and its
former colonies, suspended Pakistan's membership after the Oct. 12
military coup that ousted the government of Nawaz Sharif. Since
then, it has been pressing the military to hold early elections.
</P>
<P>
   But military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf says elections will be
held in line with a Supreme Court deadline of three years, not
before. In the meantime, Musharraf says, his government will try to
revive the economy, weed out the corrupt and impose electoral
reforms that will allow for free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   There is little pressure from Pakistanis for elections in a
country where the army has ruled for 25 years of its 53-year
history.

   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Darrin Fletcher hit three homers and
Steve Trachsel pitched six strong innings as the Toronto Blue Jays
beat the Texas Rangers 6-4 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel (7-11) won for the first time since June 27, allowing
three runs and six hits. He struck out four and walked two,
snapping a personal four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz Jr. and Shannon Stewart also homered, giving the Blue
Jays a major league-leading 214 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his 31st save as the Blue Jays
won for the fifth time in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher had solo homers in the second, fourth and eighth,
giving him 16 for the season and his first career three-homer game.
It also marked the eighth time a Toronto player has homered three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 1-0 lead in the first on Gabe Kapler's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's first homer tied it, and Stewart's solo shot in the
third gave the Blue Jays the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto made it 4-1 in the fourth on Fletcher's second homer and
Stewart's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro's 33rd homer of the season, a two-run shot in
the fifth narrowed Toronto's lead to 4-3. It was Palmeiro's 394th
homer, moving him within two of Joe Carter for 34th place all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher and Cruz hit consecutive homers in the eight to
increase Toronto's lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Helling (14-9) allowed six runs, 12 hits -- including all
five homers -- over 7 1-3 innings. He struck out five and walked
three.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Martinez had three hits for the Rangers, and Ricky Ledee's
RBI single in the eighth closed the scoring.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmeiro reached 100 RBIs for the sixth consecutive season.
Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa are the only major league players with at
least 30 homers and 100 RBIs in each of the last six seasons. ...
Martinez stretched his hitting streak to 17 games. ... Helling had
won seven of his previous eight decisions. ... The five homers
allowed by Helling tied the most allowed in a game by a Texas
pitcher. Charlie Hough gave up five homers in a game in 1989. ...
The Blue Jays have 10 or more hits in 17 of their last 22 games.
... Toronto had 212 homers last season. The club record is 221 set
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lizard Fossil Sells Big at Auction  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A 200 million-year-old fossil of a winged
lizard sold for $167,000 Sunday in the same controversial auction
that put a silver handle from Apollo 11 in the hands of an unknown
bidder for $34,500.
</P>
<P>
   Both items are considered one of a kind, and their auction
angered experts in both fields.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is investigating whether the spacecraft's handle should
have reached Butterfields' auction block at all. And
paleontologists concerned about the commercialization of important
finds were angry that the fossil was sold rather than preserved in
a museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil, a 7-inch lizard with a 10-inch wingspan called
Icarosaurus siefkeri, is the oldest airborne vertebrate known to
scientists. The fossil proved to scientists that vertebrates
attempted flight 10 million years earlier than anyone had
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   It had been studied for more than 30 years at the American
Museum of Natural History, and there was hope Sunday that it would
be returned. The unidentified man who purchased it Sunday called
himself a friend of the museum who wished to see it back in the
museum's care.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Siekfer discovered the fossil when he was 17 years old,
but now in failing health at 56, he decide to sell it for the quick
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goodwin, a vertebrate paleontologist and principal
scientist at the Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, called the
sale of the fossil a ''highly unethical event that will only
increase commercialization and encourage the theft of fossils from
museums.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apollo 11 handle had been fixed to the outside of the
command module that guided astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin
and Michael Collins into the moon's orbit in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   It was sold by Charles Barnes, a former radiation safety officer
at NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center who performed tests on it in
the 1970s. Barnes kept the handle in a safe after leaving NASA and
performed periodic tests on it for the administration to test for
radiation leakage.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Inspector General for NASA announced earlier this
month that it would investigate plans by Butterfields to sell a 18
1/2 inch long silver handle. By the time the auction took place a
deal of sorts had been struck.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the NASA inquiry is continuing there is an additional
conditional of sale that should NASA decide that the item should be
returned to them, we will certainly return funds to the buyer,''
said Butterfields spokesman Levi Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Other items sold at the simultaneous natural history and science
auctions from Butterfields' San Francisco and Los Angeles offices
included a six-inch iron meteorite which brought $51,750 and a
five-million-year-old giant saber-toothed tiger skull which sold
for $31,625.

<HEADLINE> Six Hurt in Spanish Bull Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUELLAR, Spain (AP) -- Bulls gored six people Sunday during a
Pamplona-style running of the bulls event billed as Spain's oldest.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,000 people made the dash with six fighting bulls
through the streets of this central Spanish town, from a corral to
a bullring where the animals were to face matadors and death. None
of those injured by the bulls died.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar, 70 miles north of Madrid, says its run is now in its
501st year, making it Spain's oldest. City hall cites a 1499
ordinance that officially established the run.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it older than the more famous run in Pamplona, where
locals say people have been running with the bulls in the San
Fermin Festival, held every July, for a couple hundred years.
