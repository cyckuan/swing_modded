<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Economy Expected to improve, Says Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Premier Rajko
Kasagic said today there will be a full swing of economy in the
Serb state nd economic cooperation with European partners.
</P>
<P>
"A full swing of economy in Republika Srpska can be expected
soon, so could be the resumption of its economic ties with
European countries," Kasagic told Serb Radio Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs were ready to set up new firms with partners from
Yugoslavia as well as from other European countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasagic said the sanctions - suspended in mid-February this
year - had drawn back the economy for 20 years, but he believed a
quick economic recovery would take place as the Serb state has
great natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"Republika Srpska is very rich in forests and it can obtain
about 3.5 million cubic meters of roundwood per year, which would
enable the Serb timber industry to get back on its feet," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb state, with 600,000 hectares of arable land, can feed
a 3-million population, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Following the suspension of sanctions, many foreign
delegations, including those from Romania, Bulgaria, Greece,
Italy, Canada and Sweden, have visited Republika Srpska and showed
interest in cooperation in the fields of tourism, metal, leather
and wood-processing industries and in agriculture, Kasagic said.

<HEADLINE> Interior Minister: Hijacker Psychologically Deranged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan
el-Alfy has said that the man who led the operation of hijacking
an Egyptian plane to Libya Wednesday is psychologically deranged
and an addict of narcotics and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Mahmoud Hamid, believed to have been the mastermind of
the crime, his son and nephew commandeered an Airbus A320 of
EgyptAir, Egypt's national carrier, to Libya late Wednesday
afternoon and surrendered to the Libyan authorities five hours
later.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Egypt's leading newspaper Al-Ahram
today, Alfy said preliminary results of investigations did not
specify any definite motives of the three hijackers.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that he believed the hijacking was
carried out in a "very primitive manner" and the hijackers were
not armed.
</P>
<P>
His statements ran counter to earlier reports which said that
one of the hijackers threatened the pilot with two Molotov
cocktails and a bag of gun powder.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Bayoumi, head of the security section at EgyptAir, told
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency today that Hamid was high
because of taking a dose of drugs right before he boarded the
plane in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he does not think that the hijackers had any
political, material or psychological motives by committing the
crime.
</P>
<P>
Alfy said in the interview to Al-Ahram that Egypt is following
closely investigations being conducted by the Libyan authorities
on the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt will ask Libya to extradite the hijackers, who
claimed Wednesday that they wanted to present a "message from God"
to Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and U.S. President Bill Clinton demanding a lifting of the Israeli
closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The hijacked plane had been en route from the Saudi port city
of Jeddah to Cairo with a stopover in Luxor, a city famous for
Pharaonic temples. The plane and its passengers returned to Cairo
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Parliament Condemns Deportation of Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Lower House of Parliament
today strongly condemned Israel's deportation policy, stressing
the right of Palestinians to live in a dignified and free life on
their national soil.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, the Lower House said the
Palestinians must live freely and be protected from oppressive
measures, such as deportation and other similar practices on the
pretext of Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
The statement said such an oppressive act at the time being
would ignite the hatred of the Palestinians, add to their
frustration, and end up with more violence as well as causing
other negative effects.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House called on the Arab countries to exert their
utmost efforts in conjunction with concerted international parties
to put an end to Israeli oppressive measures against the
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
Jordan earlier this week asked Israel to lift its closure on the
Palestinian self-rule areas, which was imposed late last month
following a wave of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli government said it will end its siege over
the Palestinian territories only after the PNA takes control of
the two militant groups which claimed responsibility of the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv reiterated that the closure is not a long-term
policy, but rather a necessary step toward protecting its people
under the current circumstance.

<HEADLINE> Two Civilians Killed in Israeli Bombardments in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Two southern Lebanese villagers
were killed and a third was wounded by Israeli bombardments this
evening, reported security sources.
</P>
<P>
The two civilians, Ali Jafer, 23, and Fouad Qazni, 18, were
killed when a house at the village of Yater in Bint Jbail area was
hit by an Israeli artillery shell.
</P>
<P>
The two victims were preparing a water tank in the house when
it was destroyed by the shell, the security sources noted, and a
third person was also injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also shelled a number of other southern
Lebanese villages, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Moslem guerrillas launched attacks this morning at two
positions of the Israeli client militia in the Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, but no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Amal movement claimed responsibility for the
attacks in which the guerrillas used machineguns and rockets,
according to a statement issued by the group.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah Hassan
Nasrallah described the killing of the civilians at Yater by the
Israeli forces as "a violation" of a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement
which put an end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in July, 1993, Israel promised
to refrain from bombarding southern Lebanese villages in exchange
for a refrainment of Hezbollah, or Party of God, from firing
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said the killing of the Lebanese villagers "is
unjustified."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Lebanese authority to "stand against this
event or crime and take a full responsibility toward what has
taken place."

<P>
BEIRUT, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz stressed here today the "special importance" of a scheduled
visit of French President Jacqes Chirac to Lebanon, saying that
the visit would contribute in enhancing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that Chirac's visit to Lebanon "bears a special
importance because it proceeds along the lines of France's
support for Lebanon and because it takes place when the Middle
East peace process begins to face difficulties."
</P>
<P>
He also noted France's concern on a stablization in Lebanon and
a return of this country's sovereignty to all its territories.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that during Chirac's three-day visit in
Lebanon, the two countries will sign two agreements on
cooperations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also described the current
situation of the Middle East peace process as "paralyzed,"
predicting that no progress would be achieved before the Israeli
elections, which is to be held on May 29.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to announce its commitment to a withdrawal
from the Lebanese occupied lands in the South in order to pave the
way for a resumption of talks between military experts of the two
countries on an agenda of the pullout.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacqes Chirac is due to arrive in Beirut on
April 4. He will hold talks with his Lebanese counterpart Elias
Hrawi and other politician and religious leaders, and will deliver
a speech in Lebanon's 128-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Egypt on April 6 to continue his tour,
Chirac is also expected to go to south Lebanon to inspect a
French contingent operating within the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Mayor Unveils Capital Shopping List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Mayor Li Qiyan has
unveiled a program of key projects that will get underway in
China's capital in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
New roads, a subway extension and half of the city enjoying
central heating, are included in the plans.
</P>
<P>
The Mayor said infrastructure construction work would be
given top priority during 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the city will launch a number of projects closely
related to local economy and people's lives, involving basic
facilities such as the water supplies, power, natural gas, heats,
road, telecommunications, ports, disaster reduction, and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
In a report delivered by the the mayor to an ongoing local
People's Congress meeting, Li said that by 2000, Beijing plans to
increase its capacity of water, power, natural gas supplies by
600,000 cubic meters, 2.8 million kilowatts, and nearly one
billion cubic meters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the plans will bring Beijing's annual
capacity of power supply to seven million kilowatts by 2000, the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that central heating will cover about half of the city.
</P>
<P>
During the five-year period, Beijing will start work on roads
totaling 120 km, including the fourth ring road, and major roads
radiating from downtown, and renovation of some existing roads.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,200 km will be built in suburban areas of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Fuxingmen-Bawangfen subway project will be completed during
the five-year period, increasing the subway line by 11 km.
</P>
<P>
Li said the capacity of city's telephone switchboards
will be increased to five million lines by 2000, from 1.5 million
lines last year, or just 336,000 lines in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The increase means telephones will be available to 55 percent
of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said Beijing has completed roads totaling 120 km over
the past five years, including the renovation of the second and
third ring roads, and the Beijing-Shijiazhuang expressway.

<P>
PYONGYANG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A three-nation mission today
completed a five-day investigation tour of the proposed site of
the light-water nuclear reactors in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
During the tour, the mission headed by Stephen Bosworth, an
executive director of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO), conducted investigations in Komho, South
Hamgyong Province, where light-water reactors will be built.
</P>
<P>
The mission also held talks with DPRK officials on technical
problems concerning the construction of light-water reactors, the
Korean Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
KEDO was established by the United States, Japan and South
Korea in New York on March 9, 1995 to implement the 1994 U.S.-DPRK
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, DPRK agreed to freeze its nuclear plan on
condition that the U.S. would help build light-water reactors to
replace the existing heavy-water reactors. The West claims the
latter type of reactors can produce weapons-capable materials.
</P>
<P>
Before the first light-water reactor, the U.S. will provide oil
as an alternative energy.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: No Full Withdrawal of Russian Troops From Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Just a day before unveiling his
Chechnya peace plan, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stressed
today that there would be no full withdrawal of Russian troops
from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the headquarters of the Moscow
District of Interior Troops at the end of a ceremony, Yeltsin
said, "To demand that all troops be withdrawn from Chechnya is not
a way to peace, but a direct road to spreading the war to the
entire Caucasus."
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebels have been demanding a full pullout of Russian
troops from the breakaway republic. Russia sent troops into
Chechnya in December 1994 to fight rebels led by Johar Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin said earlier that he would announce his peace
plan for ending the 15-month Chechen war in a TV address on Sunday
evening. He indicated that the plan includes both political and
military methods.
</P>
<P>
"We shall use force against terrorists, as in any state, in
compliance with the (Russian) Constitution. There will be no mercy
for them, we shall defend our people," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have reportedly stepped up air and artillery
attacks in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Security Council, the highest decision-making body
in the nation, has discussed the plan drafted jointly by a
presidential team and a government commission.

Israel since February 25, which killed more than 60 people and
wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
The four-week long closure, barred dozens of thousands
Palestinian workers from returning to their jobs inside Israel,
has further worsened the economic situation in the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli officials have repeatedly stressed that the
closure would continue until the PNA cracks down on the Islamic
military groups operating inside the Palestinian autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
Abed Rabbo today also criticized Oman and Qatar for inviting
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres to visit the two Gulf
states, saying he was surprised that they were extending
invitations to Peres while the closure continues.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli sources, the invitations were conveyed
during the follow-up meeting to the Sharm e-Sheikh Anti-Terrorism
summit held in Washington, U.S., this week.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first visit of an Israeli prime minister to
Qatar, and the late Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was in
Oman in December 1994, for his first visit to an Arab Gulf
country.
</P>
<P>
Peres is due to leave for Oman Monday, where he will spend the
night before his visit to Qatar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, international donor countries for the
Palestinians are to meet in two weeks time in Brussels of Belgium
to discuss the economic needs of the Palestinian autonomy areas in
light of the closure.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was arranged at the initiative of Norway during
the follow-up meeting to the Sharm e-Sheikh Summit in Washington
this week.

<HEADLINE> Khaleda Zia Hopes for Re-election to Bangladeshi PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chairperson of Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) Khaleda Zia, who just resigned from the
post of prime minister, expressed the hope for the re-election of
her party in the coming elections under the neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
"We want elections within May this year and the people will
re-elect the BNP in the elections," Khaleda Zia told a huge rally
in front of the BNP's Naya Paltan central office this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I have requested President Rahman Biswas to dissolve the sixth
parliament and to hand over power to the caretaker government.
Hence, we are in the street and shall remain with the people. We
have come to you again," she told thousands of cheering BNP
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitutional amendment bill passed by the
11-day-old BNP-dominated parliament, a caretaker government headed
by newly retired Chief Justice Habibur Rahman will supervise fresh
elections within 90 days after the dissolve of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We came to power in 1991 constitutionally and with people's
mandate. Today we have handed over power constitutionally. It is
the victory of the people. It is the victory of the BNP," said the
BNP chairperson.
</P>
<P>
She accused the opposition parties of destroying the country's
economy by paralyzing the biggest port of Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition parties launched an indefinite
non-cooperation campaign on March 9 to press for the resignation
of Khaleda Zia and fresh elections under a neutral caretaker
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady
Udovenko today reiterated his country's support for China's
position on Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National
People's Congress Standing Committee (parliament), Udovenko said
that the Ukrainian president, the prime minister and the foreign
ministry all strictly and explicitly support the one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian foreign minister also said that the issue of
human rights should be considered in the light of the specific
conditions of individual countries, and the West should not impose
its human rights standards upon China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who has been here sine Thursday on a four-day visit,
expressed thanks for Ukraine's understanding and support on the
two issues.
</P>
<P>
He said China hopes to solve the issue of Taiwan in accordance
with the principle of peaceful reunification and "one country, two

But with the support of certain foreign forces, Qiao noted,
some leaders of the Taiwan authorities have been pursuing an

This is why China has made no pledge not to use force in

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Mark 20th Anniversary Of Land Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arabs and Palestinians
held rallies and demonstrations today to mark the 20th anniversary
of Land Day.
</P>
<P>
Land Day began in 1976 when Israel tried to appropriate land
from the Arab villagers of Deir Hanna, Sakhneen and Arabeh in the
Galilee. In the protests that followed, six Palestinians were
killed and 70 injured by Israeli army gunfire. Ever since, Land
Day has been marked by Palestinians within the "Green Line" in the
Triangle, the Galilee and the Negev.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 local Arab councils went on strike today. Schools and
commercial sector also observed a full strike. At a rally held in
Arabeh in the north, several thousand participants listened to
speeches and shouted slogans including calls for an end to the
closure on Palestinian territories and "free Palestine."
</P>
<P>
This year's Land Day has come in the context of a severe
closure that has divided the Palestinian lands into separate
parts. The lands are locked in by circular roads built for the
Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Some of the worst events of the week with long-term damage to
the land, occurred when Israeli duster planes flew over the Jenin
and Ramallah areas, spraying pesticides Thursday, March
21. Hundreds of acres planted with wheat and other crops were
destroyed. Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights
organizations condemned the act.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, the Land Defense Committees called upon
landowners to organize demonstrations and to face the bulldozers
leveling their land as part of a day of protest. In Bethlehem,
Palestinian residents took to the street in protest against land
confiscation by Israel to build bypass roads for Jewish
settlers.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Lab Will Probe Frontiers of Computer Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-US research laboratory
that will probe the frontiers of computer science opened today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Development Laboratory for Advanced Computer and
Communication Technologies(JDL), is a 50-50 joint research
institute between the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and
Motorola Inc. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
It represents an equal partnership in the frontiers of
computing technology between a Chinese scientific research
organization, and a famous international company.
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of research, China has made great progress in
high-performance computer research and development.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the National Research Center for
Intelligent Computing System (NCIC) under the CAS has developed
the "Dawning Computer No. 1" multi-processor system, and the
"Dawning Computer 1000" massive parallel computing system, using
the world's most advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The center has a team of young engineers conducting hi-tech
research and development.
</P>
<P>
Motorola has gained considerable market share internationally
in communications and semiconductor devices in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Its Wireless Communications Center of the Semiconductor
Products Sector has been working on vector processing technology
for computing and communication applications in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Li Guojie, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
and director of the NCIC, said that the JDL will make good use of
China's advantages in systems architecture design and software
technology, related to Chinese information processing, and
Motorola's advanced hardware technology as well as marketing and
management experiences.
</P>
<P>
Li said such a combination will facilitate the research and
development of advanced computer and communications technology for
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of the JDL gives China an
opportunity to learn from the management experience of western
countries in the early stages of research and development of
China's hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The JDL, established on January 1, 1996, will mainly engage in
the research of high-performance multi-media system, computer
communications and network technologies, and natural man-machine
interface technologies.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Become Self-Reliant in Wheat Within Years:  Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMBAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will become
self-reliant in wheat supply if it can achieve the yield target of
27 maund (1,007.7 kilograms) per acre, Pakistani Minister for Food
and Agriculture Nawab Mohammad Yousuf Talpur said today.
</P>
<P>
He told local reporters in Multan, central Pakistan, that
Pakistan's wheat growers are now able to increase the yield of
wheat from 19 maund (709.1 kilograms) to 22 maund (821.1
kilograms) per acre.
</P>
<P>
He said they would be able to achieve the target of 27 maund
(1,007.7 kilograms) per acre within the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has been providing certified
seeds to the wheat growers in the last two years, which has
contributed to the rising yield.
</P>
<P>
He said the government recognizes the efforts by the wheat
growers, who persist in sowing wheat despite inadequate support,
and help the country in boosting the yield.
</P>
<P>
To ease the burden on the farmers, the Pakistani government has
decided to raise the support price of wheat by 20 rupees (58 US
cents) per 100 kilograms for the coming new wheat crop, said the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Willing to Leave Bodies to Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Chinese people have
answered a call to leave their bodies to science.
</P>
<P>
A girl student in her early 20s is one of the youngest
volunteers in Nanjing, capital city of east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Forty couples have opted to end up in research laboratories,
rather than side by side in a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
So far 312 people have volunteered to donate their bodies for
medical use after death.
</P>
<P>
The body-rush started when Huang Fuyin, a then 67-year-old
associate research fellow with the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, made a joint appeal with 11 others, calling on people to
donate their bodies for medical benefit, and saving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
His advocation met a good response from the public. Statistics
show that 95 percent of the 312 volunteers are old people above
60, 44 percent of them are intellectuals, including teachers and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
"We should save more land reserved for building tombs, for
people living in the world, and at the same time help promote
reform of funeral and interment activities," said Qian Zhonghan,
an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, we can also boost medical undertakings, and
relieve the pains of more patients, and let them have a new life,"
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Hua Aiwu and Shi Chengxing, a voluntary couple, expressed the
hope that with their conduct living people can lead a better life,
with more trees and less tombs on the earth.
</P>
<P>
They said they would be happy in the future if their functional
organs could be used to extend other people's lives, or some parts
of their bodies used for medical research.
</P>
<P>
Yin Julan, a 22-year-old female student at the Nanjing
University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said, "I will feel
rather happy if someone regains a new life from receiving my
organs," she said.
</P>
<P>
Volunteer body donation has drawn attention of the city
government, which has pledged to set up a support group to perfect
a donation system.

<HEADLINE> Minor Planet Named After Chinese Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A minor planet circling the sun
has been named after a famous Chinese scientist.
</P>
<P>
Planet 3462, discovered in 1981, has been named today as Planet
Zhouguangzhao by the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS), in honor of Zhou Guangzhao, member and
president of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Planet Zhouguangzhao, which circles the sun in an elliptical
orbit, takes 3.84 years to complete a circle.
</P>
<P>
It was discovered October 25, 1981 at the Purple Mountain
Observatory in Nanjing, capital city of east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhou has been known for his creative work in several major
fields of theoretical physics, notably particle physics,
quantum-field physics, condensed-matter physics and statistical
physics.
</P>
<P>
He is recognized internationally as one of the founding fathers
of research on the partially conserved axial vector current, and
he introduced the concept of helicity amplitude and its
corresponding mathematical description, and developed a unified
formalism for the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium states.
</P>
<P>
The Purple Mountain Observatory has so far discovered 102 minor
planets which have received permanent international codes over the
past years.
</P>
<P>
Besides naming minor planets after places and ancient
scientists, the Purple Mountain Observatory has named a dozen
minor planets after renowned contemporary people from both home
and abroad since 1990.

<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing wants more foreign
investment to add to the 15 billion US dollars of overseas
money that poured into China's capital in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to introduce more foreign investment and expand
foreign trade co-operation in the next fifteen years, said the
Beijing's Mayor Li Qiyan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an on-going session of the city's People's
Congress, Li said that Beijing should focus on the introduction
of direct foreign investment, the rational utilization of foreign
investment, and the restructuring of foreign investment in the
period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the municipal government will encourage foreign
investors to invest in key, and basic construction projects, and
new technology in enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The city will also standardize the later-stage administration of
foreign-funded projects, and gradually apply the same policies to
foreign firms as domestic firms.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign trade co-operation should be further
expanded through getting a larger share in traditional markets,
developing new international markets, and multiplying export
channels, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The service market will also be improved and opened wider for
foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech and economic development zones, which are set to
prosper during the 15-year period, will become an important part
of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has seen rapid economic
development in the past five years. Some 10,910 joint-ventures
have been approved, with 15.3 billion US dollars of foreign
investment, 11 times that of the 1986-90 period. The foreign
trade volume scored 15.55 billion US dollars, more than double the

<P>
XI'AN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A woman farmer in northwest China's
Shaaxi province has given birth to quadruplets. It was the second
set of quads born in China this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest foursome, two boys and two girls, were born by
Caesarean Section in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
The first baby boy was born at 09:10, on Wednesday and weighed
1.95 kg. A 1.6 kilogram baby girl and a 1.5 kilogram baby boy were
delivered at a two minute interval. The last baby to arrive was a
baby girl, weighing 1.5 kg.
</P>
<P>
The mother, Wang Yan, 26, is a farmer in Xiaobaozi Village in
Pingyao township, Yongshou county.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who is 1.47 meters tall, weighs 45 kg.
</P>
<P>
The doctors said the quadruplets were developed by four
separate eggs, which is quite rare as most quadruplets develop
from a single egg.
</P>
<P>
In January, a woman in east China's Zhejiang province gave
birth to female quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
Though each couple is encouraged to have only one child in
China, families with more than one baby at one birth are usually
helped by local governments until the babies reach the age of 18.

The assistance include subsidies provided by the government, a

support is being given, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Biswas said procedural formalities regarding the caretaker
government will be taken immediately after the dissolution of the
parliament. "I am acting as fast as possible without wasting
anytime," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia met with
the president to request him to institute the caretaker government
within the quickest time.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to all political parties and the people
to keep calm in the greater national interest in this historic
hour of transition of power to the non-party caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that since the opposition parties enforced
indefinite non-operation movement against the government, the
ruling party and its government is facing growing pressure from
the people. For that reason, the government has thought of
overcoming the political impasse as soon as possible to keep its
popularity for next general elections.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Unified Loan Certificate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China,
China's central bank, is to introduce a unified loan certificate
system in the country's large and medium-sized cities from April 1.
</P>
<P>
According to Regulations on the Loan Certificate System issued
recently by the bank, the system is to regulate the lending and
repaying of enterprises, improve communications between
money-lending financial institutions, and reduce money lending
risks.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the central bank, the system has been
introduced in 200 large and medium-sized-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that loan certificates are
qualification documents for enterprises, with legal status to
apply for loans from financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises must obtain the certificates before applying
for loans from branches of the People's Bank of China in areas
where the enterprises are registered.
</P>
<P>
The regulations say loan borrowing and repayment and the credit
of enterprises should be documented in the certificate.
</P>
<P>
Loan certificates will be issued and administered by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
Financial reforms in recent years have enabled enterprises to
open accounts, and obtain loans from several banks. Without a
channel to exchange financial data, many banks cannot keep abreast
of the financial situations of enterprises applying for loans,
since different banking institutions may be involved, often
resulting in incorrect loan decisions.
</P>
<P>
Some ill-managed firms use the loophole to obtain loans from
several banks, and are then unable to repay as promised.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Promises To Convey Afrikaner Education Fears To ANC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela yesterday promised 21 Afrikaner groups he will
convey their fears about Afrikaans education to the African
National Congress (ANC) and the parliamentary Portfolio Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
A local daily ''The Citizen'' today quoted the president as
saying that the concerns of all communities should be addressed
without overturning the principle of nation building.
</P>
<P>
At his official Pretoria residence yesterday, Mandela held
talks with an Afrikaner delegation, including members of the
National Party, the Freedom Front, educational bodies and
cultural organisations.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum handed to the president, the delegation asked
for the constitutional clause on education to be redefined to
protect christian Afrikaans schools.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said the interim constitution is too vague in
this regard, resulting in uncertainty and general disenchantment
among afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
''If the constitution will acknowledge and protect our rights,
and also the survival of Afrikaans schools, it will rid
Afrikaners of the resentment, confusion and struggle in which
they have become entangled,'' said the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said he fully supports the education
principles stated in the interim constitution, noting that
multilingual schools are essential for nation building.
</P>
<P>
the ANC's freedom charter explicitly espouses respect for all
languages and cultures, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's language crisis arised from the refusal of some
traditional predominant Afrikaans schools to admit black pupils.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu said on Friday that schools
should offer at lease three languages, two of them languages of
instruction, the third as a subject.
</P>
<P>
Bengu said all the 11 official languages, including English
and Afrikaans, have to be exalted, protected and developed as
South African national languages.
</P>
<P>
Those who had been identified in the past with oppression and
apartheid, such as Afrikaans, must also become bastions of South
Africa's non-racial democracy, rather than exclusion zones
limited to only those who practised the culture through its
language, Bengu noted.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Warned of Growing Urban Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Economic
and Development Authority (NEDA) has warned that the country's
urban population is growing at an alarming rate and may put the
country at risk unless necessary steps are taken.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop starting here Friday for formulating the policy
on national land use, NEDA's Deputy Director General Isagani
Valdellon said the growth rate of the urban population is more
than double that of the national population.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show approximately 50 percent of the country's
population now reside in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
This has caused many socio-economic problems, including
pollution, traffic problems, land shortage and inadequacy of
services.
</P>
<P>
NEDA is now drawing up an action plan on urban development to
address urban integration, infrastructure needs, urban land use
and environmental management.

COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's Customs Office
has cut duty on motor spare parts from 100 percent to 35 percent
as a measure of relief for private bus operators, customs sources

The sources said the measure followed a directive of Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who is also the
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting with the president, representatives of the
country's private bus owners said the high prices they had to pay
for the spare parts would lead to a hike in bus fares.

The president asked them to postpone the hike and promised to
consider ways to ease their burden.

<HEADLINE> Three British Soldiers Sentenced Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Assize Court in Larnaca
sentenced Friday night life imprisonment to three British
soliders for the manslaughter of Danish tour guide Louise Jensen
after eight-month trial.
</P>
<P>
The Court also gave each of them a five-year jail sentence for
abduction and conspiracy to rape her. The sentences will run
concurrently.
</P>
<P>
Alan Fore, 26, of Birmingham, Justin Fowler, 27, from
Cornwall, and Jeffrey Pernell, 23, from the West Midlands, were
serving with the First Battalion Royal Green Jackets, on one of
the two British sovereign bases on the island, Dhekelia.
</P>
<P>
The three British soldiers abducted Jensen on September 13,
1994, outside a petrol station in the holiday resort of Ayia
Napa, in Eastern Cyprus, after knocking her off a motorbike she
was riding with her Cypriot boyfriend Michalis Vassiliades.
</P>
<P>
Vassiliades was chased away and the victim was bundled into a
car and driven off to a remote spot where the three men sexually
assaulted her before beating her to death with a spade.
</P>
<P>
The three soldiers were arrested by police the same evening,
after Vassiliades reported the case.
</P>
<P>
Jensen's body was found two days later in a shallow grave in
nearby Paralimni, after a massive police search.
</P>
<P>
Before passing sentence the President of the panel of three
judges, Takis Eliades, told the Court "this is one of the most
horrendous crimes in recent years."
</P>
<P>
"The terrified victim, alone and unprotected, had no possible
way to defend herself due to the presence of the superior body
power and strength of the three British servicemen. Any
resistance was easily overpowered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The barbarity with which the victim was killed, which is
evident by the 15 blows the victim received in this horrific
crime, and everything which preceded the killing - while the
victim was still alive and protecting herself - shows how serious
the offences of manslaughter were," Eliades noted.
</P>
<P>
When the convicted men heard their life sentence for
manslaughter passed, they appeared totally deflated.
</P>
<P>
The three britons were led to Nicosia central prison under
strict security measures to serve their sentence.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Antonis Andreou said the three convicted men
will appeal against their sentence to the supreme court.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, defense lawyers pleaded for leniency because of the
drunken state all three soldiers were in at the time of the
killing.
</P>
<P>
But the judge said the court disagrees with the view that the
state of intoxication the three soldiers were in is mitigating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Before the court ruling, the British bases staff and Deputy
Commander, Brigadier Arthur Denaro, issued a statement, saying
that "these were three individuals on trial, and whilst their
conviction affects us all, this is not a trial of their fine
regiment, the Royal Green Jackets, nor the British forces on
Cyprus, nor the army as a whole."
</P>
<P>
However, the victim's family has threatened to sue the British
Army and the British government over Jensen's death.
</P>
<P>
Father Poul Jensen, speaking after the sentence, said "we want
to try and place some responsibility with the British military and
the British government. We feel it must be possible."
</P>
<P>
The local press has described the crime as "the most brutal
case" involving British soldiers since the two British sovereign
bases areas were set up in Cyprus in 1960, by the Treaty of
establishment, granting Cyprus its independence from British
colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> Israel: No Leakage from Nuke Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has said that it is
satisfied with an Israeli assurance that the Jewish State's
nuclear facilities did not pose an environment hazard to any of
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by an unidentified Royal Court spokesman
Friday, one day after Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent, received a
message from Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Sarid assured the Crown Prince that Israel's Dimona reactor in
the desert or any other Israeli nuclear facility does not pose any
health hazard and that reports of a radioactive leakage at Dimona
were "baseless speculations and sensational media reporting," the
daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the Israeli research reactors nor the disposal of
radioactive waste pollute in any way the environment or any water
resource and do not constitute a health hazard," Sarid pledged on
behalf of his government in his personal letter.

"We are satisfied with the Israeli assurance," said the
spokesman, "and we are continuing our liaison in this regard."
</P>
<P>
It was the first known Israeli assurance to Jordan after
reports surfaced last week that radioactivity was suspected in
southern Jordan as well as Israel's border with Egypt, prompting
Cairo government to dispatch experts to carry out tests on soil in
the area and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to
request an urgent meeting on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The reports of leakage from the nuclear facility in Dimona,
which is only 32 kilometers away from Jordan's town of Tafila,
prompted the Crown Prince to personally contact Sarid, who
promised him a full report on the affair.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Jordan's Ministry of Health announced the results
of its tests that no radioactivity was found in southern
Jordan.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch "Traffic Safety Week" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Public Security Ministry
has decided to launch a national "Traffic Safety Week" to raise the
public awareness of the country's alarming traffic situation and to
make people abide by road regulations.
</P>
<P>
The period from April 1 to 7 every year will be China's national
Traffic Safety Week, starting this year, said Jiang
Bingjie, director of the ministry's Traffic Control Bureau, here
today.
</P>
<P>
China's economic boom in the past decade has increased its
number of cars dramatically, and its roads are becoming more
congested, and the number of accidents is rising rapidly. Traffic
accidents have become the country's "No. 1 hazard to society,"
Jiang noted in a news release.
</P>
<P>
To maintain traffic safety, in addition to strengthened
government control, it is equally crucial to educate the public in
traffic regulations, he said, noting that many of the accidents
are caused by neglect of existing rules.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China had 28 million motor vehicles
and 400 million non-motor vehicles by the end of 1995. The traffic
control bureaus nationwide handled over 270,000 car accidents last
year, in which over 70,000 persons died and 160,000 were injured,
and the direct economic losses amounted to 1.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the road safety week this year will
be: maintaining road safety -- the common responsibility of the
whole of society.
</P>
<P>
In this period the mass media and other relevant departments
will be mobilized to launch various large-scale and intensive
educational activities.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turin Summit Offers Chance to Shape Europe's Future  (By Ming Dajun) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TURIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- EU leaders have officially launched
an Inter-governmental conference (IGC) at a summit meeting here
today to review the Maastricht Treaty and reshape the future of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state or government of the European Union (EU)
have agreed on a mandate to be given to their foreign ministers
who are expected to meet monthly for at least 15 months to work on
a union closer to its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Lamberto Dini, also the rotating EU
president, said after the summit meeting that the IGC will provide
an opportunity to deal more effectively with the internal and
external challenges of the EU in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The leaders asked the IGC to be focused on fighting
unemployment, reforming the EU's decision-making system to embrace
more members and boosting internal and external security.
</P>
<P>
The fight against joblessness was given one of the top
priorities at the summit and it was placed on top of the agenda at
the Florence summit scheduled for June 22 this year after the
leaders realized that the union has to bring together supporters
and skeptics before it could achieve any real success.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment affects one in every nine EU citizens at present.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also asked the IGC to revise the EU's
decision-making process to prepare for its future enlargement,
which the summit described as "a historic mission" and a great
opportunity for Europe's future.
</P>
<P>
At present, 13 countries have applied for EU membership or are
expected to do so soon.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders also set it their objective to forge a common
foreign and security policy, which might in time lead to a common
defense.
</P>
<P>
It is noted, however, that what has been agreed on at the
summit are all half-way measures and key differences remain among
EU members.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Plans To Export More Ostrich Meat To European Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean ostrich producers are
gearing themselves for massive meat exports to the European Union
(EU) following the outbreak of the ''mad cow'' disease in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Ostrich Producers Association of Zimbabwe Friday projected
an upsurge in demand for ostrich meat fast-gaining popularity in
Europe due to its low cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
''We are actually preparing to aggressively market ourselves
in the EU in the light of the ''mad cow'' disease outbreak,''
Chris Bradshaw, Managing Director of the Association said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zimbabwean ostrich producers earned eight million
U.S. Dollars worth of exports of live birds, meat, skins, eggs
and feathers. Ostrich exports started three years ago under a
strictly controlled quota system administered by the Ostrich
Producers Association of Zimbabwe in conjunction with the
Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Denounces Anti-China Bill Adopted by U.S. Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed "firm
opposition" to a bill containing anti-China clauses recently
adopted by the US Congress and urged the US government to take
action to prevent the bill from becoming effective.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the
statement when he was asked to comment on the State Department
Authorization and Reform Bill adopted by the US House of
Representatives and Senate on March 12 and 28, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the US House of Representatives and Senate
adopted the bill which contains many anti-China clauses "in
disregard of repeated, solemn representations and strong
opposition by the Chinese side."
</P>
<P>
Those clauses, ignoring the basic norms of international
relations and violating the principles enshrined in the three
Sino-US joint communiques, pose gross encroachment upon China's
sovereignty and wanton interference in China's internal affairs,
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are firmly opposed to and
will absolutely not accept such clauses," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the bill goes into effect, the spokesman said, it will cause
serious damage to the Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that Li Daoyu, Chinese Ambassador to the US, has
been instructed to make serious representations to the US
government on this matter.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the fact that the US government has time
and again stated its objection to those anti-China clauses in the
bill and definitely promised to prevent the bill from going into
effect," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side urge that the US government, proceeding from
the interests of the overall Sino-US relations, strictly abide by
the principles in the three Sino-US joint communiques and turn its
own promises into practical actions so as to forestall another
serious damage to the Sino-US relations," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Nagasaki to Show Photos of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Photographs of the Japanese army's
1937 holocaust in the Chinese city of Nanjing will be displayed as
originally planned at Nagasaki's Atomic-bomb Exhibition Hall after
Chinese protested against the city's change of pictures, the mayor
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Iccho Ito said the city government will select pictures
for the show Monday after consulting with Chinese officials, the
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The city once planned to replace the photos of killing scenes
with those of the Japanese Imperial Army entering Nanjing under
the pressure of some city assembly members of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 people died in the Japanese troops' blood
bath of the city in World War II.
</P>
<P>
Calling on Japan to reflect rigorously its history of invasion
of Asian-Pacific countries, Ito said, "without this reflection and
apologies to the countries of Asia, our appeals for the abolition
of nuclear weapons will not reach the hearts of the world's
people."
</P>
<P>
Nagasaki was the second Japanese city raided by a U.S. A-bomb
in the closing days of World War II.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Indicts Former Presidential Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul District Prosecutor's
Office (SDPO) today formally indicted Chang Hak-ro, a former
secretary for South Korean President Kim Young-sam, on bribery
charges.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who was arrested last Saturday, was charged with taking
bribes totaling 800,000 U.S. dollars from 14 domestic firms in
exchange for his influence as a close aide to President Kim since
February 1993, according to the SDPO.
</P>
<P>
Also indicted were Chang's live-in girl friend, Kim Mi-ja, and
her brother Ui Ryung on charges of violating the law concerning
registration of real estate.
</P>
<P>
Chang has hidden most of the money he received from businessmen
in real estate and financial assets under the names of his live-in
girl friend and her brother.
</P>
<P>
He was discovered to have garnered a total of 3.55 million
U.S. dollars in illicit funds from some 40 people on 170 occasions
and 2.7 million dollars of the sum were raked in while he was
working at the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 800,000 U.S. dollars turned out to have been
accepted in return for the use of his good offices against which
criminal charges can be leveled, a SDPO official said.
</P>
<P>
Chang, 45, became an aide to Kim in 1977 and was his "steward"
for nearly 20 years. When Kim became president in February 1993,
Chang was named a presidential secretary in charge of Kim's
personal matters.
</P>
<P>
"We've confirmed that those who gave money to Chang were mostly
businessmen, but we'll continue our probe into whether or not
officials from the government and state-run companies handed dirty
money to him," the official added.
</P>
<P>
President Kim apologized to the nation Friday for the graft
case involving his personal aide.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sorry to the people for his shameless misconduct
in spite of his responsibility as a member of the presidential
staff to set an example for the people in fighting corruption and
irregularities," Kim said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sixth seed Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia upset second-seeded Pete Sampras of the United States 2-6,
6-4, 6-4 in the semi-finals of the Lipton Championships at Key
Biscayne, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The victory put Ivanisevic in his seventh final of the year and
he will play against third seed Andre Agassi of the United States
for the title.
</P>
<P>
Sampras started well in the match, winning the first set 6-2
and leading the second one 1-0. But then the rain forced a delay
of 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
When the rain came, Ivanisevic was serving only a 28 percent
first-serve percentage.
</P>
<P>
And when the games resumed, Ivanisevic calmed down a little and
regained his composure.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic increased his first-serve percentage to 46 percent
and won 32 of 39 first serve points.
</P>
<P>
Sampras still had six break point opportunities after the rain
but he failed to take advantage of any of them. Ivanisevic, to
the contrary, captured both of his service break points.
</P>
<P>
The victory over Sampras improved Ivanisevic's record to 38-4
this year.

<HEADLINE> hke033017-- Weekly Report on CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Crude palm oil (CPO),
tin and rubber markets in Malaysia ended the week mixed with the
CPO and tin prices higher, and the rubber price lower.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian crude palm oil physicals closed slightly higher
this week as the market was affected by thin interest coupled with
erosion on the Chicago market.
</P>
<P>
The market started on strong note but dropped on Tuesday and
Wednesday. The market was quiet towards the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The price for March South was 1,220 Malaysian Ringgit (about
488 US dollars) per ton compared to 1,205 Ringgit (about 482
dollars) per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market closed higher the week on strong
foreign buying interest.
</P>
<P>
The tin market started on a weak note but rebounded on Tuesday
with Japanese buyers entering the market to give renewed support.
</P>
<P>
The price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market closed five sen
stronger at 16 Malaysian Ringgit (about 6.4 dollars) per kilogram
from last week's closing of 15.95 Ringgit (about 6.38 dollars) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Turnover increased from last week's 903 tons to 945 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Malaysian rubber market closed lower the week as
the April RSS1 dropped to 384 sen (about 1.53 dollars) per
kilogram and the SMR20 eased to 357 sen (about 1.43 dollars) per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The market gained Thursday on news that there would be heavy
rains in Malaysia in the next two months, but the market was still
weak on lack of fresh leads with the poor performances of regional
markets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Black Sea Nations Seek More Cooperation  (By Wang Hongqi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Black Sea countries have
worked out a package of programs aimed to step up their economic
cooperation in an effort to catch up with the European integration
process and to merge themselves into the mainstream of world
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization (BSEC), one of
the largest regional organizations in Europe comprising 11
countries around the Black Sea, has said it will make detailed
programs and take concrete measures for bilateral and multilateral
cooperation between its member countries this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Evgeni Katovoy, secretary-general of the BSEC, the
organization has set a number of priorities for its coordination
activities in the areas of energy, transportation,
telecommunication, environment and commerce and trade.
</P>
<P>
In the sector of energy, the organization will hold a
sub-minister-level meeting to review the current conditions and
potential of the member countries' energy industry, and to map out
a long-term plan for regional cooperation in energy production and
distribution. The final goal is to establish a power network of
the Black Sea countries.
</P>
<P>
In the area of traffic and transportation, the priorities are
to draw a detailed traffic map for the Black Sea region and to
build three "traffic corridors" to connect the member countries
and the region with other areas.
</P>
<P>
The three corridors are the Crete No. 7 Corridor, or the Danube
River Corridor; the Crete No. 8 Corridor, which links the Adriatic
Sea and the Black Sea; and the corridor running from the Baltic
Sea through central Russia, the Azovskoye More to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
In telecommunication, the BSEC plans to work out details for
two projects entitled ITUR and KATOS concerning the building of
fiber cable in some Black Sea countries. The two projects are
designed to modernize the region's telecommunication, connecting
it with the other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
In environment, the organization will set up a Black Sea
Environment Fund, which is to coordinate the efforts in preventing
pollution in the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the BSEC will continue its efforts for
simplized customs and transit procedures between member states,
and to strengthen activities of its sub-organizations such as the
Black Sea Commerce Council, the Medium and Small Firm Center and
the Trade Forum.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC will also start preparations for the setting up of the
Black Sea Research Center, and work for an early start of the
operation of the Balkan and Black Sea Bank.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, measures will be taken to encourage cooperation
between private institutions of the member states.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Black Sea countries have been keen to step
up bilateral and multilateral cooperation between them as some of
them are moving towards market economy.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC, set up in 1992, is designed to promote such
cooperation as did several other regional organizations which
emerged in Europe in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At a summit meeting in Bucharest last year, members of the BSEC
agreed to strengthen all kinds of cooperation gradually and to set
up a fixed and effective mechanism within the organization.
</P>
<P>
The members acknowledged that the BSEC is increasingly becoming
an important means for coordinating economic development and
cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC also held two foreign ministers' meetings last year,
at which energy, industry, environment, transportation,
telecommunication and commerce and trade were selected as the
priorities for cooperation, and departments concerned were
designated to work on acting programs for the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the BSEC said the organization has gained a firm
foot so far, but much has to be done to make it an effective
regional mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC covers a region with the population between 320
million to 330 million.
</P>
<P>
The BSEC members include Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece,
Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Turkey, the initiative country of the BSEC, called on
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Yugoslavia and Macedonia to join the
economic bloc.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Spending, Debt Ceiling Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed today the 12th stopgap government spending bill and the
bill of extending the ceiling of national debt to avoid a third
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Approved by a voice vote in the House of Representatives and a
64-24 vote in the Senate today, the new spending bill will fund
dozens of U.S. government agencies through April 24.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also signed the bill to extend the U.S. government's
borrowing authority today. The legislation has raised the national
debt ceiling from 4.9 trillion dollars to 5.5 trillion dollars
through September 1997.
</P>
<P>
For months, Republicans had used the borrowing legislation as a
political weapon, refusing to send it to Clinton unless he acceded
to their demands for balancing the budget in seven years. However,
the public poured most of the blame on Republicans for the
previous two government shutdowns.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Tightens Control Over Foreign-Invested Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will become selective in
approving foreign investment projects to make sure they help the
country's development, the Ministry of Planning and Investment
said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that foreign investment must conform to the
state's goals of development to the year 2000, making the
projected socio-economic effects the overriding criteria for
project approval.
</P>
<P>
The ministry demands that new projects be located close to both
material resources and large urban centers with a view to best
tapping local potentials. But projects involving mineral
resources and tourist services may be exceptions, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the government had been luring foreign investment
in a much wider range of projects, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has set a target of about 6 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign direct investment this year, 25 percent less than that in
1995.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Vietnam had granted licenses to 1,470
foreign invested projects with total registered capital of 19.35
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country expects to attract an additional 15 billion dollars
to 17 billion dollars by the end of the decade.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Exchange Reserves Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India's foreign exchange
reserves have poised to cross the yearend target of 17 billion US
dollars in March this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put
the foreign exchange reserves at the end of March 15 at 16.8
billion dollars. The increase in March is expected to top 1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve increase in the past few months
was due to enhanced buying by foreign institutional investors and
an increase in the repatriation of export proceeds.
</P>
<P>
With the inflows continuing, the expectations are that the
current financial year will close with a much higher level of
reserves than anticipated, RBI officials said.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Relax Foreign Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Poland, in an effort to approach
the OECD, will relax its foreign exchange control to facilitate
business transactions with overseas companies, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Poland will kick off a new program on foreign exchange control
on April 1 to encourage mutual investment between Poland and other
countries, especially the members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Financial Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Poland adopted the program last week following a modified
restriction on February 1 on foreign currencies carried across the
border.
</P>
<P>
New rules allow Polish firms to set up branches or purchase
real estate and stocks for business purposes in OECD countries,
which groups European Union countries, the United States, Canada
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Such business is allowed in non-OECD countries only when the
deal is both under 1 million European Currency Units (ECU) in
value and with the support of an investment protection agreement
between Poland and the partner country.
</P>
<P>
Poland businesses could absorb foreign exchange abroad through
long-term loans or issuance of their own shares. OECD members
could also issue stocks in Poland.
</P>
<P>
Poland accelerated its campaign to join the OECD after the
Czech Republic become the first East European member of the
26-nation bloc in November.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Naval soldiers and local
police quelled a mini-riot in southern California today, during
which at least 28 prisoners were injured.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Miramar Naval Air Station said the riot started
with a mattress fire set by about 10 inmates protesting inadequate
cafeteria privileges.
</P>
<P>
Local police and firefighters were called in to help quell the
disturbance and put out the smoky fire in the military jail that
housed 174 civilian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The jail, also incarcerating 210 military personnel, was opened
to civilian inmates just a week ago to ease overcrowding at a
federal detention center in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
After the riot, prisoners were evacuated back to San Diego and
those injured were taken to local hospitals. U.S. Attorney Alan
Bersin said most of the injured were suffering from smoke
inhalation and none of their injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said
damage to the jail has yet to be determined, and prisoners
responsible for the fire will be prosecuted to the full extent of
the law.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the naval base said some of the prisoners at the
jail were illegal immigrants awaiting trials on criminal charges
in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange ended the week steadier with second board dominating
trading.
</P>
<P>
The composite index was 1.57 points lower at 1,150.65 when
compared with last week's close, but the all main board Emas index
was 1.67 points higher this week at 321.75 while the industrial
index rose 1.29 points to 2,045.01.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the profit taking was well absorbed by buying
interest on expectations that the Malaysian Central Bank may
provide some surprise news to boost the market. The composite
index's combined gains for Monday and Tuesday totaled 13.84
points.
</P>
<P>
However, continued selling pressure erased the gains later in
the week. The much anticipated Central Bank report, which was
released on Wednesday evening, was said to have little impact on
the market.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover of the main board rose to 901.837 million shares
valued at 6.363 billion Malaysian Ringgit (about 2.54 billion US
dollars) from last week's 850.592 million shares valued at 5.32
billion Ringgit (about 2.12 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 592.566 million shares
valued at 5.394 billion Ringgit (about 2.15 billion dollars)
compared to last week's 389.214 million shares valued at 3.371
billion Ringgit (about 1.348 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Off market deals amounted to 95.335 million shares valued at
677.41 million Ringgit (about 270.96 million dollars) from last
week's 72.651 million shares valued at 593.501 million Ringgit
(about 237.4 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Coffee Rust to Cause Big Losses in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 60,000 hectares of
coffee in Nicaragua are affected by mildew, which will cause
losses estimated at some 20 million dollars, the National Union of
Coffee Producers (NUCP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide state of alert has been declared due to the fast
spread of the parasitic fungi, said NUCP President David Robleto
Lang.
</P>
<P>
About 27 percent of the coffee fields have been plagued by rust
while the government failed to provide funds to buy copper
oxycloride which is efficient in killing the fungi.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the highly humid weather last year helped the
mildew to thrive.
</P>
<P>
The disaster will add to the poverty of the Central American
country since coffee is the most important exports of Nicaragua.

year.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)'s latest industrial

this trend is broadbased covering basic, intermediate, consumer
goods, capital goods and services sectors.
</P>
<P>
An encouraging sign is that these sectors are envisaging an
equally impressive growth in the coming year 1996-97, the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
The severe resource crunch is the biggest impediment to
industrial growth and exports. The industries felt that there

countries will adopt preventive measures to bar the arrival to the
region of the "mad cow" disease and preclude the risks it entails
for the 30 million inhabitants in the region.
</P>
<P>
Honduran Natural Resources Minister Ramon Villeda Bermudez said
today that among the measures under consideration are banning the
import of live cattle and animal protein from the countries where
the mad cow disease has been identified.
</P>
<P>
Cases of the disease have been reported not only in England,
but also in the Falkland Islands, Argentina, Canada, Chile and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the disease has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
Similar diseases affect man, cats and other animals, and it is
suspected that it has some link with their food intake.
</P>
<P>
Villeda Bermudez, a veterinarian, said that the main symptoms
of the "mad cow" disease are loss of appetite, trembling,
irritability and kicking.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Hondurans have adopted vegetarianism as a
lifestyle, some of them to follow Buddhism currents, now
fashionable here, others to improve their health, but most of them
did so because of the high cost of meat in the country.

<HEADLINE> India to Supply Superconducting Magnets to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India will supply
superconducting magnets for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) being
built by the European Council for Nuclear Research (ECNR) at
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here Friday, Indian scientists will
also develop software to control the super proton synchrotron
which injects protons into the LHC with the aim of probing the
ultimate structure of matter.
</P>
<P>
The LHC will remain the most powerful accelerator in the world
for at least the next two decades and will be the Mecca for
high-energy physicists, Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
India has offered to participate in the construction of the LHC
by contributing 25 million US dollars worth of material, including
12,000 super conducting sextuple corrector magnets, they said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the tunnel houses the large Electron Position
Collider(LEP) which uses conventional electro-magnets for
accelerating particles and which are ten times less powerful than
the superconductor magnets being used on the LHC.

<HEADLINE> Austria Could Meet EU Criteria for Single Currency: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior economist predicted today
that Austria could meet the European Union's (EU) criteria for
acquiring the membership of a regional single currency system.
</P>
<P>
Helmut Kramer, of the International Economic Research
Organization, said despite the deteriorated economic performance,
it is still possible for the Austrian government to bring its
budget deficit down to within 3 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The lower deficit rate is among a whole bunch of criteria that
are set forth by the Maastricht Treaty for the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty signed in mid-1991 and effective from
late-1993, the 15 EU nations are required to meet a series of
standards on budgetary deficit, inflation, public-sector debts,
and interest and exchange rates before 1997.
</P>
<P>
Given Europe's overall weak economic growth, Kramer noted,
Austria has to restructure its economy to adapt to the
international environment.
</P>
<P>
He projected that Austria's GDP growth will reach annual 0.7
percent in 1996 and 1.0 percent in 1997; and personal expenditure
will hike by 0.8 percent in 1996 and 0.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, the economist said, the country will see
capital investment increasing by 0.2 percent and 1.5 percent
respectively; commodity export rising by 4 percent and 4.5
percent; commodity import by 2.5 percent and 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, inflation is expected to reach 2.1 percent this
year and 1.9 percent next year; and unemployment is to account for
7.3 percent and 8.0 percent of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Kramer believes that Austria's trade deficit will decrease by
10.5 billion Austria schillings, or about 10.2 billion
U.S. dollars, in 1996; and 97.7 billion schillings, or 9.4 billion
dollars, in 1997. Meanwhile, the budget deficit will down by 40.5
billion schillings, or 3.9 billion dollars, in 1996; and 30.7
billion schillings, or 3.0 billion dollars, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
His projections are backed by Bernhard Felderer, of the
Institute of High Research in Vienna, who presented a series of
estimates slightly more optimistic than Kramer's.
</P>
<P>
However, they told a joint press conference that because of
lack of basic statistics in Austria, all figures in their forecast
are based on estimates.

<HEADLINE> Former Chief Justice Likely to Head Bangladesh's  Caretaker Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The appointment of former chief
justice Habibur Rahman to head Bangladesh's proposed neutral
caretaker government is now almost final, according to reliable
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
A presidential palace source confirmed that the chief justice
who retired last May gave his consent to be chief of the caretaker
government to pave the way for next general elections probably in
May following President Abdur Rahman Biswas' consultations with
the top leaders of the major political parties Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president has received positive response from both the
ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the mainstream
opposition parties including the Awami (People's) League, the
Jatiya (National) Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami, the source added.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia called on
President Biswas Friday afternoon to request him to constitute the
caretaker government at the quickest time. This was her second
meeting with the president in 48 hours to ask for the formation of
a caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The countdown to the resignation of the prime minister has
started as the appointment of former chief justice Habibur Rahman
is almost final, the sources said, adding that the parliament may
be dissolved on March 31.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have long been locked in struggle for a
neutral caretaker government to supervise free and fair national
elections.
</P>
<P>
Following the growing pressure from the opposition and the
public society, especially after the government's civil servants
and employees refused to duties and expressed solidarity with the
opposition movement, the ruling party and its government has
decided to speed up the process of the formation of a caretaker
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese legislator Tian
Jiyun today met with Alan Dukes, chairman of the joint committee
of foreign affairs of the Irish Dail, the First Chamber of the
National Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Tian, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, said exchanges of the two parliaments
will further boost mutual understanding of the two legislative
bodies.
</P>
<P>
Tian told Dukes that the Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range
Objectives to the Year 2010, approved on the just-ended Fourth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in Beijing this
month, will ensure steady growth of Chinese economy and help
improve people's living conditions greatly.
</P>
<P>
Dukes said the Irish parliament and the people are very
interested in China, not only because it covers a vast territory,
but because it plays a critical role in world economic and
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ireland watches closely the development of China's reforms and
wishes further more successes to the Chinese government and people
in their pursuit for a better economy.
</P>
<P>
Tian also briefed Dukes on China's agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Tian is the first ever Chinese legislature leader to visit this
European nation since the two countries established diplomatic

The two nations have enjoyed closer bilateral relations since
senior officials exchanged visits to each other in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Last year Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
and Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation Minister Wu Yi paid
friendly visits to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Dukes visited China in October in 1995.

<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Motorola Computer Group and Apple
Computer International Ltd have announced a joint strategy to
manufacture personal computers with the Macintosh operating system
(Mac OS) platform in China, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
By localizing PC manufacture with its joint venture in Nanjing,
Jiangsu Province, Motorola will be ready to make a major business
assault on the Chinese market this year.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Power Computer Ltd, Motorola Computer Group's joint

later this year, said Kenneth Kin, vice-president and director of
Motorola's Asia Pacific and Japan operation.
</P>
<P>
Industrial experts said the cooperation between Motorola and
Apple will be a tit-for-tat strategy for competing with their
rivals, like Compaq and Microsoft, who have used similar tactics.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Electronics Industry predicts that sales of PCs
next year are likely to hit about 25 billion yuan (about 3 billion
US dollars) in China, an estimated increase of 47 percent.

<HEADLINE> Computer Network to Help Postal Savings in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A computer network is being set
up to link 10,000 postal savings offices in all Chinese cities
over the next three years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
With the network, by the year 2000, customers who deposit money
in a post office in one city will be able to withdraw it in
another province.
</P>
<P>
Over the 1994-96 period, the Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications will have invested more than 1.25 billion yuan
(150.6 million US dollars) in computerizing savings operations at
2,500 post offices in 50 major cities including Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin and all provincial capitals.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, another 400 automatic teller machines
(ATMs) will also be installed at these post offices, bringing the
total number to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
the ministry said that Chinese and overseas companies are
welcome to provide technology or equipment for the network
construction.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set up the Green Card Office to take charge of
the construction work.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious move comes in response to rapid expansion of the
post office savings business since the the ministry resumed the
service in 1986.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's Postal Savings and Remittance
Bureau, deposits reached a total of 161.1 billion yuan (19.4
billion US dollars) by the end of 1995, and have been growing at
an annual rate of over 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's 30,000 post offices attracted 5.45 percent of the
Chinese people's total savings deposits in 1995, compared with 2.5
percent in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Giant Petrochemical Joint Venture to Be Built in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A petrochemical joint venture
with an investment of 6 billion US dollars will be built in
Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture between the Yangzi Petrochemical Corporation
and the German Basf Corporation is expected to be built within
five to seven years, according to a letter of intent signed here
Friday. Yangzi Petrochemical and Basf will each have 50 percent
interests in the project.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, which is to be built at the Yangzi
Petrochemical base that will house 20 projects, will produce
600,000 tons of ethylene a year and turn out other products, the
Beijing-based English-language newspaper "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
China Central Television (CCTV), the State television station,
reported that the joint venture will turn the Yangzi Petrochemical
into the country's largest ethylene producer, whose annual
ethylene output is expected to be one million tons.
</P>
<P>
One of China's five largest petrochemical enterprises, Yangzi
Petrochemical is run by the State-owned China Petrochemical Corp
(Sinopec) and produces 400,000 tons of ethylene a year.
</P>
<P>
Yangzi Petrochemical, which was set up in 1983 and went into
overall operation in 1990, last year chalked up sales of 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) and profits of 4.5 billion
yuan (540 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, president of Sinopec, said the Chinese government
will give its support to the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
China plans to increase annual production of ethylene to 4.2
million tons by 2000 and 8 to 10 million tons by 2010 from last
year's 2.43 million tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Civil Protection
authorities of the southeastern state of Chiapas will install a
microwave network to watch the "Chichonal" and "Tacana" volcanos
seismic activity.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the state's Civil Protection Unit Romero Leon Vidal
said today that the monitoring network will start operation on
April 20, which will be, together with the existing facilities,
sufficient to ensure people's safety in case it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
He said Chiapas authorities are closely watching the activity
of the Chichonal volcano, located in the northern areas of the
state of Chiapas, and the Tacana volcano at the border area
between Mexico and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have acquired a better consciousness with the
creation of a new culture of civil protection, after the Chichonal
erupted 14 years ago, seriously affecting some of the state's
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The state official acknowledged that despite the close watch of
the volcanos, more advanced instruments must be installed to
expand the monitoring system.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government barred,
starting today, the import of live cattle and sheep, beef and
mutton, as well as dairy products, to prevent the mad cow disease
from the entrance into the country.
</P>
<P>
The measure is applied to imports from Britain, Oman, the
Falkland Islands, France, Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland,
Portugal and other European countries, according to a decision of
the Peruvian Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Many other countries have suspended the import of beef from
Britain, where several cases of a brain disease were
discovered. The frightening disease, both animal and human
varieties, damages the brain until the victim dies.
</P>
<P>
The embargo will be in force until it is determined that the
animals and products are not contaminated by the disease, the
ministry said.

BANGKOK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will step up its efforts
to push the export of tapioca flour in the coming months, the Thai
Commerce Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will send trade missions to Russia and the Czech
Republic from April 21 to May 4 and to China from May 24 to June 3
to promote the export of tapioca flour.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also studying the potential of new markets,
like Australia, New Zealand, India and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today reported that huge demand for tapioca in
both Thai and world markets has kept the local price of fresh
cassava high at 1.20-1.35 baht (4.8-5.4 US cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Thailand could export 31,000 tons of tapioca pellet to the

<HEADLINE> China Makes Major Achievements in Hi-tech Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China has made more than 1,200
research achievements in hi-tech fields over the past 10 years,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
About half of the achievements have reached an advanced level
in world science, the paper quoted Lin Quan, secretary-general of
the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
China launched the "863 Project" -- a hi-tech research program
in March 1986. The project is aimed at speeding up the development
of China's high technology, in order to catch up with worldwide
trends in science and technology and help reinforce economic power
and national defense.
</P>
<P>
China first implemented the plan by selecting key projects in
15 subjects and seven fields including biology, automation, energy
and new materials.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the project has played an important role in
promoting commercial and industrial exploitation of scientific
findings, helping to revitalize traditional industries as well as
creating new hi-tech industries, said Lin.
</P>
<P>
The country has now narrowed the gap with the developed
countries in automation technology.
</P>
<P>
Computerized manufacturing systems have been introduced in
machinery, electronics, space, textiles, light industry,
petroleum, chemistry, metallurgy and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
The SSTC will hold an exhibition on research results and
hi-tech products from April 1-9, said Lin.

<HEADLINE> India, Growing Rival for Thailand in Rice Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India has become a major rival of
Thailand in supplying low quality rice to Africa, the Middle East
and Asia, according to the Business Economics Department of the
Thai Government.
</P>
<P>
India exported 3.5 million tons of rice last year, five times
more than in 1994, and accounted for 18 percent of the total world
rice trade, department director-general Krirk-krai Jirapaet was
quoted by today's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
India emerged as the second-largest rice exporter, edging out
the United State which exported three million tons.
</P>
<P>
India's paddy production last year was 122 million tons. Its
exports, mainly of low grade rice, competed directly with Thai
sales.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports of low quality rice (10-20 percent grade and
20-25 percent grade) accounted for more than 30 percent of its
total rice shipments annually.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Thailand exported 1.9 million tons of low grade
rice, accounting for 36 percent of its total rice sales abroad.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Wishes Normalization with Former Republics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic said today that Yugoslavia attached strategic importance to
normalize relations with the former Yugoslav republics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with local officials in southern Serbian city Nis,
Kontic said that Yugoslavia was poised to recognize the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) soon, and talks were also
under way about the mutual recognition between Yugoslavia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
There were six republics in the former Yugoslavia, four of
which, FYROM, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia and Croatia, gained
independence while Serbia and Montenegro remained to become the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, Kontic said, has already shown wishes to establish
diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Croatia, Yugoslavia insisted on the settlement
of the strategic Adriatic Prevlaka peninsula before it recognizes
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Prevlaka peninsula straddles the maritime border between
Yugoslavia and Croatia and is claimed by both states. After a
fierce fighting in 1991 for the small peninsula between the two
countries, U.N. intervened by sending U.N. Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) to control the place in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kontic also spoke about a normalization of relations with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying talks on this regard are
under way in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was expelled from many international organizations
after the former Yugoslavia was demised and a U.N.-sanction was
imposed on Belgrade for its alleged involvement in the Bosnian
civil war. The country is trying hard to reintegrate into the
world community.
</P>
<P>
Kontic said that Yugoslavia was prepared to discharge all its
statutory and other obligations to the IMF, but was not prepared
to be treated as a successor to the fund's membership.
</P>
<P>
"This is all the more because many countries have recognized
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's continuity with the former
federation and are treating it as the predecessor state," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. legal committee has recently ruled that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia remains the predecessor state after the
four republics broke away from the former Yugoslavia, the prime
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Major confident of EU Ban Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today he hoped a package of measures could be agreed by the
European Union next Monday "sufficient to lift the ban on British
beef.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here, Major, who is attending the EU
Inter-Governmental Conference in Turin, Italy, made this statement
after his talks the EU heads of state.
</P>
<P>
The British leader said that he was "extremely reassured by the
attitude" of his EU partners and there was support for Britain's
situation.
</P>
<P>
Major conceded that the EU's worldwide ban on British beef
exports had "left quite deep scars and healing them will take some
time".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britian's Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg had
talks in Brussels today with the European Commissioner Franz
Fischler on the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are reported to have discussed whether moves
taken by Britain on Thursday, including banning sales of beef
from older cattles, were enough to restore consumers' confidence
and prompt the lifting of the EU ban.
</P>
<P>
Hogg said that the two sides had made some progress.
</P>
<P>
But panic caused by the mad cow disease continue to spread and
beef prices further tumbled across Britain today.
</P>
<P>
Consumers, along with stores and restaurants, were already
seeking alternatives to steaks and hamburgers, and farmers, who
are facing the worse crisis in decades, wanted the government to
take quick and drastic action to revive the public confidence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Passes Another Stopgap Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congress passed another
stopgap legislation today to avoid a possible government shutdown
and fund U.S. government operations through April 24.
</P>
<P>
The measure was approved with 64-24 by the U.S. Senate
following a voice vote in the House of Representatives and has
been sent to President Clinton for signing.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said President Clinton
would reluctantly sign the measure and is concerned that many
agencies are receiving only 75 percent of last year's funding
levels.
</P>
<P>
The bill is the 12th temporary spending bill since the U.S.
fiscal 1996 started from October 1 of last year. Several
government departments and agencies have been operating under one
or another stopgap spending bills in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Broader talks on the budget impasse between congressional
Republicans and Democrats as well as the White House have made
fitful progress these days but failed to reach an agreement today.
The talks recessed today and negotiators agreed to reconvene on
April 15.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled Congress would provide 160 billion
dollars for some government agencies and programs in the remaining
six months of fiscal 1996. But the White House is seeking more
money than the Congress is willing to add to the package.
</P>
<P>
The budget impasse between the White House and the Congress has
resulted in two partly shutdowns of U.S. in the past six months
totaling 27 days.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military will begin
training Mexican military officers in counter-drug techniques next
week at three U.S. bases, the Defense Department announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
15 Mexican officers will begin a 12-week anti-drug training
program on Monday, said Brian Sheridan, the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for drug enforecement policy, at a news

Benning, Georgia; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; and Fort Bragg, North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The purpose will be to help the Mexican military better support
the Mexican police with a rapid-reaction capability, Sheridan
said. "We are quite comfortable that we will see the Mexican
military providing support for the police in Mexico," he added
</P>
<P>
"This is about the most cost-effective thing we can do" to
combat the flow of illegal drugs into the United States from
Mexico, Sheridan said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Loosens Limits on Use of Pentagon GPS System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
decided to loosen military security restrictions and allow greater
commercial use of the high-tech Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
developed and being operated by the Pentagon, U.S. Vice President
Al Gore said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gore told a White House press conference that the decision
could turn the one billion U.S. dollars industry into eight
billion U.S. dollars in four years and create 100,000 jobs while
protecting military security at a certain level.
</P>
<P>
"We are harnessing power in the sky to chart a prosperous new
course on the ground," Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Based on the new Clinton administration policy, the Pentagon
will end in four to 10 years its practice of degrading the quality
of the Global Positioning System signal available for commercial
use.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Global Positioning System will be available
for cars, airplanes, trains, trucks, ambulances, oil tankers, even
hikers.
</P>
<P>
Commercial use of the Global Positioning System has been
limited by the Pentagon out of national security concerns. The
U.S. military views the system technology as an important
battlefield advantage.
</P>
<P>
Loosening the military security restrictions will greatly
expand the potentiality of the system. Using small, portable
receivers to pick up satellite signals, the Global Positioning
System users can pinpoint their locations anywhere in the world,
even at sea, under any weather conditions.

<HEADLINE> Reconstruction Plan Will Continue: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Development projects
initiated under the Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP)
would go ahead but the mechanism for co-ordinating them still has
to be finalized, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the remarks at an infrastructure investment
conference, which began on Thursday in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference was aimed at forging a partnership
among the government, organized labor and private enterprise on
infrastructure development projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
A partnership among the government, the private sector and
labor is necessary to bring about adequate growth and
development, said Mbeki while opening the conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Mbeki told newsmen that although the RDP office
has been closed down, RDP staff would continue to work.
</P>
<P>
In a cabinet reshuffle announced by President Nelson Mandela
in parliament on Thursday, the RDP office had been closed down
and the work it now handled would be relocated by Mbeki.
Meanwhile, the RDP fund would also be relocated in the finance
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which marked the release of the national
infrastructure investment framework, was touted as the "end of
the beginning" when it came to actual infrastructure delivery.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the municipal services delivery, Mbeki said the
combined resources of central and provincial governments would
not be able to cover much more than half the capital costs in the
next ten years, which estimated to about 61 billion Rand (about
16 billion US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the amount would have to come from other
sources, such as local authority budgets, community contributions
and investment portfolios of major corporations, said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the government is now working together
with local authorities and government parastatals to find new
ways of organizing projects to give the private sector a role in
the different stages of planning, implementation, financing and
management.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Godfrey
Miyanda today urged both local and foreign investors to develop
leather industry to meet local demand.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president made the call while touring the Sido
Tanning and Leather Company in Kabwe, 150 kilometers north of
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said Zambia needed more finished leather to be used in
the manufacture of shoes and other leather goods for local market
and surplus for export.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy of economic liberalization would only
make sense if it was firmly based on local utilization of its
natural resources to stimulate productive activities, Miyanda
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed his government would support any investor in the
manufacture of leather goods.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda appealed to employees to work hard and make their
company profitable.
</P>
<P>
He was also happy to learn that there had been some research
and development in leather process in the tannery.

At present, the tannery's daily production has risen to some
350 hides from only 200 per day in the past several years.

<HEADLINE> IFP Launches Election Campaign in Kwazulu/Natal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) of South Africa today launched its campaign for local
government election in Kwazulu/Natal province, scheduled for May
29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 800 Inkatha supporters at a rally on the
Durban beachfront, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he was
confident his party would win the forthcoming poll.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi's speech was focused mainly on provincial autonomy
and the empowerment of people at the local government level.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the elections would be "the true test of
whether democracy will in the end survive in South Africa, or
whether we are destined to suffer a one-party state, ruled from a
small political aristocracy in Pretoria."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the consolidation of the African National
Congress (ANC) had led to the substantial destruction across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government would be able to rid the province of
crime and violence if it had more provincial powers, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence between the IFP
and ANC in Kwazulu/Natal since mid-1980s had claimed about 20,000
lives in the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to launch the IFP's election manifesto
earlier in the day, Buthelezi said Thursday's march through the
Johannesburg's city center by thousands of Zulus was a victory
for the Zulu nation and its tradition of carrying cultural
weapons.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, thousands of Zulus took to the streets of central
Johannesburg with full array of their cultural weapons to
commemorate the 1994 Shell House massacre, openly defying a
government ban on the carrying of dangerous weapons in public.
</P>
<P>
Nine Inkathazi supporters were shot dead by ANC security guards
outside ANC's Shell House headquarters on March 28, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said he had told President Nelson Mandela that a ban
on the public display of traditional and dangerous weapons could
not be enforced, saying nothing could stop Zulus from their
god-given power to carry their cultural accoutrements.
