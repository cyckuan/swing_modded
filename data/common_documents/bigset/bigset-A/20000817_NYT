<P>
   (LOS ANGELES) - You had to be here. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever want to find out what it's like to live in a police
state, attend a national party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your papers, please,'' the police and security folks are
constantly demanding at the Democratic National Convention. OK,
mostly they ask nicely, but the effect is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Your ``papers'' define you here. Where you can sit and stand.
Who you can talk to and when. Even which party - as in fiesta - you
can attend.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, delegates to journalists, is prodded and herded.
</P>
<P>
   Police and security are everywhere. They are everywhere on the
drive from the hotel to the convention center. They flank every
demonstration. Inside the convention center, they are standing and
gazing at everyone seemingly every few paces.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular item of personal adornment here is that thing
plugged into the ear that connects to Fearless Leader at security
central someplace.
</P>
<P>
   Your bags are inspected, your person detected for metal. My
laptop has been X-rayed so often it is developing a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Inside and outside, concrete barriers, wire fence and burly
muscle separate the privileged - those with credentials - from the
unwashed.
</P>
<P>
   Security, security, insecurity. And, of course, it is all too
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But, there really is nothing less democratic, small d, than a
party convention these days. Sadly, all the democracy has occurred
long before the delegates get here.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about those demonstrators, who have alternated between
being merely noisy to downright nasty.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague told me here that she doesn't ``get it.'' Times are
good. The economy is growing. Why are they beefing?
</P>
<P>
   I gave her an inadequate answer.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, much of it is simply rage-against-the-machine kind of
stuff, people with far too much time on their hands and not enough
gray matter between the ears.
</P>
<P>
   But, really, many are making a statement about the deification
of economics in our culture and in our political system and the
fact that it seems to have all gone global.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the placards rail against things seemingly distant and
arcane.
</P>
<P>
   But allow me to say it in a manner, I hope, that is far more
persuasive than a thrown rock. They are here to demonstrate their
disgust at how crass materialism and politics too often trump
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   They are saying people first. They are saying too many, even
under the Clinton administration, have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   That they say it badly does not mean it doesn't need saying.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Paul Rodriguez said it more comically at a convention
gala: ``You better make friends with the people who touch your food
first.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Jesse Jackson said it best Tuesday night:
``Politics ask, `Can I win?' - Morality and conscience ask, `Is it
right?'''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Clinton's swan song here Monday night:
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps the best of his lifetime. It highlighted all that
the Democrats say makes them different from the GOP. No surprise:
It described his own administration in glowing terms.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest accomplishment, however, has very little to do with
what he listed. Simply, history should remember him as the
extremely effective counterweight to a GOP Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be known, the GOP hates him more obsessively for that than
for any peccadillo.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us should merely thank him.

METS BULLPEN CAN'T SAVE THEM THIS TIME AGAINST ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bobby Valentine was talking before Wednesday night's
game about the importance of bullpens. The New York Mets' manager,
meeting with reporters, argued that an effective bullpen can
unburden a starting pitcher from the need to continually pitch deep
into games and can help an offense rally by holding an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to gush about the Mets and their bullpen after they
had swept a doubleheader from the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. But
Wednesday night, pitchers Glendon Rusch and Rick White created a
gap too wide to close with a rally.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' 7-5 loss to the Rockies cost them ground in both
playoff races.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having won 18 of their previous 22 games, the Mets are
struggling to dent Atlanta's first-place lead in the National
League East. Since the Braves had won earlier in the day, the
deficit grew to three games. And the Mets' grip on the NL wild-card
berth loosened just a bit, shrinking to four games over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets trailed by 7-1 entering the bottom of the eighth
inning. But Kurt Abbott led off with a home run and Edgardo Alfonzo
added a two-run homer with two outs to bring the Mets within three
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon, the Colorado starter, left for reliever Mike
DeJean, and Mike Piazza hit a sharp grounder through the left side.
Todd Zeile, whose eighth-inning homer Tuesday helped complete a
doubleheader sweep of the Rockies, then lined DeJean's 2-2 outside
pitch to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Piazza was running on the pitch and when center
fielder Juan Pierre's dive fell short, Piazza was going home. But
the ball died on the outfield grass and right fielder Larry Walker
threw to the cut-off man Jeff Frye. Piazza's feet-first slide broke
through catcher Ben Petrick's block to draw the Mets within two
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White replaced DeJean and struck out Robin Ventura looking
at an 0-2 pitch to end the inning and quiet the crowd. Ventura
slowly left the plate after speaking with Umpire Brian Runge.
Ventura wasn't alone in his displeasure. Eight batters struck out
looking Wednesday night, including six Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was charged with six runs in seven-plus innings, the most
runs he has allowed since he gave up seven on July 2 against the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Rick White had allowed only one run in his previous six outings
as a Met. Wednesday night, he had the misfortune of allowing a
run-scoring single to Bohanon with two outs in the eighth inning.
Bohanon had four hits this season before Wednesday night.

ANALYSIS: LIEBERMAN MUST DOWNPLAY PAST POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs 4th graf to correct spelling of `shtick')  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a new-model Joseph Lieberman, hurriedly
retooled to the specifications of a national campaign, who took the
stage here Wednesday night as the presumptive Democratic vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   No advocacy of school vouchers or the partial privatization of
Social Security, no criticism of affirmative action. No untrimmed
edges that might keep the party's core voters from supporting Al
Gore. Nothing that might dramatize the candidates' differences
rather than their agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman assured the
convention delegates in his speech. ``I know his record and his
heart. I know him as a public servant and I know what it is like to
sit with him around the dining room table. We have discussed _
sometimes even debated _ policy issues. And we have shared private
moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   There was talk about his family, about his immigrant
grandmother, his father's bakery route, his wife's family's
survival of the Holocaust. There was a helping of Jewish shtick.
There was a bow to bipartisanship _ ``our opponents are decent and
likable men'' and ``I am proud to call many in their party my
friends'' _ but also a careful enumeration of policy differences
between the rival tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But any new proposals will have to come from Gore himself on
Thursday night. For his part, Lieberman delved even less into the
nitty-gritty than Dick Cheney, his Republican opponent, did at the
Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of the vice presidential candidate (and the
vice president, for that matter), where the rules are simple:
Praise your master and mute your own views.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of his record, some people might have expected
something a bit more unconventional, from Lieberman, the
Connecticut senator, though probably unrealistically.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was a master at reconciling differences among
Democrats of varying stripes. But as William Daley, the chairman of
the Gore campaign, noted the other day, wearing his best Buster
Keaton deadpan, ``Clinton is not on the ticket this year.'' And
Gore has trouble enough with the party's base without getting into
more because of Lieberman's views.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of Democratic skittishness on this point that
Lieberman has backtracked on several points of importance to the
constituencies that the ticket needs to re-energize. But the
rejiggering could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a bit of a reputation for flip-flopping and
corner-cutting on issues like abortion and trade. Former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's opponent during the primaries, accused him in
January of ``using words in a very tricky manner.'' Gov. George W.
Bush, the Republican nominee, mocked Gore for having voted one way
on guns in the 1980s and another in the 1990s, adding, ``When it's
convenient politically, he changes his tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists hoped that Lieberman, who refused to
buckle when colleagues tried to dissuade him from criticizing
Clinton's sexual misconduct, would lend the ticket some
stand-by-your-guns luster. Much of that could be lost if Lieberman
seems to be bending to political expediency at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman began attacking that problem when they
visited the vice president's home town, Carthage, Tenn., almost a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' said Lieberman, ``when President Gore decides,
Vice President Lieberman will support him wholeheartedly.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president responded: ``I think it's a strength and not
a weakness, an asset, not a liability, to be able to have a
different point of view represented in the room at the time that
decisions are being made.''
</P>
<P>
   But that, they seem to have concluded since, was not quite
enough.
</P>
<P>
   There was a day when presidential nominees chose running-mates
who provided ideological balance. In 1952, Adlai Stevenson, a
Northern liberal, chose John Sparkman, an Alabama conservative, and
in 1976, Jimmy Carter, a Southern conservative, chose Walter F.
Mondale, a Minnesota liberal. But like so many old norms in U.S.
politics, that has gone by the board.
</P>
<P>
   This year, ideological identity is the real goal for the
Democratic ticket, much as the party may have flaunted its
ideological diversity in ``Liberals' corner'' Tuesday night. Vice
President Al Gore not only selected someone from roughly the same
segment of the party as he _ both have been stalwarts of the
centrist Democratic Leadership Conference _ but he and his aides
have sought to make sure Lieberman fell into line on all the major
issues.
</P>
<P>
   That took some doing, because on some issues, his position was a
bit to the right of Gore's. Not that Lieberman is a right-winger,
or anything resembling one. He may have had doubts about
affirmative action, for example, but he will be the first person
ever chosen for a national ticket who went to Mississippi to show
racial solidarity in the dark days of 1963.
</P>
<P>
   But take the matter of vouchers issued to parents by the federal
government, to be used to pay their children's tuition. In his time
as Connecticut's junior senator, Lieberman sponsored legislation
establishing experimental programs for vouchers. He voted for such
programs on at least four occasions. But vouchers are anathema to
the American Federation of Teachers and the 2.5 million-member
National Education Association, a pair of powerhouses that are
expected to pour money and manpower into the Gore campaign this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? After he was named by Gore, according to a report in
The Wall Street Journal, Lieberman called Sandra Feldman, the
leader of the teachers' federation, and promised that a
Gore-Lieberman administration would be resolutely anti-voucher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Lieberman voiced support for Proposition 209 in
California, a ballot initiative that ended racial and gender
preferences in state university admissions. The same year, in a
Senate floor speech, he said ``affirmative action is dividing us in
ways its creators could not have intended,'' and added: ``If you
discriminate in favor of one group on the basis of race, you
thereby discriminate against another group on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements like that helped to win Lieberman a reputation as one
of the least partisan, most civil and most thoughtful members of
Congress. But not among African-Americans, one of the groups Gore
must count upon.
</P>
<P>
   So this week Lieberman visited the Congressional Black Caucus to
assuage its members' concerns. ``I have supported affirmative
action,'' he told them. ``I do support affirmative action. And I
will support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he has retreated from the idea of allocating some
percentage of Social Security funds for investment by individuals _
a proposal, known as partial privatization, at the heart of the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1998 with the Copley News Service, Lieberman
said, ``I think in the end that individual control of part of the
retirement-Social Security funds has to happen.'' Gore stoutly
opposes that.
</P>
<P>
   But almost immediately after he was chosen by Gore, the senator
released an unpublished op-ed article entitled, ``My Private
Journey Away from Privatization,'' written at the behest of the
Gore campaign. In it, he said that the promises and the numbers
supporting the proposal ``don't add up.''

ASSEMBLY LEADER KNOWN FOR HIS HUGS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You could call him the Compassionate Californian.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Robert M. Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, loves to
hug. And after addressing the Democratic National Convention on
Wednesday, he waded into the California delegation to do the thing
that has become his trademark: hug. And hug and hug and hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's famous for hugging but, you know, he's very genuine,''
gushed Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, the first to
receive a lingering bear hug from the jovial lawmaker after he
spoke to the DNC about health care and presidential nominee Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-hour on the convention floor, Hertzberg clutched at
least a dozen people, some of them twice. That's one hug every
two-and-a-half minutes; barely enough time to clutch, release, take
a step and repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's who I've always been all of my life,'' Hertzberg said
between embraces. ``It's just how I relate to people. It gives a
warmth and a connectedness.''
</P>
<P>
   He has it down to a science: the bear hug, the shoulder-pat hug,
the cheek hug. And every once in a while, he even squeezes two
people at once.
</P>
<P>
   He mostly sticks to hugging people he knows, he said. ``If
they're Democrats, I'll hug them twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City, was treated to a hug
and even a quick back rub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he's one of the three most powerful people in the
state of California, he's still the same guy,'' Cardenas said.
``The hugs we get from him today are the same we got from him two
years ago and 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Jean Anderson, a Los Angeles delegate, also received an
embrace by Hertzberg. And she doesn't let just anybody do that.
``Some people I don't, but he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg, a Sherman Oaks lawyer who was elected to the Assembly
in 1996 and quickly became one of the Legislature's most
influential members, tailored his remarks Wednesday to health care
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore will, if elected, work to expand coverage for
treatment of mental illness, prescription drugs for older Americans
and health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to improving the health of all Americans, Al
Gore is just what the doctor ordered,'' he said. ``I know that when
the votes are counted, California is Gore country.''
</P>
<P>
   He shared the podium with his wife, Dr. Cynthia Tellis of the
UCLA School of Medicine. Tellis' father was the first Latino
ambassador for the United States, appointed by former President
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics all across the country are looking forward to once
again electing a great American who understands that in an era of
tremendous growth and prosperity, our greatest challenge is to
ensure that no community is excluded and that no American is left
behind,'' she said.

CLINTON AIDE CONFRONTS LAZIO ON TAX DISCLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTON, N.Y. _ Among the demonstrators greeting Rep. Rick Lazio,
the Republican Senate nominee, on a Harlem sidewalk on Wednesday
was a tall, bearish man dressed casually in khaki pants and a dark
golf shirt and clutching a couple of slips of paper.
</P>
<P>
   It was none other than Howard Wolfson, the communications
director and a top adviser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign, who came for one of the more unusual recent stunts
intended to tarnish Lazio's appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, responding to Lazio's quip Tuesday that he would
release his state income tax return in 15 minutes if Clinton did
the same (as a resident for six months, she would have no such
return), sought to thrust on him copies of Mrs. Clinton's property
tax bills from her home in Chappaqua. Disclosure of the $17,368.64
in payments on those bills, Wolfson reasoned, complied with the
spirit of Lazio's challenge, which followed repeated demands by
Democrats that he release his federal income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he says he can release them in 15 minutes, why doesn't
he?'' Wolfson asked reporters as he stood near a Democratic Party
operative dressed as Uncle Sam and shouted for Lazio to release his
tax return. Lazio has said repeatedly he will do so this month.
President and Mrs. Clinton released their return in April.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, told of Wolfson's presence after a speech at the National
Black Theater, did not acknowledge the visitor as he left behind a
curtain of police officers, who blocked Wolfson's way.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson declined to hand the papers to Patrick McCarthy, a Lazio
spokesman, as Lazio boarded his campaign bus to continue a tour
across the state that began Wednesday and concludes Monday.
Wednesday evening, he was at the Delaware County Fair here in
Walton.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign, seeking to rebut Lazio's questioning of
Clinton's character and integrity, has taken up the issue of his
not releasing his tax returns _ a ritual expected of candidates
these days _ as a way to question Lazio's own character.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, the episode highlighted the effort by
the Clinton campaign and its supporters to rain on Lazio's
campaign. Lazio's staff, in turn, has grown irritated at the
intrusions that they say only reinforce what they consider the
negative tenor of the first lady's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cheap political stunt,'' McCarthy said afterward,
asserting it only reaffirmed that Clinton could not produce state
income tax returns because ``she is not really from New York.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWs)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wolfson is not the only assistant to Clinton making his presence
known on the opponent's trail. Employing a common campaign tactic,
a young man from the Clinton campaign trails Lazio with a small
video camera at nearly all of the congressman's appearances,
without disrupting them. ( Lazio, who says he does not employ such
a tracker, has come to know ``Eric'' and even gave him a slice of
pizza and a transit fare card at a recent event.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is ``Uncle Sam,'' who has become a fixture at
Lazio's events this past week, with a Lazio spokesman wrestling him
away from the podium before Lazio began a news conference Monday.
And demonstrators from abortion rights groups have waved placards
questioning his commitment to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Clinton is often greeted at her appearances by
protesters from anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio received a mixed reaction in Harlem, one of the
traditionally Democratic areas he says his campaign will seek to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   As his bus approached the theater, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III,
pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, one of the most
influential in the city, tapped on the door and greeted Lazio, who
stepped off momentarily. Butts said he had made no endorsement in
the race and might not do so, but he had kind words for the
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found the Republican administration in the state of New
York has been extremely helpful for the things we have done here in
Harlem, as well as for the things we hope to do in the future,''
Butts said after embracing Lazio and inviting him to the church. He
said he had discussed Lazio's candidacy favorably with Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his largely autobiographical speech, Lazio sprinkled
references to Langston Hughes in his talk before 200 mostly elderly
residents gathered for lunch at a Harlem Week 2000 celebration.

   Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, D-Panorama City, was treated to a hug
and even a quick back rub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he's one of the three most powerful people in the
state of California, he's still the same guy,'' Cardenas said.
``The hugs we get from him today are the same we got from him two
years ago and 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Jean Anderson, a Los Angeles delegate, also received an
embrace by Hertzberg. And she doesn't let just anybody do that.
``Some people I don't, but he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg, a Sherman Oaks lawyer who was elected to the Assembly
in 1996 and quickly became one of the Legislature's most
influential members, tailored his remarks Wednesday to health care
issues.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gore will, if elected, work to expand coverage for
treatment of mental illness, prescription drugs for older Americans
and health insurance for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to improving the health of all Americans, Al
Gore is just what the doctor ordered,'' he said. ``I know that when
the votes are counted, California is Gore country.''
</P>
<P>
   He shared the podium with his wife, Dr. Cynthia Tellis of the
UCLA School of Medicine. Tellis' father was the first Latino
ambassador for the United States, appointed by former President
John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics all across the country are looking forward to once
again electing a great American who understands that in an era of
tremendous growth and prosperity, our greatest challenge is to
ensure that no community is excluded and that no American is left
behind,'' she said.

SO HERE'S THIS JEWISH GUY WHO GETS NOMINATED ... 
</HEADLINE>
  By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No doubt about it, Joseph Lieberman is a
trailblazer. Wednesday night he surely became the first
vice-presidential nominee in American history to begin his
acceptance speech with a mother-in-law joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying that behind every successful man, there
is a surprised mother-in-law,'' Lieberman, lifting his eyebrows for
emphasis, told a national television audience after being
introduced by his wife, Hadassah. ``I am here to tell you, It's
true.''
</P>
<P>
   That was just one of a string of borscht belt lines that
Lieberman has delivered in recent days. At a meeting of 200
Hispanic Democrats on Wednesday, he said he was thrilled when Vice
President Al Gore made that special phone call last week. But he
added, ``I'll be honest with you: I'd be excited if just about
anybody else called.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk of this convention has been comparisons between John F.
Kennedy's religion breakthrough 40 years ago and Lieberman's now.
But it may have been Henny Youngman, Rodney Dangerfield, Jack Benny
or any of the legions of other Jewish comedians, whose distinctive
humor has permeated the popular culture so thoroughly, who also
paved the way for Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Joe,'' said the comedian Al Franken, who picked
Lieberman as his own running mate in his recent faux presidential
campaign book, ``Why Not Me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe read the book,'' Franken said, ``and made up some bumper
stickers for an all-Jewish ticket. `Franken-Lieberman: No Pork, No
Bull,' and one for the angry white male voters, `Lox and Load.'
He's a happy fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point Wednesday, Lieberman welcomed Al and Tipper
Gore to the convention, meeting them at Burbank Airport with a
twist on Ronald Reagan's old standby line. ``I've been waiting for
a week to say this,'' Lieberman began, ``and I can't control myself
anymore. In this election, will you help me win one for the
Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to gay and lesbian Democrats at a caucus meeting, he
quoted his parents in an accent of pure shtick: ``When I went into
politics, my parents said, `You can make a living from this?'''
</P>
<P>
   And at the convention Wednesday night he brought down the house
by lambasting the Republicans with this line: ``Not since Tom Hanks
won an Oscar has there been that much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Daniel, a veteran movie producer here, said he was sure his
Jewish friends in the entertainment industry would appreciate
Lieberman's efforts despite his sometimes caustic critiques of the
moral content of their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood might take issue with some of his pronouncements,
and at the same time see its own roots in Lieberman's material,''
said Daniel, who said other Jewish friends in the business had told
him they would be going home early to catch Lieberman's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being facetious. That will surface quickly in the
brain of any Hollywood viewer. It's turning into quite a matter of
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say,'' Daniel added in a line of his own. ``We're
funny.''

EDITORIAL: WHAT JOE LIEBERMAN CAN DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for rewriting thruout)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   It was a long time in coming, but Wednesday night Vice President
Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut finally moved to
center stage at the Democratic convention. Gore's surprise
appearance at the podium in Los Angeles and Lieberman's emotional
speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination sought to move
the party beyond its tributes to the Clinton era and to present a
new ticket with its own agenda and less baggage. Lieberman's speech
was a blend of personal reminiscence and condemnation of Republican
policies. It was a forceful effort, clearing the way for Gore's
all-important address Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman has worked well for Gore, giving Gore
credibility as a risk-taker and tightening the polls. Since it also
stirred a few concerns in parts of the Democratic base, Lieberman
reached out to those groups in his speech. Addressing blacks and
liberals worried about his record on affirmative action, he spoke
of his family escaping tyranny in Europe and his lifelong fight
against discrimination. ``That's why I continue to say, when it
comes to affirmative action, mend it, don't end it,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Other traditional Democrats say they are worried about
Lieberman's centrist philosophy challenging liberal orthodoxy on
school vouchers and privatization of Social Security. In response,
Lieberman offered a robust attack on Gov. George W. Bush's approach
to government and spoke of the ``real differences'' with the GOP
nominees, whom he spoke of as ``decent'' and ``likable'' men. He
also signaled the possibility of some tough oratory to come. In
Philadelphia Bush had declared ``Don't mess with Texas,'' but
Lieberman drew cheers Wednesday night when he declared that for all
the Republican promises, Texas lagged seriously in health care and
cleaning up the environment. Scoffing again at claims by the Bush
campaign that he is actually closer to the Republicans, he
declared, ``I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric, but I wish
they would also change their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks on Republicans were designed to assuage Democratic
liberals about battles they actually lost when President Clinton
moved the party to the center. For the larger national audience,
Lieberman's appearance was intended as a signal that this ticket
was moving beyond Clinton's behavioral _ as opposed to his policy _
legacy. Lieberman's authority in this regard derives from his moral
bearing, embodied in his criticism of Clinton's conduct two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was a tricky exercise for Lieberman to assail
Clinton's conduct as immoral and also vote against his removal from
office, so has it been a balancing act for him to speak openly of
his deep religious conviction without crossing the boundary that
separates religion from the affairs of state. As the first Jew to
be nominated for vice president by a major party, he paid tribute
to his immigrant grandparents and to the ``only-in-America''
quality of his selection. Then he moved on to a combined moral and
economic message that will become a main Democratic theme. It is
not ``the size of our national feast that is important,'' he said,
``but the number of people we can fit around the table _ there must
be room for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the warmth of their response, the delegates in the
Staples Arena know that a vice-presidential choice rarely makes a
decisive difference. But a vice-presidential candidate can help
establish an aura of confidence around a ticket. Gore's supporters
can hope that the selection of Lieberman attests to the ability of
their nominee to think originally, shatter the old barriers of
prejudice and feel comfortable with challenging ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spoke fervently of his long admiration for and
friendship with Gore, as well as the ``private moments of prayer''
he had shared with him. But if Gore is to make an impression on the
public this week and walk out of the shadow of Clinton and the
waves of nostalgia that have washed over the convention since last
weekend, that work still belongs mainly to one person. His turn
will come Thursday night.

ROOKIE ENDS RANGERS' SKID AND ADDS TO HERNANDEZ'S 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ He sprinted off the mound after each inning
and jumped over the foul line. He buried his face in a towel once
he got to the first-base dugout and he tried to remain calm in a
tense setting. Brian Sikorski was throttling the Yankees in his
major league debut, stopping a team that has won three of the last
four World Series and a team that regularly antagonizes the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas right-hander could not think about the past
because he was worried about the present and whether he could
continue slipping and sliding past the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   While Sikorski was resilient in leading the Rangers to a 5-0
victory on Wednesday night, Orlando Hernandez had another subpar
performance and lost his third straight start since being activated
from the disabled list on Aug. 6. He has lost four in a row
overall. The last time El Duque won was on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski held the Yankees scoreless into the eighth. Hernandez
allowed four earned runs in seven innings and was hurt by left
fielder Luis Polonia, who made one error and should have been
charged with another in plays that helped lead to three Texas runs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the 96-degree temperature and humid conditions,
Hernandez (8-10) wore a long-sleeved shirt under his uniform.
Hernandez loves the warm weather and seemed comfortable while
retiring the first six Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Lamb led off the Rangers' third and battled the Yankee
right-hander in a nine-pitch at-bat. After Hernandez jumped ahead
with a 1-2 count, Lamb fouled off four pitches before lacing a 2-2
pitch for a single. The ball soared a few inches past Hernandez's
glove and into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez stalked around the mound and then threw a quick pitch
to Bill Haselman, which Haselman smacked for a single. Royce
Clayton's sacrifice bunt moved the runners to second and third, and
Luis Alicea punched a single to center that knocked in Texas' first
run.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro had been one for 19 against Hernandez before he
faced him in the fourth. Hernandez tossed a hanging slider to
Palmeiro and Palmeiro hammered it deep to right field.The only
question was whether Palmeiro's drive would remain fair, and when
it did, it made the score 2-0. It was Palmeiro's 391st career
homer, 35th on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   The game got messier in the fifth as Manager Joe Torre's
revolving door in left field hurt the Yankees. With two out,
Hernandez walked Alicea and gave up a single to Frank Catalanotto.
Rusty Greer hit a sinking line drive to left and Polonia, who
started his fourth game in left since joining the Yankees on Aug.
3, charged in and then stopped when he realized he would not be
able to catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But Polonia turned his head while the ball bounced and it
deflected off his leg and rolled to the warning track. Both runs
scored on a play that was generously scored a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski, who was 10-9 with a 4.04 earned run average for Class
AAA Oklahoma, was recalled after Ryan Glynn was put on the disabled
list. Glynn fainted in the dugout during his start last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski walked Derek Jeter in the first, but the Yankees
stranded him. David Justice singled and Tino Martinez doubled in
the second, but Sikorski struck out Jorge Posada and Scott Brosius
on 0-2 fastballs. Jose Vizcaino walked, but Polonia grounded out to
leave the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeter opened the third with a double, Sikorski retired 13
straight. The Yankees were 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position
against him.

FOR A FAVORITE SON, ALLEGIANCE ON DISPLAY IN NEW HAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ As this city's most famous resident, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, appeared Wednesday night before Democratic Party
delegates and a national television audience, many of his
supporters back in Connecticut gathered to watch and cheer him and
share what they all said was a visceral sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special feeling,'' said state Rep. Michael P. Lawlor,
one of about 80 Democrats gathered at Tycoons, a corner bar here,
to eat chicken wings and watch Wednesday's night's speech on a
rented large-screen television. ``Especially because two weeks ago,
you're trying to figure out which baseball game to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman strode on stage in Los Angeles and the applause
there and in the New Haven bar reached a crescendo, Lawlor added
derisively, ``Did this happen with Dick Cheney?'' Wednesday night's
bar party was thrown by state Sen. Martin M. Looney, a Democrat
from New Haven, who invited every party member he could find to
come and watch Lieberman address the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sense of celebration,'' Looney said inside the bar,
between backslaps and handshakes. ``This is the first time we've
had anyone from Connecticut on the presidential ticket.'' Wednesday
night's gathering, he went on, was to acknowledge ``a sense of
community and a sense of shared pride and getting ready for the
hard work ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman spoke of his family background and hammered away at
the policies of his Republican opponents, the partisan crowd here
cheered, sometimes longer and seemingly louder than the delegates
in Los Angeles. On the walls of the bar were several hand-drawn
posters announcing ``Liebermania'' and ``Mazel Tov Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   During the speech, Norma Rodriguez-Reyes, another New Haven
Democrat, beamed with pride. ``It was really intense, I felt like
we were part of the convention,'' she said afterward. ``I felt as
if we were all part of one big family here. This was a time when no
one recognizes any difference between us.'' Her favorite line, she
said, came when Lieberman acknowledged that ``behind every
successful man, there's a surprised mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   James D. Newton, a former New Haven mayoral candidate, clapped
enthusiastically for Lieberman as he strode off the stage. ``Joe
Lieberman made a powerful speech tonight,'' he said. ``I think he
made it very clear that there is a racial divide that separates
people in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others here, Philip Voigt, a New Haven alderman, said
he came because of a mixture of personal and political allegiance
to Lieberman. ``We've seen Joe move from being attorney general to
United States senator,'' he said. ``One of our own being selected
for vice president, it's real personal pride.'' And besides, he
said, ``Joe's son is in my wife's synogogue.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles down Interstate 95, in the Stamford living room of
Alex and Vita Lionetti, 10 of the senator's former Stamford High
School classmates were holding their own Joe Lieberman party.
Everyone in the Lionettis' living room had known Lieberman since he
won the ninth-grade class presidency, a year before he was voted
king of the sophomore sock hop, which he did not attend because of
measles (leaving the queen, Lionetti, to sit by an empty chair all
night).
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for Wednesday evening's speech, the Lionettis laid
out an array of cheeses and crackers on red, white and blue napkins
and paper plates and posted a few American flags and old
photographs of Lieberman on the walls. ``We got a little
patriotic,'' Lionetti admitted. As 10 p.m. drew closer, everyone
paged through high school yearbooks and settled in for a large,
nationally televised dose of Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great speech for Joe Lieberman, to try to let people
understand who he is,'' Lionetti said after Lieberman walked off
the podium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family items were probably the most telling,'' he went on.
``Sometimes you don't really hear him say a lot about himself. I
think a lot of people like to know the guts of a person, and I
think they really got to know Joe Lieberman as a caring person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lionetti, now an accountant in Stamford, heads the Class of
1960's annual reunion, which Lieberman makes a habit of attending.
Wednesday night was the 40th reunion planning committee's second
meeting (its first meeting was on the same day Lieberman and Gore
appeared together in Stamford last week.) ''Anytime we have a
meeting, something big is happening with Joe,'' Lionetti said.

GORE ARRIVES TO GET DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats nominated Vice President Al Gore for
president Wednesday night, after a parade of admirers _ including
his running mate and his daughter _ promised new opportunities for
prosperity for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While praising Gore in an address to the Democratic National
Convention, vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman also went
on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republican nominee George W. Bush, a self-styled
``compassionate conservative,'' of merely giving lip service to
people's needs and of neglecting environmental and health care
problems in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of appealing to a broad range of American voters,
Lieberman underscored the importance of family, hard work, hope and
prayer in his own life.
</P>
<P>
   He was interrupted several times by chants of ``Go, Joe, Go!''
from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, seconded her
father's nomination after Gore was nominated by actor Tommy Lee
Jones, a college roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff recounted several childhood experiences, including how
her father helped with late-night homework assignments and taught
his children how to build an igloo after a big snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Dad is a man of faith in the most gutsy, practical sense,''
she said. ``He wants to see goodness prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said her father wants to provide affordable health care,
give struggling single mothers a ``fair paycheck,'' protect the
environment and defend abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in every woman's right to choose _ and I know my
father will always, always defend it,'' she said, pointing out one
of the most emotional issues that separate Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After Schiff spoke, Gore made a brief appearance, his first in
the convention hall. He walked onto the podium to embrace his
daughter, wave to the crowd and shake hands with a few people
sitting nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of states followed, with Florida providing the
votes necessary to put Gore's nomination over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who roomed with Gore for four years at Harvard, discussed
the men's friendship, rather than politics, in his nominating
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his big issues concerning Gore were these: ``Are they
feeding him well? And will the stress of the job hurt him?''
</P>
<P>
   He answered his own questions: ``He has sense enough to eat well
_ and the stress is no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he was glad that Republicans had ``changed their
rhetoric, but I wish they would also change their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing that our opponent talks about
education. Schools need to be held to the highest standards of
performance and accountability,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   But, he contended, Bush's education plan doesn't provide enough
resources for schools to meet high standards.
</P>
<P>
   He also ripped into Bush for poor air and water quality in
Texas, for being governor of a state that ``ranks next to last for
health insurance for both women and children'' and for proposing
tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their (Republican) tax plan operates under the old theory that
the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see America's hard-earned surplus through a very different
set of eyes, the eyes of working middle-class families.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released from Austin soon after Lieberman spoke,
Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett said, ``Tonight, Senator
Lieberman took a page from Al Gore's playbook by misrepresenting
the facts about Governor Bush's record in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lieberman, the first Jewish candidate to run for vice
president under a major party banner, vowed to work to ``overcome
the differences that are still between us, to break down the
barriers that remain, and to help every American claim the
limitless possibilities of our own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he knew Gore's record and ``his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discussed _ often debated _ policy issues. And we also
shared private moments of prayer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut, drew on his own family's
experience to paint a picture of hope for Americans from
disadvantaged or modest backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   His father, he said, lived in an orphanage as a child and later
drove a bakery truck and owned a package store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught us the importance of work and responsibility. With
my mother by his side, he saw me become the first person in my
family to graduate from college,'' Lieberman continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that somewhere in America right now, there is another
father loading another bakery truck, or a young woman programming a
computer, or a parent dreaming of a better future for their
daughter or their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep the faith, then 40 years from now one of their
children will stand before a gathering like this, with a chance
like I have to serve and lead this great country that we love so
dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also reaffirmed his support for affirmative action, an
issue that raised concern this week among black Democrats.
Lieberman told black congressional leaders on Tuesday that his
position was misrepresented in a 1995 news report saying he
supported an anti-affirmative action proposition in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to affirmative action, mend it, but please don't
end it,'' he said, adopting a phrase President Clinton has used on
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his wife, Tipper, arrived earlier Wednesday at the
Burbank Airport, where they were greeted by a mariachi band and
enthusiastic supporters in an airport hangar. Lieberman and his
wife, Hadassah, also were at the airport to join the Gores.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ticket was greeted by Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan, a Republican, and California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by Tipper Gore, Lieberman quipped, ``In this election
will you help me win this one for the Tipper?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the airport crowd that his campaign is about bringing
``positive change to America.'' He said he was looking forward to
delivering an acceptance speech that will talk about ``hard choices
that I believe we have to make in order to ensure that we have a
bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You deserve to know exactly what the candidates are proposing
to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that he supported managed care reform, gun control,
raising the minimum wage and laws against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that portrayed Gore as a ``principled fighter'' for
such issues as education, health care and human rights and against
gun violence, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told
the convention that Gore ``could be the best president this country
will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Mayor Lee Brown, who once was drug czar in the
Clinton-Gore administration, addressed the convention Wednesday
afternoon, telling delegates that Gore was ready for the White
House.
</P>

BANKRUPT FURNITURE CHAIN TO QUIT CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAM PARK 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Heilig-Meyers, the nation's largest furniture
retailer, is pulling out of California as part of a Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   In connection with a restructuring plan filed Wednesday, the
Richmond Va.-based company said it would close 302 stores
nationwide and cut 4,400 jobs, including 81 stores and 1,200 jobs
in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of operating the Heilig-Meyers format, we determined,
was greater than what was economically feasible ... so we made the
decision to exit the state of California in its entirety,'' said
spokesman Barry Brockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also pulling out of Oregon, Montana, Washington
and Idaho and closing other scattered locations around the country.
After the closings, Heilig-Meyers will have 596 stores and 12,900
employees in 29 states.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Joel K. Havard of BB&AMP;T Capital Markets in Richmond, Va.,
said the furniture retail industry has seen growth from the low
single digits at the start of the year to the mid-single digits,
and on top of a higher interest rate environment, that's a pretty
solid performance. The loss of some Heilig-Meyers stores won't
change the picture much, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the largest furniture retailer in the country, but I'd
say it doesn't mean much at all except to Heilig-Meyers. There are
about 25,000 furniture retailers in our country, so Heilig-Meyers
might represent 2.5 (percent) to 3 percent,'' Havard said.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1913 and had some stores that needed
relocating worse than they needed remodeling, he said. Shutting
down whole divisions to concentrate in other areas is not an
uncommon retail strategy, but changing the credit product is a
massive departure for Heilig-Meyers, Havard said.
</P>
<P>
   Brockwell said outsourcing its in-house installment credit
program is a key part of the reorganization. It's a fundamental
change in the way the company does business, but it will eliminate
the need to finance its $1.3 billion in customer receivables. Part
of those receivables had already been sold to third parties, but
Heilig-Meyers was still servicing them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is claiming assets of $1.35 billion and liabilities
of $868 million. It reported a net loss of $15 million for the
quarter ended May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Subject to court approval, some $215 million in financing
committed by a group of lenders, cash raised by liquidating stores
and inventory, and lower operating and infrastructure costs after
store closings will enable the company to support its ongoing
operations, Brockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Heilig-Meyers is asking the bankruptcy court to allow it to
continue all services to customers, including delivery of current
orders. Some inventory issues could arise, but if the item is in
stock, delivery would just be a matter of court approval, Brockwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to liquidate its inventory and close its
stores within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Heilig-Meyers expanded into the West in 1994 and 1995, but
business didn't go as well as expected, Brockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp, said the California furniture retailing market is
very competitive and quite fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   Chains come in and flourish, then suddenly file bankruptcy,
Kyser said. Furniture inventory moves slowly, and it's very
difficult for a chain to tweak it to appeal to different tastes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough market,'' Kyser said. ``Somehow in Southern
California, it seems to be tougher than most. There is no clear
leader.''

Website: www.nytimes.com) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Albert Arnold Gore Jr., who steadfastly served as
vice president through an often tumultuous eight years, was
nominated for president Wednesday night after his running mate,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, introduced himself to America with a
forceful appeal on behalf of Gore and a muted rebuke of Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whose selection as Gore's running mate made him the
first Orthodox Jew on a major party ticket, offered a personal
testament to the vice president by saying they were so close that
they prayed together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Al Gore for 15 years,'' Lieberman said in his
prepared text. ``I know his record and I know his heart. I know him
as a public servant and I know what it is like to sit with him
around the dining room table. We have discussed, sometimes even
debated, policy issues. And we have shared private moments of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Making his case for the Democratic ticket _ and one against the
Republicans _ on the night he and Gore were to be formally
nominated, Lieberman said flatly, ``It's this simple: We Democrats
will expand the prosperity. They will squander it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's address was one of the most anticipated, and
consequential, moments of the four-night convention. The Gore
campaign has counted on the Connecticut senator to electrify the
ticket of a standard bearer who has struggled to galvanize even
loyal Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for all the interest in Lieberman is that he is
virtually unknown beyond his home state. Though he has been a
senator for 12 years, Lieberman, who is 58, is not nearly as tested
on the national stage as Gov. George W. Bush's running mate, Dick
Cheney, who had served as a congressman, White House chief of staff
and secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took a shot a the Republicans who gathered in
Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Republican friends tried to walk and talk a lot like us,''
he said. ``But let's be honest. We may be near Hollywood. But not
since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that much acting in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the largely glowing reception Lieberman has drawn, his
selection has unsettled some liberal Democrats because of his
centrist stands. On Tuesday, he met with black delegates to
reassure them that he supported affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday night, he sought to establish his
credentials as champion for minorities. ``In the early 1960s, when
I was a college student, I walked with Martin Luther King in the
march on Washington,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who had not been widely viewed by most Democrats as a
likely choice for Gore _ and was plucked out of obscurity only
eight days ago _ still seems a bit fazed by his newfound celebrity
and, perhaps, that Gore dared to pick a Jew. As he put it in his
opening line, ``Is America a great country or what?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before the program opened, Gore arrived here triumphantly,
stepping off Air Force Two for a rally at the Burbank airport with
Lieberman and their families. Only one day after President Clinton
embraced Gore in Monroe, Mich., as the inheritor of his political
legacy, the vice president moved to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future,'' Gore declared. ``Let others argue the case for the
old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive
change to the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if manufactured, the suspense Wednesday was inside the
Staples Center, where more than 4,000 delegates converged for the
ritualistic, but joyous, roll call of states to officially award
Gore his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore claimed enough delegates to put him over the top five
months ago, this remained a night of triumph _ and, at long last,
emergence _ for Gore. He represented Tennessee in the House for
nine years and the Senate for eight years, but has been best known
for his eight years of faithful service to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As did Cheney in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Lieberman used his
night in the spotlight to critique the opposition. He scolded
Republicans for putting forth what he portrayed as a misleading
festival of inclusion at its convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the GOP has changed their rhetoric,'' he said, ``but
I wish they would also change their policies. As my friend John
McCain might say, let me do some straight talking about their
record.''
</P>
<P>
   In the excerpts of his speech, Lieberman's taunts at the
Republicans were far more subtle than Cheney's had been against the
Democrats, signaling that Lieberman may not be as willing to play
the traditional running-mate role of attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that our opponent talks about education,''
Lieberman said. ``Schools need to be held to the highest standards
of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan
does not provide the resources our schools need to meet those high
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've read their plan. To me, it seems like their
idea of school modernization means buying a new calendar for every
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's often grueling primary race against Bill Bradley
and his high-profile assignments from Clinton, like running a
program to streamline the federal government, the vice president
remains something of a mystery to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It has become almost a cliche for people to describe Gore as
remote and hard to warm to. But Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's eldest
daughter and one of his closest political advisers, sought to alter
that perception by describing a warm-hearted, conscientious Al Gore
that the public does not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was a congressman, he listed our number in the
phone book in Carthage so the people he worked for could always
reach him,'' Schiff said in the prepared text of her speech
seconding Gore's nomination. ``During my summers on the farm, I
would answer the phone, and it would often be a constituent who
needed help getting his veterans' benefits, or finding the right
health care. I was taught to run _ not walk _ to get my dad so that
people wouldn't be kept waiting for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, who is 27, also spoke lovingly of her father. ``One time
he came home after a long day of hearings and meetings and votes
and found me struggling to begin that all-important elementary
school assignment: the dinosaur diorama,'' she recalled. ``He was
tired, but while my mom was getting the others to brush their teeth
and get in bed, my dad was the one who took me down to the store to
get the emergency Q-Tips, colored Play-Doh, and construction paper
because he was simply being a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader whom Gore had
considered as his running mate, also spoke to the personal side of
Gore. ``Al Gore is a good man,'' he said. ``He is a decent, caring
man. He listens to his heart and his head. He loves his family. He
loves this country. He could be the best president this country
will ever have.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, who was a treasury secretary under Clinton,
saluted Gore for his help in ensuring a vibrant economy. ``I worked
with Al Gore for six and a half years,'' he said. ``And he was a
powerful and effective force in all of the major economic policy
decisions that contributed so critically to this record. I was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also took some time to tell his personal story to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck,'' he said. ``About this time, he'd be getting ready
for the all-night run. I know that somewhere in America right now,
there is another father loading a bakery truck, or a young woman
programming a computer, or a parent dreaming of a better future for
their daughter or son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep the faith,'' he went on, ``then 40 years from
now one of their children will stand before a gathering like this
with a chance to serve and lead this country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, at least, Lieberman brought the Democrats a
wave of favorable publicity in the days leading to the convention.
By turning to Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to
aggressively repudiate Clinton for his affair with a White House
intern, Gore underscored his determination to shed the president's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the convention hall Wednesday, more than 20
delegates, one after another, said they had not known much about
Lieberman until last week. But many said they were impressed, even
thrilled, as they learned more about him.
</P>
<P>
   Eufaula Frazier, a delegate from Florida who is black, said she
also could relate to the historic nature of the Lieberman
selection. ``Forty years ago I was a beautician and we were all in
the shop watching the TV, so excited we were about Kennedy being
nominated,'' she said. ``The supply man came in and said it was
incredible, a Catholic in such a position. He said maybe one day it
will be a Jew. It is coming true tonight, and I get to be a part of
it.''

37 ARRESTED IN MARCH ON RAMPART STATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dozens of demonstrators were arrested in acts of
civil disobedience Wednesday after a march from MacArthur Park to
the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division to protest
police brutality and the Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 took part in the rally and march. Police said 37 were
arrested at the police station for blocking the building.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, spoke at MacArthur Park, a
day after he accused police of mishandling Monday night's protest.
He said he was working with police to maintain peace during the
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, protesters, including a large number of
Catholic workers, are being nonviolently arrested to symbolize what
they consider the injustices of police behavior,'' Hayden told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rampart Division, hundreds of police surrounded the area
and lined the rooftops as protesters banged a drum and called out
the names of those they said were victims of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also demanded that the LAPD, not taxpayers, pay for
any restitution to unjustly accused Rampart defendants. They also
want an independent Rampart review and the release of Alex Sanchez,
whom they call a political prisoner, threatened with deportation in
the wake of a Rampart arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Jacobs of Temple Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills
participated in the protest and said the police show of power was
very intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Yugoslavia to rescue soldiers with Rev. Jesse
Jackson,'' Jacobs said. ``I feel more threatened here than I did in
downtown Belgrade when the bombs were going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Many think the protesters are ``just unruly kids who are
angry,'' he said. ``They are not. They have a very powerful message
about the incarceration of people, the future of our children and
police fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   American Civil Liberties Union officials said they intend to
file a federal lawsuit against the LAPD for deliberately attacking
members of the media during the melee outside Staples Center on
Monday night. The suit was not filed Wednesday because federal
court was closed. An ACLU representative said the group would
attempt to file it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference at the nearby ACLU office, Chief Counsel
Michael Small said police who shut down a protest concert Monday
night went after the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD deliberately targeted members of the media, clubbing
and shooting them,'' Small claimed, saying he has received six
calls from reporters interested in joining in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish said he had not been briefed on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ludicrous to imagine the LAPD would target members
of the media,'' Kalish said. ``However, during the incident
following the rock concert, it may be possible that media who were
in the group were inconvenienced.''

ENTERTAINMENT, POLITICAL LEADERS DEBATE CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A star-studded panel of politicians and performers
chewed on what one called the ``hot-button issue of the moment'' _
media violence _ minus the man who helped force the debate and
whose presence on the Democratic ticket will give it new attention.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman was supposed to be
featured on a panel discussing violence in the media and its impact
on children held Wednesday afternoon at the Central Library. But
with his nomination speech scheduled just hours after the panel
wrapped up, Lieberman had to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, former Education Secretary William Bennett, a
Republican and longtime ally of Lieberman's on the Hollywood
morality issues, spoke on his behalf. Bennett joked that he had
``Joe's power of attorney'' to talk about what Lieberman has called
the ``revolt of the revolted,'' people upset by a raft of vulgar,
violent and crude programming on television, in movies and
elsewhere in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is an increasingly debased culture,'' Bennett said.
``There's a sense of a general lowering of culture. We'd also say
there's an awful lot of good stuff. But this whole area of popular
culture needs to be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``people should make their art, what they call their
art,'' Bennett said, ``we have First Amendment rights, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Sydney Pollack said he didn't disagree with Bennett but
``it's naive to think in a free market that if you have an appetite
(for violent, vulgar or sexual content), that it won't get
filled.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett opposed the v-chip, which is built into all new TV
sets and allows parents to block programming with mature ratings,
U.S. Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said such technological fixes will be
increasingly important as the options for viewing multiply in an
era where the television, Internet and computers merge into one
powerful programming box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Mother and Big Father in the living room need a way to
program their TV/computer so their 5-year-old is not seeing things
they don't want,'' Markey said. ``We have the technology, so what's
wrong with giving parents the tools?''
</P>
<P>
   Talk-show host Montel Williams, who avoids the sorts of tabloid
topics that dominate many of his competitors' shows, said a v-chip
isn't the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youth violence is at the same level it was at 20 years ago,''
said Williams, who criticized the explicit news broadcasts of such
sensational topics as the O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Rodney
King beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was under the guise of news, of justifiable violence. But
why do we have to worry about what's on TV when we have a button
that says off-on? We don't need v-chips. We need 'p-chips'
implanted in the back of parents' heads and making them reassert
their responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience included Bianca Jagger, Martha Plimpton, Harry

ENTERTAINMENT, POLITICAL LEADERS DEBATE CONTENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A star-studded panel of politicians and performers
chewed on what one called the ``hot-button issue of the moment'' _
media violence _ minus the man who helped force the debate and
whose presence on the Democratic ticket will give it new attention.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman was supposed to be
featured on a panel discussing violence in the media and its impact
on children held Wednesday afternoon at the Central Library. But
with his nomination speech scheduled just hours after the panel
wrapped up, Lieberman had to bow out.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, former Education Secretary William Bennett, a
Republican and longtime ally of Lieberman's on the Hollywood
morality issues, spoke on his behalf. Bennett joked that he had
``Joe's power of attorney'' to talk about what Lieberman has called
the ``revolt of the revolted,'' people upset by a raft of vulgar,
violent and crude programming on television, in movies and
elsewhere in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is an increasingly debased culture,'' Bennett said.
``There's a sense of a general lowering of culture. We'd also say
there's an awful lot of good stuff. But this whole area of popular
culture needs to be discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``people should make their art, what they call their
art,'' Bennett said, ``we have First Amendment rights, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Sydney Pollack said he didn't disagree with Bennett but
``it's naive to think in a free market that if you have an appetite
(for violent, vulgar or sexual content), that it won't get
filled.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bennett opposed the v-chip, which is built into all new TV
sets and allows parents to block programming with mature ratings,
U.S. Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said such technological fixes will be
increasingly important as the options for viewing multiply in an
era where the television, Internet and computers merge into one
powerful programming box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Mother and Big Father in the living room need a way to
program their TV/computer so their 5-year-old is not seeing things
they don't want,'' Markey said. ``We have the technology, so what's
wrong with giving parents the tools?''
</P>
<P>
   Talk-show host Montel Williams, who avoids the sorts of tabloid
topics that dominate many of his competitors' shows, said a v-chip
isn't the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youth violence is at the same level it was at 20 years ago,''
said Williams, who criticized the explicit news broadcasts of such
sensational topics as the O.J. Simpson murder trial and the Rodney
King beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was under the guise of news, of justifiable violence. But
why do we have to worry about what's on TV when we have a button
that says off-on? We don't need v-chips. We need 'p-chips'
implanted in the back of parents' heads and making them reassert
their responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience included Bianca Jagger, Martha Plimpton, Harry
Hamlin and ``Home Alone'' villain Daniel Stern, who teaches a media
education class three weeks a year to high school students and who
suggested to the panel that such programs be expanded to teach
teens how to decode media violence and other problematic messages.

U.S. FLAGS MAY NOT FLY HIGH IN SYDNEY

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They set a lot of records. They wore a lot of
bodysuits. They cried a lot of tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the warm, chlorine-filtrated cocoon of the Indiana University
Natatorium, the fastest swimmers that the country has to offer
entranced audiences at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials for eight
days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven American records fell, plus 23 Olympic trials marks.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the nightly standing-room-only crowd of swim
coaches, swim moms and swim dads, the Olympians-to-be could do no
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But tell me, mate _ can they take this act on the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about improvement,'' observed Mark Schubert, who will
coach the U.S. men's team in Sydney. ``Whatever happened here
really won't be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Schubert wasn't trying to rain on the patriotic parade. As a
celebration of American swimming, these trials pushed all the right
buttons and drained all the right tear ducts. Each evening session
began with a stirring sermon by a designated luminary from U.S.
swimming's golden Olympic past.
</P>
<P>
   (The trials' low-water mark: the introduction of the unfortunate
1976 women's team. The team manager, whose name I have mercifully
purged from memory, took the microphone and exhorted the crowd to
cheer ``these girls, who were cheated by the East Germans.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Schubert is right. For all of the water that got churned
here, will any of it mean anything when the Americans swim again,
one month from now, halfway around the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to improve,'' U.S. women's coach Richard Quick said,
soberly. ``I'm not exactly sure, but I think we're ranked No. 1 in
the world in one women's event \Ractually two\S going into the
Olympics _ the 800 free.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rest of the events, we've got to improve and swim
better than we ever have in our lives to have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After failing to ruffle the record book at the '96 trials, yes,
there were American records broken here, nearly one or two every
day. But note that no world records fell during the NBC-elongated
eight days of competition. And Quick's math isn't far from wrong:
Only four of the times posted here rank as the fastest in their
events heading into Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of the swimmers wore some style of bodysuit, you
could argue that the new suits influenced the number of American
records that were set.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, the bodysuit was a very good thing,''
Schubert said. ``But the jury is still out on that. Basically, this
meet was an experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, though, some people were swimming very, very fast
in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick tried to quell the concerns about the lack of world
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any world records in '96, and that women's team
still seemed to scramble away with seven gold medals,'' he sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but Quick's first words rang the loudest. To reap
anywhere near the golden haul of the Atlanta Games, which came in
front of a home audience, times need to be lowered _ in one month's
time _ nearly across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming has changed. While our U.S. college coaches were giving
out scholarships to German, Dutch and Canadian kids, all in the
name of winning a conference championship, the rest of the world
was reeling us in like a stuffed tuna.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest freestyle sprinter in the world is a Russian,
Alexander Popov. The fastest woman is a Dutch girl, Inge de Bruijn.
The favorite in the Olympic women's breaststroke will be a
Japanese, Masami Tanaka. And the odds-on, undisputed, most gifted
swimmer on the planet is Australian teen-ager Ian Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming has changed.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans lay an egg in Sydney, USA Swimming officials,
including Schubert and Quick, will be sternly second-guessed for
their decision to hold the trials only four weeks before the start
of the Games. The last time anything like that was tried, 1988 (in
Austin), only Janet Evans and Matt Biondi brought home individual
gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   The two coaches addressed that yesterday, but they gave only
vague reasons about taking advantage of ``the natural summer'' and
how it's nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   Quick and Schubert apparently wanted their best athletes peaking
for Sydney, not for Indianapolis. They know that the Australians,
competing in their most passionate sport, in front of 17,000 every
night, will be more than ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say,'' Schubert said, when asked to assess
what lies ahead for Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres, Gary Hall Jr. and
company. ``It's easy to race fast when you don't have the best in
the world, or the second- or third-best, swimming next to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In four weeks, we'll all find out.

38 ARRESTED IN MARCH ON RAMPART STATION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dozens of demonstrators were arrested in acts of
civil disobedience Wednesday after a march from MacArthur Park to
the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division to protest
police brutality and the Rampart scandal.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 took part in the rally and march. Police said 37 were
arrested at the police station for blocking the building.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, spoke at MacArthur Park, a
day after he accused police of mishandling Monday night's protest.
He said he was working with police to maintain peace during the
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, protesters, including a large number of
Catholic workers, are being nonviolently arrested to symbolize what
they consider the injustices of police behavior,'' Hayden told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rampart Division, hundreds of police surrounded the area
and lined the rooftops as protesters banged a drum and called out
the names of those they said were victims of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also demanded that the LAPD, not taxpayers, pay for
any restitution to unjustly accused Rampart defendants. They also
want an independent Rampart review and the release of Alex Sanchez,
whom they call a political prisoner, threatened with deportation in
the wake of a Rampart arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Jacobs of Temple Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills
participated in the protest and said the police show of power was
very intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Yugoslavia to rescue soldiers with Rev. Jesse
Jackson,'' Jacobs said. ``I feel more threatened here than I did in
downtown Belgrade when the bombs were going off.''
</P>
<P>
   Many think the protesters are ``just unruly kids who are
angry,'' he said. ``They are not. They have a very powerful message
about the incarceration of people, the future of our children and
police fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   American Civil Liberties Union officials said they intend to
file a federal lawsuit against the LAPD for deliberately attacking
members of the media during the melee outside Staples Center on
Monday night. The suit was not filed Wednesday because federal
court was closed. An ACLU representative said the group would
attempt to file it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference at the nearby ACLU office, Chief Counsel
Michael Small said police who shut down a protest concert Monday
night went after the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD deliberately targeted members of the media, clubbing
and shooting them,'' Small claimed, saying he has received six
calls from reporters interested in joining in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish said he had not been briefed on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ludicrous to imagine the LAPD would target members
of the media,'' Kalish said. ``However, during the incident
following the rock concert, it may be possible that media who were
in the group were inconvenienced.''

HALL LIKES CHANCES AT FREE SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Hall has close to world-class speed, but the
dead giveaway that the UCLA safety has track aspirations is this:
Like many of the world's best track and field performers, he
doesn't like the idea of entering a race he has little chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who hopes to contend for the NCAA 400-meter hurdles
championship next spring, put his track career on hold this fall
when he looked at the free-safety position and saw a field full of
also-rans. He is one of six candidates - ranging from fifth-year
senior Jason Zdenek (Chaminade of West Hills) to true freshman Ben
Emanuel - who are being looked at in the most wide-open job
competition on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to play was really important,'' Hall said.
``It's great to play football, but it's not worth giving up a shot
at the national championship in track if you're not going to
contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall worked with the first-team defense in Wednesday morning's
scrimmage - the Bruins' first in full pads - but Zdenek is still
atop the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are trying to get as good a look as they can at
Hall, who is one of the team's best athletes but hasn't played a
down since he was at Long Beach City College in 1996. He was on the
team in 1997, concentrated on track the following year and joined
the Bruins midway through last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting a crash course,'' said Bob Field, the secondary
coach and defensive coordinator. ``He's a very gifted athlete who
doesn't have a lot of experience. We're hoping he can help us.''
</P>
<P>
   To Hall, a 6-foot-1 185-pound fifth-year senior, this season
represents one last fling at football. His future, he believes, is
in track.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's time of 50.44 left him .01 shy of qualifying for the NCAA
finals and a knee injury at the end of June kept him from earning a
qualifying time for the U.S. Olympic Trials. Hall thinks a top-five
finish at the NCAA championships will allow him to go to Europe
next summer and run professionally.
</P>
<P>
   But an opportunity to play football this fall was too good to
run away from.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out there in track at a really big meet like Mt.
SAC, you might have 6,000 to 8,000 people there,'' Hall said. ``If
you have a game like Alabama or Michigan, you're going to play in
front of 80- or 90,000 at the Rose Bowl. And you're on national TV,
not Fox Sports West. It doesn't compare.''
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes for fighting: Ken Kocher, violating the
third-man-in rule, was kicked out of practice Wednesday morning for
coming off the bench to go after guard Eyoseph Efseaff, who had
gotten in a scrap with defensive end Sean Phillips. Kocher was
banished to the third team during the afternoon scrimmage.

VALDES WINS DESPITE LACK OF REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A guy walked up to Ismael Valdes in the Los Angeles
Dodgers clubhouse and told him he's starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go. Bring it on,'' Valdes said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? At least Valdes would have a day to rest, unlike
Wednesday when he was pressed into starting when Chan Ho Park
became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, went out and pitched five strong innings and the
Dodgers, powered by a group who call themselves the ``scraps,''
salvaged the finale of their three-game series against the Florida
Marlins with a 10-4 win at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes had started Saturday in Atlanta and pitched a mop-up
ninth inning in Tuesday's loss to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty awesome,'' Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw said. ``That's
exactly what you look for when a guy goes down. He took that ball
and stepped up. He might not have said that last year. He's matured
a little bit and he understands you're not always going to start,
you're not always going to relieve.''
</P>
<P>
   With a starting lineup that was missing Eric Karros, Mark
Grudzielanek and Adrian Beltre, the ``scraps'' brought energy to a
stale lineup. Eventually, the Dodgers broke it open with seven runs
in the eighth inning - more runs than they've scored in 21 of their
past 25 games - as Beltre came off the bench to deliver a three-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo had his second three-hit game of the season and
drove in a run and Dave Hansen tripled in two runs in the eighth
inning. Chad Kreuter, an honorary ``scrapper'' because he starts
much more frequently than Hansen, Santangelo or Jim Leyritz, added
two hits and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out to have fun, bring some energy,'' Hansen said.
``It's nothing personal, but guys needed some time off. I think it
was a good win all around for camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   The win, indeed, was something the Dodgers, losers of eight of
10 entering the night, needed. They end their road trip 2-4, but
they remain 6 games behind San Francisco in the National League
West.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was the big eighth inning that catapulted the
Dodgers (61-58) past Florida, it was the five innings Valdes
provided that set the stage. He was called upon again when he
learned Park was sent back to Los Angeles with flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen approached Valdes about starting,
and for the second time since being reacquired from the Chicago
Cubs less than a month ago, Valdes started a day after pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Claude, `I'm ready if you need me, either starting or
relieving,' `' said Valdes, who left with a 3-1 lead but wasn't
involved in the decision. ``I'm here to help the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   While Park flew back to Los Angeles earlier in the day to get
rest and possibly get ready for a start Saturday against the Mets,
provided he's healthy, Valdes took to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   He did a similar thing when he rejoined the Dodgers, facing two
batters in the first inning against Pittsburgh before rain
postponed the game. Valdes came back the next day and pitched four
solid innings, allowing two runs in a game the Dodgers went on to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful tough to be out there, pitch an inning, and come
back and pitch the next day,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson,
who added reliever Antonio Osuna wasn't available because of a sore
shoulder, putting a further burden on the bullpen. ``He impressed
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something the Dodgers, clinging to playoff hopes,
need. In three weeks with the Dodgers, Valdes has done more to
shatter his reputation as not being tough enough and not putting
the team first than he did in his previous five seasons with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Valdes allowed came in the second inning when Kevin
Millar doubled with one out and scored on David Berg's two-out
single. But Valdes, who allowed seven hits, got out of possible
danger in the third inning with a double play and was aided in the
fifth when left fielder Gary Sheffield threw Ramon Castro out at
second trying to stretch a base hit.

<P>
   ``When you're not used to (consecutive days), the mental aspect
is probably the toughest,'' Osteen said. ``But he's been very
positive since getting here. I think his stuff is getting better
each time out. I thought he did an outstanding job. I thought he
got better as the game went on. He started throwing a lot better
curveball. It's been breaking but missing power lately, and it got
a lot better.''

VENDT SETS U.S. RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Erik Vendt dropped his time 20 seconds in the
1,500-meter freestyle and almost drowned in the backwash. When the
USC sophomore won the metric mile at the 1998 outdoor senior
nationals, U.S. Swimming officials immediately branded him ``The
Next Great American Distance Swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Vendt wore the label like an albatross. He didn't come anywhere
near his personal best in the event last summer. When he failed to
make the finals at the Pan Pacific Championships in Sydney last
August, Vendt felt like he had hit rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Having sunk to such depths is what made his swim one year later
at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials all the more satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Vendt, 19, became the first American to break the 15-minute
milestone in the event. He was timed in 14 minutes, 59.11 on
Wednesday in the final race of the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials to
break the U.S. mark that George DiCarlo set at the 1984 Olympic
selection meet.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about ending with a bang; the subsequent fireworks display
inside IUPUI Natatorium that sent the 48-member Olympic team off to
Sydney seemed colorless by comparison. With his swim, Vendt
achieved the inconceivable on two fronts: He broke a barrier no
U.S. miler had come within four seconds of since 1984 and he stole
the spotlight from sometime model Dara Torres.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 33, who returned to the sport last year after retiring
in 1992, set an Olympic Trials record in the 50-meter freestyle to
edge Amy Van Dyken, 24.90 to 24.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know most of the fans came here tonight to see Dara swim the
50,'' Vendt said, ``but I think we put on a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Vendt was 3 years old when DiCarlo lowered the American record
to 15:01.51 (at which point Russia's Vladimir Salnikov already had
gone under 15 minutes). In the ensuing 16 years, Vendt, who clocked
a 15:10.50 in 1998, was one of only four Americans to advance to
within 10 seconds of the U.S. record.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Australia's Kieren Perkins was busy lowering the
global standard to 14:41.66.
</P>
<P>
   You can't approach 14:41 until you can conquer 15 minutes, which
is why swimming insiders were so quick to pin a nation's hopes on
Vendt when he entered DiCarlo's neighborhood in 1998. Little did
anybody - least of all, Vendt - suspect it would take another two
summers to break down the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I put a lot of pressure on myself,'' Vendt said. ``I
felt I had to do incredible stuff in practice every day. If I
didn't, I was really hard on myself. Swimming turned into a huge
burden. It wasn't fun at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Said USC coach Mark Schubert, ``Erik was so intense, he would
beat himself up emotionally if he didn't accomplish in practice
what he wanted to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Schubert, the head men's coach for the Sydney-bound U.S. team,
forced Vendt to swim behind one or two teammates on certain
freestyle sets at practice so his intensity couldn't lead him
astray.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy led Vendt right to where everybody thought he
belonged in the first place. ``It feels great to win and also to
break the American record,'' Vendt said. ``It's been my goal since
I started swimming the mile at 12 years old.''

YOUNGSTERS SPARK BURN'S WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A main reason for the Burn's inactivity Tuesday before
the Major League Soccer trading deadline was the faith Burn
higher-ups said they have in the future of their young players.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, at least three of those players made a strong case
for their status in the present.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Aleksey Korol scored two goals and first-year midfielder
Antonio Martinez, a second-half substitution, assisted on the
third, sealing a 3-0 victory against the Chicago Fire at the Cotton
Bowl. Second-year midfielder Lazo Alavanja also notched a secondary
assist on the second goal.
</P>
<P>
   The game represented a return to form for the Burn (12-12-4),
which had a less-than-inspired performance in its previous game and
had taken a 5-1 thrashing from the Fire in the teams' previous
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave the Burn an additional push into the playoff
picture, boosting its overall points to 40, one behind the
fifth-place Fire (12-9-5) heading into a 10-day break for the Burn.
Eight of 12 teams make the playoffs, and the Burn has four games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our young guys have been playing well lately,'' Burn
coach Dave Dir said. ``It's made a big difference for us.
Obviously, Martinez played well off the bench, and Korol played
extremely well tonight. And Alavanja did a great job of hanging on
and doing what he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Korol, who scored his fourth and fifth goals of the season, was
able to work himself into the lineup because leading scorer Ariel
Graziani (13 goals) is playing for the Ecuador national team.
Another key player, sweeper Jorge Rodriguez, was with El Salvador's
national team, but the Burn defense managed to hold up without him.
</P>
<P>
   That Chicago was without seven regular starters _ including
leading scorer Ante Razov (13 goals) and playmaker Diego Gutierrez
(13 assists) _ didn't help the Fire. The Burn went up 1-0 in the
25th minute, when Korol collected a long cross from midfielder
Oscar Pareja and streaked across the middle of the field. Korol
fired a blast from 25 yards out to the left corner, catching
goalkeeper Zach Thornton off guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire missed two prime opportunities to equalize, both coming
early in the second half. Bulgarian midfielder Hristo Stoitchov
knocked an easy finish wide, and forward Josh Wolff had a
one-on-one breakaway play stifled by Burn goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most significant two plays of the game were the
two chances we had to make the game 1-1,'' Fire coach Bob Bradley
said. ``That probably took more out of us than the first goal.''

COWBOYS SAFETY GEORGE TEAGUE WORRIES ABOUT JOB SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ With the pedigree of a high draft pick
and the resume of a journeyman, Cowboys free safety George Teague
admits his career has been somewhat of a conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Selected 29th overall in the 1993 draft by the Green Bay
Packers, Teague has been with four teams in eight years, including
the Miami Dolphins (1997) and Atlanta Falcons (1996). He is in the
third year of a second stint with the Cowboys. He also was with the
team in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the former Alabama star, who signed a four-year contract
extension with the Cowboys in the off-season, appears to finally
have a home.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys see Teague, 29, as a defensive anchor and are
counting on his leadership to help tutor the young cornerbacks this
season.
</P>
<P>
   However, Teague, whose paradoxical experiences have taught him
that things aren't always as they seem, says his main focus is
taking care of George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like have a selfish attitude,'' Teague said. ``In
the past I might be going out of my way to help a young buck out. I
got to worry about me, about George Teague. I'm not going to play
out of scheme, and I will do what I need to do to help out. But my
mind-set is what does George Teague got to do to keep his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking calmly and firmly while in his golf cart in front of
the cafeteria at Midwestern State, Teague's words were not guided
by emotions but by history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Cowboys gave the starting free-safety job to
second-year player Omar Stoutmire in training camp. Teague won back
the job in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Cowboys came to camp looking to insert Izell
Reese at free safety. Teague, however, won the job and started all
16 games.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed the best season of his career in 1999, posting a
career-high 102 tackles and intercepting three passes.
</P>
<P>
   His performance warranted a contract extension after the season.
And with Reese's future in question because of neck surgery, common
sense said the Cowboys would sign him to a deal without any
consternation.
</P>
<P>
   Teague got his contract, though the four-year, $3 million deal
is cheap compared with what other top safeties earn. He also hasn't
forgotten that the Cowboys hinted at his tenuous job security
during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Teague is not mad. He just says he's not naive. He said he
played well last year because he trained hard and took care of
himself. He plans to do the same in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm carrying that over,'' Teague said. ``I have to have the
same mind-set. Just because I have a new deal, I still know how the
negotiating went. I don't feel set. I know Izell can play. I'm not
going in thinking I'm comfortable, because I don't know. I really
don't know how much confidence the team has in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo, who was the defensive coordinator the
past five years, does not apologize for trying to get ``the best
player on field.'' He says the way Teague has battled for his job
has made him and the Cowboys better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think George has ever gotten the respect he totally
deserves,'' Campo said. ``The guy has been in the league a number
of years. He's been a big playmaker. But we are always looking to
improve in an area. George just keeps turning that thing back,
saying `I am a football player, and I can do this.' I'm happy about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary coach Bill Bates, citing Teague's hard-hitting play
against the Oakland Raiders on Sunday when he made a couple of
bone-jarring hits, including one that caused a fumble, calls the
braids-wearing safety a big part of the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Teague has heard the compliments before, but he dismisses most
of it as coach-speak. He knows that some guys have security and
some don't. He also knows that at one time he was part of the
``in'' crowd. Now he knows he's not.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't blame the Cowboys for his attitude or the
situation. Teague said he hasn't been comfortable since Green Bay
traded him to Atlanta before the 1996 season. The most embarrassing
moment of his career came when the Falcons cut him in training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   He then signed with the Cowboys and had a good enough season
that the Miami Dolphins signed him to a lucrative free-agent deal
in 1997. One year later, however, he was looking for a job again
and landed back with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain people you know they are going to be there ... Troy
\RAikman\S, Emmitt \R Smith\S, \RDarren\S Woodson,'' Teague said.
``But with George Teague and the Dallas Cowboys, you don't know. I
take it day by day. I signed a three-year deal in Miami and played
one year. I signed a contract with Atlanta and didn't play there at
all. Just because I signed a four-year deal here doesn't mean
anything. It's four one-year deals. This is the first trying to
make four.''
</P>
<P>
   To Teague, that is no mystery. nn

MAVS OWNER FINISHES TRADE, BUT ISN'T READY TO RELAX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Sleep has been hard to come by for Mark Cuban lately.
Brokering a nine-player, four-team trade that landed point guards
Howard Eisley and Dana Barros and forward//center Bill Curley has
kept the Mavericks owner up into the wee hours most nights the past
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did get to sleep early Tuesday night after putting
his first major trade to bed, but with 21/2 months to go before the
start of the season, Cuban is settling in for many late nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be done dealing until the day they turn out the
lights,'' Cuban said yesterday at a news conference announcing the
completion of the mega-trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who traded Robert Pack and John ``Hot Rod''
Williams to Boston and Bruno Sundov to Utah, have 17 players under
contract. The NBA allows 12 on the active roster and up to three on
injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs are still searching for a backup center with their
$2.25 million salary-cap exception, which was not compromised by
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban has often said that he's borrowing much of his ownership
strategy from fellow billionaire and Portland Trail Blazers owner
Paul Allen. Much like the Microsoft co-founder, Cuban is making
sure money _ and more specifically salary-cap issues _ don't stand
in the way of putting together the best team possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is not \Rto build\S the team with the fewest players
or the team with the optimal salary construction,'' he said. ``It's
the team with the best players that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban plans many more moves before the season starts. He has
already talked to Barros' agent about trading the 11-year veteran,
who has two bulging disks in his back, to another team of Barros'
choosing.
</P>
<P>
   And though Cuban is hoping to package several players and their
salaries for more established players with bigger contracts, much
like Portland, he's not worried about possibly bringing 17 players
to training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to have them compete and pick the best 12-15 guys.
If it means someone ends up getting cut that we have a guaranteed
contract with, that's OK,'' Cuban said. ``I'd rather face the risk
of having to pay a guy that we have to release, than not having
enough guys.''
</P>
<P>
   One training-camp battle Cuban eagerly awaits is that of Eisley
and Steve Nash, last year's starting point guard. After backing up
future Hall of Famer John Stockton for the past five years in Utah,
Eisley said he's ready to start but isn't taking anything for
granted in his competition with Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both going to push each other, and it's going to help
make both of us better players,'' said Eisley, who averaged 8.6
points and 4.2 assists last season. ``No one has guaranteed me
anything. I come here to help this team. If I start, great. If not,
that's great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said regardless of which player wins the starting job, the
Mavs settled one of their off-season goals _ depth at point guard.
Eisley received a seven-year contract for $41 million, with six
years and $35 million guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard brings playoff experience, Finals experience,'' Cuban
said, referring to the two trips the Jazz made to the NBA Finals.
``We saw what he did in the playoffs last year, single-handedly
trying to take over games. He's the type of player that we want.
He's the type of player the franchise hasn't had in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban put together the four-team trade, which involved
sign-and-trade deals for four of the players, with a tool
compliments of Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built a little \RMicrosoft\S Excel spreadsheet,'' Cuban
said, ``and I starting plugging in players and calling different
teams saying, `This fits and that fits, this works and this works.
I heard that you were looking for this guy and you were looking for
this guy.'' And all the pieces fell into place.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the talk of how Portland conducts business, Cuban sent
a friendly jab at a team that he hopes can become a true Western
Conference rival one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is I want a team that can hit a couple
shots up by 10 with eight minutes to go,'' he joked.
\Nsubheds:Nelson's goodwill mission Mavs coach//general manager Don
Nelson is in China working with Wang Zhi Zhi and the Chinese
national team. The Mavs are hoping to bring Wang, their 7-foot-1
second-round pick in 1999, to the NBA in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When in the future, I'm not sure,'' Nelson said on the phone
from China yesterday. ``What I need to do is get him focused to
become the best player he can before coming over. We haven't seen a
lot of growth in him the last year. When you don't play against the
best competition, it's hard to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson would like to see Wang gain 15-20 pounds and improve his
conditioning. The Chinese team has been scrimmaging against a squad
of former NBA players, including former Mavericks star Rolando
Blackman. \NtagtopArthur Garcia, (817) 390-7760

KAPLER'S STREAK RUNS OUT OF GAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers' Gabe Kapler spent the past two
days running on fumes, and on this night there would be nothing
left in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   That as much as anything spelled the demise of the longest
hitting streak in Rangers history.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's eighth-inning at-bat last night against Yankees
left-hander Randy Choate revealed an overaggressive, overanxious
hitter exhausted mentally by the toll of a 28-game hitting streak.
Kapler chased and swung through an 0-2 fastball out of the strike
zone that completed an evening of four hitless at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried my best to enjoy it, but the last couple of days were
tough,'' Kapler said. ``I felt like I was just kind of hanging
on.''
</P>
<P>
   His body language and recent at-bats suggested as much to
manager Johnny Oates and hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see it,''' Jaramillo said.
</P>
<P>
   One can only wonder what former Yankees great Joe DiMaggio went
through during his streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine 56,'' Oates said. ``We got halfway there.
We? I like the way I use the word ``we.'' It's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler sensed his streak in jeopardy before last night's game at
The Ballpark in Arlington. A headache annoyed him, and the
outfielder sensed mental exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took its toll,'' Kapler said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler drew a tough assignment to begin with Yankees
right-hander Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who entered last
night's game limiting right-handed hitters to a .228 batting
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's tough on right-handed hitters,'' Kapler said. ``The funny
thing is I felt really comfortable against him. I felt like I got
some good pitches tonight as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez induced a routine fly ball from Kapler during their
second-inning encounter and a ground ball during his fourth-inning
at-bat. Kapler's best swing resulted in a sixth-inning smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit that ball hard,'' Kapler said, ``but I hit it to the
wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter fielded the wicked short hop
cleanly and retired Kapler easily at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a good play,'' Kapler said. ``This is a game of
inches. We all know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler admitted afterward that his patience at the plate
dwindled recently as the mental fatigue began to mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's to be expected,'' Oates said. ``You only get so
many chances, and you want to make the most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates likely will reward Kapler with a break from tonight's game

games, the major leagues' best since Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero
hit safely in 31 games during the summer of 1999.

   ``I'm really proud of him,'' said Jaramillo, who worked
extensively with Kapler this season to rebuild his swing. ``There
was never a doubt that he was going to hit.'' nn

DAUGHTER PAINTS A LOVING PORTRAIT OF DAD
</HEADLINE>

By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore, months after clinching the
job, was formally chosen on Wednesday night as the Democratic
nominee for president after his eldest daughter described him in a
loving tribute as a man who ``wants to see goodness prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the applause for her speech died down, Gore came on
the stage to hug daughter Karenna Gore Schiff, waving to the
roaring, sign-waving, foot-stomping crowd that chanted, ``Let's go
Gore. Let's go Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The more than 20,000 delegates and Democratic activists meeting
in Staples Center erupted again when Gore went over the top to win
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration concludes tonight when Gore makes his acceptance
speech and prepares to face Republican nominee Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was officially nominated for the presidency by his former
college roommate, actor Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of people at this convention who will talk
about policy,'' the Academy Award-winning actor said, focusing
instead on anecdotes of their college years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can speak to this man's character. He is a good, decent,
loving man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a person with Al Gore's commitment. We need a
president with your heart, Al.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Schiff, however, who shined brightest for Gore on
Wednesday night with her warm recollections of a father who went
out of his way for his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always there for us ... and told us we could do
anything we worked for,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   And, she also pushed his belief in policy issues of health care,
equal pay, pollution and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope for the sake of our country and our future that my
father is elected president,'' Schiff said. ``I'm not asking you to
support Al Gore because he's my father or a great dad to his kids.
What really matters is what he will do for all our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In seconding the nomination and seeing her father selected as
the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Schiff took a bold
public step in the political life to which she was born and,
seemingly, to which she is destined.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, 27, is seen as the Gore campaign link to Generation X
and as a counterpoint to George P. Bush, the half-Latino nephew of
Republican nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, described as an energetic and candid campaigner for her
father, first became actively involved in political campaigning
during her father's second run for vice president after her
graduation from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   She helped him prepare for his 1996 debates against Republican
vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp and remained as an unofficial
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a political family, Schiff _ named after author Leo
Tolstoy's character Anna Karenina _ was 3 years old when her father
was first elected to Congress from Tennessee, following in his own
father's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years she would campaign with him, take telephone
messages from constituents and sit in on strategic meetings _
where, the stories go, she would sometimes correct her father or
his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, she said, she saw the impact of being an
elected official and became motivated to get involved _ but at the
backroom, strategic level of planning, developing and cultivating
voters.
</P>
<P>
   After the successful 1996 election, Schiff moved to Spain and,
like her father, went to work as a newspaper reporter for El Pais.
In 1997, she returned to the United States and worked briefly for
the electronic magazine Slate and then was married the following
year to a New York physician, Drew Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on July 4, she gave birth to a son and while taking
time off decided she wanted to play an active role in her father's
presidential campaign. She began by meeting with young people to
convince them of the need to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the trust her father places in her, that he agreed to
her suggestion to move the campaign from Washington, D.C., to
Tennessee. And, she advised him on his decision to select
Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   During this convention, she has been actively involved in the
planning and staging of the events on Wednesday _ including the
list of speakers _ as well as in tonight's session where her father
is to deliver his acceptance speech, which she also is said to have
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff is part of a one-two punch of her generation in the Gore
family. Her sister Kristin, 23, is to speak tonight. The two long
have been in the public spotlight, thanks mostly to an NBC-TV
``Saturday Night Live'' skit about the ``babelicious Gore girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have been actively courting the MTV generation,
stressing how issues such as Social Security and Medicare are as
important to the young as they are to the elderly, since the young
will have to pay to keep the system alive.

INTERNS GET EDUCATION IN WILDERNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gustavo Gonzalez always has been receptive to new
experiences. The 17-year-old encountered his share in the Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area outreach program this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was among five Wilson High students in the six-week
program designed to expose underrepresented groups to careers with
the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The students were selected to the inaugural program on
scholarship and aptitude. They assisted staff ecologists with
removing exotic plants and replacing dead plants and the
restoration of the Potrero Creek at Ranch Sierra Vista/Satwiwa.
</P>
<P>
   The activities also ranged from soil sampling to water-quality
monitoring to tracking bobcats, coyotes, reptiles and insects to
maintenance of the backbone trail and office work. They were easy
to spot wearing baseball caps and T-shirts with the National Park
Service insignia.
</P>
<P>
   For Gonzalez, a member of the Wilson Environmental Academy and
Environmental Club who will be a senior in the fall, the job in the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was a welcome
change from his internship at Cal Poly Pomona the previous summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us be like farmers, which was not very fun for me,''
Gonzalez said. ``I was hoping the job would be better than Cal
Poly. I am willing to try everything once. So once I try everything
here, I'll tell you what I like doing best.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Villalaba, 18, Kelly Trainor, 17, and Phillip Rodriguez
and Joe Rene Jimenez, both 16, were other program participants.
Like Gonzalez, all had an interest in the environment and applied
to the program to aid in choosing a college major.
</P>
<P>
   Through a grant of nearly $15,000 from the Public Lands Corp.
and matching funds from the National Park Service, the students
were paid an hourly salary of about $8. For most, it was their
first paying job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides this being a job, I have always been into the
environment, nature and mostly animals,'' Trainor said. ``I was
always curious what a ranger does and the different opportunities
there were. I hoped to understand more what this field of work
would be as well as having fun and getting out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's main interests are music and art but a career in the
National Park Service has become a strong candidate. He is
particularly interested in using his art skills to map parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like checking out all the stuff that is around and the
different places,'' Rodriguez said. ``Being able to meet new people
and make some friends out here is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The students worked Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
p.m., rising before sunrise to car pool for the 50-mile trip from
Los Angeles to report to duty at the visitors center in Thousand
Oaks. The round trip during rush-hour traffic averaged three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked a little sleepy in the morning, but I was
impressed about how hard they worked,'' said coordinator John
Tiszler, a plant ecologist at the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area. ``There were preconceived thoughts about
teen-agers, but I was surprised with their enthusiasm to be ready
to go after a long ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The program was designed to complement Wilson's Environmental
Science Academy, a cooperative program with the L.A. Unified School
District and the National Resources Conservation Service in which
the students learn plant, insect, fish and animal biology.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the summer, the students worked on group
projects. Each day, they elected a leader, who was in charge of
safety and breaks. But in the final weeks of the program, the
students were frequently separated to fill demands for their
service.
</P>
<P>
   On their final day on Aug. 11, the students were honored at a
luncheon and presented appreciation certificates by Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area Superintendent Art Eck.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were first planning this thing, there was concern
about them doing the same thing over and over again, but there was
a huge demand for their labor,'' Tiszler said. ``It got to the
point where people throughout the park were calling the day before
and asking if they were available.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiszler welcomes the students' return and would not hesitate to
hire them as seasonal employees. Funds permitting, he hopes to
expand the number of students next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a trial and in our eyes it was a great success,''
Tiszler said. ``We tend to call them interns, but they are much
more than volunteers. They are our official employees. They really
did a job for us, and the work they did was needed, which was good
for us and good for them to see the range of activities they might
be exposed to with the National Park Service.''

CUNNINGHAM LATEST COWBOYS QUARTERBACK WHO'S HURTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys yesterday re-signed former
Arena Fooball League quarterback Charlie Puleri to help them
through the preseason because of a mounting attrition at
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham, Troy Aikman's backup, has been found to have
bursitis in his throwing shoulder. Paul Justin, who is in a battle
with Clint Stoerner for the No. 3 job, suffered a right elbow
contusion in Sunday night's loss to Oakland. Both Cunningham and
Justin are getting limited work.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 37, doesn't consider the bursitis to be ``a
problem,'' while the Cowboys are ``just being precautionary about
it,'' coach Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this juncture, I'm not too concerned. I think Randall will
work \Rthe bursitis\S out,'' said owner Jerry Jones, who is
comfortable in knowing that the 15-year veteran has had bursitis in
the same shoulder before.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham has demonstrated that he can throw the ball further
than any quarterback in camp. But the arm has made more than 4,400
throws in NFL games, and that doesn't count preseason games and
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Puleri, 30, went through the team's off-season workout programs
before being cut June 8]. Puleri was brought back because he knows
offensive coordinator Jack Reilly's system. Puleri will be on the
practice field this morning.
Enough for Ogden Frustrated by two separate foot sprains that have
held him out of training camp, wide receiver Jeff Ogden put on his
uniform yesterday afternoon and tried to practice. His bid was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our \Rmedical\S decision,'' Dave Campo said. ``He's not
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach can empathize with the third-year player who starred
for the Rhein Fire in NFL Europe before suffering the first of his
two foot sprains late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough sitting there, I know,'' said Campo, who earlier in
the day said at his daily news conference: ``Jeff obviously has
fallen farther and farther behind just because he's not out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo added, ``But he has a track record in NFL Europe and with
us, so we'll be a little bit more lenient in hoping he shows us
something relatively quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo is hoping to see Ogden in the final preseason game Aug. 24
against St. Louis.
Briefly ... Tight end Chris Smith lasted five days with the
Cowboys. He was waived yesterday after driving in from Washington,
where he earlier had been cut by the Redskins. Three free-agent
tight ends remain in the Cowboys' search for a third tight end who
can play behind either Jackie Harris or David LaFleur. The audition
became necessary when Mike Lucky suffered a season-ending knee
injury July 30 against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Erik Williams participated in both team
practices yesterday, after just observing his first day back in
camp.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Albert Arnold Gore Jr., who steadfastly served as
vice president through an often tumultuous eight years, was
nominated for president on Wednesday night after his running mate,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, introduced himself to America with a
forceful appeal on behalf of Gore and a muted rebuke of Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whose selection as Gore's running mate made him the
first Jew on a major party ticket, delivered a personal testament
to the vice president, saying they were so close that they prayed
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is a man of courage and conviction,'' Lieberman said.
``He believes in service to America. He volunteered for Vietnam.
Together, we crossed party lines to support the Gulf war. I was
there in the room when I heard him forcefully argue that America's
principles and interests were at stake in Bosnia and Kosovo. That
wasn't easy. He had the guts to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ceremonial, but joyous, roll-call of states to ratify
Gore's nomination, Florida put him over the top just before
midnight ET, surpassing the 2,170 votes needed for the nomination.
The Democrats were signaling their intention to make Florida a
battleground in November.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the actual vote, the hall exploded in chants of
``We want Gore!'' when the vice president, unannounced, stepped
briskly on stage from a submerged stairway to embrace his eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, after she seconded his nomination
with a personal testament to her father. After waving to the roars
of the more than 4,000 delegates, the vice president strolled off
stage with his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The address by Lieberman, who will formally be nominated on
Thursday, was one of the most anticipated, and consequential,
moments of the four-night convention. The Gore campaign has counted
on the senator to electrify the ticket of a standard bearer who has
struggled to galvanize even loyal Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for all the interest in Lieberman _ who was
introduced by his wife, Hadassah, on Wednesday night as ``just a
regular Joe'' _ is that when he was plucked by Gore eight days ago
he was virtually unknown beyond his home state of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been a senator for 12 years, Lieberman, who is 58,
is not nearly as tested on the national stage as Bush's running
mate, Dick Cheney, who had served as a congressman, White House
chief of staff and secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman dutifully took on Bush and the Republicans, but
without the hard edge of Cheney, who in his own acceptance speech
two weeks ago at the Republican convention in Philadelphia bitterly
ridiculed Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this simple,'' Lieberman said flatly. ``We Democrats will
expand the prosperity. They will squander it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's half-hour address was less a traditional attack on
the opposition and more an American tale of the senator's life
story. As Lieberman stepped to the rostrum, the hall swelled with
music from the film ``Chariots of Fire'' _ the story of two track
stars, a Jew who fought anti-Semitism to win an Olympic medal and a
Christian who refused the importunings of the King of England to
run on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he was embarking on ``a miraculous journey,''
Lieberman first reached back to his own family's odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Lieberman remembered his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was raised in Central Europe,'' he said, ``in a village
where she was often harassed because of the way she worshiped God.
And then she immigrated to America.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved on to his parents, Henry and Marcia Lieberman. ``My
father lived in an orphanage when he was a child,'' Lieberman said.
``He went on to work in a bakery truck and then owned a package
store in Stamford, Conn. He taught my sisters and me the importance
of work and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to his mother in the audience, he said, ``Mom is 85
years old, but I'll tell you, she never felt younger than she feels
today.''
</P>
<P>
   He progressed to the 1960s, describing himself as an early
champion of civil rights. He was seeking to establish his
credentials as a champion of minorities because of concerns among
some black delegates that he did not adequately support affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1960s, when I was a college student,'' he said,
``I walked with Martin Luther King in the March on Washington for
jobs and freedom. That was my honor. That was my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general of Connecticut, he said, ``I worked to be
the people's lawyer. I went after polluters who were spoiling our
water and our air.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he spoke of Hadassah, his wife, whose family, he said, was
``literally saved by the greatest generation of American G.I.'s who
liberated the concentration camps.''
</P>
<P>
   While his delivery was earnest yet unadorned, it drew
enthusiastic applause from the delegates. And his effort to
reassure African Americans _ he was proceeded on stage by Rep. John
Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights hero _ seemed to meet with some
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about his civil rights record,'' said Virginia
Rollins, a black delegate from Virginia. ``If anyone had doubts
about where he stood, he took care of that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond telling his story, Lieberman drew contrasts between his
party and the Republicans. And he skipped over the fact that he is
viewed as hewing to more moderate positions on a range of issues
than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a shot at the Republicans who gathered in Philadelphia
two weeks ago, Lieberman said, ``Our Republican friends tried to
walk and talk a lot like us. But let's be honest. We may be near
Hollywood. But not since Tom Hanks won an Oscar has there been that
much acting in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who had not been widely viewed by most Democrats as a
likely choice for Gore still seemed a bit fazed by his newfound
celebrity and, perhaps, that Gore dared to pick a Jew. As he put it
in his opening line, ``Is America a great country or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Before the program opened, Gore arrived here triumphantly,
stepping off Air Force Two for a rally at the Burbank airport with
Lieberman and their families. Only a day after President Clinton
embraced Gore in Monroe, Mich., as the inheritor of his political
legacy, the vice president moved to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future,'' Gore declared. ``Let others argue the case for the
old guard. We're the new guard, and we're going to bring positive
change to the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if manufactured, the suspense on Wednesday was inside the
Staples Center. While Gore claimed enough delegates to put him over
the top five months ago, this remained a night of triumph _ and, at
long last, emergence _ for him. He represented Tennessee in the
House for nine years and the Senate for eight years, but has been
best known for his eight years of service to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While his speech was not devoted to critiquing the opposition,
as was Cheney's, Lieberman did scold Republicans for putting forth
what he portrayed as a misleading festival of inclusion at its
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that the GOP has changed their rhetoric,'' he said,
``but I wish they would also change their policies. As my friend
John McCain might say, let me do a little straight talking'' about
their record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing that our opponent talks about education,''
Lieberman said. ``Schools need to be held to the highest standards
of performance and accountability. But I'm sad to say their plan
just doesn't provide the resources our schools need to meet those
high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's often grueling primary race against Bill Bradley
and his high-profile assignments from Clinton, like running a
program to streamline the federal government, the vice president
remains a bit of a mystery to the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   It has become almost a cliche for people to describe Gore as
remote and hard to warm to. But Schiff, one of Gore's closest
political advisers, sought to alter that perception by describing a
sweet and conscientious Al Gore that the public does not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was a Congressman, he listed our number in the
phone book in Carthage so the people he worked for could always
reach him,'' Schiff said, seconding Gore's nomination. ``During my
summers on the farm, I would answer the phone, and it would often
be a constituent who needed help getting his veterans' benefits, or
finding the right health care. I was taught to run _ not walk _ to
get my dad so that people wouldn't be kept waiting for a moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's name was put in nomination by Tommy Lee Jones, the actor
who was one of his roommates at Harvard. Jones also tried to warm
up Gore's image by attesting to the Gores' relationship, ``To this
day,'' he said, ``when they come to our house, they sit in each
other's laps. They hold hands. They even smooch occasionally _ like
the kids they have always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, a Treasury secretary under Clinton, saluted Gore
for his help in ensuring a vibrant economy. ``I worked with Al Gore
for six and a half years,'' he said. ``And he was a powerful and
effective force in all of the major economic policy decisions that
contributed so critically to this record. I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, at least, Lieberman brought the Democrats a
wave of favorable publicity in the days leading to the convention.
By turning to Lieberman, the first Democratic senator to
aggressively repudiate Clinton for his affair with a White House
intern, Gore underscored his determination to shed the shadow of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in the convention hall on Wednesday, dozens of
delegates, one after another, said they had not known much about
Lieberman until last week. But many said they were impressed, even
thrilled, as they learned more about him.
</P>
<P>
   Eufaula Frazier, a delegate from Florida who is black, said she
could relate to the historic nature of the Lieberman selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago I was a beautician and we were all in the shop
watching the TV, so excited we were about Kennedy being
nominated,'' she said. ``The supply man came in and said it was
incredible, a Catholic in such a position. He said maybe one day it
will be a Jew. It is coming true tonight, and I get to be a part of
it.''

BOEING TO ANNOUNCE EMPLOYMENT SHIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. will announce an emerging plan tomorrow
to close some Puget Sound area operations and retrain and transfer
hundreds of workers within the region but not cut jobs, a source
familiar with the plan said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Boeing would close a 300-worker small-parts
assembly facility on Harbor Pointe Boulevard near the company's
huge Everett, Wash. manufacturing plant and shut down its
300-employee machine shop in Kent, Wash. Workers in both plants
would be moved to new jobs in the area, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   While no employees are expected to lose their jobs under the
plan, other more dramatic steps are possible in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the plan, which a company spokesman warned still might
change, Boeing would name its plant in Wichita,Kan. a ``center of
excellence'' for tooling, a move that would preserve 2,000 tooling
support jobs in the Seattle area and require the retraining of an
additional 350 tooling workers in the region, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to comment,'' John Kvasnosky, Boeing
spokesman, said last night. ``These things change literally up to
the last minute. When we are ready, we are going to communicate to
our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials in Wichita told a reporter there last night they
expected to be briefed today. The union officials said they did not
know about the plan last night.
</P>
<P>
   The plan arrives after months of rumors that the world's leading
airplane manufacturer was preparing to close a major facility in
the Puget Sound area. For example, one rumor suggested the company
would sell its Auburn, Wash., parts facility.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been reviewing its operations with an eye toward
boosting efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The plan isn't as dramatic as some workers feared. However, the
International Association of Machinists is concerned about the idea
of moving and retraining union workers, according to Bill Johnson,
president of the International Association of Machinists District
Lodge 751.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been sitting on the edge of their
seats,'' Johnson said. ``We are going to continue to fight for each
and every job in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   They could have a future fight. Peter Jacobs, an analyst at the
Seattle-based investment firm of Ragen MacKenzie Inc., said the
plan represents a good first step in the Puget Sound area toward
greater efficiency, but the company could easily take other steps
in the region in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps don't sound dramatic enough to represent the only
(moves) we should expect in the Puget Sound region,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps demonstrate Boeing is committed to making
incremental improvements in its operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, Boeing put a St. Louis manufacturing unit
on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   The move was the latest and one of the strongest signs in recent
years that Boeing was serious about shedding underused plants and
assets as it strives to become a leader competitor in the aerospace
business.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale also left 1,665 Missouri-based employees in
limbo, although Boeing said any buyer would be expected to hire
most of the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, Boeing executives have stressed that
they must re-evaluate what the company sells. These statements and
the St. Louis sale, as well as steps to consolidate operations in
Boeing's Delta rocket program have fueled the fears of Boeing
workers in the Puget Sound region.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Boeing, and at other manufacturers nationwide are
examining operations because they believe it could be cheaper to
buy certain parts than produce them, Frederick Zimmerman, a
professor of manufacturing systems engineering at the University of
St. Thomas, said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Academics have highlighted Ford Motor Co., PepsiCo Inc. and
Coca-Cola Co. as high-profile firms companies that which have shed
less- profitable enterprises. For example, Ford spun off its
parts-making arm, Visteon Corp., in June.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging Boeing plan comes after the Machinists the largest
union at Boeing, launched a public and private lobbying campaign
designed to press Boeing to discuss their plans and keep jobs in
the Seattle area.

 PIG CLONING BRINGS PAYOFF, BUT RAISES CONCERNS  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pigs have been cloned for the first time using methods that may
lead to an important new source of human-like organs for
transplant, scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The birth announcement of genetically identical piglets came
from two independent research teams, each using different
techniques refined from past cloning experiments in sheep, cattle,
mice and goats.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcements were tempered by another scientific report
highlighting the risks of ``xenotransplantation.'' The report
warned that hidden diseases may be transferred from pigs to people
along with life-saving organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some potential risks here,'' said Dr. Daniel Salomon
of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, senior author of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the significance of the research, Salomon's study
and one of the other cloning-experiment reports were released by
the British journal Nature Wednesday in advance of regular print
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The second report on cloning research was originally slated to
appear Friday in Science, but editors of that journal also agreed
to release the report early so that all three studies would come
out at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Authors of the Nature cloning study include scientists
affiliated with the Scotland-based company PPL Therapeutics, which
was formed to commercialize the technology that gave birth to
Dolly, the famous cloned sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Advance word about Salomon's study led to speculation in the
financial markets earlier this week that PPL and researchers
affiliated with Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif., were backing
away from xenotransplantation research. PPL issued a statement
Wednesday that ``reaffirmed'' its commitment to the field, although
the company said it will be at least four years before clinical
trials can commence.
</P>
<P>
   Geron, meanwhile, said it is ``refocusing'' its investments in
cloning-related research but denied it was backing off due to
medical risks.
</P>
<P>
   Safety concerns already have led U.S. regulators to impose tight
restrictions on xenotransplant experiments, while some experts are
advocating a blanket moratorium on clinical trials. Research also
has been complicated by ethical considerations involving the use of
animals as organ donors.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts insisted that while such concerns must be taken
seriously, cloning offers one of the few practical solutions to the
critical problem of organ shortages.
</P>
<P>
   About 72,000 people are awaiting organ transplants of various
kinds, including nearly 16,000 awaiting livers and 46,000 in need
of kidneys. Only a small fraction of those on the waiting lists
find a donor match.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of cloning, combined with genetic engineering
techniques, suggests that ordinary barnyard animals might someday
be transformed into walking organ factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moon shot of liver transplantation,'' said Alan
Brownstein, president of the American Liver Foundation. ``The need
is staggering, and pursuing this type of research is critically
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigs are considered an ideal species because they can be grown
quickly to roughly human size and are relatively free of pathogens
capable of causing disease in humans.
</P>
<P>
   However, pig reproductive biology presented some daunted
technical problems for cloning pioneers. Only a single success in
pig-cloning experiments had been reported until Wednesday,
involving laborious methods considered impractically difficult to
duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the results reported Wednesday, no one suggested it
will be easy to make pig cloning anything more than a laboratory
novelty any time soon. Dr. Ryutaro Hirose, a transplant surgeon at
the University of California at San Francisco, said the cloning
experiments amounted to ``a small step forward'' in light of other
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Most pressing, he said, is the need to find ways of manipulating
the pig's genetic machinery in a much more subtle fashion than can
be done now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can introduce new genes into a pig, but we can't yet knock
out specific genes,'' he said. ``Pigs make all kinds of proteins
that essentially are pig versions of our own proteins. The trouble
is those are not the kind of proteins you really want in your
body.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cautionary Nature study, Salomon, the Scripps researcher,
and his colleagues showed for the first time that an infectious
agent called porcine endogenous retrovirus, or PERV, can infect
mice genetically engineered with a condition similar to
immune-suppressed human transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was found to move around in the mouse bloodstream and
infect other organs as well beyond the transplant site. However,
the infection induced in the mice did not lead to any disease
symptoms, and the same could be true in humans, Salomon said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the research may help speed progress in the
xenotransplant field by giving scientists a way to study
cross-species infections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's every reason to believe the mouse is a good model,''
he noted. ``We need to keep the field moving forward.''

 BEYOND THE ISLAND, A LINE IS DRAWN  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's not often I get to break a major news
story, but here it is:
</P>
<P>
   Alameda is creeping into San Francisco. Could be devastating to
property values.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Weixel says he was listening to radio KFOG and the morning
crew asked a listener this question: What is the eastern-most point
of land in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The person answered ``Treasure Island.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Correct!'' said the radio guys.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Weixel says he has heard that a tiny corner of
the Old Alameda Air Station creeps over the S.F.-Alameda boundary
line that runs north-to-south through the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   I checked with the San Francisco office of Thomas Bros., the map
people. They put Michael Delano _ ``our map expert'' _ on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Delano says a tip of the air station, ``ever so
tiny, maybe two square blocks,'' spills over into San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So in Alameda, there is a here there.
</P>
<P>
   THANK YOU, Rat Boys:
</P>
<P>
   Those laboratory scientists who continually find new ways that
good things are bad for you (``Cancer linked to breathing'') have
found a new way that a good thing is good for you.
</P>
<P>
   For un-young guys, the researchers found, sleeping more helps
reduce love handles and double chins.
</P>
<P>
   Deep sleep produces growth hormones that in a lot of ways make
you younger and more athletic.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, gym; hello, hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can develop rock-hard abs to go with your rock-hard
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   But they say you may need help to achieve that deeper sleep.
Maybe a six-pack of beer? I'm starting my deep-sleep program
tonight by watching Al Gore's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDLY SKIES keep their distance:

<P>
   Steve Cannata is in L.A. and says that if you spend time
wondering about the intangible qualities that make United Airlines
the company it is, you might ponder the sign he saw on the door of
the United ticket office at 6th and Grand, about a half mile from
the big convention:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are enthusiastic supporters of the Democratic National
Convention and wish to do everything we can to help L.A. serve as a
good host. This office will be closed Monday, Aug. 14 through
Thursday, Aug. 17.''
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WOODS tees off Thursday in the PGA Championship, and you
have to wonder if the kid is over the hill. At last week's Buick
Open, Tiger won a measly $57,240.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Bristol wonders, ``Does Tiger's bank assess him a surcharge
when he makes a deposit that small?''
</P>
<P>
   What deposit? Tiger probably used that check to floss his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   CONCRETE GOD: The folks at Cody's bookstore in Berkeley were
worried that nobody would show for Tony Hawk's book-signing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk is the king of skateboarding, in town for the X Games, but
the signing had been rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Word got out. Kids were lined up around the block, and superstar
Tony couldn't have been cooler, signing boards and books (``Hawk _
Occupation: Skateboarder'') and posing for pics.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys get all the luck. With a name like Tony Hawk, what
could he have been but a skateboard god? If you're a Tony Hawk, you
don't drive a bread truck.
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE N0. 1: The broad-brushers will tell you that Palo Alto
is all wine-sipping dot-commers with golden retrievers that drive
Porsches.

   ``I would like to point out,'' points out Bill Bucy, ``that
Rudy's Pub on University St. in downtown P.A. is No. 1 in Santa
Clara County in smoking citations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucy also notes that the Rudy's attitude is well-expressed in
its newspaper ads: ``Buy 10 beers ... get 10 beers.''

   FRONTIER JUSTICE: The Police Log of the Half Moon Bay Review
(thanks, Dick Alexander) reports that a young man was 86'd from the
Half Moon Bay Inn for intoxication, after punching a bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``When police attempted to contact the man, he ran and was
sprayed by a skunk.''
</P>
<P>
   CARMEL DRAGGED into the 20th century:
</P>
<P>
   Carmel's postal folks, under pressure from a group of citizens,
has agreed to deliver mail.
</P>
<P>
   This is in Carmel-by-the-Sea, the city's charming inner city.
</P>
<P>
   The way it has always worked is that Carmel-by-Sea homes have no
addresses and no mail delivery. You pick up your mail at the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of addresses, many homes have names, like ``My Reward,''
``Living Right'' and ``Xanadu.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the City Council approves, you will have the option of
home-delivery or the old pick-up system.
</P>
<P>
   This means war. The anti-delivery forces could ramrod (that word
is illegal in Carmel, by the way) into law a prohibition on any
kind of box being placed in front of a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That probably will happen,'' says Daryl Glen. ``At Carmel
construction sites, people cover their porta-potties with tasteful
wooden lattices.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if the porta-potties have names? ``Think Tank.''
``Xanadoo.'' ``My Reward.''

 NEEDIEST GET GUARANTEE OF COLLEGE FUNDS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Under a landmark deal cut by lawmakers and Gov.
Gray Davis, the state is committing at least $1.2 billion in grant
money to guarantee that low-income high school graduates can go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the state's neediest students who meet grade
requirements have the right to receive a grant from the state for
community colleges, campuses in the California State University and
University of California systems or private four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant increase in access to higher
education since the GI bill,'' said John Mockler, Davis' cabinet
secretary for education. ``There is no state in the country doing
anything comparable to this.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Davis described the agreement as
``historic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a major modification of the so-called Cal Grant program. In
the past, an established amount of money was set aside for grants,
and when it ran out, otherwise eligible students got no aid.
</P>
<P>
   Now if a student meets the eligibility criteria, the state will
give him or her a grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk into any high school in this state and say to a
poor kid that just because you're poor doesn't mean you don't have
a chance. If they have the grades, they get money for college,''
Mockler said.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is expected to reach 30 percent of the students
attending California high schools. When Davis took office last
year, there was enough Cal Grant money to reach 17 percent of those
students.
</P>
<P>
   The grants are available to students whose families have no more
than $45,400 in assets. The income ceiling varies, based on the
size of students' families.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a student with five family members and an income of
$68,700 would qualify. As family size drops, so does the income
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Students earning up to $23,500 on their own are also eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Students fitting income and asset requirements who earn a 3.0
grade point average or better would be eligible for grants that
range from a maximum of $1,428 for CSU, $3,249 for UC and $9,703
for a private university such as Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Students earning a 2.0 average would get a grant of up to
$1,551, which they could use to pay for textbooks and other
incidental costs at community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time students enrolled at least half-time _ six credit
units a semester _ would also qualify for grants.
</P>
<P>
   Students have within a year of high school graduation to apply.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is students who complete community college within
five years of high school graduation and who have the grades to
move on to four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was championed in the Legislature by Senate President
Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make a real difference in a lot of lives,'' Burton
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also embraced the idea, even though they rarely
support entitlement programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What distinguishes this from other entitlements is that the
receipt of the benefit is based on merit, and it requires the
recipient to fulfill their potential,'' said Sen. Chuck Poochigian,
R-Fresno. ``It's not a crutch or a giveaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans backed the plan for more personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about hope. My parents were dirt poor. They used to
tell me growing up how they wanted to go to college but didn't have
the money,'' said Assemblyman Rod Pacheco, R-Riverside. ``That's
not going to happen anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor initially opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He backed a $71 million increase in money for the Cal Grant
program in his budget proposal _ which did not include the
educational guarantee _ far less than lawmakers had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   To win Davis' support, Burton linked the Cal Grant to another
Davis-backed bill giving $1,000 merit scholarships to students who
score in the top 10 percent of their school on aptitude tests or in
the top 5 percent statewide.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis had vetoed one of the bills, the other would have died
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Burton also told Davis that because of unanimous GOP support,
the governor might risk an override if he vetoed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Burton and Davis negotiated during the past month and finally
reached an agreement earlier this week that narrows the scope _ and
cost _ of the program, but maintains the guarantee of an education
to needy students.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, a new category of grants also is created.
</P>
<P>
   Burton calls them ``redemption'' grants. They are intended for
students who did not go to college within a year of high school
graduation but later enrolled in community college and those who
have been working and want now to attend college.

 LIEBERMAN EXHORTS AMERICANS TO `OVERCOME DIFFERENCES'  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marveling that ``only in America'' could a Jewish
baker's son aspire to help lead his nation, an awed Joseph
Lieberman called on Americans Wednesday night ``to overcome the
differences that are still between us ... and to help every
American claim the possibilities of their own God-given lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As every faith teaches us ... we must, as Americans, try to
see our nation, not just through our eyes, but through the eyes of
others,'' said Lieberman, accepting his party's vice presidential
nomination before a panorama of cheering delegates in the Staples
Center last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my eyes, I've seen the goodness of this great country
through many sets of eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third night of the Democratic National Convention,
delegates formally selected their presidential ticket, Al Gore and
Lieberman. Gore made an unexpected visit to the hall, delivering an
exuberant bear hug to his daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, after she
formally nominated her father for president.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening's spotlight clearly belonged to Lieberman, the
first Jewish candidate on a presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago we came to this city and crossed a new
frontier,'' said the Connecticut senator, in a reference to the
nomination of John F. Kennedy in Los Angeles the last time
Democrats met here. ``I believe the next frontier isn't just in
front of us, but inside of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman entered the hall to a deafening ovation and set the
tone with his opening line: ``Is America a great country, or
what?''`
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were a clear departure from those of his GOP
counterpart, Dick Cheney, who acted as a partisan attack dog for
his party two weeks ago in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Lieberman opted for an often reverent,
conciliatory, and sometimes humorous tone aimed at outlining the
divide between Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Calling his GOP opponents ``decent and likable men,'' Lieberman
said there are ``very real differences'' between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be near Hollywood tonight, but not since Tom Hanks won
an Oscar has there been that much acting in Philadelphia,'' he
said, as the hall erupted in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   He chided the GOP for what he said were failures in policies
affecting education, health care, environment and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore and I are the only candidates in this race who will
extend health care coverage to every single child in America,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their idea of school modernization means buying a new calender
for every school building,'' he said. ``We are committed to making
America's public schools the very best in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the more emotional moments of his speech, Lieberman
talked of his family's immigrant roots and his own opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will we dream for our country ... and how will we make it
come true?,'' he asked. ``It's not just the size of our national
feast that's important ... but the number of people we can fit
around the table. There must be room for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for barriers to be torn down ``on race, and gender and
sexual orientation,'' saying, ``In America, every time a barrier is
broken, the doors of open opportunity grow wider for every single
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``when it comes to affirmative action, mend it, but please
don't end it,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman reached out to undecided and independent voters who
are crucial to his ticket's election. ``For those of you at home
who haven't made up your mind how you're going to vote in this
election, if you want to build on prosperity, if you want progress,
not partisanship in Washington, if you want to reform the system
and not retreat from the problems, then ... your choice is clear:
Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   And addressing his own political differences with Gore,
Lieberman said, ``We have discussed, often debated, policy issues
... and we've often shared private moments of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates appeared transfixed as Lieberman humbly thanked the
country for his latest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I try to see this world as my dad saw it from his
bakery truck,'' he said. ``I know that somewhere in America right
now, there is another father loading a bakery truck, or a young
woman programming a computer, or a parent dreaming of a better
future for their daughter or their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep the faith, then 40 years from now one of their
children will stand before a gathering like this, with a chance to
serve and lead this country that we love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's acceptance address came on a day Gore made a
triumphant entry into Los Angeles, met by hundreds of roaring
supporters as Air Force Two touched down at Burbank Airport. Gore
was greeted by Gov. Gray Davis, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
and Lieberman as he concluded a campaign trek across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vice president gave a hint of themes for his own
acceptance speech tonight, saying he would talk about ``specific,
hard choices that I believe we have to make in order to ensure that
we have a bright future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said teacher pay, minimum wage, health care, hate crimes,
gun control and the environment would be part of the issue-packed
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future starts in California, the victory starts in
California,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, too, roused the supporters with his own cheer, a
takeoff on a popular GOP chant: ``Let's win this one for the
Tipper!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was nominated by his former Harvard roommate, actor Tommy
Lee Jones, and Gore's daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Poised and personal, Schiff tried to give Americans a more
intimate side of her father, saying, ``I would be supporting my dad
for President even if he hadn't raised, fed, clothed, taught and
loved me _ and even if he hadn't accepted more late-night collect
calls from me that I'd ever like to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to support Al Gore because he is my father,
or even because he's been a great dad for his kids,'' she said.
``What really matters is what he will do for all our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, entered the hall to a huge ovation
and thousands of blue and white ``Hadassah'' signs. And in an
emotional speech, she introduced Americans to the man she
affectionately called ``my Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Joe, family, faith, neighborhood, congregation and
community are the guideposts of his life,'' she said. ``It reminds
him of the republic he serves: one nation, under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al Gore chose my husband as a running mate, this country
got a man whose mission in life is inspired by the people he
serves,'' she said to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman himself engaged in a busy day of campaigning
Wednesday, appearing before delegations of Hispanic, Asian-Pacific
and gay and lesbian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And he confirmed in an interview with the Associated Press that
_ as the race moves into its crucial post-Labor Day period _ he
will withdraw from the campaign for several days in the coming
weeks for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   It is a period in which Jews observe some of the holiest days of
their religious year, which include Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New
Year that falls on September 30, and Yom Kippur, the day of
atonement, which this year is Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to do what I've always done and work extra hard
on the days that I'm campaigning,'' Lieberman said. ``Al Gore is a
man of faith, and he respects my faith and my observance and he's
been very clear that he doesn't want me to vary from my traditional
practices and I won't,'' Lieberman said.

GORE ARRIVES WITH CALL FOR `THE BEST AMERICA'

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif _ On the eve of the most important speech in his
political career, Vice President Al Gore arrived in town Wednesday
to a cheering hero's welcome, greeted by hundreds of party faithful
who are counting on him to keep the White House in Democratic hands
for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the Democratic ticket ``the new guard,'' Gore spoke
briefly at Burbank Airport, where he was joined by his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and local dignitaries including Gov.
Gray Davis and Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's time for all of us to come together and lift up
the ideal of the best America that we can move toward,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future. Let others argue the case for the old guard. We're
the new guard, and we're going to bring positive change to the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Perspiring profusely as he spoke inside a hot airport hangar on
another sizzling day, Gore relished the reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with the Liebermans, we are looking forward to being
here in Los Angeles. The future starts in California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Gore steps into the limelight as he accepts
the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention.
The speech, which he has been thinking about for the past three
months, is particularly critical because he is behind in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the Republicans, he said, his speech would
contain specific policy details. He gave a taste to the airport
crowd, setting out his agenda in sound bite-size declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Among his goals, he said, are raising the minimum wage; giving
doctors, rather than HMOs, more medical decision-making authority;
giving senior citizens a prescription drug benefit under Medicare;
passing a hate crimes law; getting guns out of the hands of
children and criminals; and cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have dubbed this week's events the Gore
``reinvention convention,'' scoffed at Gore's speech. They said his
liberal policies are a shift from the more conservative positions
he held as a senator, designed to win votes rather than express his
true beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has had more upgrades than Microsoft Windows,'' said
Terry Holt, spokesman for Victory 2000, a Republican National
Committee campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years in office, he has left the American people
confused about him, whether he has convictions, what his positions
on issues are. And over the last couple of weeks, the picture of Al
Gore has become even more complicated. He walks a razor edge
between holding on to the charm of Bill Clinton even while he knows
he needs to separate himself from Bill Clinton's liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As for declaring himself the ``new guard,'' Holt said, ``His
opening a new chapter begs the question: What were you doing in the
last chapter? According to Bill Clinton, he's the most influential
vice president in history. Where have you been for the last eight
years, Mr. Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived with his wife, Tipper, and daughters, Karenna Gore
Schiff and Kristin. As he got off the plane, he embraced a line of
local officials who included Davis, Riordan, actor Sean Penn, Los
Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke; state Sens.
Richard Alarcon and Jack O'Connell; and Los Angeles Councilmen
Michael Feuer and Alex Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   As he strode up to the podium, the South Gate Middle School
mariachi band struck up a Mexican folk tune called ``Relampago'' or
``lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Gore worked the crowd for a half-hour, shaking
hundreds of hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go, Hey, can I get a high-five? and he said `Yeah,' and we
just smacked hands,'' said a smiling Tina Jasiukonis, a preschool
director from Sherman Oaks. ``I thought it was great. I'm in the
best mood right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle, Romas Jasiukonis, similarly got a chance to shake the
veep's hand, but he later revealed a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning close to a reporter, he confessed in a low voice, ``I'm
a Republican. She dragged me in here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to vote for Bush, to which his niece replied:
``You just think you are. I'm gonna take you around on voting day,
too. Come on _ today was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he agreed. ``It was.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, Gore, Lieberman and their families traveled by
motorcade down the street to Warner Bros. Studios, where they were
greeted by their home state delegations from Tennessee and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Hart's band played at the party, as actor Martin Sheen
and other cast members of NBC's ``The West Wing,'' which is
produced on that lot, signed autographs for delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, normally a critic of Hollywood, referred to the show
when speaking of the Republican nominee: ``The closest George Bush
will get to the West Wing is a remote control!''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had been scheduled to speak later that afternoon at a
panel discussion at the Los Angeles Central Library on the issue of
media violence and its impact on children, but he backed out in
order to work on the convention speech he delivered Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was a Republican, former Education Secretary
William Bennett, who spoke on his behalf to rail against what
Lieberman has in the past called the ``revolt of the revolted'' _
or those upset by increasingly violent and obscene content in the
entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lieberman met with a series of minority
caucus groups _ Latinos, Asians, gays and lesbians _ to convince
them he is on their side, despite his reputation as a centrist
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   To the gay and lesbian group, the senator said he supports
hate-crimes legislation. He received a standing ovation when he
said he opposed the Clinton's administration's ``don't ask, don't
tell'' gays in the military policy.
</P>
<P>
   And he told the Latino delegates that, as opposed to the
Republicans, ``we're not faking anything'' when it comes to the
party's racial and ethnic diversity.

GORE ARRIVES WITH CALL FOR `THE BEST AMERICA'
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif _ On the eve of the most important speech in his
political career, Vice President Al Gore arrived in town Wednesday
to a cheering hero's welcome, greeted by hundreds of party faithful
who are counting on him to keep the White House in Democratic hands
for four more years.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring the Democratic ticket ``the new guard,'' Gore spoke
briefly at Burbank Airport, where he was joined by his running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, and local dignitaries including Gov.
Gray Davis and Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's time for all of us to come together and lift up
the ideal of the best America that we can move toward,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation, we have to make the hard choices between
one direction or another, between going back to the past or forward
to the future. Let others argue the case for the old guard. We're
the new guard, and we're going to bring positive change to the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Perspiring profusely as he spoke inside a hot airport hangar on
another sizzling day, Gore relished the reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with the Liebermans, we are looking forward to being
here in Los Angeles. The future starts in California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Gore steps into the limelight as he accepts
the presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention.
The speech, which he has been thinking about for the past three
months, is particularly critical because he is behind in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with the Republicans, he said, his speech would
contain specific policy details. He gave a taste to the airport
crowd, setting out his agenda in sound bite-size declarations.
</P>
<P>
   Among his goals, he said, are raising the minimum wage; giving
doctors, rather than HMOs, more medical decision-making authority;
giving senior citizens a prescription drug benefit under Medicare;
passing a hate crimes law; getting guns out of the hands of
children and criminals; and cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have dubbed this week's events the Gore
``reinvention convention,'' scoffed at Gore's speech. They said his
liberal policies are a shift from the more conservative positions
he held as a senator, designed to win votes rather than express his
true beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has had more upgrades than Microsoft Windows,'' said
Terry Holt, spokesman for Victory 2000, a Republican National
Committee campaign organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years in office, he has left the American people
confused about him, whether he has convictions, what his positions
on issues are. And over the last couple of weeks, the picture of Al
Gore has become even more complicated. He walks a razor edge
between holding on to the charm of Bill Clinton even while he knows
he needs to separate himself from Bill Clinton's liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   As for declaring himself the ``new guard,'' Holt said, ``His
opening a new chapter begs the question: What were you doing in the
last chapter? According to Bill Clinton, he's the most influential
vice president in history. Where have you been for the last eight
years, Mr. Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived with his wife, Tipper, and daughters, Karenna Gore
Schiff and Kristin. As he got off the plane, he embraced a line of
local officials who included Davis, Riordan, actor Sean Penn, Los
Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke; state Sens.
Richard Alarcon and Jack O'Connell; and Los Angeles Councilmen
Michael Feuer and Alex Padilla.
</P>
<P>
   As he strode up to the podium, the South Gate Middle School
mariachi band struck up a Mexican folk tune called ``Relampago'' or
``lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Gore worked the crowd for a half-hour, shaking
hundreds of hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go, Hey, can I get a high-five? and he said `Yeah,' and we
just smacked hands,'' said a smiling Tina Jasiukonis, a preschool
director from Sherman Oaks. ``I thought it was great. I'm in the
best mood right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle, Romas Jasiukonis, similarly got a chance to shake the
veep's hand, but he later revealed a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning close to a reporter, he confessed in a low voice, ``I'm
a Republican. She dragged me in here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to vote for Bush, to which his niece replied:
``You just think you are. I'm gonna take you around on voting day,
too. Come on _ today was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' he agreed. ``It was.''
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, Gore, Lieberman and their families traveled by
motorcade down the street to Warner Bros. Studios, where they were
greeted by their home state delegations from Tennessee and
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Hart's band played at the party, as actor Martin Sheen
and other cast members of NBC's ``The West Wing,'' which is
produced on that lot, signed autographs for delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, normally a critic of Hollywood, referred to the show
when speaking of the Republican nominee: ``The closest George Bush
will get to the West Wing is a remote control!''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman had been scheduled to speak later that afternoon at a
panel discussion at the Los Angeles Central Library on the issue of
media violence and its impact on children, but he backed out in
order to work on the convention speech he delivered Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was a Republican, former Education Secretary
William Bennett, who spoke on his behalf to rail against what
Lieberman has in the past called the ``revolt of the revolted'' _
or those upset by increasingly violent and obscene content in the
entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lieberman met with a series of minority
caucus groups _ Latinos, Asians, gays and lesbians _ to convince
them he is on their side, despite his reputation as a centrist
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   To the gay and lesbian group, the senator said he supports
hate-crimes legislation. He received a standing ovation when he
said he opposed the Clinton's administration's ``don't ask, don't
tell'' gays in the military policy.
</P>
<P>
   And he told the Latino delegates that, as opposed to the
Republicans, ``we're not faking anything'' when it comes to the
party's racial and ethnic diversity.

<P>
   Be careful what you wish for, because your wish just might come
true.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the stock market's recent rally as the calendar flipped
from May to June. The driving force behind the upswing: the
disclosure that the U.S. economy was no longer expanding as rapidly
as it had been earlier in the year. What was bad news for business,
in other words, had become good news for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This was exactly what the market had been hoping would happen.
For months, Wall Street had been focused on the Federal Reserve
Board. The Fed had become the nemesis of the stock market because
of its ongoing campaign to combat even the remotest prospect of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Four times in six months the central bank had seen fit to raise
interest rates. Each time it had done so, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, and the Nasdaq had all taken a hit.
</P>
<P>
   What Wall Street wanted to know more than anything else was when
the Fed was going to end its campaign. The predominant view was
that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan would call a halt as soon as he
got some sign that his nasty medicine was actually working. Any
hint of a slowdown in economic activity might serve this purpose _
which explains why investors began to hope and pray for some lousy
economic news.
</P>
<P>
   Such twisted thinking is, of course, vulnerable to reality.
Notice what's missing in the above line of reasoning: the impact
that a slowing economy in and of itself might have on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it customary for a drop in business activity to hurt
corporate earnings _ and therefore depress stock values? Indeed,
what looks like a boost for stocks right now may not seem so
favorable by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that Greenspan's Fed may have done its job too well _
that the economy might be slowing too much _ could derail the
fourth-quarter rally that many investors are banking on to rescue
their portfolios in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once the market gets the proof it needs that the Fed has decided
to cease its anti-inflation campaign it, too, will probably begin
asking these questions.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the collective attention of investors shifts from
the good news about the Fed to the bad news about a slowing economy
may be the single most important unknown facing equity investors in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, let's go back and review the underlying
economic news that first prompted the market rally.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the Department of Commerce reported that spending on
construction projects had fallen by 0.6 percent in April. It was
the first decline in this important economic indicator since
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figure also represented a sharp change from the 0.8
percent gain Commerce had reported for the month of March.
Additionally, the April figure was well below the consensus
projection of Wall Street economists, who had anticipated a number
closer to zero.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the National Association of Purchasing Management
in Tempe, Ariz., reported that its index of economic activity had
hit 53.2 in May. That suggested that while the economy was still
growing _ any reading above 50 foretells an expansion in GNP _ it
was doing so at a much slower rate than the 55.5 reading projected
by Wall Street economists (as well as the 54.9 reading recorded in
April).
</P>
<P>
   Other business-news headlines also appeared to confirm a picture
of a slowing economy. Sales at most U.S. retailers were tepid at
best in May. Kmart reported a mere 0.9 percent rise in same-store
sales for the month. The increase at May Department Stores was
slightly better, at 1.2 percent, but Saks reported only a 0.7
percent improvement in sales.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. automakers also had a sluggish month. Ford Motor said total
domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.4 percent in May compared to the
year-earlier month. That was a very different result from the 12
percent year-to-year gain Ford had reported as recently as April.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors, total vehicle sales in May actually fell
almost 6 percent from the year-earlier total.
</P>
<P>
   More news of the Kmart and GM variety would begin to raise
questions about whether the Fed had actually given its patient an
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, Prudential Securities' chief investment strategist,
first brought this up on May 3 when he wrote, ``It always seems to
happen that rates are raised so much that, rather than simply
slowing GDP growth to a more moderate rate of growth (say, 3
percent annually), the economy actually weakens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor anticipation of an economic slowdown will likely unfold
in two stages. At first, the focus will be on specific stocks to
avoid _ such as those of middle-market retailers and the producers
of automobiles and houses. Money will flow out of these sectors and
into areas that seem likely to sidestep the worst of the downturn
or perhaps even to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Stage two will occur if and when the market as a whole begins to
seem vulnerable. At current price levels, stocks are attractive
buys only if current earnings expectations for the third and fourth
quarters are actually met (or even exceeded). There's no room for
disappointment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Different sectors of the stock market are likely to thrive
during each stage. Expect to see a relief bounce in the tech sector
on June 28 if the Fed indicates that its rate hikes are over. That
bounce could turn into a red-hot tech rally if investors quickly
start to worry about slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks' high revenues and earnings growth rates make them
seem immune to any slowdown in the economy. If investor attention
turns to panic about growth this quickly, the rally in technology
stocks that many investors are now pegging for September could
occur much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few high-profile warnings about reduced
revenue or earnings prospects could also put high price-to-earnings
technology stocks under pressure again as analysts start to hedge
their forecasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sectors with dependable growth _ drug stocks, for example _
would become safe havens for money flowing out of the riskier
technology stocks. That kind of sector rotation could make the
fourth quarter very choppy.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises immense timing problems for investors who have
been trying to figure out when it's safe to put cash back to work
in the market and for those who, having switched sectors to avoid
the worst of the year's technology meltdown, are now trying to
decide which sectors to own for the remainder of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could find themselves again facing the choice of
moving early _ and possibly in the wrong direction _ or staying put
and toughing it out. &QL;

 CONGRESS MISLED ABOUT COST OF SUPERLASER, REPORT SAYS  &HT;     By BERNADETTE TANSEY 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Officials in charge of a superlaser under
construction at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory misled
Congress in 1995 by intentionally lowballing the project budget to
win initial funding, investigators said in a report to be released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Energy and lab officials then knowingly downplayed
the National Ignition Facility's mounting technical problems and
altered an outside contractor's evaluation to give the project
glowing reviews last year, the General Accounting Office report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Energy Department and lab officials vigorously denied
wrongdoing in representing the superlaser's costs _ now set at
nearly $4 billion _ to Congress. A Lawrence Livermore Lab watchdog
group, meanwhile, called on Congress to start a criminal
investigation of what it called ``a clear pattern of deceit, fraud
and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be clear evidence of a coverup, of knowingly
lying to Congress,'' said Marylia Kelley of Tri-Valley CARES.
</P>
<P>
   Madelyn Creedon, Energy Department deputy administrator for
defense programs, said the agency made a straightforward case for
the project in 1995 based on its merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was anything nefarious about the (Energy)
Department's original presentation,'' Creedon said.
</P>
<P>
   The report raises doubts about the value of the experimental
superlaser project to the Energy Department's nuclear weapons
program as Congress decides whether to continue or reduce the
project's funding.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for the stadium-size laser now stand at more than $3.9
billion, according to the report's estimates, which include funds
for related research and programs that investigators believe should
be counted as part of the ignition facility's budget.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate is more than $600 million higher than the Energy
Department's latest projection of $3.3 billion, which excludes
costs that the department insists do not belong on NIF's balance
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the numbers are added, federal investigators say,
the price could rise again by an unknown amount because substantial
technical problems still have not been solved. The final report,
submitted at the request of two congressional committees
investigating the superlaser's cost overruns and project delays,
will be made public Thursday by the House Science Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The superlaser, designed to test the reliability of nuclear
weapons through experiments rather than bomb blasts, was originally
scheduled to begin operating in 2002. But those deadlines kept
slipping as technical snags came to light. The project, if funded
as the Energy Department requests, will not reach full power until
2010.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the project's troubles began to surface
publicly in the fall of 1999, when Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
accused Lawrence Livermore of belatedly informing him that the
laser project was behind schedule and as much as $350 million over
budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office report says that both lab
managers and high-level officials at Energy Department headquarters
covered up the project's true costs beginning with an initial
budget request of $1.2 billion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Based on interviews with the Energy Department and lab
personnel, investigators said officials admitted that they
``accepted this unrealistic budget in the belief that Congress
would not fund the (ignition facility) at a higher cost and that
the value of the (facility)  &LR; to the future of the laboratory
overshadowed potential cost concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Creedon said, ``I don't buy that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Energy Department has always reported the known
expenditures of the ignition facility, though some costs were
considered part of the larger Inertial Confinement Fusion program,
which tries to use experiments instead of underground bomb tests to
test the condition of the nation's nuclear stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the apparent multimillion dollar cost increases
reflected in the report come down to differences in accounting
methods that attribute larger program costs to the ignition
facility, Creedon said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Wells, the General Accounting Office's director of
Energy, Resources and Science Issues, said Congress should be given
all related costs as it decides whether to continue funding for the
ignition facility.
</P>
<P>
   The burgeoning costs of the superlaser are likely to drain the
budgets of other elements of the nuclear stockpile program, the
Accounting Office reported. Officials at Los Alamos and Sandia
national laboratories, the Energy Department's other nuclear
weapons labs, have advocated cutting back the number of ignition
facility's laser beam lines from 192 to as few as 48 until the
budget impacts become clearer, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Accounting Office recommended a freeze on shifts in funding
to the ignition facility from the other labs until an outside team
independent of the Energy Department has evaluated the program.
Reacting to the report, House Science Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. called the ignition facility's cost and schedule
overruns ``alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that (the Energy Department's) own independent
reviews masked the cost overruns is even more disturbing,'' said
the Wisconsin Republican. ``(The Energy Department) and Lawrence
Livermore National Lab should have come clean about the engineering
difficulties and cost overruns for this project years ago. (Energy
Department) mismanagement has left the American taxpayers holding
the bag once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensenbrenner's fellow Republican Duncan Hunter, however, said
the report does nothing to change his opinion that the ignition
facility should be fully funded as an essential resource to
maintain the nation's nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, R-El Cajon, a member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the Accounting Office has made no allegation that
Lawrence Livermore wasted any of the money spent on the superlaser,
even if officials underestimated the cost of the cutting-edge
scientific project.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Livermore lab spokeswoman Susan Houghton said lab
scientists have already established a track record of solving some
of the thorny technical challenges presented by the laser project.
They expect to overcome remaining obstacles in the development of
optical lenses for the superlaser.

their portfolios in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Once the market gets the proof it needs that the Fed has decided
to cease its anti-inflation campaign it, too, will probably begin
asking these questions.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the collective attention of investors shifts from
the good news about the Fed to the bad news about a slowing economy
may be the single most important unknown facing equity investors in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, let's go back and review the underlying
economic news that first prompted the market rally.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the Department of Commerce reported that spending on
construction projects had fallen by 0.6 percent in April. It was
the first decline in this important economic indicator since
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figure also represented a sharp change from the 0.8
percent gain Commerce had reported for the month of March.
Additionally, the April figure was well below the consensus
projection of Wall Street economists, who had anticipated a number
closer to zero.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the National Association of Purchasing Management
in Tempe, Ariz., reported that its index of economic activity had
hit 53.2 in May. That suggested that while the economy was still
growing _ any reading above 50 foretells an expansion in GNP _ it
was doing so at a much slower rate than the 55.5 reading projected
by Wall Street economists (as well as the 54.9 reading recorded in
April).
</P>
<P>
   Other business-news headlines also appeared to confirm a picture
of a slowing economy. Sales at most U.S. retailers were tepid at
best in May. Kmart reported a mere 0.9 percent rise in same-store
sales for the month. The increase at May Department Stores was
slightly better, at 1.2 percent, but Saks reported only a 0.7
percent improvement in sales.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. automakers also had a sluggish month. Ford Motor said total
domestic vehicle sales rose just 1.4 percent in May compared to the
year-earlier month. That was a very different result from the 12
percent year-to-year gain Ford had reported as recently as April.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors, total vehicle sales in May actually fell
almost 6 percent from the year-earlier total.
</P>
<P>
   More news of the Kmart and GM variety would begin to raise
questions about whether the Fed had actually given its patient an
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Smith, Prudential Securities' chief investment strategist,
first brought this up on May 3 when he wrote, ``It always seems to
happen that rates are raised so much that, rather than simply
slowing GDP growth to a more moderate rate of growth (say, 3
percent annually), the economy actually weakens.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor anticipation of an economic slowdown will likely unfold
in two stages. At first, the focus will be on specific stocks to
avoid _ such as those of middle-market retailers and the producers
of automobiles and houses. Money will flow out of these sectors and
into areas that seem likely to sidestep the worst of the downturn
or perhaps even to profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Stage two will occur if and when the market as a whole begins to
seem vulnerable. At current price levels, stocks are attractive
buys only if current earnings expectations for the third and fourth
quarters are actually met (or even exceeded). There's no room for
disappointment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Different sectors of the stock market are likely to thrive
during each stage. Expect to see a relief bounce in the tech sector
on June 28 if the Fed indicates that its rate hikes are over. That
bounce could turn into a red-hot tech rally if investors quickly
start to worry about slower economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   These stocks' high revenues and earnings growth rates make them
seem immune to any slowdown in the economy. If investor attention
turns to panic about growth this quickly, the rally in technology
stocks that many investors are now pegging for September could
occur much earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a few high-profile warnings about reduced
revenue or earnings prospects could also put high price-to-earnings
technology stocks under pressure again as analysts start to hedge
their forecasts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sectors with dependable growth _ drug stocks, for example _
would become safe havens for money flowing out of the riskier
technology stocks. That kind of sector rotation could make the
fourth quarter very choppy.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises immense timing problems for investors who have
been trying to figure out when it's safe to put cash back to work
in the market and for those who, having switched sectors to avoid
the worst of the year's technology meltdown, are now trying to
decide which sectors to own for the remainder of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could find themselves again facing the choice of
moving early _ and possibly in the wrong direction _ or staying put
and toughing it out. &QL;

 GORE SPEECH MUST TRANSLATE POLICY INTO PASSION  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Al Gore tells people he spent his youth
shoveling pig manure on his family's Tennessee farm, many laugh in
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   A congressman at age 28, a senator at 36 and a presidential
candidate before he turned 40, the vice president is better known
today as a sober understudy whose idea of lightening up is to
change from blue pinstripes to earth tones.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, as he formally accepts his party's nomination
for the highest office in the land, Gore faces a challenge that
goes beyond stepping out from President Clinton's shadow. He must
somehow win over voters who can no more picture him in the No. 1
position than as a simple farmhand.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, still buzzing over Clinton's address to the
convention on Monday night, wait with nervous anticipation. They
know that while Clinton can pass the torch of party leadership to
his vice president, he cannot transfer his gift for political
charm.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's address, scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, must find a way to
stir an electorate that tends to fall for oversized political
personalities like Gov. Jesse Ventura, Sen. John McCain and
President Clinton. He must rise above his stiff speaking style long
enough to explain why his policy positions are the right ones. And
he must convince the nation that a cerebral policy wonk who knows
more about biodiversity than baseball is the man they want for
their president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that those who watch and listen will feel afterward
that they have a clearer idea of exactly what I'm proposing to
do,'' Gore said as he arrived in this convention city. ``They'll
also know how the ideas and proposals I'm making are rooted in the
experiences that I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's task is very similar to that faced by then-Vice President
George Bush in 1988, who had an impressive resume that included
eight years of service to a very popular president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in what was regarded by many to be the finest speech of
his career, touched on his loyalty to President Reagan and then
detailed his vision for the nation's future and what sort of leader
it would take to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' Bush declared to the GOP faithful in New
Orleans, ``I am that man!''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bush trailed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis by
17 points in public opinion polls. He came back to win the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of his effort to communicate to voters
who he is,'' said House minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Missouri,
speaking about a man who has been in the public eye since his birth
made the front page of the Nashville Tennessean.
</P>
<P>
   ``As vice president, he is famous,'' Gore's daughter Karenna
Gore Schiff said. ``But he is not well-known.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has presented the public with a life of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, he spent the school year living in a hotel suite on
Washington's Embassy Row and his summers on the family farm in
Carthage, Tenn. He opposed the war in Vietnam, but enlisted to
serve because he thought it would be wrong for someone else to go
in his place. He was a conservative Democrat in the House of
Representatives, voting against abortion and gun control. He
emerged as a more liberal, centrist member of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He is a faithful Christian and a devoted family man. Yet his
political ambition is so fierce he earned the nickname
``solicitor-in-chief'' for his aggressive efforts to raise money
for the party, which included questionable telephone solicitations
from the White House and an event at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   He has spent his entire life in the public eye but still looks
uncomfortable before television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore begins a new chapter in his long political career,
strategists say he has a unique opportunity to shape his public
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are just beginning to pay attention,'' said Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake. ``This is his chance to powerfully introduce
himself to those voters.''
</P>
<P>
   One way for Gore to distinguish himself is to focus on issues.
With Not only do  &LR; polls showing that the public supports most of
his positions, but  &LR; this would allow him a chance to display his
mastery of policy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kennedy Jr., whose family knows something about political
oratory, said the most important advice he could offer Gore is to
draw a policy distinction between himself and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party has to win this election on issues,''
said Kennedy, the third son of the man who was headed to the
Democratic Party's nomination in 1968 before his assassination only
a few miles from the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   So Gore will detail his plan for education, health care,
targeted tax cuts, Social Security and Medicare, his aides say. He
will leave no doubt that voters have a choice in November.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that Gore must somehow convince the
nation that he is likable. Not necessarily. The nation has a long
history of electing less than likable characters, most recently
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   His task is actually much broader. He has to convince the
country that he ought to be president.

DULL POLITICAL EXTRAVAGANZAS IN THE U.S.

 By FLORA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Flora Lewis  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   PARIS _ The American political conventions have performed their
formal task of naming presidential and vice-presidential candidates
for November elections, and their informal function of rallying
party cadres and, the leaders hope, energizing potential voters.
Fine. These traditional duties still must be done, and be seen to
be done.
</P>
<P>
   But the conventions also served to show how much American
democracy is frittering its vigor, even as the familiar old
procedures are observed. A remark by the chairman of the Democratic
National Convention Committee, Terry McAuliffe, just before the
meetings in Los Angeles reflected the essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to peacefully coexist with the demonstrators,'' he
said as the plans were made for dealing with street confrontations.
``They have every right to be heard, and we have every right to be
heard.'' In a word, that means nowadays to be on television.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to do it. One is to provoke the cameras'
attention by being important, outrageous or entertaining, and
better, all three. The other is by paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money involved, to be spent to a very large extent
on TV, continues to rise with every campaign. It has reached levels
so absurd that the figures have somehow lost their shock value.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of 1999 to the middle of this year, the
Democrats elicited $118.6 million and the Republicans $137 million
in ``soft money'' contributions, the unlimited gifts which can be
accepted in addition to the straightforward ``hard money'' maximum
of $1,000 per person to candidates. It is clear that the totals
this time around will be well over a quarter of a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform has been a recurrent issue for
generations and every time new restrictions are imposed on
donations, new ways are found to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   The one effective way to take the politicians back from the
moneybags would be to reduce the need for spending-free TV time as
in practically all other democracies and strict limits or even an
outright ban on TV political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   A good European idea to get rid of the sneaky and misleading
attack ads that pollute American airwaves would require that the
candidate appear personally in the spots and that they last a
minimum of three minutes. That is a long time on TV; you have to
have something to say or reveal your emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court, wrongly I think, has ruled that to
limit political advertising on the public airwaves would violate
freedom of speech. So the people who can't raise that kind of money
but still want to assert their right to be heard are learning to
use a kind of TV theatricality to get their share of camera time.
</P>
<P>
   After their surprise success at disruption at the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle late last year, and their
undeniable presence at the World Bank meeting in Washington this
spring, demonstration organizers have become remarkably
professional at planning, training, and outfitting their troops for
maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   They use a catch-all multiplying approach. One of their Web
sites listed some of the issues they were inviting protesters to
join them in opposing as ``corporate globalization, militarism,
poverty, starvation, campaign finance corruption, sexism, racism,
homo/transphobia, criminalization of youth, environmental
destruction, prison industrial complex, genocide.'' Why not traffic
jams and junk mail?
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing like the passionate demonstrations at the 1968
Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where opposition to the
Vietnam War had already driven President Lyndon Johnson to renounce
a bid for reelection. There were people of various background, but
with a real cohesion of opinion that merged their many voices into
a clear message.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bit of bashing _ and after all, a good dollop of
bashing is supposed to be a TV specialty _ the demonstrations this
time seemed to be as much a part of the show as the balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats weren't so carefully scripted and scheduled as the
Republicans, but they have both understood that TV focuses on
glitches so they must make sure that nothing disturbs the smooth
surface.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves it to the demonstrators, and the
``counter-convention,'' to provide some tumult and spontaneity to
keep viewers from dozing. But it is far from any political reality.
It only adds to the ordinary citizen's sense of having no part in
the procedure, indeed to not being really represented.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout of voters in the United States, a country so
proud of its democracy that is always ready to lecture others on
how to go about it, has been a perplexing scandal for years.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the official launch of Campaign 2000 foreshadows an
improvement this November. On the contrary, there may be even a
further drop below 50 percent. But it doesn't seem so perplexing,
given the show. &QL;

VALDES EXCELS DESPITE LACK OF REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixes headline) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A guy walked up to Ismael Valdes in the Los Angeles
Dodgers clubhouse and told him he's starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go. Bring it on,'' Valdes said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? At least Valdes would have a day to rest, unlike
Wednesday when he was pressed into starting when Chan Ho Park
became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, went out and pitched five strong innings and the
Dodgers, powered by a group who call themselves the ``scraps,''
salvaged the finale of their three-game series against the Florida
Marlins with a 10-4 win at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes had started Saturday in Atlanta and pitched a mop-up
ninth inning in Tuesday's loss to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty awesome,'' Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw said. ``That's
exactly what you look for when a guy goes down. He took that ball
and stepped up. He might not have said that last year. He's matured
a little bit and he understands you're not always going to start,
you're not always going to relieve.''
</P>
<P>
   With a starting lineup that was missing Eric Karros, Mark
Grudzielanek and Adrian Beltre, the ``scraps'' brought energy to a
stale lineup. Eventually, the Dodgers broke it open with seven runs
in the eighth inning - more runs than they've scored in 21 of their
past 25 games - as Beltre came off the bench to deliver a three-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo had his second three-hit game of the season and
drove in a run and Dave Hansen tripled in two runs in the eighth
inning. Chad Kreuter, an honorary ``scrapper'' because he starts
much more frequently than Hansen, Santangelo or Jim Leyritz, added
two hits and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out to have fun, bring some energy,'' Hansen said.
``It's nothing personal, but guys needed some time off. I think it
was a good win all around for camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   The win, indeed, was something the Dodgers, losers of eight of
10 entering the night, needed. They end their road trip 2-4, but
they remain 6 games behind San Francisco in the National League
West.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was the big eighth inning that catapulted the
Dodgers (61-58) past Florida, it was the five innings Valdes
provided that set the stage. He was called upon again when he
learned Park was sent back to Los Angeles with flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Claude Osteen approached Valdes about starting,
and for the second time since being reacquired from the Chicago
Cubs less than a month ago, Valdes started a day after pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Claude, `I'm ready if you need me, either starting or
relieving,' `' said Valdes, who left with a 3-1 lead but wasn't
involved in the decision. ``I'm here to help the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   While Park flew back to Los Angeles earlier in the day to get
rest and possibly get ready for a start Saturday against the Mets,
provided he's healthy, Valdes took to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   He did a similar thing when he rejoined the Dodgers, facing two
batters in the first inning against Pittsburgh before rain
postponed the game. Valdes came back the next day and pitched four
solid innings, allowing two runs in a game the Dodgers went on to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful tough to be out there, pitch an inning, and come
back and pitch the next day,'' said Dodgers manager Davey Johnson,
who added reliever Antonio Osuna wasn't available because of a sore
shoulder, putting a further burden on the bullpen. ``He impressed
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something the Dodgers, clinging to playoff hopes,
need. In three weeks with the Dodgers, Valdes has done more to
shatter his reputation as not being tough enough and not putting
the team first than he did in his previous five seasons with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   The only run Valdes allowed came in the second inning when Kevin
Millar doubled with one out and scored on David Berg's two-out
single. But Valdes, who allowed seven hits, got out of possible
danger in the third inning with a double play and was aided in the
fifth when left fielder Gary Sheffield threw Ramon Castro out at
second trying to stretch a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not used to (consecutive days), the mental aspect
is probably the toughest,'' Osteen said. ``But he's been very
positive since getting here. I think his stuff is getting better
each time out. I thought he did an outstanding job. I thought he
got better as the game went on. He started throwing a lot better
curveball. It's been breaking but missing power lately, and it got
a lot better.''

L.A. POLICE MOVE FAST TO BREAK RESISTANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO, DAVID GREENBERG, DONNA HUFFAKER, JASON KANDEL
and JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles police moved swiftly and decisively
against a few bottle-throwing demonstrators Wednesday and quickly
dispersed what organizers billed as the biggest protest of the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 activists flooded Olympic Boulevard and Figueroa
Street outside Staples Center in the late afternoon after a day of
angry but nonviolent protests targeting Los Angeles Police
Department tactics.
</P>
<P>
   They were met head-on by hundreds of officers in riot gear who
split the group in two, shoving their batons at challenging
protesters as bottles and sticks were hurled at them.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the front lines of the skirmishing, Chief Bernard C.
Parks directed the operation personally. Police broke up the crowd
with pepper spray and rubber bullets but backed off after talking
with organizers and watching dozens of protesters who had been at
the front of the confrontation walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the phrase repeatedly used by LAPD officials all week,
Mayor Richard Riordan called the police response ``measured,
strategic, appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said officers had been disciplined and effective at
maintaining the peace throughout the week while respecting the free
speech rights of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of what the LAPD has done,'' Riordan said.
``They've been calm. But when they've had to be tough ... they've
been appropriately aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Police made 38 arrests Wednesday, nearly all at a Rampart
Division protest at which demonstrators submitted voluntarily and
peacefully to officers to dramatize criticism over anti-gang
officers accused of framing hundreds of people in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   During the series of convention protests, police have made 192
arrests, 59 of those felonies. Most of the arrests included failure
to disperse. A group of 51 bicyclists was arrested Tuesday for
reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, protesters took to downtown chanting, ``LAPD go
away _ racist, sexist, anti-gay,'' and, ``Two, four, six eight.
Smash the police state.'' Signs at the Pershing Square rally
included: ``LAPD: License to Attack Peaceful Demonstrators'' and
``Does this look like Berlin 1930s?''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few incidents where protesters threw bottles at
police. Police, citing intelligence reports, said the bottles were
filled with urine, gasoline or an acid, similar to incidents in
Philadelphia at the Republican convention. A California Highway
Patrol officer was taken to the hospital after being hit with a
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Police warned delegates and media that some protesters had
stolen, or tried to steal, convention passes off their necks.
</P>
<P>
   But other than the mass arrests at Rampart Division, the day
went with few arrests and incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Staples Center in the afternoon, District Attorney
Gil Garcetti said the police response has been ``a tempered, proper
response, up to what I have seen right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are out there, they are keeping things in order,''
Garcetti said. ``For the most part, we have demonstrators and
protesters who are enjoying their First Amendment rights. And I
cheer them.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere protesters went, they were met with an overwhelming
police presence.
</P>
<P>
   Too overwhelming, according to City Councilwoman Jackie
Goldberg, who watched a protest outside Parker Center, where
hundreds of officers ringed the police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in protecting property and keeping the peace, but
this is ridiculous,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an exaggeration of police presence, and one that's
going to cost of millions of dollars in taxpayers' money. The
protesters are saying they want to change the world, and the police
are saying they won't let them because they're the ones that have
the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The only serious confrontation of the day happened as protesters
tried to filter into the designated protest center outside Staples
Center. An overflow crowd on the street refused to move, according
to police. Officers moved in, and after about an hour discussing it
with protest leaders, police called it an ``unlawful assembly'' and
broke up the group.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fithian, a D2KLA organizer who negotiated with officers at
the scene, said ``the cops completely instigated this.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, though, had turned back the hard-core protesters and
from there, much of the crowd dispersed, with several heading back
to Pershing Square. Two people were arrested in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're violating our rights,'' said 31-year-old Eric Magnuson
of Atwater Village. ``They stopped a peaceful protest. We have
permits to be here for another two hours. They broke up a legal
rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldberg of Direct Action Network, a protest group at the
convention, decried the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not suspend the First Amendment rights of the masses
because of the actions of a small sum,'' she said. ``This is
continued harassment that started weeks ago. We will continue to be
in the streets, we will continue to be peaceful. If the LAPD needs
to deal with some then they should deal with some. It is not their
job to suspend the rights of the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights attorney Osha Neumann of the Midnight Special Law
Collective said police made a big deal out of a small incidents
``and used them as excuses to violate First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawsuits have been filed and there will be more coming this
town is paying for the misconduct of the police,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcetti, who has tangled with the Parks and the LAPD over
the Rampart corruption scandal, called police action professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonstrators and protesters are having their rights
protected by the police,'' Garcetti said. ``There is nothing going
on to tarnish (the image of L.A.). We should all stand tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses downtown were closed, but the protests did upset
the convention, said George Van Til, a delegate from Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, he and half the Indiana delegation were trying
to get to the convention for the roll call on Joe Lieberman's
nomination for vice president, but they were stuck inside the
Holiday Inn across the street from Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   He said it didn't look safe to go out, and after spending nearly
$2,000 on the trip, he was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this? To stand here?'' he said. ``I was looking forward to
coming here, to being renewed in the Democratic spirit. It really
hasn't turned out to be that way. I want to be in there tonight and
I can't be.''

VANNEY'S GOAL LIFTS GALAXY

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ With the Los Angeles Galaxy's Western
Division title shot fading, Greg Vanney followed in a loose ball
with two minutes left in sudden death overtime, scoring from 18
yards to give the Galaxy a much-needed 1-0 victory over Colorado on
Wednesday before 5,187 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy played poorly to that point, except for Luis
Hernandez, who flew in from Mexico City earlier in the afternoon
after playing a World Cup qualifier the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez started the second half, creating two chances for
himself and another for Simon Elliott in the final 10 minutes of
regulation, but both couldn't find the net.
</P>
<P>
   Vanney, a defender who had been left off the U.S. national team
for Wednesday's game against Barbados, scored his sixth goal of the
season, but his first from the field after five penalty kick goals.
</P>
<P>
   The win enabled the Galaxy (12-7-8, 44 points) to stay within
striking distance of the division-leading Kansas City Wizards
(14-6-6, 48 points), a 3-0 winner over San Jose earlier in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just stood at the top of the box and there were two or three
shots deflected in front of me,'' said Vanney. ``It bounced out and
I knew the goalie had gone to the near post to make a save. I got a
good first touch and hit it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for us and a huge relief to get that win in
overtime because it was a hard-fought battle all night.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, the victory strengthens the Galaxy's hold on the
fourth playoff seed after Chicago (12-9-5, 41 points) lost earlier
to Dallas. The fourth seed earns home-field advantage in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Regular starters Mauricio Cienfuegos (El Salvador), Ezra
Hendrickson (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) and Cobi Jones (U.S.)
were absent due to World Cup qualifying commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy midfielder Sasha Victorine had a rough night, missing two
good opportunities in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   On a breakaway in the ninth minute, Victorine could do nothing
against Colorado goalkeeper David Kramer, sending a weak shot
straight at the former Galaxy keeper, which Kramer knocked out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Victorine had an easier opportunity in the 30th minute from
20-yards out with Kramer off his line, but his chip shot was far
left of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Junior Agogo broke loose near the end of the first
half, but goalkeeper Matt Reis, who has filled in nicely for
injured starter Kevin Hartman, deflected his shot away.

L.A. POLICE MOVE FAST TO BREAK RESISTANCE

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles police moved swiftly and decisively
against a few bottle-throwing demonstrators Wednesday and quickly
dispersed what organizers billed as the biggest protest of the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 activists flooded Olympic Boulevard and Figueroa
Street outside Staples Center in the late afternoon after a day of
angry but nonviolent protests targeting Los Angeles Police
Department tactics.
</P>
<P>
   They were met head-on by hundreds of officers in riot gear who
split the group in two, shoving their batons at challenging
protesters as bottles and sticks were hurled at them.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the front lines of the skirmishing, Chief Bernard C.
Parks directed the operation personally. Police broke up the crowd
with pepper spray and rubber bullets but backed off after talking
with organizers and watching dozens of protesters who had been at
the front of the confrontation walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the phrase repeatedly used by LAPD officials all week,
Mayor Richard Riordan called the police response ``measured,
strategic, appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said officers had been disciplined and effective at
maintaining the peace throughout the week while respecting the free
speech rights of protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of what the LAPD has done,'' Riordan said.
``They've been calm. But when they've had to be tough ... they've
been appropriately aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Police made 38 arrests Wednesday, nearly all at a Rampart
Division protest at which demonstrators submitted voluntarily and
peacefully to officers to dramatize criticism over anti-gang
officers accused of framing hundreds of people in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   During the series of convention protests, police have made 192
arrests, 59 of those felonies. Most of the arrests included failure
to disperse. A group of 51 bicyclists was arrested Tuesday for
reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, protesters took to downtown chanting, ``LAPD go
away _ racist, sexist, anti-gay,'' and, ``Two, four, six eight.
Smash the police state.'' Signs at the Pershing Square rally
included: ``LAPD: License to Attack Peaceful Demonstrators'' and
``Does this look like Berlin 1930s?''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few incidents where protesters threw bottles at
police. Police, citing intelligence reports, said the bottles were
filled with urine, gasoline or an acid, similar to incidents in
Philadelphia at the Republican convention. A California Highway
Patrol officer was taken to the hospital after being hit with a
bottle.

   DEM-GORE-BIO-TRANSFORM (Undated) _ After Al Gore ran for
president in 1988 and lost, he organized a series of dinners where
he went around the room and asked each person to tell him where he
had gone wrong. It was excruciating, his friends said, but he
insisted on hearing the bad news. Gore responded, as he always has,
by going back to school. He put together a graduate seminar for
one, complete with a syllabus and a heavy-duty reading list, and
applied himself. Politicians often learn from and are even
transformed by a good drubbing at the polls, but few have pursued
their lessons as aggressively as Gore. By Melinda Henneberger and

   DEM-NETWORK-STRATEGY-NYT (Los Angeles) _ Of the many contrasts

firms have cut back on pro bono work so sharply that they fall far

Sonoma County, Calif., were common in the early 1990s. But in the
past five years or so, many of the smallest ones have disappeared
while AOL and a handful of others have undergone explosive growth.
By numbers alone, the Web service business doesn't look so dire.
Boardwatch magazine, which tracks ISP's, recently reported more

<P>
   CIR-MATES-ONLINE (Undated) _ Harsha Kumar, a 29-year-old
technology officer for an e-commerce company in Westborough, Mass.,
wanted to find a wife. And Mr. Kumar, who was born in India and
educated in the United States, wanted to begin his search in a way
that blended both Old and New World sensibilities. ``I knew I
wanted to marry an Indian or Indian-American woman, but arranged
marriage seemed unnatural to me,'' Kumar said. ``Meeting someone
online seemed more natural to me, maybe because I work in
e-commerce and am on the Internet and using e-mail a lot already.''
In January 1998, Kumar signed up with Internet Matrimonials
(matrimonials.com), a service for people of South Asian heritage.
Traditionally, many South Asians have arranged marriages through
relatives or ``marriage bureaus,'' paid matchmakers sometimes
called bride brokers, and publications like India Abroad and The
Times of India have published classified ads usually placed by
parents for serious prospective brides and grooms. In the last few
years, matrimonial Web sites have started up. By Reena Jana.

EDITORIAL: A METROPOLIS OF POOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Every so often during a national convention, a politician says
something that shines right through the accumulated oratory hanging
like fog above the convention floor, creating an image that
requires deeper contemplation. Though hardly known for his speaking
skills, former Sen. Bill Bradley did just that the other night when
he told the Democratic convention that if all the 13.5 million poor
children in America were gathered in one place, they would form a
city bigger than New York _ and ``we would then see child poverty
as the slow-motion national disaster that it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This Dickensian vision was a wonderfully descriptive way of
saying that while Americans can sympathize with individual cases of
poverty, and ``would never turn their backs on a starving child,''
it is next to impossible for them to imagine the totality of the
problem. Put all these children in one place in the mind's eye, and
the reality becomes inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's imagery was part of a passionate plea to his party to
reaffirm its historic connection to America's underclass. So, too,
was his use of another geographical metaphor, in which he noted
that the 44 million Americans without health insurance equal all
the people living in 12 states between the Mississippi and the
Rocky Mountains. But it was also a reminder to affluent Americans
of their moral obligation to do something about America's
``ill-fed, ill-housed and ill-educated'' children. ``If we don't
end child poverty in our lifetime,'' Bradley said, ``shame on me,
shame on you, shame on all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   As he made clear during his unsuccessful primary run against Al
Gore, Bradley does not think his own party has done enough on this
score. But it has at least done and promised more than the
Republican opposition. Both sides have pledged to devote
substantial resources to early childhood education, an important
issue to Gore and almost a signature issue for George W. Bush. The
Democrats have also offered proposals like expanding the
earned-income tax credit and raising the minimum wage that would
quickly put real dollars in the pockets of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley was talking about more than individual programs,
however worthy. What he was talking about was the need for a
sustained, systematic effort to reach out to the one-fifth of
American children living in families making less than $13,000 a
year. These are damning statistics in a nation whose convention
orators keep congratulating themselves on America's present
prosperity, and where the main political debate involves how to
spend the giant surplus generated by that affluence. There is no
better place to spend that surplus than on the vast city of poverty
that Bill Bradley brought to life on Tuesday night.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Congressional cure for IRS was worse than agency's
ills
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You remember the horror stories _ brutish government officials
cruelly harassing law-abiding citizens, confiscating their
property, reducing them to lives of terror.
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much the story a few years ago as Congress held
hearings on what members widely held were rampant abuses of power
by an Internal Revenue Service the best of whose agents, it seemed,
where merely loutish and insensitive and the rest of whom were
petty tyrants and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The result, in addition to repeated histrionic tableaux of
congressional indignation and unctuous solicitude for an abused
citizenry, was the enactment in 1998 of a law holding IRS agents
accountable for jerking taxpayers around improperly. Elaborate
mechanisms were set up to take complaints, investigate them and
mete out stern justice, up to and including the bureaucratic
equivalent of the death sentence: firing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the first report on the new law is in and it turns out
that of the 830 formal complaints of IRS abuse, not one _ zero,
zilch, nada _ panned out. Investigated by the IRS under the
oversight of the Treasury's watchdog Inspector General for Tax
Administration, the charges were either trivial, groundless or
outright bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many came from persons hoping to get out of
paying taxes or at least put off the due date.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years the law has been in effect, only four of the
IRS's 16,000 auditors have been fired for abusing a taxpayer _ and
then for what amounted to temper tantrums, not harassment as
Congress defined it.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the hearings and advocates for the resulting law credit
both with disciplining a run-amok IRS into sudden civility.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the problem was wildly exaggerated in the first place
and the fix has had consequences more perverse than purposeful.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings did surface some specific cases of abuse that
deserved exposure and rebuke, but in the main they served as a way
for the Republican Congress to act out its long-held animus toward
the very idea of tax collection and its growing anti-government
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively few cases were elaborated into a supposed pattern
that, in fact, they didn't show and couldn't support. A cowed IRS
was reduced to a sputtering defense along the feeble lines of
``But, but, but...''
</P>
<P>
   The main effect of the supposedly corrective law has been a
sharp roll-off in tax investigations as auditors, fearing for their
bureaucratic lives, proceed timidly. That, and a sorry
disproportion of enforcement against the lowest income taxpayers
rather than against the high rollers. The poor and near-poor have
neither the means nor, generally, the moxie to fight. They are safe
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Congress's dominating conservatives spend so much time in a
closed-loop politics in which they feed right-wing talk radio and
are in turn provoked by its railings that we're sometimes getting
government-as-talk-show. Congress isn't so much passing laws as it
is enacting rants.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: It's still anybody's election
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore-Lieberman? Heck of a ticket the Democrats have ended up
with.
</P>
<P>
   A Southerner from Tennessee needed a Jew from the Northeast to
bring moderation to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the political times we live in. Moderates are where you
find them, in places you never would have thought to look. That
goes for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a Republican can be for zero income tax, zero inheritance
tax, reintroducing segregation and mandatory gun ownership ...
</P>
<P>
   But, if you are pro-choice, you are a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, you can be for a 100 percent estate tax, a
punishing progressive income tax, reintroducting busing and
abortion on demand whether you want one or not ...
</P>
<P>
   But, if you are pro-defense, you are a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Sen. Joe Lieberman somehow comes across as Tail
Gunner Joe, having stood up and voted for the Gulf War when most
every other Democrat was running for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Good, too, that he was the first of his party to publicly
denounce President Clinton for immoral perpetration, if that's the
word.
</P>
<P>
   The code words, incidentally, in the Republican campaign are
``restore honor and dignity to the White House,'' a political
anagram for ``Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Lieberman, a moral man by anyone's standards,
may well have canceled out that part of the GOP game plan.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it could still be anybody's ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the big lead the polls have been giving Texas Gov. George
W. Bush. In 1968, former President Richard Nixon came out of the
conventions _ his a coronation, the Democrats' a conflagration _ as
much as 25 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   By election day, it was a split-hair finish.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's chances, if you figure the betting
odds, are maybe one in three. But that's still a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Lieberman can pull it out. Here are some ideas on how:
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's saying that Gore needs to define himself. Better he
should define the Republicans, and Bush-(Dick) Cheney are perfect
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Paint them up as a couple of reactionary Texas oilmen who are
anti-environment, pro-guns and anti-choice, and the Democrats will
be able to wrest away a large portion of the women's vote Bush has
attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Tag the Republicans as the party of tobacco and insurance, the
forces of evil that, on the one hand, have made us sick unto death
and on the other are denying us proper medical care.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget big oil, especially for voters north of the
Mason-Dixon line. If they liked the price of home heating oil last
winter, they're going to love Bush-Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   If anybody tries to argue it, just show them the money. The bulk
of Republican soft money comes from oil, tobacco and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-wise, Democrats can pretty much write off the South with
the exception of Tennessee and, maybe, Georgia. Anybody who knows
anything about Georgia politics will tell you that you never can
tell about Georgia politics.
</P>
<P>
   So, with New York and California ceded to Democrats, here's the
three-pronged key they'll need to unlock a winning ballot box:
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois _ each of which contains a
significant Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Lieberman? It reads better as Go Lieberman!
</P>

 &HT;    Earth calling Texas
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Texans like to brag about big. Everything is
braggable here, and size certainly qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   But one area of big in which we'd just as soon not brag is crud.
</P>
<P>
   Crud is a by-product of crude. Oil, that is. Texas tea. We're
pretty big in that, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the airborne crud category, the kind pumped into our skies by
cars, factories and refineries, if Texas were a country it would
rank seventh largest.
</P>
<P>
   So what the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission will
consider Wednesday is big, even by our standards.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will consider an appeal by environmental
organizations to begin formal rulemaking toward a state plan to
curb greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   This is 10 years removed from the Texas Legislature authorizing
the state's environmental enforcer to come up with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, 1990, sufficient lawmakers were moved by a
state-authorized study showing that the planet was warming and that
made-in-Texas pollution shared the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, absolutely nothing climatologically has happened
that would undermine the thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Science magazine recently published a study by Texas A&AMP;M
geologist Thomas J. Crowley citing man's role in making the 1990s
the hottest decade in recorded history. Sure, recorded history is
just a fly speck on Earth's lifeline. Much remains theoretical. But
to worldwide participants in the United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change, any question about man's role in these
trends has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   'W' WARMS TO IT
</P>
<P>
   If you want a revelation sure to melt the ice caps, consider
Gov. George W. Bush going on the record recently saying that the
planet is warming. According to climatologists, that's no leap of
faith. That's math. But any acknowledgement helps, particularly
from a Republican standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not ready, apparently, to blame man-made pollution for
these matters. This is convenient, particularly in Texas, and
particularly with a party leadership in Washington which has
blunted efforts to make good on the Kyoto Accords aimed at curbing
greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   ATTENTION TO OUR AIR
</P>
<P>
   Texas air has gotten a lot of attention lately with Bush's
candidacy and with Houston's supplanting Los Angeles as the
nation's smog capital. Good things have happened with all this
attention, including cleaner-air provisions built into electric
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC, under the gun from federal regulators, recently came
out with tough proposals that could mean major lifestyle changes in
Houston _ slower speed limits, bans on heavy machinery in the
morning and more.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC is just now getting a handle on pollution as a
statewide syndrome rather than a metro or regional one. From Big
Bend to North Texas, our river of air is rancid and getting more
rank.
</P>
<P>
   Is Texas a major culprit in global warming? So say most
climatologists. But in some ways the argument about the earth's
warming _ the ``is not'' vs. the ``is so'' _ reminds one of the
tobacco companies trying to say ``prove it'' on the accusation that
ambient smoke causes cancer. Cancer is just one of many concerns.
Try allergies, asthma and heart disease if you want others.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to prove man-caused global warming to know that
the pollutants we are spewing into the air do us no good.
</P>
<P>
   The world really is watching Texas when it comes to pollution.
And we shouldn't flatter ourselves into believing that it's just
because of a Texan running for president. It's because Texas, as a
polluter, is just that big.

fast-food restaurants and movie studios are not the only ones

 &HT;    Now Harley, Bugs Bunny help sell cars
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cross marketing seems to be the way of this
millennium. Or has it been around for a while?
</P>
<P>
   Cross marketing is the practice of one product hitching a ride
on the star of another product's success. How many of you have
purchased just one more Kid's Meal to get a dinosaur from the
latest Disney movie?
</P>
<P>
   But fast-food restaurants and movie studios are not the only
ones playing that game. Automakers today are using cross marketing
to target a segment of potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   One is Ford's hot, limited-production Harley Davidson F-150
pickup truck. In the mid-'80s, you couldn't have paid an automaker
to put out a vehicle emblazoned with Harley badges. Back then,
bikers were bad dudes. But no more. Today, a Harley Soft-Tail may
be the ultimate baby boomer status symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it makes good business sense for Ford and Harley-Davidson
to capitalize on each other's success. If a Harley is the ultimate
status symbol, the ultimate accessory for your bike could be a
black-on-black truck complete with bike tie-downs in the bed,
chrome Harley badges here and there, and even wheels that evoke the
spirit of the motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   You don't find P275/45R20 Goodyear Eagle GT1s on just any pickup
truck. Stand back and look closely and you will notice that the
exceptionally low profile tires mounted on wide-spoked alloy wheels
actually are pretty close to what an actual Harley has.
</P>
<P>
   With an asking price of $33,205, the Harley F-150 is one
tricked-out version of America's best-selling truck.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet is capitalizing on a much younger market with its
Warner Bros. Edition Venture minivan. Anybody can put a video
screen in a minivan but can they say that it has had Bugs Bunny or
Wiley Coyote or the Tasmanian Devil? General Motors already has
hooked Taz up with its NASCAR and Monte Carlo teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the Doraville-built Warner Bros. Venture minivan, Chevy has a
package that appeals to the whole family. For the 2001 model year,
Chevy is enhancing the Warner Bros. Venture with the addition of an
extra video screen. Now the smaller ones can sit in the middle row
of seats and watch Bugs and company, while third row passengers can
play with their Sony PlayStations on the second screen.
</P>
<P>
   y? There's another tie-in.
</P>
<P>
   But is this concept really new?
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s, one of the popular buzz phrases was: ``Here
comes the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac capitalized on the craze by offering its hot-selling GTO
in the Judge edition. Across town, Chrysler Corp. marketers were
wrapping the tails of Plymouths with a big wide stripe that carried
a Roadrunner cartoon character decal.
</P>
<P>
   I guess history does have a way of repeating itself.

 &HT;    Easy steps can keep basement dry
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Though rainfall has been at or below normal this
summer, there was at least one July storm that left many, including
me, with wet basements.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural that basements are more damp than other parts of
our houses, but if you regularly get a puddle, a stream or even a
lake during a heavy rain, there are things you can do to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Inspect your gutters. If you didn't have gutters along the edge
of your roof or downspouts to carry rainwater into the yard, almost
all the rain that hit your roof would fall on the drip area right
under the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   This area quickly would become saturated, and water pressure
would build up outside your basement walls and under the floor. Any
cracks or air pockets in the concrete or the seams between concrete
blocks would allow a path for the water to seep into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest key to a dry basement is keeping rainwater away from
the foundation. If you've had problems with basement moisture after
a rain, go outside and see what's happening on your roof and in the
yard around the house the next time a downpour occurs.
</P>
<P>
   I did that this spring and found a pool forming between my west
wall and the slope alongside my neighbor's driveway. It's going to
take some excavation to give the water a path away from the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, working with the gutters and downspouts
will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Look for leaks in gutters and downspouts and pay particular
attention to seams and connections. Look for sagging spots or areas
where so much water hits the gutters that they overflow. Sagging
spots in gutters are often the sites of overflows.
</P>
<P>
   You usually can fix minor leaks around seams with caulk designed
for gutters. Adding a strategic support strap or nail will correct
a minor sag.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of each downspout, attach some kind of extension
or splash guard that directs water leaving the downspout at least
three feet away from the house. If your basement is chronically
damp, releasing the water even farther away might help.
</P>
<P>
   If the gutter and downspout system is sound, periodically clean
the gutters to keep leaves and other debris from interfering with
efficient water flow.
</P>
<P>
   Check that water that enters the gutters flows smoothly through
the downspouts. Clogged downspouts often can be cleared by
directing a powerful stream from a garden hose through the top
opening.
</P>
<P>
   The soil adjacent to your foundation should slope away from the
house at a rate of at least an inch of drop per foot. Concrete
patios, porches, walks and other solid surfaces also should slope
away from the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   If you do any landscaping or gardening, make sure you don't
create raised areas that cause water to flow back toward the house.
Grass or ground covers with thick root systems planted next to the
foundation also help control water.
</P>
<P>
   Check for more serious problems. Once you've dealt with surface
rainwater runoff, dampness problems should be greatly reduced. But
they might not be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   To correct persistent seepage problems, start by sealing all
visible cracks with concrete patching compound or hydraulic cement.
Hydraulic cement is a putty-like material that can be used to plug
a leak.
</P>
<P>
   After following manufacturers' directions for patching compound
or hydraulic cement to seal cracks, cover walls and floors with a
waterproofing paint. Make sure the paint you select is a
waterproofer, not just a sealer, and that it is rated for use below
grade _ that is, below the ground level. And follow all application
instructions, especially wall-preparation instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If all these steps fail, you might have a problem that needs a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Waterproofing contractors can install a sump pump to pump
underground water away from the foundation. Or they can excavate
around the foundation to add water barriers to the outside of the
basement wall or add underground pipes called drainage tiles to
help direct water away from the house.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ Gore-Lieberman? Heck of a ticket the
Democrats have ended up with. A Southerner from Tennessee needed a
Jew from the Northeast to bring moderation to the party. Such are
the political times we live in. Moderates are where you find them,
in places you'd never would have thought to look. That goes for
both parties. (Joe Murray, editor-publisher emeritus of the Lufkin

<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I am on the lookout for
lumber. Black walnut is my favorite wood to work, but it's easier
to find someone who's going to vote for Ralph Nader than it is to
find black walnut. I'll buy red oak when I find a decent deal,
trade for ash or cypress on occasion, pick up cedar if the price is
right and am considering a trip to Central Texas to pick up some
mesquite and pecan. (Gary Borders is editor and publisher of the
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday. MOVED.

<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Texans like to brag about big.
Everything is braggable here, and size certainly qualifies. But one
area of big in which we'd just as soon not brag is crud. Crud is a
by-product of crude. Oil, that is. Texas tea. We're pretty big in
that, too. In the airborne crud category, the kind pumped into our
skies by cars, factories and refineries, if Texas were a country it
would rank seventh largest. So what the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission will consider Wednesday is big, even by our
standards. (John Young is opinion page editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

PGA PUT VALHALLA ON A FAST TRACK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Augusta National. Pebble Beach. St. Andrews.
Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   Play a game of ``What's Wrong With This Picture'' and folks who
follow professional golf will tell you quicker than you can pick up
a gimme putt that Valhalla doesn't fit. There's just no tradition,
which, of course, it couldn't possibly have, given the fact it is
only 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Valhalla is the venue for the 82d PGA Championship, the
season's fourth major that annually gets trashed as the weak link
in the chain of golf's four majors. Too bad, said Curtis Strange,
``because it's a big deal to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Players generally have been generous in their praise of this
Jack Nicklaus-designed course, but skeptics are everywhere. The
problem, as some observers see it, is that the PGA of America
co-owns the place and will own it outright by the end of this year.
Having an event the size of the PGA Championship or Ryder Cup
(2007) on your own property ensures higher profits, which smacks of
money being the bottom line in selecting a layout.
</P>
<P>
   When Valhalla was granted the PGA Championship in 1996, eyebrows
were raised because rarely do young courses get awarded such
jewels. The return to Valhalla for this season's fourth major has
given more ammunition to the skeptics because it's the soonest a
major championship has returned to a venue since the Myopia Hunt
Club in South Hamilton, Mass., was host for the US Open in 1905 and
1908.
</P>
<P>
   Who cares? say the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you it's my favorite golf course,'' said
Justin Leonard, ``but we're all here playing on the same one.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his colleagues, Leonard knows that criticizing the
course would serve no purpose. Many of them are connected to the
PGA of America, and no Tour player wants to be accused of taking a
slap at Nicklaus. While Valhalla lacks the aura of Augusta, the
breath-taking views of Pebble Beach, and the unmatched history of
St. Andrews, it's not exactly a cow pasture (though it was a horse
pasture before Dwight Gahm bought this 430-acre site in 1981).
</P>
<P>
   Quite the contrary, it's a marvelous layout if you can forgive
the eyesore created by a number of electrical towers and cable
lines. The front side, around which Nicklaus had to deal with
low-lying land that floods easily, is wide open, almost to the
point of radiating a links-like feeling. The backside cuts through
woods and transforms the course into a more traditional American
layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great course,'' said Sergio Garcia, voicing a
popular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But as there always is with these players, some criticisms
surfaced, much of it surrounding the par-5 seventh hole. On a tract
that provides some quirky features (an island green at the par-4
13th, thick bluegrass rough, greens with severe humps), it is the
seventh hole that elicits the most noise.
</P>
<P>
   Goofy, said Ken Venturi. ``I think they ruined it. Get rid of
the (fairway) on the left. Play it on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the fact that players have an option off the
tee: Driving it right to the fat part of the fairway where it
becomes a three-shot hole, or going left, cutting the distance by
nearly 60 yards, and turning it into ``nothing but a long par 4,''
said Venturi.
</P>
<P>
   Like Venturi, Leonard has his doubts about the hole. ``I think
everybody should have to play the same fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would probably go right because there is added danger
left. Still, he knows that bigger hitters who take it left will
have a huge edge by being within mid-iron distance to the green.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, the longest of long hitters, is looking the right way
for once. ``I hit it down the left side today, but I'll probably go
down the right unless the wind is blowing right in our faces. If
you miss the fairway (going left), you don't have a second shot to
get back to the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   The right side? ``I don't know why (a player would),'' said
Venturi, although if it were up to him, the players would be forced
to go that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get rid of the left side and now you have one hellacious par
5,'' he said.

WOODS'S FOCUS HOGAN-LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The teacher was trying to explain his point,
searching for the perfect tool to do so. Words just didn't do it,
no matter how he used them. So Claude ``Butch'' Harmon Jr. did what
anyone from his era would do _ he turned to Ben Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Not the legend himself, but a picture of him. It had been taken
years earlier, but because the photo was clear, so, too, was the
teacher's point. ``Look,'' said Harmon. ``Look at the picture. This
is where I need to get you, but you've got to get stronger to get
to there.''
</P>
<P>
   Get stronger to get better? The student, Tiger Woods, salivated.
Though he had taken the golf world by storm months earlier,
shattering the scoring record at the 1997 Masters, Woods didn't
like the way his golf swing was holding up under pressure. He was
flying greens with wedges, coming up short with 9-irons, pushing
drives right.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, there was something in the swing that only the most
astute gurus could have picked up. Woods wasn't strong with his
left wrist at impact. Bowing. Pronation. Whatever the term, Woods
needed to work on it and to remind him, Harmon gave him a large
blowup of the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't get there,'' said Harmon, explaining the position
Hogan was in in the photo. ``He (Woods) would always rub his arms
right here (pointing to an area above the left wrist where the
right hand would flip over the left at impact). He actually had a
spot on his arm because he rolled it so much when he was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   That Woods trusted Harmon is no surprise, for they had been a
team since August 1993, a collaboration that had produced three
straight US Amateur championships and five victories in his first
16 PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   That Harmon trusted a decades-old photo of Hogan was no
surprise, either, for in the industry, no one's work ethic,
attention to detail, and determination was admired more.
</P>
<P>
   In God we trust? That's currency. In golf, they trust Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   He sees things his competitors can't, sets goals mere mortals
can't even fathom, and pushes himself harder than most of his
colleagues would dare consider. Which is why Tiger Woods is where
he is today, even at age 24.
</P>
<P>
   He's in the field for the 82d PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf
Club, but more than that, Woods is in a league by himself. His
colleagues can pursue their craft in hopes of one glorious week;
Woods will continue his assault on the history books.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Woods already has established scoring records in the US
Open (12 under) and British Open (19 under) to complete his victory
trip around the four majors in just 15 attempts, quicker than any
of the four other players who can claim such a feat. In cementing
his domination of a game that observers had always said could not
be dominated, Woods has become not only the most feared golfer, but
the most recognized sports figure in the world. And each week,
stories are written and words are spoken as to why all of this has
happened so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Examine any number of reasons, but again experts will point to
the picture of Hogan. This time, not for the swing, but for an
essential quality that no one possessed quite like him. Focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan was a breed apart,'' said Ben Crenshaw. ``He was
unbelievable. He would not say hello to his mother if she were out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan. The mere mention makes Crenshaw pause out of respect. It
is arguably the most revered name in golf history, not so much
because he was a warm, beloved person as much as he was the most
diligent worker in a game that demands supreme diligence.
</P>
<P>
   The stories are legendary: Hogan's struggle for years with a
brutal hook that he eventually cured or his unmatched ability to
shape a shot to whichever way was required. The answer ``was in the
dirt,'' he used to say, which meant you had to practice for hours,
then practice some more. On his way to tournaments, it is said that
Hogan would drive well below the speed limit, going just slow
enough to get himself into a frame of mind that would fit the
meticulous pace he would play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had tremendous focus,'' said Harmon, who is one of the few
people who can relate to Hogan on a personal level and not through
the pages of history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and my dad (Claude, the 1948 Masters champ and one of the
best pros of his era) were friends. I knew Hogan my whole life. I
grew up watching him practice at Seminole.''
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, agreed Harmon, that he is helping to guide Woods
toward a Hogan mark that many people felt would never be matched.
That is, three major victories in a season, a feat Hogan
accomplished in 1953 and one which Woods could match with a victory
at Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   There are huge differences between these men, said Harmon. While
Woods was told to study Hogan at impact, he did not try to sell him
the entire package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say you should try to copy Hogan's swing, because I
think it's ruined more people than it's helped,'' said Harmon.
``He'd try to bend that right elbow in, the shaft would lay down,
but he had tremendous speed in his body and his hands and he would
get the club squared, the left wrist in a more tucked position and
the clubface open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the average player doesn't have that sort of
speed and would hit it right every time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was one thing Harmon would transplant from Hogan to
Woods, it would be the legendary steel-eyed focus. He won't take
credit for it, but it appears to be taking place, said Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hogan) had tremendous focus, and I think you're seeing Tiger
Woods is now getting to that. If you watch Tiger play, especially
in the major championships, he is totally in command of not only
his physical being, but mentally, too. And that's where I think
Hogan and (Jack) Nicklaus had it over everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they were great players, but they also were so smart and
they had to focus with what was at hand. I think you're seeing
Tiger Woods is now able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story has been told many times in many versions and is
considered the quintessential tale to demonstrate just how focused
Hogan was. ``Dad swore it was true, so it's all I can go by,''
Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 12th hole at Augusta and my dad made a hole-in-one. Mr.
Hogan made a 2, and as they walked to the 13th tee, Mr. Hogan said
to my dad, `Claude, that's the first time I've ever made a 2 on
that hole. What did you get?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon laughs pleasantly, for the story hasn't lost an ounce of
its appeal over the span of 50 years. And he is well aware that his
star pupil is compiling his own legendary tales that perhaps now
don't measure up to Hogan's, but someday will.
</P>
<P>
   The US Open at Pebble Beach a few months ago provided just such
a moment. In the final round, Woods's walk down the third fairway
brought him close to a jam-packed gallery. Two attention-seeking
spectators grabbed prime spots to stand there, both of them donned
in Tiger costumes head to toe, complete with makeup and whiskers.
</P>
<P>
   People laughed, hooted, and waited for Woods's reaction. There
wasn't any. He locked his eyes straight ahead, walked briskly, and
never strayed one step from his intended destination. The men in
their Tiger costumes walked away.
</P>
<P>
   A different example, for sure, but these ``are different eras,''
said Ken Venturi, the CBS analyst and former US Open champion who
counted Hogan among his friends. No one, in Venturi's mind, matches
Hogan for pure determination, and if Woods drew inspiration from a
large photo of the four-time US Open champion, it only proves he's
like many others.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Woods is respectful of what Hogan did and not in
any rush to look past the business at hand. ``I am not here trying
to duplicate what Hogan did in '53,'' he said. ``That strictly is a
by-product of winning the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan loyalists are quick to point out that the '53 feat should
rank ahead of what Woods could do _ and their rationale is sound.
After winning the Masters and US Open that year, Hogan had to
choose between the PGA Championship (July 1-7) and the British Open
(July 8-10). There was no way he could travel from one to the
other, not with the British Open in those days requiring
pretournament qualifying, so there would not be any chance at the
Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no outcry for it, either. Like Venturi said, ``a
different era.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 47 years and Woods is at the center of every
interview, the focal point of every practice round, seemingly the
only player in a field of 150 who matters. It is, said Woods,
sometimes stifling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Hogan played in a time when the media atmosphere
wasn't what it is now, so that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   He was addressing a room filled with reporters, most of whom
will be jammed inside the ropes for this morning's round, played in
front of galleries packed 10-15 people deep. Indeed, more hectic
than in Hogan's prime, but Woods concedes that the man whose mark
he is chasing had to deal with it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played golf in a way, both mentally and emotionally, where
he liked to just kind of be on his own and block everything out.
And that is what I try and do.''
</P>
<P>
   Can he do it? Are you kidding, ask his colleagues. Have you been
watching?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be very surprised if he actually knew there was a big
gallery there,'' said Lee Westwood. ``I think mentally he is that
strong. I don't think he sees anything but the ball and the hole,
or the ball and the flag. I don't think he'd know whether there
were 5 or 5,000 people watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, you know Hogan would approve.

<P>
   It's dark. As you drift off to sleep, a noise outside yanks you
back into the wakeful world. Instantly alert, your heart pounds
against your ribs. A moment later you hear a snarling bark and a
crash as the intruders beat a hasty retreat. Panic over _ good old
Fido has seen them off.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine that instead of settling back to sleep, your loyal
watchdog comes bounding into your bedroom, teeth bared, eyes
flashing, and starts attacking you. How do you feel as your flesh
is ripped apart? Now you can begin to understand the shock felt by
someone who has been told that their own immune system _ their
body's molecular watchdog _ has turned traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, lupus and
rheumatoid arthritis, claim millions of new victims each year.
Their methods vary, but all involve an overzealous immune system
attacking the very body it was designed to defend. Cell by cell,
they slowly disable and ultimately kill many of their victims.
Despite decades of research, few theories have emerged to explain
why natural selection would tolerate such a critical design flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few biologists are starting to point the finger at alien
invaders that have been trapped inside our cells for millions of
years. And if they are right, practices such as gene therapy and
xenotransplantation may be riskier than anyone thought.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers agree that the key to the puzzle of autoimmunity
must lie in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) _ our immune
system genes. The MHC is an unusually diverse region of the genome,
which probably reflects our intense and ongoing co-evolutionary
arms race with countless disease organisms. Each MHC gene in a
population can have dozens of versions _ or alleles _ although only
a couple of these will be present in any given individual. Over 200
MHC genes are packed tightly together in our genome and their job
is to produce proteins that detect and destroy invaders.
</P>
<P>
   But some MHC alleles or haplotypes _ combinations of alleles _
have a major drawback: people who carry them are more likely to get
an autoimmune disease. For example, nearly every victim of Hirata's
disease _ in which the body attacks its insulin-producing cells _
carries the MHC allele known as DR4w13. Two-thirds of those who
suffer from rheumatoid arthritis possess another risky allele
called DQB1. The haplotypes dubbed DQ and DR also confer an
increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes. And
researchers have identified dozens more of these associations.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely, not everybody who carries a risky allele or
haplotype becomes ill. So the simplistic notion that these risky
alleles lead inexorably to autoimmune disease has been abandoned in
favor of more sophisticated explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The widely accepted view is that a risky allele must be switched
on before it turns traitor. The trigger is thought to be bits of
foreign proteins, from food or infectious invaders, that resemble
the body's own proteins. MHC alleles that respond to such
``molecular mimics'' will then be primed to attack the body's own
proteins as well. Such alleles could persist through evolutionary
time if they help fight off infectious diseases in early life and
do not trigger autoimmune reactions until middle or late life. So
people who carry them are more likely to survive long enough to
reproduce and pass along their double-edged immunological
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Although this theory doesn't explain susceptibility to diseases
that kick in during childhood, such as type I diabetes, many find
it appealing. Not so Graham Boyd, emeritus professor of medicine at
the University of Tasmania in Hobart. He doesn't attribute
autoimmune diseases to molecular mimics at all. Instead, Boyd and a
growing number of like-minded theorists point to what at first
glance may seem an unlikely culprit: ancient viruses stuck in the
human genome, known as endogenous retroviruses or ERVs.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish as it sounds, we are the genetic descendants of
viruses as well as primates. The viral ancestors of ERVs invaded
the cells of our forebears during infections millions of years ago
and liked it so much they decided to stay. Happily integrated into
their new home, ERVs have become part of our own genome, passed
down through the generations. In fact, virologists have spotted
ERVs in the genome of every mammal they have checked. Repeated
invasions over more than 30 million years have left a surprisingly
large viral legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 1 per cent of the human genome is represented by human
ERVs and their fragments,'' says Eugene Sverdlov, a geneticist at
the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ERVs are relatively simple creatures, genetically speaking. Like
wild retroviruses _ which include HIV _ they have a few genes
coding for enzymes and structural proteins. They are called
retroviruses because their genes are encoded in RNA rather than DNA
and they infiltrate the host genome by creating DNA copies of
themselves. Infected cells may then be tricked into duplicating the
viral genes as though they were merely instructions for one of the
body's own cellular proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Sverdlov calls ERVs ``the perpetually mobile footprints of
ancient infections.'' Many of the resident aliens' genes have been
broken up by mutations, but at least a few are still intact and
able to make viral proteins. ERVs also have a nasty habit of
hopping around the genome, duplicating as they go. And either
behavior _ jumping or producing viral proteins _ could explain why
certain MHC alleles are linked to autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, ERVs pose little threat to their hosts. But Boyd
believes the truce is an uneasy one. ``There would always be
renegade rogues on both sides,'' he says. Although most ERVs do not
normally produce the viral proteins that provoke attack from the
host immune system, many retain the genetic code for such
particles. This unwillingness to disarm, Boyd believes, may set the
stage for autoimmune disease. ERVs that retain their
protein-producing potential are more like tenuously tamed wolves
than loyal puppy dogs. Every once in a while these ERVs awake from
their civilized slumber and begin pumping out viral proteins.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes domesticated ERVs turn feral? Boyd believes that
the key is repeated damage to cells, either from infection by wild
viruses or from severe psychological stress. The effects of such
stress can affect the sympathetic nerves controlling arterial blood
supply. If the nerves are shut down, the temporary loss of blood
supply can cause cellular damage, which might contribute to ERV
activation, according to Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once ERVs start producing molecules that look like
antigens from wild viruses, MHC genes may kick in to fight off the
perceived invasion. The result is an immune attack against your own
cells.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the jury is still out on whether ERVs are an
accessory to autoimmune disease.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more positive side to all this: it could lead to
ways of fighting off diseases that now seem to strike at random. If
ERVs are activated by repeated stress, as Boyd suspects, then
identifying and avoiding such stress could one day eliminate the
immunological betrayals that lead to disease. ``Autoimmune disease
is not inevitable,'' says Boyd.

<P>
   Chimpanzees are on their way to becoming half-decent chefs.
Captive chimps in Madrid have begun to puree their own fruits and
vegetables, in what looks like the first case of an ape
transforming food to improve its taste and texture.
</P>
<P>
   Chimps use all sorts of clever techniques to obtain food, such
as fishing termites out of mounds with sticks and bashing palm nuts
open with rocks. But these tricks do not alter the quality of the
food. ``These are not cases of transformation of food in the human
way,'' says Samuel Fernandez-Carriba, a primatologist at the
Universidad Autonoma in Madrid. ``Transformation involves things
like grinding and heating.''
</P>
<P>
   The first chimp to perform the new trick was Linda, who was
brought to the university zoo in 1992 after her previous owner had
removed all her teeth to avoid being bitten. When she had been at
the zoo about a year, the keepers noticed she was managing to eat
apples by rubbing them along a sharp corner in her enclosure so
that pulp and juice ran out on the wall. She would lick the mashed
fruit off the wall and then rub the apple some more. Six other
chimps in the same enclosure soon began to imitate her. Now the
whole group, except the alpha male and female and an infant, have
picked up the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez-Carriba and his colleagues Angela Loeches and Ana
Morcillo have now watched the chimps pureeing their food for more
than 450 hours. Rather than just mashing up fruit any old way, the
other chimps have adopted Linda's means of preparation. They all
rub the fruit on a sharp corner for about 10 seconds and then lick
off the pure. Because the chimps copy the action in a stereotypical
fashion, the researchers conclude that it is a culturally
transmitted ritual. Chimps are known to have passed on around 40
other behaviors in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The gourmet chimps eat apples, carrots, lemons and oranges by
rubbing, which changes not only the texture, but also the flavor of
the food. And since they choose to take the time preparing each
dish, they may get greater enjoyment or satisfaction from the
result, Fernandez-Carriba says.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether food transformation exists in the wild, he
says. Either we just haven't seen it, or animals can't afford to
waste time preparing each meal. ``But if, like the chimps, you have
the time, you might cook all day and make something nice,''
Fernndez-Carriba says. ``Maybe this is one more piece of evidence
that we are not as unique as we previously thought.''  &QL;

<P>
   People likely to commit suicide have a distinctive tone of
voice.
</P>
<P>
   A subtle change in the sound of someone's voice is the first
sign that they are serious about committing suicide. The change is
so distinctive that psychiatrists plan to use the sound change as
an early warning system to separate those who are seriously
suicidal from those who are merely depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the voice might contain vital clues about
someone's mental health came when Stephen Silverman, a psychiatrist
at Yale University, noticed he could often sense from a patient's
voice whether they were likely to attempt suicide in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   To find out if this observation had any practical use, Silverman
teamed up with Mitchell Wilkes, an electronics engineer based at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes recorded a series of interviews with 64 depressed
patients and compared them with recordings of 33 others who weren't
depressed. In total, 22 patients made a serious attempt on their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   He then compared the recordings with the subsequent history of
the patients. ``In suicidal patients, the voice becomes slightly
hollow and empty, you get this change in quality,'' he says. ``They
call it 'the voice from the grave.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes found that two factors helped him discriminate between
those who were at high risk of committing suicide and those at low
risk. First he noticed that people who are truly suicidal use a
narrower range of frequencies when pronouncing their vowels than
people who are just depressed. The voices of suicidal people also
become higher pitched. ``We find there's a noticeable difference
between suicidal and normal, and normal and depressed people,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the frequency shifts could be related to
stress-induced physiological changes, Wilkes says. ``A variety of
changes can take place under stress _ like muscle tone quality _
that can affect the vocal chords,'' he says. ``Also you get changes
in moisture and elasticity of the vocal tract.''
</P>
<P>
   His findings could help the volunteers who staff helplines to
assess a depressed caller's mental state. ``The goal is to have a
diagnostic device for emergency rooms or that could be linked up to
helplines,'' he says. ``It could help volunteers on those phones
answer the question: is this person in danger of committing
suicide?'' Emma Charvet from The Samaritans, which runs helplines
for suicidal people in Britain, says the research might help to
prevent suicides. ``If there's any way of finding out earlier the
level of someone's risk of suicide, it'd be a great help,'' she
says.

<P>
   Animal behavior experts have been looking at how their
colleagues behave, and have found that those who study the most
colorful animals are also the most flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Dale of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole,
Mass., and his colleagues watched 42 presentations at last year's
Animal Behavior Society meeting at Bucknell University in
Pennsylvania. They recorded the number of times each speaker used a
laser pointer to trace shapes on the slide screen during a
20-minute talk, including wiggles, circles, horizontal and vertical
lines. ``It was just a matter of doodling during each talk,'' Dale
says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the recorders, Jenny Basil of the City University of New
York, looked for any correlations between the types of shapes used
and various distinguishing characteristics of the speakers, such as
age, sex, social status (professor or student) and habitat _
whether they lived east or west of the Mississippi River. But none
could be linked to the speaker's pointer style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only correlation we found was with the speaker's study
organism,'' Dale says. Bird behaviorists used an average of four
different shapes per talk, whereas scientists studying other
vertebrates averaged only 2.3. Invertebrate biologists had the
least varied pointer repertoire, using only 1.5 shapes per talk on
average.
</P>
<P>
   Dale says people with more flamboyant personalities may be drawn
to birds _with their bright plumage and cheery songs _ whereas more
reserved scientists might prefer prawns and starfish. The
researchers would like to collect more data, but they worry they
may now have biased their study population by presenting the
results at this year's meeting.  &QL;

   This month, The New York Times Syndicate debuted HARVARD
BUSINESS PUBLISHING, the first of two news services that will carry
content from Harvard Business School Publishing. HBSP is the
publishing arm of the world leader in business and management
education.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, clients of HARVARD BUSINESS PUBLISHING receive two
800-word articles selected from HBSP's three newsletters: Harvard
Management Update newsletter, Harvard Management Communication
Letter and Balanced Scorecard Report.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   All reports:

<P>
   HOW TO AVOID E-MAIL LAWSUITS
</P>
<P>
   AVOIDING-E-MAIL-LAWSUITS-HARVARD-BUSINESS-PUBLISHING _ Instant
gratification always comes at a price. E-mail makes it easier to
communicate with colleagues, but inappropriate messages can make
you and your company vulnerable to lawsuits for harassment, libel
and copyright violations. How should one navigate these treacherous
communication waters? By taking heed of these tips. 700 words.
Excerpted from the Harvard Management Communication Letter.

   WORKING WITH INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
</P>
<P>
   CONSULTANT-BOOM-HARVARD-BUSINESS-PUBLISHING _ The terms are used
loosely: independent contractor, contract employee, consultant. But
the phenomenon they refer to _ people who put in a substantial
number of hours at a company but are not legally employees of the
business _ has exploded in recent years. Some independent
contractors, or ICs, are brought in for specific short-term
projects. Others have a long-term gig with a company, moving from
one task to another. This article lists 20 ways to tell who's truly
a consultant and who's not. 800 words. Excerpted from the Harvard
Management Update newsletter.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The terms are used loosely: independent contractor, contract
employee, consultant. But the phenomenon they refer to _ people who
put in a substantial number of hours at a company but are not
legally employees _ has exploded in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent contractors, or ICs, are brought in for
specific short-term projects. Others work what amounts to a
long-term gig with the company, moving from one task to another.
</P>
<P>
   From a manager's perspective, it seems like an easy solution:
Freeze or reduce the permanent staff and instead contract with
skilled professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A company isn't responsible for income-tax withholding, Social
Security and Medicare, unemployment, workers' compensation and all
the other benefits that generally amount to more than one-third of
total payroll costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does anyone have to worry about terminating the ICs in a
downturn: When their contracts end, they're gone.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors, for their part, can pick and choose clients,
work where and when they determine and typically earn significantly
more per hour than they'd make as regular employees.
</P>
<P>
   But complications can arise. For instance, imagine a situation
in which employers suddenly decide to treat whole groups of
employees as independent contractors, thereby saving bundles on
benefits. A relationship that looks like a win/win from society's
perspective when the IC is, say, a skilled software engineer could
look more like exploitation when the newly declared IC is an
unskilled factory worker who is asked to work without benefits.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, tax-collecting authorities have a big interest in
how employees are classified. Employees' taxes are withheld and
paid to the government on a regular basis. ICs, by contrast, are
responsible for paying their own taxes. That makes the tax
collector's monitoring-and-collection job harder.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, there are a host of governmental regulations
concerning the circumstances under which workers may legitimately
be classified and treated as ICs.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OR EMPLOYEE? THE 20 TESTS
</P>
<P>
   Here are 20 common factors that the IRS and federal courts use
in combination to determine whether workers are properly
classified. Measure against this list to see if your classification
is appropriate:
</P>
<P>
   1. INSTRUCTIONS. Employees must comply with instructions of
when, where and how work is to be performed. ICs can be held
responsible only for the final product.
</P>
<P>
   2. TRAINING. Employees often receive training from their
employers; ICs do not.
</P>
<P>
   3. INTEGRATION. Employees provide services that are an integral
part of a company's day-to-day operations; ICs should not do work
that determines the success or continuation of the hiring firm.
</P>
<P>
   4. SERVICES RENDERED PERSONALLY. Employees must do their own
work; ICs generally can hire other people to do their work.
</P>
<P>
   5. HIRING, SUPERVISING AND PAYING ASSISTANTS. Employees hire,
supervise and pay assistants only at the discretion of the
employer; ICs can hire whomever they want.
</P>
<P>
   6. RELATIONSHIP TO EMPLOYER. Employees have a continuing
relationship with their employer; ICs generally move on after
finishing a project.
</P>
<P>
   7. WORK HOURS. Employees normally have set hours of work; ICs
set their own hours.
</P>
<P>
   8. WORKING FULL TIME. An employee may be required to work full
time for an employer; ICs can work when and for whom they choose.
</P>
<P>
   9. LOCATION OF WORK. Employees must work where their employer
specifies; ICs can usually choose where to work.
</P>
<P>
   10. SEQUENCE OF WORK. Employees may have the sequence of work
established for them by their employers; ICs decide the sequence
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   11. PROGRESS REPORTS. Employees may be required to prepare
progress reports; ICs are responsible only for the final product.
</P>
<P>
   12. METHOD OF PAYMENT. Employees are paid by amount of time
worked; ICs are often paid a flat rate per project.
</P>
<P>
   13. BUSINESS OR TRAVEL EXPENSES. Employees' expenses are paid by
the employer; ICs are responsible for their own expenses.
</P>
<P>
   14. TOOLS AND MATERIALS. Employees get all necessary supplies
from their employer; ICs must provide their own.
</P>
<P>
   15. INVESTMENT. Employees usually don't have an investment in
equipment or facilities; ICs do.
</P>
<P>
   16. REALIZATION OF PROFIT OR LOSS. Employees are paid for their
labor and have no liability for business expenses; ICs can earn a
profit or suffer a loss as a result of the services they provide.
</P>
<P>
   17. WORKING FOR MORE THAN ONE FIRM. Employees may be restricted
from working for another firm at the same time; ICs have no such
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   18. MAKING SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. Employees
work primarily for the hiring firm; ICs can make their services
available to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   19. RIGHT TO FIRE. An employee can be fired at any time, for
almost any reason; ICs can be terminated only according to the
terms of their agreement.
</P>
<P>
   20. RIGHT TO QUIT. Employees may quit at any time without
liability; ICs are legally obligated to complete the work they
contracted to do.

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Instant gratification always comes at a price. E-mail makes it
easier to communicate with colleagues, but inappropriate messages
can make you and your company vulnerable to lawsuits for
harassment, libel and copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, senior management may be watching. An American
Management Association survey released in April found that 38
percent of companies routinely store or review e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   How should one navigate these treacherous communication waters?
By taking heed of these tips.
</P>
<P>
   BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WRITE
</P>
<P>
   Labor lawyers are kept busier than ever with sexual and racial
harassment claims, and an increasing number of lawsuits feature
damaging e-mails as evidence. Indeed, lawyers say the climate for
harassment in the workplace has dramatically shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six months, it's been rare to hear about
harassment complaints that don't involve e-mail, the Internet or
both,'' says Carole O'Blenes, a lawyer at Proskauer Rose in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Employees today often claim they are victims of a hostile work
environment that could include persistent e-mail requests for
dates, racy jokes or pornography downloaded from the Internet. What
is one person's notion of fun can be another's humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   O'Blenes says a larger problem is the technology itself. E-mail
is often viewed as an informal medium with few, if any, rules.
``There's an ephemeral quality to e-mail that allows people to be
more offhand than if they were writing a memo on company
letterhead.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BE FOOLED BY `DELETED E-MAILS'
</P>
<P>
   The informality of e-mail can lull users into a false sense of
comfort. After all, if they send or receive something questionable,
all they have to do is hit the delete button and no one will be the
wiser, right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The stark reality is that deleting an e-mail merely sends the
document into the recesses of a hard drive, and it will sit there
indefinitely unless the drive itself is purged.
</P>
<P>
   SEND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION VIA ANOTHER MEDIUM
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a no-brainer, but lawyers say its alarming
how often employees will use e-mail to casually discuss strategy,
trash-talk a competitor or divulge information not meant to be
shared.
</P>
<P>
   This can especially be a problem for personnel issues. E-mail
that speaks negatively of a person and goes beyond the original
sender and recipient could be the basis for a libel claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do employee reviews by e-mail because that's not
something you want someone else to accidentally get,'' says lawyer
Marcelo Halpern of Gordon &AMP; Glickson in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   BE WARY OF COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS
</P>
<P>
   It's easy _ too easy _ to download software and other material
and then e-mail it with abandon. Woe to the employee whose company
gets a cease-and-desist letter.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Pictures reportedly sent out plenty of those when the
trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'' became a
download darling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, these files suck up too much bandwidth and slow
down the normal course of business. An otherwise efficient T I pipe
will behave like a balky 14.4 kb modem if too many of these files
are traveling through the system.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Although you can't stop people from sending you
things, you can ask them to not send them. And never pass them
along.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL IS COMPANY PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to e-mail, employees have no right to privacy. As
long as they are using a company PC and computer network, then any
product generated from that use _ including e-mail _ is considered
company property and is subject to monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number of firms are turning to monitoring software
to do the work for them. Employees might find that akin to Big
Brother getting a corner office. But those who make the software
prefer to view their product more as a security blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies have internal audit departments,'' notes Bob
Friedhoff, whose Falls Church, Va., company xVault makes monitoring
software. ``It's not audited because nobody believes you. It's
audited because you want to have controls and assurance that things
are being done properly.''

LOPEZ AT THE CENTER OF ``CELL'' FANTASY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
There's a reason why Jennifer Lopez looks so comfortable in the
wilder, more surreal segments of ``The Cell.'' The movie's director
used to make music videos. Called upon to strike poses in
phantasmagorical settings while wearing outrageous outfits, the
singer-actress seems right at home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A psychological thriller that takes place largely within the
dreamlike confines of the mind, ``The Cell'' plays like an
audacious cross between ``The Matrix'' and ``The Silence of the
Lambs.'' At times it even starts to resemble ``What Dreams May
Come.'' In that romantic fantasy, Robin Williams, with the help of
groundbreaking computer graphics, journeyed through extravagant
visions of heaven and hell.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cell's'' first scene, Lopez sits astride a black horse
that gallops through the desert, dwarfed by gigantic pink dunes.
She wears an elaborate white, feathered dress. Accompanied by a
cacophony of Middle Eastern-sounding music, she starts to walk
slowly up the dune, leaving footprints behind in the mountain of
sand.
</P>
<P>
   It's a peculiar opening for a cop movie, but it is only the
first of many peculiarities.
</P>
<P>
   Video directors who graduate to film often have problems with
basic storytelling. Their movies look good, with every shot
suitable for framing, but fundamentals such as narrative
progression, character building and suspense can seem beyond their
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Tarsem Singh avoids this pitfall. ``The Cell'' has a narrative
thread as strong as steel. A psycho killer is on the loose. After
he's caught, there is a race to unravel his secrets so that his
last victim may be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers use a radical (and largely unexplained) therapy that
uses drugs and futuristic devices to project the consciousness of
Lopez's character into the killer's mind. Once there, she learns
that there is an innocent but wounded boy buried deep inside the
killer's brain. Is it possible to vanquish the monster but save the
child?
</P>
<P>
   With such a strong storyline, the movie can afford to take time
to luxuriate in spectacle. Still, the cost for all of those grand
images is a diminished detective story and characters that are less
developed than they ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   This is a psychological thriller with little concern for
psychology, a detective story with no patience for detection. After
he takes his own journey through the mind of the killer, FBI agent
Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) springs awake with a head-smacking good
idea: Why not poke around the psycho killer's lair for clues?
</P>
<P>
   As basic as this is, it's treated as such an outlandish notion
that when Novak suggests it, his partner cautions him against
rushing off half-cocked.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow it feels right that when Lopez's character, psychologist
Catherine Deane, journeys into the killer's mind, she encounters
limited memories and no ideas but plenty of bizarre, unhinged
fantasies. In his imagination, the killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) is
alternately a cruel but regal warlock-like being or else a savage
warrior king in a splendiferous hall.
</P>
<P>
   Unfettered by irrelevant notions of realism or physics, director
Singh and his teams of visual effects artists go all out. These
scenes sometimes have the feel of fantastic comic books or of
science fiction _ narrative forms in which the imagination is the
only limit. In such landscapes as this, war is waged against good
and evil.
</P>
<P>
   But that opening scene in the desert takes place inside the mind
of a child. Later scenes inside Deane's own mind are similarly
visual and dreamlike. For example, she imagines herself in a red
nun's habit. She stands in a perfectly symmetrical hall, and when
she speaks, gold filigree and flowers appear along the edges of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   These images are all great to look at, but are they meant to
suggest that we all think solely in images, as if we have Hollywood
production designers inside our heads with our own teams of visual
artists?
</P>
<P>
   As good as Lopez looks in these costumes (she wears nothing as
showy as that green, open-fronted number she notoriously half-wore
to the Grammys), she comes across less well in the dramatic
portions of the movie. Her character risks her sanity, if not her
life, by projecting her own consciousness into the killer's head.
</P>
<P>
   Deane is part of this important experiment not because of her
scientific acumen but because of her unusual ability to connect
with wounded individuals and draw them out. ``She has a gift,'' one
scientist says of her.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez makes us believe in Deane's vulnerability and gift for
empathy, but, with her little girl's voice, her passive manner and
body-hugging skirts, she's not what you would expect of a
competent, educated professional, much less a partner in such an
important scientific project.
</P>
<P>
   These traits all could've been used to establish character. At
the beginning of the film, a man who questions her abilities almost
withdraws his son from the experiment. But rather than explore his
reasons or even acknowledge that Lopez isn't typical, the movie
makes either her casting or the way she was directed seem like a
lapse in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only serious lapse. The rest of the movie probably
works pretty much the way the filmmakers wanted it to. You can
question the worthiness of their subject and vision, but you can't
really argue with the way they executed it.

 &HT;    
 By SUSAN WELSH 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``Sex-crazed homewrecker'' is not exactly the description that
comes to mind when one thinks of Joan Allen, an actress who has
brought sexual repression to a new level of artistry.
 &HT;    Yet in her new movie, ``The Contender,'' she portrays Sen. Laine
Hanson, a politician who is first seen in flagrante delicto on her
desk and is later accused of committing adultery with her best
friend's husband.
 &HT;    More damning still, she's said to have engaged in carnal
shenanigans that would make Monica Lewinsky look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm.
 &HT;    Early in the film, Hanson, an Ohio Democrat, is asked by the
president (played by Jeff Bridges) to take the office of vice
president after the death of the incumbent. But in a plot twist
laden with allusions to the Hill-Thomas hearings and the Clinton
scandal, her enemy, a powerful Republican congressman (Gary Oldman,
looking very unlike himself), dredges up some eye-popping sex
photos from her past.
 &HT;    Writer-director Rod Lurie began work on ``The Contender'' at the
height of the Lewinsky affair, and he wanted to comment on an
aspect of it that he thought was being overlooked.
 &HT;    ``I told my wife,'' he recalls, ''`Clinton is going to get away
with this, because he's a man, and because we don't have many
negative feelings about male sexuality. But female sexuality is a
totally different story.'''
 &HT;    For Allen, the role offered an opportunity to break the glass
ceiling that has hovered over her career. Over breakfast on a hazy,
sweltering New York morning, the willowy 45-year-old actress,
looking cool and self-possessed in a simple sleeveless black dress,
sums up the role's appeal: ``Instead of being married to the
senator, I am the senator.''
 &HT;    Despite being one of the most highly regarded actresses in
Hollywood, she has, until now, played mostly wives _ but wives who
are singularly good at hiding roiling passion beneath a placid,
controlled exterior.
 &HT;    She won Best Supporting Actress nominations for her turn as a
loyal but sexually frustrated Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's epic
``Nixon,'' and the following year for playing a Puritan whose
bottled-up ardor drives Daniel Day-Lewis astray in ``The
Crucible.''
 &HT;    Allen's uncanny ability to convey raw emotion without emoting
may make her the ideal choice for a film that tests the somewhat
hazy American boundary between the public and the private. And as
it happens, Lurie dreamed up ``The Contender'' expressly as a
vehicle for her.
 &HT;    In 1998, when Allen won a best supporting actress award from the
L.A. Film Critics Association for playing a love-starved June
Cleaver clone in ``Pleasantville,'' Lurie, a former critic who
describes himself as ``an obsessed fan of Joan's,'' asked if he
could present it to her.
 &HT;    Extemporizing at the podium, he found himself saying, ``I should
write a movie for Joan Allen, because if Joan agrees to do it, then
it's going to be a good movie.''
 &HT;    During the dinner that followed, Allen expressed genuine
interest in the idea, and shortly afterward, Lurie began work on a
screenplay.
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what I was going to write _ not the vaguest
idea,'' he says. ``I knew that I had one mission, and that was to
write a character to which Joan Allen could not say no.''
 &HT;    Allen, who researched the role by watching tapes of Gerald
Ford's confirmation hearings and by spending time with Arkansas
Sen. Blanche Lincoln, says she connected with Laine Hanson's core
of integrity.
 &HT;    ``It's what you would like politics to be if it really worked,''
she says, while acknowledging that ``the character is not
completely lifelike.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Hanson is almost a fairy-tale liberal: She is pro-choice
and pro-campaign finance reform, wants the death penalty abolished,
thinks all guns should be confiscated and believes that selling
cigarettes to minors should be a federal offense. Oh, and she's an
avowed atheist.
 &HT;    But unlike some of her celebrity neighbors on New York's
famously liberal Upper West Side _ where she maintains a low
profile with her husband, actor Peter Friedman, and their
6-year-old daughter, Sadie _ Allen prefers to keep her own views
private.
 &HT;    ``Rod is the political animal, and I'm the actor,'' she says.
``He wrote the part that way, and I did it.'' She herself would
``never, ever, ever'' want to run for office. ``That's why it was
so fun to play a politician,'' she says, ``because it's so
antithetical to my nature.''
 &HT;    Early press screenings had Oscar-watchers buzzing about Allen's
strong shot at a statuette. Allen remains wary of the hype, but she
confesses that when the movie was picked up for distribution by
DreamWorks, her heart beat a little faster.
 &HT;    ``I knew how much they were going to back it,'' she says, ``and
I had a moment like, `God, this could really change me.' I sort of
panicked, quietly. I said to my husband, `I like to take the
subway. I like taking the bus. I'm kind of anonymous!' But I've
sort of calmed down about that now.''

 (Art is available.) 
 From WWD, DNR and W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHER'S LATEST VENTURE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    She sings, she acts _ and now she makes jewelry. Cher is hard at
work on a new jewelry line that will be in stores by November.
 &HT;    The collection, called ``Cher for Loree Rodkin,'' includes long
earrings, necklaces and bracelets; platinum, gold and silver, and
lots of beads and stones.
 &HT;    As with the vanity cases that Sharon Stone's designing for Louis
Vuitton, a percentage of the profits will go to charity _ in Cher's
case, the Facial Foundation for Disfigured Children, the cause she
took up during the making of the film ``Mask.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMAN'S AIDS STANCE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``AIDS is not over. Our children remain at great risk. Every
hour of every day, two American adolescents are infected with
HIV.''
 &HT;    These words are from the model Iman, who has signed on as
celebrity spokeswoman for Mothers' Voices, a nonprofit group
focused on educating parents and teachers on AIDS issues as they
affect youth.
 &HT;    Sheryl Schwartz, wife of Calvin Klein Inc. vice chairman Barry
Schwartz, serves as chairwoman of the group, which also receives
financial and logistical support from Calvin Klein.
 &HT;    ``As parents, we all want to protect our children and given them
the skills they need to live a sexually healthy life,'' Iman added.
 &HT;    This fall, the organization plans to extend its workshop series,
which aims to teach parents how to seize ``teachable moments'' to
explain to their children the facts about the disease _ from its
New York headquarters to Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles,
Miami and Providence, R.I.
 &HT;    The group also plans to host a full-day workshop titled
``Parenting in the Age of AIDS'' this October in New York for the
parents of children attending public schools.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRITNEY'S ONLINE LATHER
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It seems that Clairol is taking its association with new
spokeswoman Britney Spears to a new level. Not only is the company
sponsoring Spears' summer concert tour, it's also garnering new
listeners for the teen queen with a promotional pack available on
CVS.com.
 &HT;    The set includes full-sized bottles of Clairol's Herbal Essences
Shampoo and Conditioner for normal/oily hair and a Spears sampler
CD for $8.99.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POWER LUNCHERS
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ ``Men already run the world,'' said Susan Estrich,
the first woman to run a presidential campaign _ Michael Dukakis' _
and the author of an upcoming book, ``Sex and Power.'' She said
it's up to women ``to recognize the power they have,'' be proud of
it and use it.
 &HT;    Estrich, who spoke to about 60 women at Harper's Bazaar's recent
``power luncheon'' at the Alain Ducasse restaurant, pointed out
that one of the most powerful women was sitting right in the room _
Barbara Walters. She cited Walters' refusal to have O.J. Simpson on
her show, ``The View,'' which drew applause from the audience.
 &HT;    ``I do not have power,'' Walters called out, to which the crowd
exhibited some disbelief _ especially since Walters is negotiating
a reported $12 million contract with ABC.
 &HT;    Other heavy hitters who came out to celebrate Bazaar's August
``power'' issue included Tina Brown, Maria Bartiromo, Kate Spade,
Diane Von Furstenberg, Lesley Stahl, Carolina Herrera, Aerin
Lauder, Josie Natori and Dana Buchman.
 &HT;    The luncheon was hosted by Kate Betts, Bazaar's editor in chief,
and Cynthia Lewis, vice president and publisher.
 &HT;    Bartiromo, an anchor for CNBC whose staggering schedule left
some in the room breathless, said her idea of power is not having
lots of assistants and delegating.
 &HT;    ``I make my own phone calls and in many cases, I'm a one-woman
show,'' said Bartiromo, who does three live shows a day. ``For me,
power is not delegating. It's getting the story right and getting
it first and putting it on the air before it's disseminated.''

 By ROXANNE ROBINSON 
 (Three color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Forget Miss Manners' hard-and-fast rules about never
wearing white before Memorial Day or after Labor Day. White denim
is fast becoming a seasonless fabric, and manufacturers are
offering it into holiday.
 &HT;    At Calvin Klein, white denim with a ``destructed'' finish was a
huge part of summer 2000, and it's returning for holiday 2000-2001.
 &HT;    Nautica Jeans is also pushing white forward for holiday, giving
it a subtle ecru tinge finished with beige stitching and western
detailing.
 &HT;    Paulette McReady, president of Nautica Enterprises, said that
while designers typically use black as a base color for holiday
collections, the switch to white was simply a way to offer the
customer something different.
 &HT;    ``It's fresh and new to see white in wintertime,'' she says.
``Having whites and creams in wintertime is one of those unexpected
things.''
 &HT;    She also noted that putting out white versions of items that
have sold well during past holiday seasons _ for example, leather
pants _ makes it possible for shoppers to pick up something they
don't already have in their closets.
 &HT;    As is the case with stonewashes, dark rinses and black denim,
white has become a basic that many jeans makers are keeping in
their collections, regardless of the season.
 &HT;    ``White is really expanding and growing in importance,'' said
Maggie Winkel, women's merchandise manager for the Levi's brand.
``We used to do it for a few short months, but now we offer it for
eight to nine months _ starting in November and December with
holiday and going all the way through July.''
 &HT;    While they aren't offering it for fall, Winkel said that they
are considering doing so in the future. She also noted that the
company reevaluated its ``white standard'' about 1 1/2 years ago
and is now offering what she describes as ``a cleaner, more optic
white.''

 By ANNMARIE DODD 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Tiger Woods has already printed his name in golf's record books;
his British Open victory made him the youngest player to complete
golf's career Grand Slam.
 &HT;    His impact on fashion, however, and the aesthetic of his
namesake Nike Golf apparel line are just starting to break out from
behind his black-and-red-on-Sundays signature.
 &HT;    Not even Nike's marketing brawn could have picked a better time
than spring 2000 to relaunch a collection in the summer Tiger won
both the U.S. and British Opens.
 &HT;    For Nike, the Tiger Woods Collection is positioned as the most
upmarket component of the company's overall $1.3 billion apparel
offerings. And like the golfer, the Tiger Woods Collection has
grown up, focusing on better-quality fabrics and more sophisticated
silhouettes and colors.
 &HT;    And for most, Tiger's accomplishments and popularity signal the
promise and reign of golf's next generation.
 &HT;    ``Tiger's impact on society and culture is phenomenal,'' said
Stuart Scott, an anchor for ESPN'S SportsCenter. ``People who don't
know about golf, and those who don't care about golf, they care and
they watch Tiger.
 &HT;    ``His attention to fashion goes with his respect for the game,''
Scott said. ``He is one of the most impeccably dressed golfers on
the tour. Even his Sunday thing, the black and loud red, has become
muted. To me, this is a sign of his maturity.''
 &HT;    Golf retailers, too, have taken careful notice. According to
Mark Sanchez, vice-president of merchandise for American Golf
Corporation, which operates 325 private and public golf facilities,
the Tiger Woods Collection will vault to one of the top three
apparel resources in AGC-operated shops by year's end.
 &HT;    Stuart Lucas, CEO of the 24-unit mall-based Golf America, is
bullish on the line.
 &HT;    ''(The Tiger Woods Collection) is so much better than it was two
years ago; Tiger is so much better than he was two years ago,''
Lucas said. ``Both things are happening at the same time and it's
super for business. He's such a dynamic personality, and he looks
fabulous in clothes.''
 &HT;    Asked how the Tiger Collection was checking, Lucas said, ``Our
stores average 1,700 square feet, so how we allocate our square
footage is very important. If you're not performing, we may take a
pass on you next season. We're not taking a pass on Nike Golf.''
 &HT;    And Woods' line from Nike isn't only for the democratic
demographic. The Tiger Woods Collection will debut next month at
the venerable Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md.
 &HT;    ``Our members can't stop talking about him,'' said Darcy Ryan,
Congressional's lead merchandiser. ``I believe the line is a
classic look, but it's still youthful enough to appeal to our
younger members. Before this current season, it just didn't seem
classic and traditional enough. And those are the big buzz words
around here.''
 &HT;    David Hagler, Nike Golf's director of apparel, confirmed that
one major department store group is considering adding the Tiger
Woods Collection to its golf and sportswear floor for spring 2001 _
the first sign that the department store channel may again be ready
to embrace the lifestyle sport. Also among the 500 green-grass
accounts for the collection are Pebble Beach in Monterey, Calif.,
and Doral Golf Resort and Spa in Miami.
 &HT;    So dominant is Woods that during the final round of the British
Open, he was on screen an amazing 35 percent (one hour, 22 minutes)
of the three hour, 54 minute broadcast.
 &HT;    The Nike swoosh on Tiger's hat was visible 22 percent of the
time, according to Sponsorship Research International. That kind of
television exposure, which keeps other apparel-backed PGA Tour
stars off the screen, is causing some competitive companies to
re-think sponsoring golfers.
 &HT;    Said one executive: ``It makes me wonder what our company is
getting for the money.''
 &HT;    Still, the success of Nike Golf's Tiger apparel was not a slam
dunk.
 &HT;    Originally launched as an ill-fated Nike Golf Sport line in
1997, it did not achieve widespread acceptance with either
green-grass accounts or traditional retailers. The styling was
aggressively young, an obvious effort to attract younger, hipper
golfers instead of the game's core audience.
 &HT;    Said Hagler: ``Nike has been seen as an outsider in golf; that
wasn't the best strategy for us.''
 &HT;    While golf retailers have reported a spike in sales in the Nike
golf ball that Tiger uses, measuring Tiger's impact on Nike Golf
apparel, even now, is more difficult.
 &HT;    Said American Golf's Sanchez: ``We cannot get the (Nike) Tour
Accuracy Ball in our shops quick enough. Most of that is strictly
because Tiger switched to the Nike ball. People want to try it.''
 &HT;    ``Whether or not Nike Golf is selling lots of shirts because of
Tiger is debatable,'' said Adam Barr, business reporter for the
Golf Channel, based in Orlando. ``The problem with any endorsement
is that you cannot tell how many people actually watch and then go
buy. Nike wouldn't keep going with the collection if it was
tanking. Tiger is probably having a bigger effect than we know
right now.''
 &HT;    Said Sanchez, ``Tiger has lift on the apparel side.''
 &HT;    Instead of marketing to trend-hopping teens, Nike is courting
core golfers and the game's establishment. ``My opinion is that
that makes the apparel more saleable to the average consumer,''
Sanchez said.
 &HT;    Nike Golf's Tiger Woods Collection centers around shades of
chianti, black, charcoal, azure blue, sage green and white for
spring 2001. Silhouettes include a button-front jacquard knit with
engineered stripes and an aggressive hemming detail on the shirt's
bottom and sleeves, $72 suggested retail price.
 &HT;    There's also a short-sleeved viscose/mercerized nylon V-neck
knit with contrast tipping at neck, hem and sleeves, $100 suggested
retail. Knits in Nike Golf's sportier and khaki-based Tour
Collection start at $50 suggested retail.
 &HT;    ``We are not abandoning the young customer,'' Hagler said. ``We
can appeal to them with specific pieces in the line. But the
sport's core 30-to-50-year-old players, where the bulk of the
market's money is spent, are not influenced by hero worship like
teens. We're always looking to change as much as we can, but we
want to operate from inside the game, rather than be outside.''
 &HT;    Woods meets with the design staff four times a year to review
seasonal deliveries. Hagler and design staff are scheduled to meet
with him this week to review the spring 2001 line and preview fall
2001 between rounds at the Buick Open at Warwick Hills Golf &AMP;
Country Club, Grand Blanc, Mich.
 &HT;    ``Bright red doesn't merchandise well. We learned that and
switched Tiger to a more muted tone of chianti,'' said Hagler.
``When redoing product, we went into a classics range, but at the
same time we wanted to push Tiger's line as the more
fashion-forward offering. We will look to trends going on in men's
sportswear to pick up cues where to take Tiger.''

 By SUSAN WELSH 
 (Color art is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``Sex-crazed homewrecker'' is not exactly the description that
comes to mind when one thinks of Joan Allen, an actress who has
brought sexual repression to a new level of artistry.
 &HT;    Yet in her new movie, ``The Contender,'' she portrays Sen. Laine
Hanson, a politician who is first seen in flagrante delicto on her
desk and is later accused of committing adultery with her best
friend's husband.
 &HT;    More damning still, she's said to have engaged in carnal
shenanigans that would make Monica Lewinsky look like Rebecca of
Sunnybrook Farm.
 &HT;    Early in the film, Hanson, an Ohio Democrat, is asked by the
president (played by Jeff Bridges) to take the office of vice
president after the death of the incumbent. But in a plot twist
laden with allusions to the Hill-Thomas hearings and the Clinton
scandal, her enemy, a powerful Republican congressman (Gary Oldman,
looking very unlike himself), dredges up some eye-popping sex
photos from her past.
 &HT;    Writer-director Rod Lurie began work on ``The Contender'' at the
height of the Lewinsky affair, and he wanted to comment on an
aspect of it that he thought was being overlooked.
 &HT;    ``I told my wife,'' he recalls, ''`Clinton is going to get away
with this, because he's a man, and because we don't have many
negative feelings about male sexuality. But female sexuality is a
totally different story.'''
 &HT;    For Allen, the role offered an opportunity to break the glass
ceiling that has hovered over her career. Over breakfast on a hazy,
sweltering New York morning, the willowy 45-year-old actress,
looking cool and self-possessed in a simple sleeveless black dress,
sums up the role's appeal: ``Instead of being married to the
senator, I am the senator.''
 &HT;    Despite being one of the most highly regarded actresses in
Hollywood, she has, until now, played mostly wives _ but wives who
are singularly good at hiding roiling passion beneath a placid,
controlled exterior.
 &HT;    She won Best Supporting Actress nominations for her turn as a
loyal but sexually frustrated Pat Nixon in Oliver Stone's epic
``Nixon,'' and the following year for playing a Puritan whose
bottled-up ardor drives Daniel Day-Lewis astray in ``The
Crucible.''
 &HT;    Allen's uncanny ability to convey raw emotion without emoting
may make her the ideal choice for a film that tests the somewhat
hazy American boundary between the public and the private. And as
it happens, Lurie dreamed up ``The Contender'' expressly as a
vehicle for her.
 &HT;    In 1998, when Allen won a best supporting actress award from the
L.A. Film Critics Association for playing a love-starved June
Cleaver clone in ``Pleasantville,'' Lurie, a former critic who
describes himself as ``an obsessed fan of Joan's,'' asked if he
could present it to her.
 &HT;    Extemporizing at the podium, he found himself saying, ``I should
write a movie for Joan Allen, because if Joan agrees to do it, then
it's going to be a good movie.''
 &HT;    During the dinner that followed, Allen expressed genuine
interest in the idea, and shortly afterward, Lurie began work on a
screenplay.
 &HT;    ``I had no clue what I was going to write _ not the vaguest
idea,'' he says. ``I knew that I had one mission, and that was to
write a character to which Joan Allen could not say no.''
 &HT;    Allen, who researched the role by watching tapes of Gerald
Ford's confirmation hearings and by spending time with Arkansas
Sen. Blanche Lincoln, says she connected with Laine Hanson's core
of integrity.
 &HT;    ``It's what you would like politics to be if it really worked,''
she says, while acknowledging that ``the character is not
completely lifelike.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Hanson is almost a fairy-tale liberal: She is pro-choice
and pro-campaign finance reform, wants the death penalty abolished,
thinks all guns should be confiscated and believes that selling
cigarettes to minors should be a federal offense. Oh, and she's an
avowed atheist.
 &HT;    But unlike some of her celebrity neighbors on New York's
famously liberal Upper West Side _ where she maintains a low
profile with her husband, actor Peter Friedman, and their
6-year-old daughter, Sadie _ Allen prefers to keep her own views
private.
 &HT;    ``Rod is the political animal, and I'm the actor,'' she says.
``He wrote the part that way, and I did it.'' She herself would
``never, ever, ever'' want to run for office. ``That's why it was
so fun to play a politician,'' she says, ``because it's so
antithetical to my nature.''
 &HT;    Early press screenings had Oscar-watchers buzzing about Allen's
strong shot at a statuette. Allen remains wary of the hype, but she
confesses that when the movie was picked up for distribution by
DreamWorks, her heart beat a little faster.
 &HT;    ``I knew how much they were going to back it,'' she says, ``and
I had a moment like, `God, this could really change me.' I sort of
panicked, quietly. I said to my husband, `I like to take the
subway. I like taking the bus. I'm kind of anonymous!' But I've
sort of calmed down about that now.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHER'S LATEST VENTURE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    She sings, she acts _ and now she makes jewelry. Cher is hard at
work on a new jewelry line that will be in stores by November.
 &HT;    The collection, called ``Cher for Loree Rodkin,'' includes long
earrings, necklaces and bracelets; platinum, gold and silver, and
lots of beads and stones.
 &HT;    As with the vanity cases that Sharon Stone's designing for Louis
Vuitton, a percentage of the profits will go to charity _ in Cher's
case, the Facial Foundation for Disfigured Children, the cause she
took up during the making of the film ``Mask.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    IMAN'S AIDS STANCE
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``AIDS is not over. Our children remain at great risk. Every
hour of every day, two American adolescents are infected with
HIV.''
 &HT;    These words are from the model Iman, who has signed on as
celebrity spokeswoman for Mothers' Voices, a nonprofit group
focused on educating parents and teachers on AIDS issues as they
affect youth.
 &HT;    Sheryl Schwartz, wife of Calvin Klein Inc. vice chairman Barry
Schwartz, serves as chairwoman of the group, which also receives
financial and logistical support from Calvin Klein.
 &HT;    ``As parents, we all want to protect our children and given them
the skills they need to live a sexually healthy life,'' Iman added.
 &HT;    This fall, the organization plans to extend its workshop series,
which aims to teach parents how to seize ``teachable moments'' to
explain to their children the facts about the disease _ from its
New York headquarters to Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles,
Miami and Providence, R.I.
 &HT;    The group also plans to host a full-day workshop titled
``Parenting in the Age of AIDS'' this October in New York for the
parents of children attending public schools.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRITNEY'S ONLINE LATHER
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It seems that Clairol is taking its association with new
spokeswoman Britney Spears to a new level. Not only is the company
sponsoring Spears' summer concert tour, it's also garnering new
listeners for the teen queen with a promotional pack available on
CVS.com.
 &HT;    The set includes full-sized bottles of Clairol's Herbal Essences
Shampoo and Conditioner for normal/oily hair and a Spears sampler
CD for $8.99.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POWER LUNCHERS
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ ``Men already run the world,'' said Susan Estrich,
the first woman to run a presidential campaign _ Michael Dukakis' _
and the author of an upcoming book, ``Sex and Power.'' She said
it's up to women ``to recognize the power they have,'' be proud of
it and use it.
 &HT;    Estrich, who spoke to about 60 women at Harper's Bazaar's recent
``power luncheon'' at the Alain Ducasse restaurant, pointed out
that one of the most powerful women was sitting right in the room _
Barbara Walters. She cited Walters' refusal to have O.J. Simpson on
her show, ``The View,'' which drew applause from the audience.
 &HT;    ``I do not have power,'' Walters called out, to which the crowd
exhibited some disbelief _ especially since Walters is negotiating
a reported $12 million contract with ABC.
 &HT;    Other heavy hitters who came out to celebrate Bazaar's August
``power'' issue included Tina Brown, Maria Bartiromo, Kate Spade,
Diane Von Furstenberg, Lesley Stahl, Carolina Herrera, Aerin
Lauder, Josie Natori and Dana Buchman.
 &HT;    The luncheon was hosted by Kate Betts, Bazaar's editor in chief,
and Cynthia Lewis, vice president and publisher.
 &HT;    Bartiromo, an anchor for CNBC whose staggering schedule left
some in the room breathless, said her idea of power is not having
lots of assistants and delegating.
 &HT;    ``I make my own phone calls and in many cases, I'm a one-woman
show,'' said Bartiromo, who does three live shows a day. ``For me,
power is not delegating. It's getting the story right and getting
it first and putting it on the air before it's disseminated.''

 &HT;    STRIKES RARE IN HIGH-TECH ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories
 &HT;    See chart information below
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a phone strike?
</P>
<P>
   Even though 87,000 operators and technicians at Verizon, the
nation's largest local phone company, walked off their jobs nearly
two weeks ago, dial tones keep droning and folks keep talking into
cell phones even in Verizon's service area throughout the busy
northeast corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A satellited, digitalized, Internetted, high-tech economy has
wrought changes in collective bargaining, labor experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   When miners strike, coal shipments stop. When auto workers
strike, no cars are made. But other than falling behind in repairs
and new installations, highly automated Verizon has continued to
provide service since contract talks stalled on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes do seem to be less effective in high-tech industries,
said Don Parsons, an economics professor at George Washington
University. ``If you look at it as a game between labor and
management, it gives a tremendous advantage to the employer'' if
basic operations can continue indefinitely during a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   In these negotiations, striking workers must miss a lot of
paychecks before the impact of their sacrifice is felt, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has existed for some time in telecommunications,
said William Dickens, a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities have generally had an easier time maintaining
service. The system pretty well runs itself,'' said Dickens. ``If
you had operators connecting calls, it would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   If production or service continues during a strike, the striking
workers are at a disadvantage, conceded Ron Blackwell, the
AFL-CIO's director of corporate affairs. But even in high-tech
industries, ``if workers were unnecessary to the operation, they
wouldn't have been hired in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Withholding labor is still a viable tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no doubt strikes are less a part of the
information age than they were in an industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were only 17 work stoppages involving 1,000 or
more workers _ the fewest in six decades, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. That compares to 34 in 1998, 412 in 1969 and
470 in 1952. There have been fewer than 100 such strikes every year
since 1982 while there were more than 200 almost every year between
1947 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing scarcity of strikes is partly due to ``the
declining importance of the industrial armies of the past _ the
hordes of blue collar workers'' in a high-tech economy, said Marvin
Kosters, the director of economic policy studies at the American
Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The number of union workers in the private sector has declined
dramatically as the economy changed. And many strongly organized
occupations _ such as school teachers _ are more concentrated in
the public sector and have historically been reluctant to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed from the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. The
strike affects Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, Virginia,
West Virginia, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. A key issue in
the contract talks is mandatory overtime _ which workers want to
cut back and management said is needed in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Verizon is in a competitive market, Blackwell said
any reductions in service will send customers to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a well-run strike'' by the Communications Workers of
America and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, unions don't exist to strike. That's just a
tactic'' to achieve broader goals, he said. The fact that there are
fewer strikes reflects that workers ``don't do it unless its
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions are trying to organize high-tech workers. Blackwell
pointed to a recent strike by Boeing engineers as a successful
example of labor moving into a new sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a new constituency,'' said Marcus
Courtney, co-founder of WashTech _ the Washington Alliance of
Technology Workers _ which is seeking to organize technical
writers, web site developers and other high-tech employees in
Washington state. He said the fledgling union has 250 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the very beginning so the whole notion of a
strike is not what's on our minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sorts of highly skilled workers that his group is
seeking to organize are vital to continued operations of even
automated industries. If large numbers of these workers united,
Courtney said, a work stoppage could shut down a company's
high-tech services.

   WASHINGTON _ There's a phone strike?
</P>
<P>
   Even though 87,000 operators and technicians at Verizon, the
nation's largest local phone company, walked off their jobs nearly
two weeks ago, dial tones keep droning and folks keep talking into
cell phones even in Verizon's service area throughout the busy
northeast corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A satellited, digitalized, Internetted, high-tech economy has
wrought changes in collective bargaining, labor experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   When miners strike, coal shipments stop. When auto workers
strike, no cars are made. But other than falling behind in repairs
and new installations, highly automated Verizon has continued to
provide service since contract talks stalled on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes do seem to be less effective in high-tech industries,
said Don Parsons, an economics professor at George Washington
University. ``If you look at it as a game between labor and
management, it gives a tremendous advantage to the employer'' if
basic operations can continue indefinitely during a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   In these negotiations, striking workers must miss a lot of
paychecks before the impact of their sacrifice is felt, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has existed for some time in telecommunications,
said William Dickens, a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities have generally had an easier time maintaining
service. The system pretty well runs itself,'' said Dickens. ``If
you had operators connecting calls, it would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   If production or service continues during a strike, the striking
workers are at a disadvantage, conceded Ron Blackwell, the
AFL-CIO's director of corporate affairs. But even in high-tech
industries, ``if workers were unnecessary to the operation, they
wouldn't have been hired in the first place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Withholding labor is still a viable tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no doubt strikes are less a part of the
information age than they were in an industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were only 17 work stoppages involving 1,000 or
more workers _ the fewest in six decades, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. That compares to 34 in 1998, 412 in 1969 and

&HT;     PERFECT FOOD FOR AN OUTDOOR COOKOUT? TRY PIZZA

<P>
   Take two very popular eating activities _ grilling and pizza _
put them together and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   You might get burnt cheese on your grill, but if you follow some
simple directions, that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, you'll get one of the best-tasting pizzas you ever
sank your teeth into.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled pizza has been around awhile. I read about it years ago,
but was reminded of it recently while reading Patricia Cornwall's
mystery ``Black Notice.'' In the book, medical examiner Kay
Scarpetta throws together several pizzas to cook on the grill. At
the same time, she is entertaining company, doling out advice to
her niece who is tracking a gang of vicious drug dealers, grieving
her boyfriend's violent death and trying to solve a mystery
involving a homicidal French werewolf.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, messing up the grill was the least of her
worries.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled pizza sounded delicious, so I decided to give it a try.
Without directions to follow, friends and I tackled the task using
our own, generally reliable, common sense.
</P>
<P>
   First, we made pizza dough using my favorite recipe from Jack
Bishop's ``The Italian Vegetarian.'' It is a very flavorful dough
that works great in the oven. We stretched the dough, put it on an
oiled cookie sheet and added our toppings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we ran into difficulty _ how to get that pizza, with wet
sauce and loose toppings, off the pan and onto the grill. It took
two of us, using spatulas and fingers, to lift that first pizza off
the cookie sheet and onto the grill.
</P>
<P>
   One person folded the second pizza in half, then moved it to the
grill and rearranged the toppings. This worked better, but we
decided that next time we'd find a cookie sheet that was open at
one end, oil it and slide the pizza off.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the cooked pie off the grill wasn't a problem. The dough
begins to cook the minute it hits the hot rack and soon will move
easily when prodded with a spatula. Only one of our pizzas came out
looking bad (it fell apart for some reason) but it succeeded in the
taste category _ smoky, crusty and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   While we were reasonably pleased with our results, we decided
the next time we made pizzas on the grill we'd put the dough on the
grill, then add toppings.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some expert consultation seemed in order. So, I called
Steven Raichlen, author of ``The Barbecue Bible'' and an
experienced pizza griller.
</P>
<P>
   He, not to my surprise, had a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to remember three basic things,'' Raichlen said.
First, cook the crust over direct heat and flip it, so that both
sides cook over the heat. (Obviously, you don't put toppings on
until after you've flipped it!)
</P>
<P>
   ``Indirect heat,'' said Raichlen, ``is for sissies.''
</P>
<P>
   Have the topping ingredients handy and when you put them on the
crust, ``do it in reverse order,'' Raichlen says. That means you
brush oil and scatter cheese on the hot, crusty top of the pizza,
then arrange the other ingredients and sauce over the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't really need wet sauce, though. ``I really like a
combination of fresh chopped arugula, chopped tomatoes, caramelized
onion and gorgonzola cheese,'' Raichlen said. Ingredients such as
these don't even need to be put on the crust as it bakes on the
grill _ pile it on afterward, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a salad on pizza, but it's good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more tips for grilling pizza:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do a trial run using frozen (then thawed) ready-made bread
dough. It won't taste as good as homemade, but you won't feel so
bad if it doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have a grill that is adjustable up and down, cook the
dough until it's crisp on the first side, then flip it and raise
the grill for lower heat.
</P>
<P>
   _ The lid can remain open while you're grilling the pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   _ For best luck, keep the pizzas ``personal'' size, 7-to-8
inches.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make your sauce a little thicker than usual, or just use
freshly sliced tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to reverse the order of the ingredients, with
cheese going on the hot crust before the other ingredients and
sauce.

   DETOURS AND ROYAL DICTATES
</P>
<P>
   In Cricklade, we stopped for a cup of tea with Jos Joslin, the
national trails officer in charge of the Thames Path. The trail,
she told us, is still a work in progress, with occasional detours
away from the Thames necessitated by riverside landowners. These
battles have been going on since the towpath was built in the 18th
century, and some of the staunchest opponents have been the royal
family. Queen Victoria blocked the towpath at Windsor with an Act
of Parliament in 1860, and Queen Elizabeth II has kept up the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   But the walkers' rights of way across private property are a
cherished British tradition dating back to the Middle Ages, and the
route of the Thames Path will continue to evolve as Joslin's
organization wins court battles against the reluctant landowners _
at least those whose portraits don't appear on postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
   By next summer Joslin hopes to eliminate one of the worst
detours, one I walked that afternoon _ a mile along the shoulder of
a busy highway between Upper Inglesham and Inglesham.
</P>
<P>
   At Lechlade, where the path returned to the river, the young
boys of the village were leaping into the Thames from the graceful,
arched Ha'penny Bridge, named for the toll charged to walkers
(except churchgoers and mourners) until the mid-1800s. Mentioned in
the Domesday book, Lechlade is a market town owing its prosperity
to the fact that it was the highest point on the river loaded
barges could reach. In the Middle Ages, many tons of lucrative
Cotwsold wool passed through here on its way to London and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Here we began to encounter brightly painted ``narrowboats,''
descendants of the live-aboard barges that once hauled coal
throughout Britain. Built only 7 feet wide to fit through the
narrowest locks, they now sport chimneys and satellite dishes and
are often decorated with rooftop flower gardens and gnome statues.
</P>
<P>
   At St. John's Lock, Michael Faulkner, a retired civil engineer,
noticed my interest in his narrowboat and gestured for us to hop
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon,'' he said, ``we'll give you a ride down to the next
lock.''
</P>
<P>
   As Faulkner steered from the back with the boat's long tiller,
his wife Fay handed us each a steaming cup of tea and told us they
were headed down the Thames to Oxford, where they would turn into a
canal system that would take them through the Midlands to
Nottingham, a journey they expected would take 16 or 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only go about 2 miles and hour,'' Faulkner said. ``But
there's no point in going faster, is there? You don't see
anything.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CROSSING THE THAMES BY FERRY
</P>
<P>
   At Bablock Hythe, we spent the night at the Ferryman's Inn,
where a ferry has been crossing the Thames nearly continually since
monks first settled along the riverbank in 945 A.D. Poet Matthew
Arnold immortalized the crossing in the 1853 poem ``Scholar
Gypsy,'' whose protagonist ``oft was met crossing the stripling
Thames at Bablock-hyth.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the ferry operates only sporadically, the Thames Path
officially detours away from the river to another crossing
downstream. But in the morning the barman was glad to ferry us
across the river, where we could walk the tree-shaded towpath on
the right bank until we rejoined the official path at Pinkhill
Lock.
</P>
<P>
   The river makes a sharp bend to the south, and here we came to
the ruins of an 11th-century abbey called Godstow. It was along
this stretch of the Thames that an Oxford mathematician named
Charles Dodgson rowed Alice Liddell and her two sisters on a summer
day in 1862, amusing them with stories of White Rabbits and Mad
Hatters, which he later published under his pen name, Lewis
Carroll. It was perhaps fortunate that Dodgson took a particular
shine to Alice and not her younger sister, or his book might have
been called ``Edith in Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the river, cattle were grazing at Port Meadow, which has
been a free common in continual use since William the Conqueror
presented it to the burgesses of Oxford nearly 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And just around the corner we caught our first sight of those
dreaming spires of Oxford, where astronomer Edmund Halley first
predicted the return of his comet, where penicillin was invented
and where a young Rhodes scholar named Bill Clinton didn't inhale.
</P>
<P>
   At Osney Bridge we turned off from the Thames into the sudden
bustle of downtown Oxford, and our journey ended.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the bridge, though, the Thames Path
continued _ past Lullebrook Manor, the inspiration for Toad Hall in
``The Wind in the Willows''; past Hampton Court, home of Henry VIII
and his unfortunate wives; past Runnymeade Meadow, where King John
signed the Magna Carta; past Windsor Castle and the playing fields
of Eton; past Syon House, where Pocahontas once lived; past the
gravesite of Captain Bligh, of ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' fame; and
past the site of the London slums that inspired Charles Dickens to
write ``Oliver Twist.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's another journey, another story, another bit of liquid
history.

&HT;     THAMES TRAIL OFFERS A RAMBLE INTO ENGLAND'S `LIQUID HISTORY'

<P>
   KEMBLE, England _ Under an ancient ash tree in a pretty Cotswold
meadow
</P>
<P>
   called Trewsbury Mead, I'm stooped over in search of liquid
history. I can't find a trickle, a dribble, even a damp spot.
</P>
<P>
   A little stone monument announces that this spring _ dry except
in winter, I later learn _ is the official source of the River
Thames, the majestic waterway on whose storied banks kings were
crowned and queens were beheaded, the Magna Carta was signed,
Shakespeare's plays debuted and the Mayflower set sail.
</P>
<P>
   William the Conqueror built castles along the Thames. Henry VIII
honeymooned next to the river _ again and again. ``Paradise Lost,''
``Frankenstein'' and ``Alice and Wonderland'' were written on its
banks. Twenty prime ministers and the future king were educated
riverside at Eton, on whose fabled playing fields, the saying goes,
the Battle of Waterloo was won.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run down the Thames is to run one's hand over the pages in
the book of England from end to end,'' wrote H.G. Wells. British
politician John Burns put it more succinctly. ``The Thames,'' he
declared in 1944, ``is liquid history.''
</P>
<P>
   If I can't find any actual liquid in this Gloucestershire
meadow, I can at least locate the start of a hiking trail _ the
Thames Path, the newest of Britain's national long-distance
footpaths. Opened in 1996, it hugs the banks of the river as much
as possible, from its birthplace to the Thames Barrier 180 miles
downstream in east London, where the river officially ends and its
estuary begins.
</P>
<P>
   It's a walk through the green heart of the England, past fields
of golden barley and thatched cottages as homey and precious as a
Thomas Kinkade painting. It ambles alongside the dreaming spires of
Oxford, brooding Windsor Castle, Hampton Court, Big Ben,
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre and the Tower of London.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Britain's long-distance trails, the Thames Path can
easily be broken up into manageable chunks. In August, my wife Jeri
and I set off to walk the first 50 or 60 miles _ no two sources
agree on the exact distance _ from the source to Oxford. This is
the most pastoral stretch of the river, through the timeless
countryside of the Cotswolds.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   AN UNHURRIED PACE
</P>
<P>
   The landscape here is old, gentle and, in the case of the Thames
Path, nearly perfectly flat. For five days we carried light packs
containing just our toothbrushes and a change of clothing for the
evening. We took our meals in convivial country pubs and finished
each day with a hot shower and a snuggly, duvet-covered bed in a
B&AMP;B. Backpacking just doesn't get any cushier than this.
</P>
<P>
   Walking an unhurried 10 to 12 miles a day, we had time to linger
in prettily steepled villages, to pause for conversations with
country publicans and lockkeepers and retired constables, to share
a bite with riverbank picnickers offering cucumber sandwiches from
their wicker baskets and to consult with swans and magpies and
bounding hares.
</P>
<P>
   Shouldering our packs in Trewsbury Mead, we walked only a few
steps before we were nearly run over with our first bit of history.
The Thames Path crosses an old Roman road, the Foss Way, which
connects Bath with Cirencester _ at one time second only to
Londinium as the largest town in Roman Britain. As we discovered,
the road is still very much in use: Range Rovers and Vauxhalls
whooshed past at unchariotable speeds.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, this was the only busy road we'd see for days.
We sauntered across a meadow full of lolling cows and wildflowers,
passing an old stone farmhouse with glimpses over the trees to the
13th-century church tower of Kemble.
</P>
<P>
   In the next village, Ewen, we found the first trickle of water
in the infant Thames, and with it the first encounter with the
river's remarkable avian life: we heard a rustle in the reeds and
saw a Great Blue Heron beating its big wings. From here on, birds
would be our constant companions: we shared the river with
mallards, Canada geese, magpies, barn owls and hundreds and
hundreds of white swans.
</P>
<P>
   The river _ at this point just a babbling, willow-shaded brook _
runs straight through the center of Aston Keynes, a handsome
village named for a family that arrived with William the Conqueror.
Like Kemble and Ewen, the homes here are made of honey-colored
Cotswold stone, once described by J.B. Priestley as ``faintly warm
and luminous, as if (the builders) knew the trick of keeping the
lost sunlight of centuries glimmering about them.'' On the other
side of the village, the Thames Path cuts directly across a neatly
manicured playing field belonging to the Aston Keynes Cricket Club.

<P>
   Getting there: From London's Paddington Station, frequent trains
leave for Kemble, with a change in Swindon. From Kemble's train
station it's about a mile's walk to the source of the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics: Ideally, you could walk from the source to Cricklade
the first day, to Lechlade the second, to Tadpole Bridge the third,
to Bablock Hythe the fourth and to Oxford the fifth. These days
average 10 to 12 miles. Accommodations along this stretch are
limited, though, and it pays to book in advance, particularly in
summer. We waited too long and couldn't always get our first
choice. What follows were our overnight stops, all of which were
comfortable and friendly, and some notes on alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Thames Head Inn, Tetbury Road, Cirencester, Gloucester GL7 6NZ,
Great Britain; phone/fax: 011-44-1285-770259. Doubles, 45 pounds
($68) a night. Located a few minutes' walk from the source. An
alternative would be to stay in Cirencester, three miles away, a
handsome old Roman town with many B&AMP;Bs to choose from. Taxi rides
to and from the source run about 6 pounds ($9.)
</P>
<P>
   Waterhay Farm B&AMP;B, Leigh, Cricklade, Wilts SN6 6QY, Great
Britain; phone: 011-44-1285-861253. Doubles, 38-50 pounds ($57-$75)
a night. A pub for evening meals is 15 minutes' walk away. The B&AMP;B
is only 8.5 miles from the source, making for an easy first day -
and a long second day. An alternative would be to stay in the
village of Cricklade, three miles further down the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The New Inn, Market Square, Lechlade, Gloucestershire GL7 3AB,
Great Britain; phone: 011-44-1367-252296; fax: 011-44-1367-252315.
Doubles, 42.50 ($64) a night; breakfast is extra. An old coaching
inn in the center of town. One or two other B&AMP;Bs are available in
Lechlade, as are several pubs and restaurants. It's about 12 miles
from Cricklade.
</P>
<P>
   Chimney House Farmhouse B&AMP;B, Chimney on Thames, Aston, Bampton,
Oxfordshire OX18 2EH, Great Britain; phone: 011-44-1367-870279.
Doubles, 50 pounds ($75). Currently it's a 1.5-mile detour from the
Thames Path, but when the path is rerouted along the south bank of
the river it will be just minutes off the route. It's about 12
miles from Lechlade. In the morning a shortcut, fairly obvious on
the map, shaves off a long detour away from the river. We ate
dinner at the Trout Inn (Tadpole Bridge, Buckland Marsh, Oxon SN7
8RF, Great Britain; phone 011-44-1367-870382; www.troutinn.co.uk),
where we enjoyed the best pub meal we've ever had in Britain.
Dinner for two, including two pints of ale and two glasses of wine,
came to 34 pounds ($51). By next summer the Trout Inn plans to
offer rooms, making this a convenient overnight stop. (Note that
there is a Trout Inn every few miles along the Thames. This refers
to the one at Tadpole Bridge.)
</P>
<P>
   The Ferryman Inn, Bablock Hythe, Northmoor, Oxon OX8 1BL, Great
Britain; phone/fax: 011-44-1865-880028; e-mail:
kelland &LR; oxferry.com. Doubles, 45 pounds ($68) per night. Using the
shortcut mentioned above, it's about 9 miles from the Chimney House
Farmhouse. In the morning, ask the owner to ferry you across the
river. You can follow a good trail along the right bank,
eliminating another long detour away from the river.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Bank Hotel, 92094 High Street, Oxford; phone:
011-44-1865-799599; fax: 011-44-1865-799598; e-mail:
info &LR; oldbank-hotel.co.uk; Web: www.oxford-hotels-restaurants.co.uk.
Doubles from 155 pounds ($234) a night, breakfast extra. An
end-of-the-walk splurge, this is a smart and comfortable new hotel
built in an 200-year-old building in the center of the old town.
Numerous other B&AMP;Bs available in town. Oxford is about 10 miles
from Bablock Hythe.
</P>
<P>
   Guidebooks: The essential guide is ``The Thames Path,'' a
National Trail Guide by David Sharp (Aurum Press, published in
association with The Ramblers' Association; 12.99 pounds/$19.63.
Available in the U.S. from Amazon.com.) It has a detailed verbal
description of the route, plus the appropriate sections of
1:25,000-scale Ordnance Survey maps. ``The Thames Path National
Trail Companion,'' by Jos Joslin and Alison Muldal (National Trails
Office; 4.95 pounds; $7.50) covers B&AMP;Bs, hotels, pubs, public
transportation and other information useful to Thames Path walkers.

 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Ever since Julius Caesar decreed that the empire of Rome should
follow a solar calendar rather than ancient lunar calendars,
mankind has been ever so slightly out of sync with the moon.
 &HT;    August 2000 marks one of those rare occasions when the calendar
happens to neatly coincide with a full 29.5-day lunar cycle,
beginning with a hair-thin crescent that will wax into a brilliant
full moon at midmonth and fully wane on the 29th.
 &HT;    Sculptured around the phases of the moon, this month is a good
time to pay homage to our nearest heavenly neighbor.
 &HT;    The moon tends to loom very large in the mind's eye, but in fact
it would take 105,050 objects of the same size to completely fill
the sky.
 &HT;    Its brightness is something of an illusion as well. Because we
never step directly from sunlight to moonlight, gauging the
difference in intensity is difficult.
 &HT;    Surprisingly, the sun is 450,000 times brighter than the full
moon. Our satellite's surface is as dark as asphalt. Still, the
moon, as it nears its full phase this month, will be dazzling
enough to wash out the famous Perseid meteors, beloved by summer
campers and country vacationers.
 &HT;    Those sky watchers who linger by their campfires will see the
same lunar hemisphere that humans have gazed upon since time
immemorial.
 &HT;    The moon shows us only one face because it rotates on its axis
in the same period that it orbits Earth. The speed of the slow
axial spin is just 10 mph at the equator. A jogger perpetually
circumnavigating the moon in the right direction would never see
the sun rise or set.
 &HT;    If the moon behaved like every other major satellite in the
solar system and orbited over the equator of its mother planet, it
would traverse Orion's Belt each month.
 &HT;    Instead, it ignores Earth's tilt and revolves around the globe
in the same plane as the planets, taking it through the zodiac
constellations and delivering vivid planetary conjunctions, like
its striking predawn meeting with Jupiter and Saturn on Aug. 23.
 &HT;    Even the slant of the moon is unusual. It stands straight up
relative to the sun; this lack of tilt allows depressions at the
poles to remain permanently shadowed. Those dark regions are cold
enough that they might conceal billions of tons of ice locked away
in deep freeze, a convenient water source that may drastically
change the course of future space exploration.
 &HT;    The moon's battered surface is covered with a soil of
talcum-powder softness. The silicon-oxygen mix of the rocks below
closely matches the composition of Earth's crust and mantle _ so
closely that scientists now believe the moon must have once been a
piece of our own planet, blown into space by a spectacular
collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body.
 &HT;    The moon's core is solid, essentially one giant crystal. This
causes our natural satellite to keep shaking whenever a large
meteor or unmanned spacecraft collides with it. At such times the
entire moon rings for hours like an enormous gong.
 &HT;    Luckily, sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space.
Otherwise, our noisy neighbor might keep us awake on those nights
when we'd just as soon have moon shadows follow us in our dreams.

 By KATHY A. SVITIL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Bill Stone will never forget the day he began to make diving
history by immersing himself in Wakulla Springs, a network of
submerged caves in northern Florida.
 &HT;    On the early afternoon of Dec. 3, 1987, he swam to a depth of
about 30 feet and settled in, carrying only two 30-cubic-foot
oxygen tanks and a sack of ``blood and gore'' war novels.
 &HT;    Had he been using normal scuba gear, he would have had to
surface after 30 minutes. But Stone, an automation engineer at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology in Washington, D.C.,
was wearing a homemade rebreather.
 &HT;    He didn't come up for 24 hours _ the longest anyone has ever
survived underwater with a self-contained breathing device.
 &HT;    ``When I got out of the water and checked, I found I'd used only
half of my consumables. That was the big shock. I could have stayed
under for another 24 hours,'' he says.
 &HT;    Stone's rebreather recycles his exhaled air, scrubbing it of
poisonous carbon dioxide and squeezing out every last molecule of
oxygen in his tanks. His inventiveness has transformed the ability
of humans to carry out scientific exploration underwater. With
rebreathers, divers can linger for half a day without thinking
about their air supply.
 &HT;    The concept of rebreathers is not new. In the 1870s, Henry
Fleuss, a British merchant seaman, developed the first primitive
oxygen rebreather _ an unwieldy device handy for rescuing mine
workers, For the next hundred years or so research into rebreathers
was carried on primarily by navy engineers.
 &HT;    Convinced that rebreathers could be small, cheap and reliable,
Stone designed his first rig in the mid-1980s and dubbed it the
MK1. He eventually founded a company, Cis-Lunar Development
Laboratories in South Lancaster, Mass., which has developed four
more models.
 &HT;    The latest one, the MK-5P, features sophisticated gas and depth
sensors, three microprocessors, computer displays and a $17,500
price tag.
 &HT;    Dozens of other companies have hopped on the bandwagon. With a
rebreather, as with scuba gear, a diver inhales through a
mouthpiece, drawing compressed gas from a tank. But the expired air
is saved, shuttled through a valve into a balloonlike bag, and then
back into the breathing loop.
 &HT;    With each breath the concentration of oxygen in the bag drops
and carbon dioxide rises. The main job of the rebreather is to get
rid of carbon dioxide while replenishing the oxygen in the diver's
air supply.
 &HT;    Canisters of soda lime or lithium hydroxide do the first part by
scrubbing carbon dioxide out of the air. In the fanciest rigs, such
as the MK-5P, electronic controls take care of the second part,
automatically sensing the oxygen content and injecting more of the
gas as needed.
 &HT;    The process is not nearly as foolproof as it might sound.
``Sooner or later, your scrubber canister is going to run out and
you are going to start inspiring a high, potentially dangerous
level of carbon dioxide,'' says John Clarke, scientific director of
the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City, Fla.
 &HT;    If carbon-dioxide concentrations reach about 10 percent, inhaled
air becomes lethal, no matter how much oxygen is present.
 &HT;    ``Right now, we have no way of letting the diver know if that is
happening. With a rebreather, you can die without even knowing that
you are dying,'' Clarke says.
 &HT;    Divers must rely on carefully calculated tables that let them
know how long their scrubbers should last if everything is
functioning perfectly.
 &HT;    One solution being studied is a sensor that measures
carbon-dioxide levels by detecting the distinctive frequencies of
infrared radiation emitted by the carbon-dioxide molecule as it
vibrates in the air.
 &HT;    Engineers also are developing films that monitor changes of pH,
or acidity, in exhaled air. Dissolved carbon dioxide makes air more
acidic, so a sudden drop in pH means carbon-dioxide levels are
spiking.
 &HT;    ``The films could be placed directly on the body, to measure
carbon-dioxide intake,'' says Martin Heerschap, project manager for
Cochran Undersea Technology in Richardson, Texas, which
manufactures an electronic, fully closed rebreather.
 &HT;    Other advances may allow the machinery to respond still more
intelligently to its wearer's needs. For instance, as depth
increases, so does the pressure on the counterlung _ the flexible
bag that holds exhaled gas _ making it increasingly difficult for
the diver to exhale. Clarke and his colleagues have patented a
device, similar to a hospital ventilator, that reduces the load on
the counterlung to keep breathing free and easy.
 &HT;    Farther ahead, Clarke and engineer John Mittleman of the Navy's
Coastal Systems Station in Panama City envision placing
micro-machines in the rebreather, on the diver's skin, or even
inside the diver's body. These tiny devices could collect precise
data on oxygen and carbon-dioxide levels and signal any trouble.
 &HT;    ``That could be his warning to do something different _ maybe
start breathing harder, or come up into more shallow waters,''
Clarke says.
 &HT;    In the farther future, engineers are working on devices that
pull oxygen directly from the water, much as a fish does, so a
diver might never run out of breath. Japanese engineers recently
found an effective way to separate the hydrogen and oxygen
molecules in water using light.
 &HT;    Heerschap says rebreathers might someday incorporate a version
of this technology: ``If so, the rebreather could be reduced to the
size of a small backpack, with only scrubbing material and sensors
and no oxygen tanks.''
 &HT;    Explorers of the deep briny blue aren't the only ones who will
benefit from advances in rebreathers. Mountain climbers also waste
a lot of oxygen each time they exhale. New technology could
drastically cut the number of 30-pound oxygen tanks climbers have
to haul up a mountain.
 &HT;    Similarly, rebreathers could lighten the load of firefighters,
search-and-rescue teams, and hazardous-materials workers.
 &HT;    And rebreathers might be the key to conquering outer space. The
challenge of life support in a vacuum is not much different from
that of survival 300 feet underwater, In fact, the space shuttle's
extravehicular-activity suit is essentially an extremely fancy,
modified rebreather. But, in true NASA style, it costs tens of
millions of dollars and cannot be fixed while in orbit.
 &HT;    Stone predicts that a decade from now commercial space explorers
will don drastically cheaper suits containing off-the-shelf
replaceable parts derived from commercial rebreathers. The suits
will have flexible exoskeletons and low internal pressures, giving
tomorrow's astronauts the dexterity of today's divers.
 &HT;    When that day comes, Stone says, ``space suits will simply be
another item of gear from the orbital equipment supply catalog.''

   CVN-WILLIE-BROWN Los Angeles) _ In his first year as San

But the news raised an ethical issue for the media after police
revealed that the child had been sexually assaulted by her alleged
abductor. The child's name had been widely publicized in the two
days she was missing. By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN.

   UNITED-AIRLINES (San Francisco) _ There's an old expression
about winning the battle but losing the war. If you don't
understand it, watch what's happening with United Airlines. The

   THAMES-FOOTPATH (Kemble, England) _ The Thames Path, the newest

<P>
   LIEBERMAN-JEWISH (San Francisco) _ Al Gore's vice presidential

is so much brouhaha. Others hint at something less pleasant. By

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When I became president and COO of Harley-Davidson's motorcycle
division in 1987, the hard work of saving the company was done. We
had survived seven arduous years of crisis. But we faced an
altogether new challenge _ sustaining progress. How to do that?
</P>
<P>
   For me, the answer was clear. We needed to create an environment
where everyone at Harley took responsibility for the company and
its future. I believe that a leader should mind the interests of
all stakeholders, of course, but also be an outspoken advocate for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are hardwired, like me, to be a leader who shares
rather than exerts power, the command-and-control model is hard to
avoid. The top management job carries certain expectations on
behalf of employees, colleagues and the outside world. It takes
trust on the part of employees and discipline on the part of the
leader to push back on those traditional expectations and create a
company where everyone owns decisions and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVAL MODE
</P>
<P>
   My career with Harley-Davidson dates to August 1981 when I
joined as CFO, just two months after a group of 13 Harley managers
had bought the company from AMF in a leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson had a poor reputation for quality and
reliability, and it was behind the curve on product design and
development. Break-even points were high; market share was falling.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company faced tough competitors: Honda and
Yamaha. It's no wonder that in 1980, when AMF engaged an investment
bank to sell the division, it found no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Vaughn Beals, formerly AMF's group
executive for the Harley division and now chairman and CEO of
Harley-Davidson Inc., and the leadership team (of which I was
member) cut the overall workforce by 40 percent _ affecting
salaried and hourly workers. All remaining salaried employees
agreed to a 9 percent pay cut, frozen for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, it appeared that Beals and the team might pull
off a miracle. The company had introduced its Evolution Engine in
1984, and that, combined with the new Softail product line, began
to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   Harley was also having some success with special programs
started to help its dealers attract and retain customers. Important
improvements were made on the operating side of the business, and a
financial restructuring positioned the company to go public.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, the prognosis looked good. Manufacturing costs were
falling; reductions in in-process inventories and associated
carrying costs saved about $40 million a year. Our quality had
improved. Our dealer network was revitalized and growing. When we
went public in July, the offering raised $25 million more than the
underwriters had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ENGINES OF CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear the present was in good order, it was time to
think about the future. I didn't have a plan beyond knowing that
capturing the ideas of all the people at Harley was critical to our
future success.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gelb, then vice president of manufacturing, and John
Campbell, vice president of human resources, and I were meeting a
lot back then to talk about how to improve operations. One idea we
came up with was gain sharing _ a program to allow all employees to
share in the company's financial success. But organizational-change
consultants quickly explained that the gain-sharing program had
been created at the top and was about to be imposed from the top.
So much for inclusive leadership!
</P>
<P>
   GOOD INTENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We explored several other ideas and posed many questions: How
does constant crisis management affect a workforce? How _ in the
absence of a crisis _ can we create an environment where employees
care about the company on a personal level and work together to
improve individual and overall performance?
</P>
<P>
   One consultant, Lee Ozley, talked a lot about the psychologist
Abraham Maslow. Maslow had a theory that absent a crisis, people
rarely commit to a program imposed on them. But they will willingly
commit to a program they help create. That thought made a huge
impression on me. In late 1988, we agreed to start a series of
programs intended to elicit ideas from our employees.
</P>
<P>
   First we approached the union leadership of the roughly 700
employees in the Wisconsin operations and asked them to help us
create a vision for the business. Ozley had warned us that it would
take 12 to 18 months to prepare people for such a process. But I
decided we couldn't wait. I wanted a new labor-management
relationship approved before our union contracts expired, in three
months.
</P>
<P>
   We were able to put in place one-year contracts with each local
union that included the joint vision-building process. Over the
next several months, many people in the Wisconsin operations worked
hard to craft a joint vision. First, about 70 leaders, union and
management, wrote down ideas for what Harley should become. Then a
facilitator met with them in groups to build consensus. Finally,
all 70 people met for three days to forge a shared strategic vision
for Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   When we rolled the ideas out to the rest of the company _ an
audience mainly of salaried employees _ one asked, ``Who
represented us in this process?''
</P>
<P>
   I was ashamed. Once again, we had behaved like traditional
managers by not including everyone. But we quickly set up two
groups of salaried employees to share the making the vision work.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our leaders weren't prepared to implement the
dramatic change the plan called for. In fact, the implementation
came off like a forced march, sending mixed messages and causing
confusion on both the shop floor and in the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the largest local union opted out of the
process after two years. Although the joint visioning process did
not succeed as we had hoped, it laid the groundwork for shared
leadership agreements with the unions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES RICH WANT?
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989, I became CEO. I soon decided that it was time to
bring together the company's 60 senior executives at an offsite
meeting. I wanted them to get to know one another and begin to work
as a truly unified team.
</P>
<P>
   We developed a program featuring two expert speakers on the
issue of change and one outside CEO who had led a major change
effort. After the presentations, we broke into smaller
cross-divisional, divisional, functional and cross-functional
groups to talk about what we'd heard, what we thought we could
accomplish and how we could do it. I visited each cluster with the
speaker so people could ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   On many easels that groups were using to record their ideas, I
was dismayed to notice the question ``What does Rich want?'' I
thought we had been so clear that the point was not to figure out
what I wanted but to figure out what everyone wanted for the
company. At the closing session, I let loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution, and I'm not going to lead it,'' I said.
``You need to lead it.''
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to the office on Monday, a colleague was waiting
for me. ``You know, you really stuck a pin in our balloon at that
session,'' she said. ``We were doing fine. We were getting to know
one another, expressing our fears as well as our thoughts about
what we wanted for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And then I realized my mistake. What was important were their
expectations. And they were happy. Too frequently, we as leaders
try to satisfy ourselves rather than others.
</P>
<P>
   The second session went well. By the third, we had jettisoned
our facilitators _ as had been the plan _ and took responsibility
to teach one another instead of listening to the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ONGOING PROCESS
</P>
<P>
   I retired as Harley's CEO in 1999, and I now serve on its board.
Looking back, I believe I succeeded in my journey to be a different
kind of leader. Harley's culture has changed, but the work is not
done.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming a culture takes time. Everybody hasn't fully bought
in to the inclusive approach. We still have people who think they
know all the answers, but they are getting fewer in number. We
still have people who just want to bring their bodies, and not
their minds, to work. But their ranks, too, are dwindling, too.

<P>
   We've been transforming ourselves since the buyout and will
still be at it 10 years from now. It is a journey that will never
end unless we let it.

<P>
   Many buyers on the Internet routinely use shopbots _ software
agents that automatically canvass the Internet looking for the
cheapest price for a given product.
</P>
<P>
   Now e-businesses are deploying agents of their own. For example,
the online retailer Buy.com is reportedly using price-comparison
software that automatically adjusts its prices to undercut
competitors' prices.
</P>
<P>
   But if all online sellers deploy armies of such pricebots, would
the result be self-destructive cyber price wars and digital mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hardly moot. Within the next decade, the
Internet could be populated with billions of software agents
exchanging information goods and services with one another and with
people.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, numerous computer
simulations have been run to explore how an agent-based economy
might function. The findings derived from those simulations raise
profound questions about the way businesses _ and the entire
economy _ will operate in the future. As commerce increases on the
Internet, a company's success may be determined as much by its
skill in programming its bots as by the wisdom of its business
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   One simulation model investigates how software agents might set
the prices of a commodity, such as a computer memory chip or a copy
of John Grisham's latest novel. Using the model, the behavior of a
variety of pricebots with different levels of sophistication was
studied.
</P>
<P>
   One simple bot, for example, uses trial and error to raise or
lower prices incrementally in an effort to maximize profits. A more
sophisticated agent makes pricing decisions based on detailed
information about competitors' prices and buyers' price
sensitivity, use of shopbots and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   With this copious information, the pricebot applies a short-term
optimization approach (dubbed ``myoptimal'' for myopically
optimal), and calculates the price that will maximize profits under
the assumption that competitors' prices remain fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the models are somewhat idealized and focus on only
about a half-dozen pricebot strategies, the results raise
provocative issues. If all pricebots rely on the trial-and-error
strategy, their collective behavior will evolve toward tacit
collusion in which they each maintain high prices and healthy
profits. If one of the pricebots adopts the myoptimal strategy,
however, it will garner higher profits at the expense of the
trial-and-error agents.
</P>
<P>
   But if all the pricebots make the switch, then endless price
wars ensue. The bots continually undercut one another until the
price reaches a certain lower limit, at which point they
re-establish a higher price, touching off a new round of
undercutting. Each pricebot actually fares worse than if all had
just maintained a trial-and-error approach.
</P>
<P>
   When all the agents are myoptimal, the one with the most
up-to-date information on competitors' pricing reaps the greatest
profits. Companies would therefore be highly motivated to program
their bots to scan competing sites and databases constantly, with
the advantage going to the fastest and most relentless repricers.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, suppliers' Web sites could be overwhelmed by
price queries from competitors' pricebots _ and the entire Internet
could be gridlocked.
</P>
<P>
   To deter such abuse, sellers may have no choice but to charge
pricebots (and shopbots) for price information. This possibility
hints at a powerful principle that could govern an agent-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that information goods and services are neither
overused nor underprovided, shopbots and pricebots may evolve into
full-fledged economic agents functioning as buyers, sellers and
intermediaries to facilitate all facets of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, researchers at the Watson Center have begun to
investigate how companies might avoid destructive bot wars by
developing more intelligent pricebots that can adapt to their
environment and anticipate the future. One promising approach is
based on reinforcement learning, in which agents learn optimal
pricing policies that maximize long-term profits. These
forward-looking pricebots have outperformed trial-and-error and
myoptimal agents.
</P>
<P>
   And when two forward-looking pricebots compete against each
other, they refrain from excessive undercutting because they
anticipate retaliation. Future research will investigate how larger
communities of such agents would perform against one other.
</P>
<P>
   Also of great interest is the behavior of agent-based markets
for complex products. Various models have been developed in which
sellers' bots not only set prices but also determine product
quality or configuration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bot could be used to create different versions of
an online journal, each with a unique set of articles, and to
adjust prices accordingly _ all in response to customers' demand
patterns and competitors' actions. Preliminary results reveal
several possible scenarios, including complicated cycles in which
both price and product parameters oscillate indefinitely _ an
undesirable situation for both sellers and buyers.
</P>
<P>
   To compete effectively on the Web, businesses will need to
understand the market dynamics of large communities of software
agents. Companies can use simulation studies to develop mechanisms
and strategies that will help them avoid potential pitfalls such as
price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligently designed bots can help businesses capitalize on
(and create) a flurry of information goods and services that will
rise as quickly and pervasively as the growth of the Web _ and that
will affect the world even more profoundly.

&HT;     APPLE THINKS OUTSIDE THE BOX WITH ITS IMPRESSIVE CUBE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all its breakthrough technology and
acknowledged superiority in desktop computing, Apple Computer's
lasting legacy will be industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent computer maker has once again thought outside of
the computer design box, ironically producing a revolutionary Cube.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac G4 Cube, a pint-sized powerhouse of a desktop
computer picks up the industrial design legacy established by its
translucent predecessor, the iMac. By all accounts, the Cube
expands on that groundbreaking design, or rather contracts on it,
offering a sleek miniaturization coupled with clean, crisp lines.
Simply put, the Cube is a beautiful machine.
</P>
<P>
   But while the design is revolutionary, the average Mac user
won't experience a huge difference when using the Cube, at least
not until Apple's next operating system, Mac OS X, is shipped in
early 2001. Until then, the Cube is essentially a faster, smaller,
cooler-looking version of the existing G4 Power Macs on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Cube, which retails for $1,799, is a 8-inch by 8-inch square
computer suspended inside an industrial-strength clear plastic
casing, giving the set-up a floating feel. The machine comes
equipped with Apple's new ``pro keyboard'' and an optical, ``pro
mouse,'' both of which follow the crystalline design of the mother
Cube. Closing out the set are a pair of 20-watt, Harman Kardon
speakers, once again encased in smooth, clear plastic. The Cube
comes with no monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But combined with one of Apple's digital, 15-inch, flat-panel
monitors ($999), the Cube is, indeed, a smaller, cooler-looking
version of the powerful Apple computers that have been dominating
the desks of graphics professionals for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   No other computer company comes close to generating the level of
loyalty and adoration that Apples does. A lot of that has to do
with the commitment to design chief executive Steve Jobs has
ingrained into the company he founded more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly it reminds me of Jobs' original NeXT computer,''
said Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin, referring to Jobs'
ill-fated company that folded in 1993. ``In some ways (the Cube) is
a new incarnation of that original idea. However, this is much more
innovative and, in many ways, represents the next generation of
computer design.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda McNulty, Apple's director of desktop product marketing,
said size was a critical component when the corporation conjured
the Cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing the size is the biggest advance,'' McNulty said.
``Having something that powerful, that's essentially silent, is an
incredible move. You have a really powerful tool on your desk, not
taking up too much space and it's unobtrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cube makes virtually no noise when it operates, thanks to an
external power source. That means no fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we design a product, we sit down and look at our customer
profile,'' McNulty said. ``You start with the needs and where you
want to get to. Basically, we got to the point where it was very
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no one person gets official credit for the Cube's
design in Apple's internal, democratic design structure, Jonathan
Ive, the vice president of industrial design, is unofficially
acknowledged as the Cube's chief creator.
</P>
<P>
   At $1,799, the Cube straddles the space between the serious
computer consumer and the corporate buyer. Luckily for both, the
Cube has the guts to satisfy the professional and the polish to
soothe a new user.
</P>
<P>
   The guts include a 450-MHz G4 processor, 64MB of RAM and a 20 GB
Ultra ATA/66 hard drive. Built-to-order options will include
incremental memory expansions topping out at 1.5 GB and a processor
upgrade to 500 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the Cube are relatively few ports for peripherals,
consisting of two USB ports, two FireWire ports, a 10/100Base-T
Ethernet port and a 56K V.90 modem connector.
</P>
<P>
   Internally, the Cube has a DVD-ROM drive, an ATI RAGE 128 Pro
graphics card with 16 MB of SDRAM graphics memory, an AirPort Card
slot and 1 MB of backside level 2 cache.
</P>
<P>
   Mac OS 9 includes a number of software applications, including
Apple's latest home-movie editor, iMovie 2.01, and QuickTime. Both
programs make the most of the Cube's digital roots, allowing for
television-quality viewing of video.
</P>
<P>
   Set-up was extremely easy, as is common with Apple computers.
There are only two wires connecting the Cube and the monitor. The
speakers and the keyboard plug directly into Apple monitors using
USB connectors.
</P>
<P>
   The chief drawback to the stock version of the Cube is the
relative lack of random access memory. With graphics-heavy programs
such as iMovie and QuickTime, it's often impossible to run more
than one at a time with only 64MBs in the tank. In the short-term,
a Cube user can boost virtual memory without major problems, but a
professional user will definitely want to upgrade the machine's
internal chips. To Apple's credit, there are plenty of slots
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably be nice to have more memory. But for a
professional customer, there's no right number in terms of
memory,'' McNulty said. ``There are people that will load it up
with a gig and a half of memory. We did design it so it's nice and
easy to get in and add whatever memory they need. We also wanted to
make sure we didn't bump the price point up.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other drawback centered on the Cube's ``sleep mode,``
which caused occasional crashes and was a bit sluggish to recede
when trying to revive the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Cube's nominal negatives were far outweighed by
the machine's positives. The new operating system should make a big
difference, as will the continued evolution of the high-speed
Internet access and programming.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Hollywood, the summer of 2000 was a season of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Perfect Storm (enditalic)blew away
(beginitalic)The Patriot (enditalic)at the box office.
(beginitalic)Chicken Run (enditalic)trotted past the fowl Jim
Carrey movie (beginitalic)Me, Myself &AMP; Irene(enditalic). And people
loved hanging out at (beginitalic)Big Momma's House(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise was the runaway hit (beginitalic)Scary
Movie(enditalic), the Wayans brothers' raunchy send-up of teenage
slasher movies that cracked the $140 million mark. In the
wheels-within-wheels department, (beginitalic)Scary Movie
(enditalic)parodied such films as (beginitalic)Scream(enditalic),
which poked fun at such old horror flicks as (beginitalic)Halloween
(enditalic)and (beginitalic)Friday the 13th(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Scary Movie (enditalic)overcame some pretty loud
harrumphing from critics, many of whom felt it scored too high on
the raunch-o-meter.
</P>
<P>
   And it pretty much did. But (beginitalic)Scary Movie
(enditalic)was a far better effort than the disgusting
(beginitalic)Me, Myself &AMP; Irene(enditalic), which got a pass from
some because it had Carrey and the Farrelly brothers behind it. No
matter that the movie stunk.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, people voted with their feet. At last count,
(beginitalic)Scary Movie (enditalic)has made over $50 million more
than (beginitalic)Me, Myself &AMP; Irene(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The Wayanses led a vanguard of African-American filmmakers and
stars who cashed in this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There was Martin Lawrence in (beginitalic)Big Momma's
House(enditalic), playing an FBI agent who dresses up like an
elderly woman to catch a thief. At last count, the movie was
approaching $115 million in receipts, especially impressive because
it cost only about $30 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy also climbed back into the fat suit for
(beginitalic)Nutty Professor II: The Klumps(enditalic). Widely
dismissed as inferior to the original, the movie still grossed $43
million on its first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And director John Singleton scored a solid hit with
(beginitalic)Shaft(enditalic), starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stars, we saw a battle for Hollywood hunk supremacy
between Mel Gibson in the Revolutionary War epic (beginitalic)The
Patriot(enditalic) and George Clooney in (beginitalic)The Perfect
Storm(enditalic), which chronicles the exploits of a fishing boat
caught in a horrific gale.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of incredible special effects, Clooney easily
bested Gibson, outearning him by $60 million. To be fair, Gibson
had to carry his long, dull movie, while Clooney's performance
consisted mainly of clinging to something while being battered with
spectacular digitized waves.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Perfect Storm (enditalic)didn't rule the summer
season, however. That honor goes to (beginitalic)Mission:
Impossible 2(enditalic), the Tom Cruise spy movie that made more
than $200 million while proving to be critic-proof. Many reviewers
saw it as a step down from the original, but audiences loved it.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Mission: Impossible 2(enditalic) was closely
followed at the box office by another guy movie,
(beginitalic)Gladiator(enditalic), which followed the exploits of a
Roman general who is first double-crossed and then becomes the Rock
of the Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   With testosterone-laden flicks dominating theaters, the summer
films didn't give women much to choose from. So it was no surprise
that the splendid ghost story (beginitalic)What Lies
Beneath(enditalic) showed some staying power, with receipts
approaching $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The supernatural thriller gets my vote as the summer's best. It
stars Michelle Pfeiffer, whose character is haunted by an
apparition somehow connected to her husband, played by Harrison
Ford. Of the calls I received praising this movie, most were from
women.
</P>
<P>
   Another big summer movie, (beginitalic) X-Men(enditalic),
started strong with a $54 million opening, but it's faded fast in
recent weeks, perhaps because all the comic book collectors have
finally seen it the requisite 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer winds down, there were three late entries in the
sweepstakes. Last weekend's (08/04-06) (beginitalic)Space Cowboys,
Hollow Man (enditalic)and (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)all
tried to grab pieces of the weekend gate, with (beginitalic)Hollow
Man (enditalic)breaking on top with a $26 million opening.
</P>
<P>
   If the summer lacked anything, it was that one critical success
that had everyone talking about it. But there's no need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The fall film season is right around the corner.

   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore did not invent the
Internet. But Democrats believe they are the e-political party and
when they decided to hold their national convention in Los Angeles,
they were determined to create a convention with cutting-edge
technology.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc., the telecommunications giant spanning
the Southwest, West Coast and parts of the Midwest, says its people
made that possible.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio-based company is the official communications
provider for the convention. This week, it has supplied the fiber
optic voice, data, video, broadcast and wireless services for
45,000 media personnel, delegates and political service companies
that have gathered here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest single deployment of digital subscriber
lines ever at one spot on the planet,'' said John Britton, the SBC
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said SBC also provided data and voice services for the
Republican National Convention that was held in San Diego in 1996,
but technology has advanced so dramatically in four years that the
scope of services needed has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996 we had almost no Internet service,'' Britton said.
``This year, there are over a hundred dot-coms that are streaming
out information constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Watts, president of the Los Angeles region of Pacific
Bell, a division of SBC, said the Democratic convention has
provided an opportunity for SBC to demonstrate that it is no longer
a regional phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an opportunity for us to show nationally and
internationally that we have become a global player in
communications,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Motta, vice president for operations for the Democratic
National Committee, said Democrats are paying retail rates for all
the regulated communications and broadcast services being provided
for the convention. In-kind contributions of telecommunication
services are closely monitored by the Federal Election Commission,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Motta said the company has not forecast how much revenue it
expects to receive from the convention, but said the project would
be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, SBC contributed
$2.1 million to candidates in a wide range of races in the current
election cycle, with 51 percent of the money going to Democrats.
But Motta said SBC's involvement with the Democratic convention has
nothing to do with politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to evolve into a bigger and better global forum and
this convention is a global stage,'' he said. ``There is nothing
like it.''

&HT;     UNITED IS IN FOR A ROUGH LANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's an old expression about winning the
battle but losing the war. If you don't understand it, watch what
is happening with United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest airline is in danger of becoming America's
most common swear word. Because of separate labor disputes
involving mechanics and pilots, United has canceled hundreds of
flights, and many others have been delayed for hours.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an attempt to side with management or the unions.
It's rare in any dispute that either side is completely right or
wrong. But contract negotiations everywhere are sort of like
playing chicken on the railroad tracks; deep down, you honestly
think the other side will flinch before you do. But sometimes you
forget that the train is perfectly capable of destroying you both.
</P>
<P>
   That might happen with United. Even if management and labor both
eventually end up claiming victory, they might lose something more
important than one contract: a habit.
</P>
<P>
   Companies count on repeat business. They want customers to get
into the habit of using their service without even thinking about
what competitors have to offer. United had that with me, and I'm
sure I'm not alone. I have frequent-flier miles there, so I would
automatically take United whenever it was available. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I have no horror story; just a change of habit. When my wife and
I flew to Atlanta in May, we chose Delta instead of United because
we didn't want to risk having a vacation fouled up by a labor
dispute. When we flew our nephew out from Boston in July, we chose
American instead of United for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   People who work for United probably think this mess is better
than a strike, which can cause serious scars on both sides. After
all, workers still get paid and the airline still gets revenue from
passengers. But for customers, the experience might be worse
because you never know when the whole thing is going to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest now: If you were booking a flight for January and had
a choice between United and any other decent airline, wouldn't you
choose the competitor? Why risk it? But if the pilots and mechanics
were on strike, you might go ahead and book the flight, figuring
that the strike isn't going to last five months.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long for habits to change. The Teamsters got
most of what they wanted after a 15-day strike at United Parcel
Service in 1997, but UPS lost business and had to cut jobs. Even a
year later, its business was suffering, and a lot of employees were
still ex-employees. Fifteen days was long enough to change
customers' habits.
</P>
<P>
   In United's case, the labor dispute carries a double whammy
because of competition and timing. Both of our flights on Delta
were on time, as were both of our nephew's flights on American.
Certainly part of the credit for that could go to United.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we were going through three of the busiest airports
in the country, places where you expect delays. But those airports
_ particularly San Francisco's _ weren't as busy as usual, because
the world's largest airline had canceled so many of its flights.
</P>
<P>
   United not only unwittingly sent us to its competitors, it
helped to ensure that our experience with them was more
pleasurable. Now THAT'S customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the whammy is the timing. For logical
reasons, labor unions often act during the busiest time of the
year. That can cause management to suffer more, which is part of
the game of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   When you mess with people's summer vacations, you can build up
hatred in a hurry. Business travelers can get numb to airline
delays, but those whose only airline experience is a week or two of
vacation each year can get awfully testy if you spoil it.

MORE SPEED NEEDED TO MAKE WAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For eight days here, the theme was ``Send a
Message to Sydney.'' The Aussies are talking about a gold rush in
their home waters. Gotta send 'em a message.
</P>
<P>
   So, now that the US Olympic Swimming Trials are done, what's the
message? Our girls are older than your girls? Our guys are younger
than your guys? The Americans didn't send the only message that
matters _ world records.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they couldn't have. Lenny Krayzelburg, the Ukrainian
emigre-turned-California beach boy, could have taken down his own
global mark in the 100-meter backstroke in the semis, but eased up.
Tom Malchow did the same in the 200 butterfly. And a few others
came within hundredths of a second _ Gary Hall in the 50 freestyle
and Ed Moses and Megan Quann in the 100 breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   This was still a much better meet than it was four years ago,
when no American records were set for the first time since 1920.
Nine US marks were established here, including Erik Vendt's
historic 14:59.11 in Wednesday's 1,500 freestyle, the first time an
American has broken 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Yanks will be delighted to do as well in Sydney as
they did in Atlanta, where they won 26 medals, half of them gold.
If the Games were held today, the US men would still be favored for
six gold medals _ Krayzelburg (two), Malchow, Tom Dolan (400 IM),
and the two 4x100 relays. But the women figure to win only three _
Brooke Bennett (800 free) and the two 4x100 relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ranked No. 1 in the world in one individual event,'' US
women's coach Richard Quick said Wednesday, after perusing the form
sheet. ``The rest, we've got to improve to have a chance. We will
have to swim better than we ever have in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   That's essentially what Quick said here four years ago. The
difference then was that his swimmers had four months to get faster
after the March trials. This time, they have four weeks. Last time,
the Games were on home soil. This time, they're halfway around the
world in a hostile pool.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when the trials were also held in August and the Games
were also on the other side of the international dateline (Seoul),
the Americans had their worst showing (18 medals) since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Matt Biondi and Janet Evans, everybody peaked at the
trials and was flat by the Games. ``We learned something from
1988,'' Quick says. ``We do need to have that balance of work and
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   So the US team will train hard for the next two weeks at its
Pasadena camp, then taper and hope that its old girls and young
guys can jack up their times to podium range. ``It's all about
improvement,'' says men's coach Mark Schubert. ``Whatever happened
here won't be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans easily topped the table in Atlanta, nobody
cared that they'd been slow here. But the question is whether their
old girls (oldest in history, including 33-year-old Dara Torres)
and young guys (eight teenagers) will be able to get up enough
speed to stay in front of a world that's gotten markedly faster
over the last quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the hype has surrounded the Yank-Aussie showdown,
the fact is that the two old rivals go head-to-head for gold in
only one individual event _ the men's 100 backstroke with
Krayzelburg and Matt Welsh. ``It's not the Pan Pacifics and it's
not US versus Australia,'' says Quick. ``It's the US versus the
rest of the world. We have to be prepared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Chinese women are clean and slow, the sprinters
have to worry about the Netherlands' Inge de Bruijn, who holds
three world records. The breaststrokers still will have to deal
with South Africa's Penny Heyns.
</P>
<P>
   The US men have more than just The Thorpedo (Australian phenom
Ian Thorpe) and his mates to handle. Russia's Alexander Popov, who
has tormented them at the last two Games, is still around and still
talking trash.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the American men needed only jump in the
water to win all three relays. This time, they could lose them all.
Odds are that won't happen _ the US has never lost either of the
4x100s at the Olympics and has always set a world record.
</P>
<P>
   But when the clockers and watchers penciled the times from the
last eight days into the world rankings, the message that emerged
was strictly intramural: Gotta get faster.

F-150 SUPERCAB SHARES FORD, HARLEY ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen.
</P>
<P>
   That staccato burble you hear might be coming from a
Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Look.
</P>
<P>
   You're half right. The tuned exhaust notes are pouring forth
from a 2000 Ford F150 SuperCab pickup truck that has been restyled
and customized in the first year of a five-year joint partnership
between Ford Motor Co. and Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Limited Edition Harley-Davidson F-150. Black with
distinct Harley-orange pinstriping. Black leather all over the
inside. Chrome glistening in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   And that sound is the perfect purr to announce the joining of
two companies, both founded in 1903 _ same year the Wright Brothers
flew at Kitty Hawk _ and hooked at least through their centennial
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Their recipe for this truck? Drop in Ford's 5.4-liter Triton
V-8, make it sound something like a Harley V-Twin engine, and let
the folks at Harley _ with ol' Willie G. Davidson himself taking a
heavy hand _ give it a distinct look.
</P>
<P>
   What you get is an F-150 SuperCab that is lowered so low it
looks like it is crouching. It's the cruiser look.
</P>
<P>
   You've got a chrome billet grill and remarkable 20-by-9-inch
wheels _ biggest ever on a Ford production vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20-inch wheels pose a significant problem when you add them
to a rig that can spin them at high speeds. Bigger wheels means
bigger tires. Bigger tires, at high speeds, mean more centrifugal
force, and that could mean tire distortion or failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the thing we worked hardest on,'' George Magor, the
project manager for the Ford-Harley Alliance, said of the
wheel-tire combo.
</P>
<P>
   They built the wheels out of aluminum and coated them with
chrome. For the tires, they turned to Goodyear, which developed
Eagle GT2s that incorporate the company's ``run-flat'' technology
which, in effect, produces very strong sidewalls. They are rated to
130 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The result is some of the most beautiful wheels I have seen on
any vehicle. They give this F-150 a distinct presence.
</P>
<P>
   The other remarkable distinction is the sound, produced, Magor
said, by ``tinkering with the lengths and numbers of tubes inside
the exhaust can.'' Like building a musical instrument. It's a tune
that does it for me.
</P>
<P>
   The Triton V-8 that produces the power that produces the burble
cranks out 260 horsepower and 350 ft.-lb. of torque. It delivered
15.6 miles per gallon in more than a week of driving.
</P>
<P>
   It is a very responsive engine, hurtling the truck forward when
asked to do so and, with that torque rating, I'm sure it would be a
hauling and towing beast.
</P>
<P>
   To smooth the ride _ no easy task on a truck with big wheels _
the suspension has been lowered an inch and the springs and sway
bar suspension have been strengthened. They've done a good job in
tuning the suspension _ coil springs up front, leaf springs in the
rear _ and on most roads and in highway travel, it is a crisp,
smooth charger. Only when the suspension encountered a repetitive
series of bumps _ such as washboard _ did a noticeable shudder
develop, running diagonally from front to opposite rear.
</P>
<P>
   In hard corners, it sat remarkably upright and you quickly
realized the only leaning being done was by the occupants of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   With four doors, getting in and out of the front and rear seats
was easy _ made easier for adults, at least, by the fact the truck
sits lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The front seats _ leather captain's chairs embossed with the
Harley logo were firm and supportive _ like a good saddle on a
Softail Springer.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the rear seat, where three people could sit with
decent legroom, was a bit upright, and as the four-door pickup
evolves increasingly into a popular family transport choice,
manufacturers are going to have to make this rear seat just a bit
more comfortable. Some folks will make their decisions on whether
or not to buy a particular truck with the back seat a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   Leather, as I said, is all over the inside: seats, steering
wheel, armrests.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first introduced, the Harley-Davidson F-150 came
with a tonneau cover and it was a slick-looking cap. But Ford had
quality problems with the supplier _ the covers wouldn't hold the
paint job Ford/Harley wanted on them _ so Harley dropped $550 off
the MSRP and delivered this year's model without the cover. The
problem with that is it leaves the big rubber bedliner _ loose in
the bed and embossed with a huge Harley logo _ in easy reach of
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bedliner that would make a nice wall hanging or rug in
certain homes. I can see one in, say, a living room in winter with
a Harley parked on it.
</P>
<P>
   But news for the future is good. The tonneau cover will return
and, Magro assured me, Ford/Harley will offer a new model of the
specialized truck for each of the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to sell 8,000 this year, 8,000 next year, and remain
limited in production throughout the run of the joint venture.
Colors will change and mechanics will change.
</P>
<P>
   Is that an F-150 SVT Harley-Davidson Lightning I hear rumbling
just over the hill?
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The arrow just below that fuel gauge that reminds you which
side the gas cap is on. If you're a family that swaps vehicles
around, it's sometimes easy to forget how to pull up to a pump.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The chrome pseudo-step-up-bars tucked under the rocker panels.
Don't tread on me, they say. Problem is, lots of families with what
some Harley types call ``rug rats'' would probably prefer some
semblance of a usable step those kids could use to get out of the
truck.

   WELLFLEET, Mass. _ To find the pulse of what's hot in the book
publishing world, turn left at the peeling row boat and look for
the seafood shack up ahead.
</P>
<P>
   This is Commercial Street, not Times Square. The parking lot
that leads to Leapfrog Press _ if you can find it _ pops with
seashells and ends at a marshy creek. In a one-room office inside,
the company's entire publishing arsenal consists of a computer, a
Web site, a fax machine, and cartons of . . . plastic frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll do anything to sell a book,'' said Marge Piercy,
watching her husband and fellow author, Ira Wood, tear through a
box of the souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   This fishing village has always been a writer's enclave, drawing
the likes of Annie Dillard, Stanley Kunitz and Maya Angelou to its
rugged harbor and local eccentrics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years after one of the town's most celebrated literary
couples launched the Cape's only small press with national
distribution, Leapfrog is bursting onto the scene with rare
success. Amid the national explosion of independent presses trying
to fill the gaps between New York's giant conglomerates, the
company has quickly distinguished itself. In the process, it has
brought a new dimension to this town's literary legacy.
</P>
<P>
   With writers' instincts and impossible good luck, Wood and
Piercy have drawn a potent, eclectic mix of authors and genres to
their coastal offices. With ten books published so far, their
titles have captured the attention of leading industry reviews,
including the New York Times Book Review, Kirkus Reviews, The Los
Angeles Times and The American Book Review. Their authors, almost
all with New England ties, are popping up on National Public Radio.
Several have won awards or nominations for national prizes in
fiction and poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The works include a book of early poetry by Piercy, a 30-year
Wellfleet resident and author of 14 novels, including the 1976
science fiction classic ``Woman on the Edge of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also include ``Rookie Cop,'' a former New York City
police detective's memoir of his years infiltrating a terrorist
group. The author, now Wellfleet Police Chief Richard Rosenthal,
had published other books through a major New York house, but he
abandoned that publisher for Leapfrog's intimacy and literary edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything quite like what they are doing, and they
sensed an opportunity to bring the energy of the publishing
industry to the Cape,'' said Charles Coe, of Cambridge, an
African-American poet who never published until he put together a
collection under Leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Picnic on the Moon,'' was published last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' Coe said, ``(Ira and Marge) love
Wellfleet, and they made a decision to integrate their work into
their life. A lot of people who were going to do this would say,
`We have to be in New York.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With a national distributor to push their books to the major
chains, and printing contracts with companies in the mid-west, Wood
and Piercy seem to have the art of small press publishing down to a
science, using cyberspace for everything from text editing to book
jacket design.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Wood said, his aim was simple: to create an
outlet for writers whose books have all but died amid the
multi-million-dollar deals of New York's major publishing houses in
the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw friends of ours who had already published three or four
books and couldn't get published,'' Wood said, ``terrific writers
whose books would get rejected over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, as Wood and Piercy take on different projects, the
stories of how some manuscripts have found their way to Leapfrog's
door have taken on a magic as strange and compelling as the books
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``leo(at)fergusrules.com.'' A first novel by Arne
Tangherlini, it is a book that, by all accounts, never should have
seen the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard graduate who taught high school students in the United
States and the Philippines, Tangherlini sent the first 50 pages of
his book to a few New York houses. They rejected the work, saying
the cyber-science-fiction, coming-of-age story couldn't be
marketed. Then, Tangherlini sent the excerpt to Leapfrog, picking
it at random from a long list of smaller presses.
</P>
<P>
   For days, it sat in a pile with dozens of others the couple
receives each week. But as soon as Piercy read it, she said, she
knew it deserved to be published. Described by one reviewer as a
computer-age ``Catcher in the Rye,'' the novel follows an
Asian-Italian-American teenager caught between her lost ancestors
and the virtual reality behind her computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Wood and Piercy rushed an e-mail message to the author, asking
for the rest of the manuscript. A few months after receiving it,
the couple sent a second e-mail to accept the book. They didn't
hear back from him.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Tangherlini's wife returned the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said Arne would have loved knowing that someone wanted to
publish his book,'' Wood said. ``And I said, `Wait a minute. What
do you mean, would have?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before Wood's last e-mail, Tangherlini killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the couple faced another dilemma _ whether or not to invest
resources in an unknown author and publish the book posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   In Piercy's mind, there was no question. The book came out last
year. And after a USA Today book reviewer stumbled on the novel at
a bookstore, the exposure catapulted the novel to worldwide
acclaim, winning a best-book prize from the New York Public Library
and finding a place on the reading lists of international schools.
It sold 5,000 copies in trade paperback _ a rare feat for a young,
small press _ and is poised for a second printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to think about how impossible it is,'' Wood
said. ``A guy from USA Today walks into a bookstore with miles and
miles of books, he sees 5/8 of an inch of the spine of my book by
an unknown writer, and then he buys it. He actually buys it, and he
decides to review it, and the whole thing just takes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of thing _ when you're sitting here doing
nothing, feeling like you're in the middle of nowhere and your
books are collecting dust _ that makes you just shoot to the
ceiling. That's what pulls you along in this business.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 14 months since Jim Tobin became chief executive of
Boston Scientific, succeeding founder chairman Peter Nicholas, he
dismissed 1,900 people, closed manufacturing operations in three
states, and watched profits decline while the stock lost two-thirds
of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas's reaction: ``I wished I hired him earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   His confidence in the 56-year-old Tobin stems from a deep trust
the two men have developed in each other as they attempt to turn
Boston Scientific around. For Tobin, that assurance _ and the free
hand he's been given by Nicholas _ is a stark change from the four
years he spent as president of Biogen under chairman Jim Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to CEO, Vincent called Tobin ``the ideal choice'' to lead
Biogen's management team. But Tobin reportedly had some differences
with Vincent, who is widely known for saving Biogen from near
bankruptcy and establishing it as an industry leader. Tobin,
sources said, felt he was being second-guessed by Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1998 showdown, the Biogen board of directors sided
with Vincent, prompting Tobin to resign abruptly and go on an
extended skiing vacation.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, Tobin calmly said he did not want to
talk about Vincent, but his demeanor changed quickly when he spoke
about Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Pete is a joy,'' he said. ``Not that we always
agree on everything. We have a pretty productive collaboration. He
is better at some things than I will ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 59-year-old Nicholas, turning over control of the
medical-device company he and John Abele founded in 1979 in
Watertown and grew through acquisitions to more than $2.8 billion
last year, with 13,500 employees, has been a deliberate process.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Nicholas told company directors that he wanted
to scale back his day-to-day involvement and urged them to begin
seeking his replacement. There were few candidates inside the
company. Abele left full-time company management in 1990 and
further reduced his workload this January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the management depth,'' Nicholas said. He
focused his executive talent search on large medical products
companies with strong management talent, such as Abbott
Laboratories and Baxter International Inc. Tobin spent 22 years at
Baxter, the huge supplier of hospital products, rising from
financial analyst to chief operating officer before joining Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tobin bolted from Biogen for the western ski slopes,
Nicholas made his move, reaching him by phone in between downhill
runs for a first interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good discussion and it was clear to me that here was
the guy I was looking for,'' said Nicholas of Tobin. ``He fit my
view as an ideal successor. It was an easy decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, who said he also received a strong recommendation
about Tobin from Vincent, believed that Boston Scientific's growth
through acquisition left it somewhat bloated and inefficient at
turning out products quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And while revenues were reaching record highs last year he was
worried about the company's future, following a four-year
acquistion spree in which Boston Scientific spent $6 billion on at
least a dozen deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was particularly concerned about high manufacturing
costs and Boston Scientific's ability to keep pace with more nimble
competitors in emerging markets such as cardiovascular stents.
These are metal mesh devices used by cardiovascular surgeons in a
procedure known as angioplasty that keeps blood vessels open after
they are cleared of plaque to improve blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the significance of the stent opportunity,''
conceded Nicholas, noting that while Boston Scientific anticipated
that stents would be used in 25 percent of patients with heart
disease, they are now used in upwards of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Tobin, who was hired in March 1999 but did not begin working
at Boston Scientific until that June, Boston Scientific's problems
fit perfectly with his Baxter skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Tobin has begun to do a lot of the things people thought
he would do,'' said Daniel T. Lemaitre, first vice president at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who has followed his career at Baxter since
1983. ``Tobin is very pragmatic and blunt-talking. He knows how to
drive manufacturing costs lower every year.''
</P>
<P>
   That directness also appealed to Nicholas. While Tobin was still
relatively new to biotech, Boston Scientific's challenges boiled
down to becoming more efficient in manufacturing, consolidating
some operations and figuring out how to stem the market-share loss
in cardiovascular stents, the fastest growing part of the stent
market that was the major cause of company's recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival at Boston Scientific's plush executive office
in Natick _ the former Prime Computer Corp. headquarters and once a
Carling beer brewing facility _ Tobin has moved quickly on two
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a corporate reorganization aimed at streamling the
company by eliminating overlapping manufacturing functions and
focusing stent production in Miami and Ireland. Last month the
company announced that 1,900 manufacturing jobs, including 850 in
Watertown _ the community where Nicholas and co-founder John Abele
launched Boston Scientific in 1979 _ would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the loss of jobs can be painful for
employees, Tobin didn't flinch from making the cuts. ``At Baxter, I
had 60,000 people and 131 plants and we closed 50 of them and built
five new ones,'' Tobin said. ``So closing three facilities (at
Boston Scientific) is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin says the restructuring will generate savings of $250
million annually by 2003 and boost research and development
spending. Boston Scientific also consolidated its Medi-Tech
division, which produces its vascular surgery and radiology
products division to Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The second and perhaps most intractable problem is Medinol Ltd.,
a company that Boston Scientific helped create in Tel Aviv five
years ago to produce state-of-the-art cardiovascular stents.
Disagreements over timely delivery of the top-selling stents led to
unusally high inventories which Boston Scientific had to be write
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky partnership for quite some time,'' said
Tobin. To solve the provlem, Boston Scientific announced last week
that it would acquire acquiring Medinol, its sole supplier of
cardiovascular stents.
</P>
<P>
   Owning Medinol would enable Boston Scientific to become more
competitive with rivals who make their own stents, generating
higher gross profit margins. Tobin maintains a closer working
relationship is needed between the two companies to avoid recent
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Boston Scientific, which does the final assembly
of the stent system by adding a balloon catheter, recalled
thousands of its top-of-the-line Nir stents because of suspected
pinhole problems after the company reported 22 leakages.
</P>
<P>
   Solving the problem and regaining US Food and Drug
Administration's approval took 17 months and set the company's new
product plans back by a year. It also puts Boston Scientific
further behind its leading rivals _ Guidant Corp. of Indianapolis
and Medtronics Incv. of Minneapolis _ and just ahead of Johnson &AMP;
Johnson of New Brunswick, N.J. _ in the $2 billion stent market.
J&AMP;J, the nation's largest medical device company is reportedly
gaining market share against Boston Scientific with its new
cardiovascular stent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Boston Scientific suffered another setback,
when Medinol said it would have to delay its next generation stent
from early 2001 to year to the second half _ a move that chagrined
investors. Boston Scientific stock closed at a 52-week low of
$16.125 Tuesday, rising to $16.25 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a step slow right now,'' declared Tobin confidently.
``That is all that is boils down to.''

HIS MATH ADDS UP TO BETTER THAN SIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Peter Kormann has the math to prove his hypothesis:
``People who think we have no chance to win a medal in the Olympics
. . .,'' said the head coach the US men's gymnastics squad, ``. . .
they are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For going on five years now, said Kormann, the US men's squad
has shown an upward spike in its learning curve. With the Olympic
Trials under way at the FleetCenter, shaping the teams that will go
to Sydney next month, Kormann is confident that his Yankee men will
flash the moves that have kept them consistently among the world's
top six competitive nations since the last Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' said Kormann, ``are approaching the fields of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone for banging the drum of patriotic optimism,
Bela Karolyi, head of the women's squad, soon grabbed the
microphone at Wednesday's news conference and proclaimed the
women's team ``very, very good.'' He said it with the typical
Karolyi body English, punctuating adverbs and adjectives with
twists of his torso and shadow punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a problem,'' said Karolyi. ``We don't have a team
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The sorting-out process, putting names to rosters, begins with
the men's preliminary round, which includes six events. The women,
whose preliminaries are Friday night, compete in four events.
Finals for the men will be held Saturday, followed by the women
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of the squads inevitably raises some controversy. The
men will take the top four finishers, determined by combined scores
here and last month's US championships in St. Louis. The fifth and
six members will be chosen by Kormann and members of USA
Gymnastics. All six members of the women's squad will be picked,
regardless of scores here, although the women who finish 1-2-3 will
receive special consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that is subjective, concedes Bob Colorassi, president of
USA Gymnastics, but like figure skating, judging is subjective. In
the end, the sport's governing body wants to be comfortable that it
is heading to Australia with the best tumblers and jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our responsibility,'' said Colorassi, ``to put the best
on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure rosters now, said Karolyi ``is all mental
bingo.'' And in the end, he said, the athletes will determine the
roster by their performances, his attempt to diminish fears of
politics playing a cruel hand come selection time.
</P>
<P>
   The most recognizable athlete to take the floor will be Shannon
Miller, the most accomplished gymnast in US history. Hindered by a
hairline fracture in her shin, Miller Tuesday worked out on all
four events and convinced USA Gymnastics honchos that she was fit
for a third run at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Miller didn't begin thinking seriously about another run at
Olympus until December, when she approached her longtime coach
Steve Nunno, ex- of Burlington, Mass., about reaching for the Rings
once more. ``She came to me and said, `I'd like to get in shape and
see where it brings me,' '' said Nunno. ``Then she said, `Maybe I'd
like to compete again.' To me it was, `Hey, been there, done that.
What do you want to do that for?' I mean, for what? What if (the
US) team doesn't even medal. Isn't that going to be
anticlimactic?''
</P>
<P>
   But within a month, said Nunno, Miller was the best athlete in
his gym once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would have started all this,'' said Miller,
sounding confident about a third trip to the Games, ``if I didn't
think I could make it.''

 BLAINE WILSON IS NOT AFRAID TO CRASH THE SELECTION PARTY

<P>
   BOSTON _ He's got a ticket to ride, but he don'tcare. Blaine
Wilson was guaranteed a free pass to Olympus months ago, based
solely on his resume. No thanks, he says. He's no charity case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by some chance I screw up and don't make this team, I'm not
going,'' declared Wilson, who's far and away the top man coming
into Thursday night's US Olympic Gymnastics Trials at the
FleetCenter. ``Because there'd be six other guys out there who've
busted their ass and they should be there. If you didn't earn a
spot on this team, you shouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Gymnastics says Wilson has more than earned a spot with a
record five straight national titles and a fourth-place finish at
last year's World Championships. So if he gets hurt this week or
falls off an apparatus or three, Wilson can petition onto the team
and get an automatic thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in petitions,'' said Wilson flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Ask and ye shall receive doesn't make it in Wilson's value
system. You might as well ask the Lords of the Rings for a gold
medal if you miss your wakeup call at the Olympics. There are no
handouts in this league. Or there shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad would be like, `Weak way to get in,' ' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   How weak would it have been if Michael Johnson and Maurice
Greene had been able to petition onto the 200-meter team after
pulling up lame at the track and field trials last month? ``So much
hype for absolutely nothing,'' Wilson snorted. ``We waited all day
to watch that race and then _ nothing. The other three guys won
that race because they didn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wilson will attack all six events in Thursday night's
preliminaries and attack them again on Saturday. Twelve-for-12 is
the goal and if Wilson misses a routine, he will come off cursing,
as always.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is 26 and coming off shoulder surgery but he's still
dissatisfied with anything less than a 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's way better than he was last year,'' said two-time
Olympian (and four-time US champ) John Roethlisberger. ``He's
meaner and nastier. I'm just glad he's on my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been The Man all quadrennium, winning his last 110
domestic events by US coach Peter Kormann's count. He missed a
bronze medal at the world meet by .001 points. If Wilson had just
stuck his rings routine, he would have been the first American on
the all-around podium since Kurt Thomas in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   By then, though, Wilson had already served the greater good,
making sure that the Americans stayed among the top six in the team
competition going into the Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top six is like the Final Four,'' said Kormann. ``You're
not going to win any medals if you're not in that group. Unless
you're on the floor with the top teams, you're not going to get a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Wilson, the Yanks likely would have sunk out of the top
10 and off the radar screen. They've been invisible before. After
the US men won their only Olympic title in 1984 in Los Angeles,
they plunged to 11th in 1988 and were still only sixth in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, there was concern about whether we'd even qualify for
1996,'' said men's team director Ron Galimore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans were in medal contention in Atlanta until
two of them fell off the pommel horse. This time, they're mounting
``Operation Sneak Attack,'' which is aimed at ambushing the
Koreans, Japanese, and Belarussians and getting the United States
back on the podium. And Wilson, his tongue repierced, will be
walking the point.
</P>
<P>
   He had taken out the tongue stud and removed the eyebrow ring
because Kormann thought they conveyed the wrong image in a
clean-cut, clean-shaven sport. But the four tattoos are here for
keeps. And the stud is back. ``I got tired of listening to other
people,'' Wilson said. ``I'm doing my own thing. Anyway, it's not
like I'll be sticking out my tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Sundance Kid, he goes his own way. Wilson was always
getting chucked out of practice for acting up. But his spunk and
spark and his fierce team sense always got him invited back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blaine is a bit misunderstood,'' said Kormann, who coached him
at Ohio State. ``He does have a rebel side to him that he uses to
his advantage. But I've never had anyone who's as strong a team
player as Blaine Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Wilson might be too much of a team player for his
own good. ``When the team competition is over, Blaine tends to
think his job is done,'' said Kormann, ``and he lets down.''
</P>
<P>
   Operation Sneak Attack aside, the Americans have a decidedly
better chance of getting an individual medal from Wilson than they
do of leapfrogging three countries for a team bronze. And if it's
in the all-around, which only one US male (Peter Vidmar in 1984)
has ever managed at Olympus, Wilson will finally get his moment on
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   If he were female, five US titles would already have put Wilson
on a magazine cover. But the men have always played second banana
in America (Mary Lou Retton overshadowed the golden boys in 1984)
and that won't change this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, they won a gold medal in 1996,'' said Wilson.
``That's legit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that what the women do isn't demanding, Wilson conceded. The
4-inch balance beam is so nasty that cops should use it for a
sobriety test. But still . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather watch somebody crash on the high bar or watch
balance beam?'' Wilson said. ``I would not watch balance beam. I'd
watch the crash. It's just more exciting. The events we do are
powerful. Their events are graceful. I don't know if I could sit
and watch graceful for three hours. But I could watch people crash
all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so the USA Gymnastics people, who've already watched one
Olympics implode because their national champion (Dan Hayden in
1988) crashed twice on high bar and missed the team. That's why
Wilson got his ticket to ride, no matter what he does or doesn't do
here this week. Charity has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The federation people will tell you it's terrific that Wilson is
so competitive, so hard-core, so honest that he won't take anything
he hasn't earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not up to him,'' Kormann said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaine Wilson is going back to Olympus even if his coach has to
handcuff him to the rings and ship him Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Blaine says anything,'' said Kormann, ``here's what I'm
going to tell him: `Ask not what your country can do for you, ask
what you can do for your country.' ''

BACK-TO-SCHOOL LOOK IS RETRO, RETOOLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents may find back-to-school shopping this year nostalgic,
confusing, and annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are stocking the shelves with predictable staples and
retro accessories from several eras, creating the potential for a
jumble of styles, from cute (plaid skirts) to seductive (sparkly
stretch denim).
</P>
<P>
   For girls, there are patent-leather shoes, Peter Pan collars,
and blouses with ruffle trim.
</P>
<P>
   But before you start thinking your darling could head off to
class looking like a kilt-wearing private-school student, be aware
that trendsetters are also offering animal prints, fake leather,
stretch jeans (to go with leg warmers _ no joke), colored corduroys
with studs, and jeans in wider bells or flares, some adorned with
fringe, shiny fabric, or beads.
</P>
<P>
   According to one interpretation, these looks are supposed to be
blended, for example, patent-leather Mary Janes paired with orange
bell-bottom corduroys and a dark denim jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is juxtaposition to mixing and matching,'' said Robert
Rutkauskas, fashion director at Filene's in Boston. ``And plaid is
important. A bold plaid. It's not the traditional schoolgirl plaid.
You'd be wearing it with a pleather (fake-leather) jacket or a
chunky sweater, breaking style with a different attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, it's simpler for boys.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo pants that zip off at the knee or loose-fit
carpenter-style corduroys are hip. So is layering screen T-shirts
under short-sleeve woven ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``For boys, it's the great basics, updated by color and
fabric,'' said Betsy Thompson, spokeswoman for Talbots Kids. ``If
you buy things that are lightweight that can be layered up, they
can wear it right through fall; fleece vests, baseball-inspired
T-shirts. Boys take their inspirations from rugged outdoor sport
themes.''
</P>
<P>
   For both sexes, cowboy and motorcycle boots in wood or lug
soles, and brightly colored suede sneakers, are popular this year.
Girls may also choose from among side-zip booties, platforms, and
Mary Janes.
</P>
<P>
   The season's hot accessories for girls include stacks of
bracelets and gold hoop earrings, right out of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgic yet?
</P>
<P>
   The trend in outerwear is denim jackets, down vests, and
peacoats for kids in every age bracket, while ponchos are one of
the biggest items for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans are always popular, but this year the denim is darker, and
for girls, it sometimes has a sheen or sparkle. (Sparkle falls into
the annoying category.)
</P>
<P>
   One trend is wearing a denim jacket with matching jeans,
hearkening back to a James Dean look. It's retro, but also a more
polished and put-together approach for students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is somewhat of a return to wearing a denim jean jacket
in the same finish as the bottom,'' Rutkauskas added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pleather may seem over the top for kids. But
retailers say the look, in pants, jean-style jackets, or skirts, is
not just for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleather is the hottest trend out there,'' said Mary Ann
Crenshaw, spokeswoman for the Children's Place.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the kicker: ``It's machine washable,'' Crenshaw
insisted. ``And it's for girls and boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleather comes in solid colors, such as red and black, and
plain, smooth finishes. But there are also snake-print and
imitation-crocodile looks.
</P>
<P>
   As for sweater trends, there are hooded or zip-front cardigans,
chunky knits, and an '80s preppy look with Fair Isles and argyles
in a range of necklines.
</P>
<P>
   The preppiness also extends to plaid skirts, which can be
dressed down with layered novelty T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Rutkauskas calls the cotton tops ``attitudes'' because they have
words on them, such as ``Princess'' or ``Goddess.'' The look is a
continuation of the logo T-shirt trend, which is several years old.
</P>
<P>
   Those T-shirts _ with quite different logos or images _ are also
in for boys, who have grown accustomed to wearing a short-sleeve
version over a long-sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Layering is something kids have done for many years, but the
fabrics these days make it easier than ever,'' said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   New fabrics extend to pants as well, ``like corduroys that have
that soft, lived-in quality,'' Thompson added. ``It feels good
against the skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight pants have a more techno feel, coming in shiny fabrics
with toggle drawstrings and handy pockets for electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Although cargo pants have been popular for a few years, there's
a new formula for wearing them: They are supposed to fit, not hang
low or bunch up at the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Following the trend in women's wear, kids are expected to look
more pulled together this year _ despite the trend of mixing and
matching.
</P>
<P>
   Confused yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more refinement to dress,'' Rutkauskas said. ``It's a
little more cleaned up.''

&HT;     BROWN TOUTS GORE DESPITE DIMINISHED CONVENTION ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his first year as the mayor of San Francisco,
Willie Brown stormed into the 1996 Democratic National Convention
in Chicago with the electricity of a Hollywood star.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a rousing five-minute speech praising President
Clinton's urban policy and blasting Republicans for neglecting
cities. As the crowd chanted, ``Willie, Willie,'' hundreds of ``Da
Mayor'' baseball hats were tossed into the California delegation.
</P>
<P>
   In his second-term, Brown is no less a party, but his presence
at this year's convention was decidedly low-key.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is one of the nation's most prominent mayors and a
leading black official, Brown did not speak from the convention
podium.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was offered a non-prime-time spot to address the
delegates. Brown declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first and foremost think you really ought to have a message
to deliver to the good and faithful from the podium,'' said Brown,
who has rarely been shy about sharing his messages. ``I don't need
to do that. My career in that regard is already done.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who was re-elected last year, explained that he would
have taken the role if he had been asked to speak about a
particular topic of concern to cities. And perhaps something other
than the 2:15 p.m. time slot he was offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a legitimate role for me on the rostrum, I'll be
happy to do that,'' he said. ``But just to put me up there to
settle some old bill is not necessary. For three minutes?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brown's colleagues were surprised he was not given a
more prominent role at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the former speaker of the California Assembly, he's the
mayor of San Francisco,'' said former state Assembly Speaker
Antonio Villaraigosa, who is now running for mayor of Los Angeles.
``I think that three minutes at 2:15 is not an appropriate
indication of his stature and his achievements for the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is forbidden by city law from serving another term as
mayor, said his 36-year political career ``isn't even close to
being over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he did not have a prominent speaking role, Brown was
active at the convention, which concluded Thursday. He accepted
every chance to appear on national television. And while he skipped
the morning breakfasts with California delegates, he was a featured
speaker before the Massachusetts and South Carolina delegations.
</P>
<P>
   Brown insisted he was not avoiding the limelight. An early Gore
supporter, the mayor said he is doing much of his work for the vice
president behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a lower profile, it's a more practical way
for me to help,'' he said. For example, Gore aides have urged him
to do all the news internviews can. ``I'm being given the green
light to go do CNN and you and everybody else, all on message, and
I'm doing that. So I'm playing my role.''

PEDRO PRONOUNCES HIMSELF READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM KALEC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez knew the countdown to an extremely
important game of catch rested on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When the portable timer attached to the large bag of ice on
Martinez's arm hit 0:00, the Red Sox ace grabbed his glove and
headed toward the field to try to discover what happened to his arm
Monday night in the Red Sox' 7-3 win against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems in good spirits,'' manager Jimy Williams said before
Martinez took to the field for warmups. ``He has to go out there
and find out something for himself. He has to go throw long catch.
I don't know if he necessarily has to get up there and throw a side
session, but I think by playing catch, he would certainly know.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He needs) to just be honest with himself. We all know he
wants to pitch, loves to pitch. We want him to pitch every fifth
day or whatever it is, but we don't want to jeopardize his career,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams's concern was replaced with the comforting feeling of
knowing when Martinez's turn in the rotation comes up Saturday
against Texas, he will be physically ready to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Cy Young Award winner threw long tosses between the
420-foot mark in center field and the 380-foot mark in right field
to pitching coach Joe Kerrigan for approximately 10 minutes.
Martinez then went into the bullpen to throw briefly before
returning to the clubhouse to give Williams an estimation on how
serious was the pain in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's verdict pleased Williams so much that the Red Sox
skipper felt the need to answer a question nobody asked when he
emerged from the dugout to start batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to go,'' Williams said, referring to Martinez, with
enthusiasm to a couple of reporters sitting in the Red Sox dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine, I feel optimistic right now and I think I
am going to be out there on Saturday,'' Martinez said. ``Like I
said, it was probably something that was (just) one day. I know I
was fine in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel fine. I just threw my pitches, threw
everything over pretty good, just like a normal game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez will keep taking anti-inflamatory medication and
receive massage therapy. He insisted that further treatment is
nothing more than just precautionary measures, and if he were to
rate his health it would be ``100 perecent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm feeling like before I took this (last) start,''
Martinez said. ``So, I hope I'm just fine. Now, if I feel something
then I am probably going to be concerned or checking about it. But
I don't expect to be the way I was the last time out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Martinez pulled himself out as he pointed to his
shoulder while looking into the Red Sox dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has been on the 15-day disabled list twice in his
Boston career, the first because of soreness in his right shoulder
July 24, 1999. Pain in his oblique muscle suffered in June caused
Martinez to miss another two weeks of action earlier this season _
an injury he compares to his recent setback. ``It was the same
feeling, that is why I decided to shut it down,'' Martinez said.
``The other time took me to the DL and I didn't want to go through
that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to feel so free (yesterday in warmups),''
Martinez said. ``As soon as I threw the first ball I was ready to
let it go. I didn't feel anything probleming me or holding me.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said if there were pain, he would consider pitching
through it because of the lack of games remaining in the regular
season. But he explained that he would not pitch if he felt he
could cause long-term damage to his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the experience I had back in those days I probably would
have pulled something because I would have tried to pitch because I
didn't know,'' Martinez said. ``It took me seven years to miss a
start. I didn't believe in any pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Martinez has nothing to hide. He says he honestly
does feel fine and is ready to face Texas at Fenway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was free and easy and it looked like his delivery was very
much back to normal,'' Kerrigan said. ``He looked like Pedro.''

DESPITE CRITICISM, BLEDSOE IS GETTING LITTLE HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It was in Canton, Ohio, during Hall of Fame
induction week that the answer to your Drew Bledsoe riddle was
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The hints came from Joe Montana, the greatest quarterback of all
time. He was asked about his greatness, his magical nature, his
elusiveness, his penchant for comebacks and dramatics _ what was
the essential reason why he was so great?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had great receivers, I had a running game, I had a great
offensive line, and I was in a system that was made for me,''
Montana said. ``The rest was up to me. If I've had any success,
it's due to the people who played in front of me and around me.'
</P>
<P>
   Check out Brett Favre, a three-time MVP. As soon as the talent
around him was depleted, his game suffered. John Elway? Always a
great quarterback, but it was only after the Broncos added the best
offensive line in the business to go along with the best tight end
(Shannon Sharpe) and the best running back (Terrell Davis) that
Elway was able to win two consecutive Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe in 1996? Pretty good offensive line and running back
(Curtis Martin), a great tight end (Ben Coates), and excellent
receivers (Terry Glenn and Shawn Jefferson). The result? A Super
Bowl appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Montana tells us a quarterback cannot do it all. But if Bledsoe
were to stand on the podium after Patriots practice and complain
that he has an unsettled offensive line, a shallow receiving corps,
a tight end problem, and no real running game _ so how in the world
can he get the job done? _ he'd be ridiculed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those are the facts. Sometime between now and the
regular-season opener Sept. 3, the level of play around Bledsoe, as
well as his own play, must improve for the offense to be able to be
in synch with a defense that should be the team's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect us to be explosive,'' said Bledsoe. ``I expect us to
score points on people. To do that we have to have individuals make
big plays and be consistent in our passing game. We have to start
picking up third downs, and when we have a chance to hit the big
play, we've got to hit it. That's what I expect to happen. If it
doesn't, I'd be dissapointed and surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe certainly has heard his critics. He's gone from
superhero (when he won two games in the final seconds two years ago
with a broken finger) to ostensible league MVP (the first half of
last year) to a quarterback nobody could recognize (by the time the
dust of a 2-6 second half of last season had settled).
</P>
<P>
   His detractors say he should be able to do it on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anyone who could do it all by himself,'' said
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition season, Bledsoe has had one bad half (which is
the only measureable time he's had on the field), in the 30-20 loss
to the Redskins last Friday. But then he came out and completed 9
of 10 in the second half, though he threw an interception that
would have given him a second touchdown in as many drives.
</P>
<P>
   When Bledsoe isn't going right, the entire nation of Patriots
followers begins to panic. You hear that Bledsoe can't do this and
that, that he can't lead the Patriots. Bring on Michael Bishop.
Trade Bledsoe for draft picks. The stream of negativity never ends.
So many Boston superstars have endured it when they haven't lived
up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's my coach and me (saying it), it means something,''
Bledsoe said. ``It's obvious the turnovers are unacceptable. They
are 100 percent my responsibility, but there are some things that
come into play. What I'm disappointed in is third-down conversion.
If you can get into a shorter third-down situation, you can pick
them up. If it's third and 10 or 12, we'll have to make some plays
in the regular season to get the first down. We have to do it to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe has a running game, he'll often get to face the less
formidable challenge of third and short. If he doesn't, he'll be
backpedaling on third and long, likely running for his life and
being forced to rush his throw. That's been the trend, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said he's concerning himself with running backs Kevin
Faulk and Raymont Harris right now. If J.R. Redmond, who is
supposed to play Sunday vs. Tampa Bay, becomes a factor, ``then
I'll concern myself with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Never one to rock the boat, Bledsoe didn't express outrage at
Vincent Brisby's parting, instead saying, ``I'm very comfortable
with Troy (Brown) and Terry (Glenn). I don't know Tony (Simmons) as
well, but he's a guy who's going to be out there a lot and we have
to develop something between us. (Chris) Calloway is also someone
I'm looking forward to throwing the ball to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe loves the two-minute, no-huddle offense, but he knows it
would be taxing on his offense to do it all game. But in spots,
Bledsoe would love to implement it. Part of it depends on center
Damien Woody being able to make the snap properly, which allows
Bledsoe to set up properly. It's been a problem in the exhibition
season, and coach Bill Belichick has threatened that if Woody
doesn't get more fluid while still being able to make his block,
the team will scrap the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do it and use the shotgun until it becomes a
problem,'' said Bledsoe, who earlier in his career felt
uncomfortable with it. ``It has been a problem in preseason games,
but if we can get through the next two without any problems with
the shotgun snaps, we'll use it. I prefer to be in the shotgun
because it gives me more separation in the rush. It improves my
field of vision. It's something we need to be able to do, but not
at the expense of creating turnovers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite looking chaotic at times, Bledsoe said, the offense ``is
getting close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terminology has come back rather quickly,'' he said.
``That's the No. 1 thing: You have to learn and be accustomed to
the language. As far as what we're trying to do this week, and with
the short week next week, we're moving toward fine-tuning how we're
going to use our personnel. Now we're moving closer to which things
we're going to use. With Vincent gone, that changes things.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe could, he would tell the fans to relax. It is only
the exhibition season. There are other teams around the league
having miserable times getting their offenses going, too, because
defenses generally are ahead of offenses now.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he cannot take the pounding of 50-something sacks, as he
did a year ago. He can't have Bruce Smith drill him on the first
play of a game, as he did in last week's exhibition in Washington,
setting the tone for the game and putting the thought in Bledsoe's
head that he must rush his throws so he won't eat the ball. On
Sunday he'll be watching Warren Sapp closely.
</P>
<P>
   Those are things Bledsoe will never bring up. He'll never blame
a soul. He will keep it all inside and take the beating from not
only the opposition but his own fans as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go. I'm excited about it,'' he said. ``At this
point in my career, it's hard to get up for exhibition games, but
this one I am. We open the season against these guys and we have a
chance to get the upper hand going into that game. I'm excited.''

<P>
   Once in a lifetime comes a novel like ``Beach Blanket
Blockbuster,'' which is just as well, because there are so many
books like it already on the shelves, novels rife with triumph and
tragedy, peopled by characters who cope with human experiences,
wrestle with human emotions, and yet, through it all, still manage
to be something less than human.
</P>
<P>
   So brace yourself for ``Beach Blanket Blockbuster,'' the novel
everyone is reading this summer, or trying to read but never
finishing. It's the perfect summer book, because once you put it
down you never want to pick it up again.
</P>
<P>
   (``Lush, soporific.'' Publishers Weekly)
</P>
<P>
   It's a compelling tale of passion and intrigue, a grand and
sprawling account of how one desperate woman defied the odds to
write a novel that will be remembered as the book few people ever
managed to actually read in the summer of 2000, but one that proved
useful in so many surprising, life-enhancing ways _ as an eyeshade,
a cake stand, a pasta press, a 5-pound free weight, a headrest, a
bookmark cosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beach Blanket Blockbuster'' tells the story of a woman who
ruthlessly seizes her future by the throat and throws together a
novel that will tug at your heartstrings, fire your imagination,
knock you down, pick you up again and leave you asking, ``What was
that all about?''

   They said it couldn't be done. Or did they say it shouldn't be
done? It doesn't matter because she went ahead and did it anyway,
in spite of whatever it was they said. And she did it alone,
almost, with only the help of one of her multiple personalities,
Dee Dee, sometime advice columnist and full-time know-it-all.
</P>
<P>
   It's a white-hot story of romance, intrigue, and betrayal set in
the high stakes world of contemporary publishing, where authors'
egos are eviscerated and profit prevails over passion, except on
the dustjackets.
</P>
<P>
   (``Three thumbs up!!!'' The author's mother.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a saga of obsession, sabotage, and superstition in the
scorching tradition of every trashy bestseller you ever imagined
and then some. Teeming with all sorts of stuff, it's something
you'll immediately forget, and be glad you did, especially since
it's soon to be a major made-for-TV movie starring Tea Leoni, Neve
Campbell, Rhys Ifans, Udo Kier, Piper Perabo and a lot of other
actors whose names you have no idea how to pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the characters:
</P>
<P>
   The Author. Her novel has everything it takes to soar to the top
of bestseller lists including the three big ``S's'': sex, shopping,
and submarines. When she confronts the mysteries of her past lives
she discovers a fourth ``S,'' a secret that may prove her undoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Agent. A basically decent woman possessed by evil spirits
who refuses to settle for anything less than 20 percent. She
wrestles with her conscience daily, and wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Publisher. The company's plans to build an underwater
printing plant off the coast of exclusive Palm Beach hits a snag
when the Bureau of Fisheries and Wildlife Management declares the
area a publishing-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Bookseller. She learned life's lessons the hard way _ she
read about them. Will she be able to unload all those copies of
``Beach Blanket Blockbuster'' by summer's end?

&HT;     REPORTER CLEARED OF CONTEMPT THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Supreme Court has lifted the
threat of contempt of court from a reporter who refused to answer a
prosecutor's questions in a Marin County murder case. But the
court's action left news organizations fearful of a possible new
breach in California's shield law for journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously denied review of an appellate decision
in May that overturned a judge's contempt order and $1,000-a-day
fine against Dan Fost, now a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
The dispute involved an article Fost wrote about the murder case in
1997, when he worked for the Marin Independent Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Fost's lawyer, joined by an attorney representing several
newspapers and the California Newspaper Publishers Association,
said the ruling could jeopardize other reporters and asked the
state's high court to withdraw it as a precedent for other cases.
The court declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The murder case involved Darrell Hunter's trial for the shooting
death of Ronnie Small at a party in Marin City. Prosecution witness
Shayla Davis testified she had seen only one man break into the
apartment, but Fost quoted her as telling him three or four men had
burst in.
</P>
<P>
   Called as a defense witness, Fost said he had quoted Davis
accurately. But when the prosecutor tried to cross-examine him
about the circumstances of the interview, Fost refused to answer,
citing the shield law, which prohibits reporters from being held in
contempt for refusing to disclose confidential sources or
unpublished material.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge John Sutro held Fost in contempt of court
but was overruled by the 1st District Court of Appeal, which said
Sutro had failed to make the findings required to overcome a
reporter's protection under the shield law: that the evidence is
needed to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial and could
not be obtained from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   But the court also said a reporter might be required to answer a
prosecution's questions in a future case.
</P>
<P>
   If a reporter answers defense questions about a published
article and then refuses to answer the prosecutor's questions about
unpublished material, the prosecutor can ask the judge to strike
the earlier testimony from the case and deprive the defense of
evidence, Presiding Justice J. Anthony Kline said in the 3-0
ruling.

`SPINSTER FICTION' PUTS ON A NEW FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MONICA L. WILLIAMS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
RACHEL'S HOLIDAY 
By Marian Keyes 
Morrow, 624 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics weren't too kind to Marian Keyes the last time around.
Her second novel, ``Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married,'' a success
with book buyers, was a failure with reviewers. Her eponymous
heroine was quickly labeled a poor clone of Helen Fielding's
irresistible Bridget Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But Keyes knew that Fielding was on to something. Publishers
were scrambling to turn out tales of the badly behaving
30-something single woman. This fashionable ``spinster fiction''
was a roaring success, and Keyes, Melissa Bank, Jane Green, and
others cashed in on the discovery, even if the publishing
industry's answer to Ally McBeal was more fun than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of Bridget resurface in Keyes's latest work, ``Rachel's
Holiday,'' a hilarious but poignant novel that is already a
bestseller in England. While ``Rachel's Holiday'' is not the usual
frantic-single-woman comedy, it is a coming-of-age journey of love
and self-discovery. This first-person narrative gives a
behind-the-scenes glimpse at life in a drug rehabilitation center.
The protagonist, Rachel Walsh, has a penchant for recreational
drugs and recreational sex, especially with men sporting tight
leather pants. Like the predecessors of her genre, Rachel is a hip
single woman who spends inordinate amounts of time obsessing over
men and weight. But for her, life in the fast lane is a bit too
slow. Luckily, New York City is the perfect place for the
transplant from Dublin to indulge _ or overindulge. But 2 1/2 years
after moving to New York, Rachel gets a painful lesson in what it
means to have too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   When she wakes up in a hospital emergency room to find herself
diagnosed as a suicidal drug addict, she is outraged. As if being
dumped by her wonderful boyfriend were not enough, her quirky
family flies in from Dublin to hustle her straight to the
Cloisters, Ireland's equivalent of the Betty Ford Clinic. She is
furious at the idea of being institutionalized with a bunch of
addicts, but admits that her life had a way of veering out of
control. ``I had long stopped believing that the God who had been
assigned to me was a benign old guy with long hair and a beard. He
was more like a celestial stand-up comic, and my life was the
showcase he used to amuse the other gods.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad could the Cloisters be? Hundreds of rock stars had been
admitted to the converted monastery to go tepid turkey. Maybe it
would be OK to leave New York for a life of steam rooms, Jacuzzis,
massage, mud wraps, and fruit salad. And, of course, the Cloisters
would have a gym where she could tone up the abs. Maybe people like
her, the ones without serious substance abuse problems, could
wander down in the evenings to the local pub.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of seaweed and saunas, though, Rachel gets chores at the
crack of dawn, tubby middle-aged men in brown acrylic sweaters,
hours of excruciating group therapy, and quarters more like a
Dickensian orphanage than a luxury spa. She's ready to make her
great escape until she meets sweet, wonderful Chris. Chris has a
complicated past, but his chlorine-blue eyes and earnest manner are
enough to make Rachel believe she may have met her perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes's third novel is her most serious, and yet her funniest.
She deftly builds on the characters introduced in ``Watermelon,''
her grand first novel. Her touch in ``Rachel's Holiday'' is
sometimes heavier, and the narrative is a bit long, but what easily
could have been a grim shelf-warmer turns out to be a delightful
page turner, propelled by its unforgettable heroine and her
supporting cast of eccentric sidekicks. Readers will grow to love
the exasperating and beguiling heroine as Rachel finds her way
through her bittersweet self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   After 600 pages and months of drug rehab, readers may expect a
dynamic denouement. This is where Keyes falls short. Instead, the
ending is a bit too convenient and predictable. A marvelous journey
is disappointingly wrapped up in a one-page epilogue.

DODGING THE ONCOMING BRITNEY BANDWAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have tickets to take your 6- or 7- or 8- or 9-year-old
daughter to see Britney Spears, throw them away and think of it as
money well-spent in the effort to reclaim your daughter's
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Spears's lyrics are so bad; they're suggestive but
not immoral or evil. Her bumps, grinds, and pouts are provocative
but not over the edge. Even her clothes, which often do go over the
edge, can also be schoolgirl All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: If her peppiness, catchy tunes, and
wholesome clothes tell 7-year-olds, ``I'm just like you!'' what do
her vampy outfits say? If a 6-year-old can see that whatever Spears
does translates to lots of attention and therefore is cool, can she
also understand that sexy is just one of many ways for a female to
be, along with kind or strong or smart?
</P>
<P>
   No way, say psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   Girls under 10 don't have the cognitive equipment to decode the
subtleties of Spears's messages or movements. All that time they
spend watching her videos, singing her songs and dressing like her?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because they're confused. In very basic ways, they can't
make sense of Britney, so they put all this energy into trying to
figure her out,'' says early childhood educator Diane Levin of
Wheelock College.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to perhaps an even more serious problem. In idolizing
Spears, young fans may be skipping an immportant developmental
phase of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus on her takes time away from what girls this age
typically work on: friendship, values, and safe, altruistic,
heartfelt love,'' says psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair of the
Harvard University Eating Disorders Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Moreno of North Andover, who is a proud 6 3/4, doesn't see
it that way, of course. ``I like Britney because she looks pretty
and she writes down nice music,'' she says. ``I like the clothes
she wears and her style. I like her movements. I'd like to be like
her when I grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes her mother cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when my daughter is developing her sense of who she
is, I worry she's getting a warped view of what it means to be a
girl,'' says Bridget Moreno. (Conscious of this, she's careful to
set limits around what Emily absorbs of pop culture: There's no
unsupervised TV, for instance, and no cable.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being a girl
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Learning what it means to be a girl is a process that begins in
the toddler years when a child imitates behaviors of the same-sex
parent. At 4 and 5, cause-and-effect enters her thinking: ``I'm a
girl because I wear a dress.'' At 6 or 7, a girl is still partially
in that place, says developmental psychologist Elizabeth Debold, a
gender development researcher in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's looking for extreme examples of what it means to be a
girl to accentuate the differences between boys and girls,'' she
says. ``That's why Barbie is so popular at this age and why Britney
is, too. In that sense, Britney and Barbie fit the same mold.''
Indeed, there is a Britney Spears Barbie doll.
</P>
<P>
   What also fuels girls' interest is that Spears is marketed
directly at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since `Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles,' there's been a
steady escalation of marketing teenage issues to young children,''
says Levin, who is the author of ``Remote Control Childhood?''
(NAEYC Press).
</P>
<P>
   In the process, adults have come to accept as normal what once
upset and shocked us, including the marketing of sexuality to young
children. Which can explain why plenty of responsible, caring
parents might buy tickets to a Britney Spears concert.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stamp of approval
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking our daughter to a concert, though, isn't just a matter of
buying into the cultural escalation, says Levin; it's also giving
her a giant, personal ``This-is-for-you-honey'' stamp of approval.
Because we're so important to young children, that can add to the
pressure a girl already feels.
</P>
<P>
   The culture is telling her ``to think that the way to gain
attention is by how you look, not by how you relate to others,''
says psychologist Linda Hartling of the Centers for Women at
Wellesley College. She specializes in risk prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a girl skips the step when she learns she's capable of
having relationships because she's a kind, caring person, she's
more susceptible later on to thinking that a sexy body is what she
needs for a relationship,'' says Hartling.
</P>
<P>
   This also is typically the age when a girl begins to discover
the athletic power in her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sees she can run like the wind or jump rope five times
through the alphabet,'' says Steiner-Adair. ``This enables a girl
to see her body as a whole entity, not as body parts.'' It's an
important developmental step, she says, because it gives girls a
broad relationship to their body.
</P>
<P>
   Spears crowds this out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She pushes them to tune in to body parts instead of the
whole,'' says Steiner-Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Moreno sees it happen when Emily looks in the mirror and
says, ``My thighs are fat.'' Steiner-Adair hears it in young girls'
conversations about whether Spears has had a ``boob job,'' a hot
topic among radio DJs. ``That girls this age even have this on
their radar screen is a distortion of childhood,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Preoccupation with looks
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The preoccupation with how you look may account for the onset of
eating disorders in 10- and 11-year-old girls, researchers say, as
well as an increase in early onset of other risky behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10-year-old in a belly-shirt who looks sexy is putting
herself out there in a way that says to men and boys, `I'm ready to
go,' '' says educator Amy P. Vorenberg , a veteran third-grade
teacher and now head of the lower school at the Shady Hill School
in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The younger a girl is when she begins to internalize the
message, the more power it has over her. ``They don't have the
intellectual capacity to argue with themselves, so it's absorbed
more deeply,'' says Debold. She is the author of ``Mother-Daughter
Revolution'' (Bantam).
</P>
<P>
   Steiner-Adair urges parents to shield young girls from exposure
to Spears or anyone like her for as long as possible.
Unfortunately, as Bridget Moreno has seen, exposure often occurs in
spite of our vigilance. ``Britney is part of children's social
currency,'' says Vorenberg. Even if it's not on your TV set, ``it's
on the playground and in the backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, there are ways to blunt the impact:
</P>
<P>
   --Say no. Even if she puts up a fuss, ``A girl 6 to 9 will be
satisfied and deep down inside, relieved, to have you say, `This is
too grown up for you,' '' says Steiner-Adair.
</P>
<P>
   --Find positive things to say about Spears: ``I can see why kids
think she's cool; she's so young and so upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't censor her completely _ ``I'm not saying you can't sing
her songs, they're really catchy'' _ but set clear limits. Moreno,
for instance, won't let Emily buy belly-shirts or CDs.
</P>
<P>
   --Watch your tone. ``You don't want to have a lot of heat in
your voice,'' says Steiner-Adair. ``Children will tune out.''
</P>
<P>
   If you decide you aren't going to take your daughter to the
concert, for sure there will be unhappiness to tolerate, and for
sure, it will be hard to take. Steiner-Adair's advice is to tell
her you've made a mistake and you're sorry: `` `I didn't realize I
was taking you to see someone who is so sexy; she's icky. After you
stop being disappointed, let's find something else to do together.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Vorenberg urges parents to have deliberate conversations about
what it means to be a strong and powerful girl.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno had one one night recently as she tucked Emily into bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, I don't think I'm innocent,'' her daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Moreno recognized that as a line from Spears's song,
``Oops! . . . I Did It Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her being innocent was a good thing,'' she says. ``That
it means you aren't guilty of doing anything bad and that you can
look at nature and appreciate it. And then I told her, `In that
song, she's playing with a person's emotions, pretending to be a
friend when she isn't. That's not a quality I want in my friends.
What about you?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a conversation that was exactly developmentally where her
daughter ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRITNEY TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --By 10 or 11, interest in Britney Spears tends to wane (or not
ignite) because a girl either sees how unreal Spears is _ ``Nobody
is that perfect'' _ or is frightened by her: ``Is this how I have
to be?''
</P>
<P>
   --Because Britney Spears is young enough, at 18, to be a girl's
father's daughter, fathers who say she's sexy or talk about her
(``I heard she had breast implants'') give young girls a confusing
and scary message.
</P>
<P>
   --Expose your daughters to varied female role models.
</P>
<P>
   --Learn something about Spears so you can help your daughter see
her as a real person. For instance, ``She's been dancing since she
was 3 and spent her life doing talent shows and TV commercials; I
wonder what that's like?''
</P>
<P>
   --Ask your daughter why she likes Britney: ``What attracts you
to her? Is it her energy? Her confidence? Her clothes?''
</P>
<P>
   --Have conversations with a son, even if he doesn't like Spears:
``Our culture makes such a big deal about sexiness and bodies that
I want to make sure you know that I think it's never OK to like a
girl just for the way she looks.''
</P>
<P>
   --Get to know the parents of your daughter's friends so your
girls are all getting similar messages about Spears and the values
she represents.

   Q. I have a small night light that plugs directly into an
outlet, but one of its prongs is a little wider than its neighbor,
so it is difficult to plug it in. Can I file it down to match the
smaller one, so it will fit?
</P>
<P>
   G.S., Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No. The prongs are a different width to make sure the light
is plugged in the correct way to maintain polarity. It is not a
good idea to trim down a prong. Besides, if you find you cannot
push the light into the socket, turn it 180 degrees and try again.
If the outlet is not really, really old, the prongs will fit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wall shingles are 70 years old and not curling. The paint
is thick and cracked, but there is no peeling. I have heard of a
Power Shaver, an electric tool for scraping paint. Or should I
pressure-wash? I want to repaint, but not necessarily get down to
the bare wood.
</P>
<P>
   JOAN KASPRIK, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The Power Shaver or a good, coarse power-sanding is your best
bet. Either method will get down to bare wood or just take off some
of the paint. Then you can prime and paint, and hope it lasts
another umpteen years.
</P>
<P>
   Power washing is good for some projects, but not for yours,
because it will not remove paint that is intact, only loose stuff.
And, there is a chance of water saturating the wood; you would have
to wait several days for this water to evaporate. Power washing can
also get water behind the shingles; if that happens, they could
take months to dry out, and in the meantime the shingles could rot
out from that steady moisture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The ceramic tiles on my concrete bathroom floor are 4 by 4
inches, and when I walk I hear a popping sound. They are installed
with thin-set mortar. What is this popping sound, and how can I
stop it? Is it dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   KATHRYN JOHNSON, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Some of the tiles are loose, and that popping sound is a
double click, the sound of your foot hitting the tile, then the
tile hitting the floor. It is not dangerous, especially since the
tiles are on concrete. If they were on a wood floor, that floor
could leak water.
</P>
<P>
   You can live with them until you are ready to chip out the
grout; lift the tiles; scrape off grout and old thin-set mortar
from the tile and floor; apply new thin-set, a bit thicker than
originally; and relay the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   If some of the loose tiles are around the toilet, you will have
to lift the toilet before lifting the tiles underneath. When you
are ready to have the toilet put back, it will need a new wax ring.
So, call your friendly plumber.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I spilled gasoline on my mother-in-law's asphalt driveway. It
created a circle darker than the asphalt. Soap and water did no
good. Is there anything I can do to disguise the mark?
</P>
<P>
   S.D., Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There must be a law in heaven that says you always hurt the
ones you love. I know I am not innocent, either, but can't think of
any incidents, except when my daughter ran over her cousin's
motorcycle. That's nothing, except that the car was a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if your mother-in-law is taking it in stride or
doesn't even know about it, so your attitude is admirable. The
gasoline is long gone, but the stain remains. It might weather out
over a few months. Or, put down a driveway sealer _ which the
handyman has often contended is mostly cosmetic. You have to do the
whole driveway, though; just a section will make Ma suspicious.
Regardless, she is going to say, ``Now why is he doing that?''
Trying to spray-paint the spot to lighten it up will end in
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is 18 years old and the basement is damp. How can I
keep it dry, except with a dehumidifier?
</P>
<P>
   EILEEN ZELLER, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. On damp days, when the humidity is sky high outdoors as well
as in, is the time to use the dehumidifier, usually in July and
August. All the rest of the time, and on dry days, ventilate,
ventilate, ventilate: Open windows, screen and secure them, and
leave them open in May, June, September, and October. Put a fan in
a window to get the moist air out. Air conditioning will also work
because it is a dehumidifier, but is not practical unless the
basement is lived in.

 FOREIGN INVADERS THREATEN NATIVE SPECIES IN THE WILD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all people, gardeners know best how quickly plants can get
out of control.
</P>
<P>
   We've all had plants that took advantage of our hesitant
hospitality. There's that multiflora rosebush that sprouted
unbidden and was such a hit with the mockingbirds that you let it
stay, and now it's big and thorny enough to guard Sleeping Beauty's
castle. Meanwhile, baby rose canes are reaching out to grab you
from every unpatroled niche, spread by those ungrateful
mockingbirds.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you tell an overly aggressive and invasive plant from
a desirable one?
</P>
<P>
   This is not an easy question. You don't have to graduate from
West Point to be able to weed a garden, but you do need to be able
to recognize the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the most important war on weeds today is being
waged not in our yards but in conservation land and along
shorelines, where invasive species are taking over about 10 million
acres nationally each year. ``An average of 40 percent of the
vegetation in Massachusetts now is invasive species,'' said Sharon
McGregor of the state's Executive Office of Environmental Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible example of this is the miles of purple
loosestrife in bloom in many of our wetlands. Twenty years ago
these were diverse habitats, then almost overnight, they became
solid purple.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like `The Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' '' said Tim
Simmons, a restoration ecologist with the state's Natural Heritage
and Endangered Species Program. ``Overnight you realize you have a
problem. We don't know when a new plant that existed in sparse
amounts will suddenly explode. They seem to reach a critical mass
and go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking in most woods near a highway today and you'll find
yourself tripping on honeysuckle and bittersweet vines busy
smothering trees, or being stuck by increasingly impenetrable
thickets of thorny multiflora roses, buckthorns, and Japanese
barberries. Bamboo-like Japanese knotweed has been around for 100
years, but in the last 10 it's spread to every major river system
in Massachusetts. Like the worst invasives, it pushes out all other
vegetation, rendering natural areas useless for most wildlife and
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   One irony is that many of these invaders originated in our own
gardens. We usually think of our garden plants as fragile,
cultivated creatures under relentless attack from wild weeds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No enemies here
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the opposite is also true. The wild plants of forest and
field are being overwhelmed by some of the most aggressive
cultivated plants, especially those imported from other parts of
the world that don't have insects and diseases here to keep them in
check.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this truer than among homes close to conservation
land and waterways. It's a status symbol today to clear a lot and
build a house snug against protected land so you don't have to
worry about other builders impacting your privacy and natural view.
But the plants landscaping these new homes pose a threat to those
very natural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every new home that goes in gets two Norway maples, three
Japanese barberries, and four burning bushes,'' said Chris
Mattrick, an invasive plant specialist with the New England Wild
Flower Society in Framingham, Mass., citing three common nursery
plants he sees as threats to native plant communities because of
their aggressive self-seeding.
</P>
<P>
   But won't nature just find a new balance? After all, most of our
ancestors weren't native to these shores either. Isn't this just
evolution?
</P>
<P>
   These are actually profound questions, because what's happening
to southern New England's wild areas is happening all over the
world as global trade facilitates the spread of species.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Learning from Hawaii
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To put it simply, some ecologists think we may end up with the
same plants, animals, and bugs all over the world, as the toughest
arrivals invade new areas and overwhelm the daintier local flora
and fauna, as has already happened in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, plants from India and Brazil are not going to take
over Boston because the climate is different. Most of the invasive
life-forms we see here are from similar temperate regions such as
Northern Europe, China, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   What's undesirable about this scenario, of course, is mass
extinctions. The world would become an even more homogenized place,
with a relatively few supersuccessful species circling the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would there be a Gap store at every mall, but Norway
maples in every forest, which, locally speaking, would be a letdown
for people who like the orange fall foliage of our retreating
native sugar maples, not to mention maple syrup on their pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   The most hopeful strategy is to import some natural enemies of
invasives. This is called ``biological control,'' and it's a
growing field, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lythrum-eating beetles
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lythrum, or loosestrife, is native to Europe, and Bernd Blossey
at Cornell University has imported two beetles that eat lythrum
there and have begun eating it here. Should widespread release of
the beetles win USDA approval, they are predicted to bring lythrum
under control _ in several decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, what can gardeners do to help protect
wild areas in their neighborhoods?
</P>
<P>
   They can remove invasive plants from their properties so they
aren't jumping-off points, said Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   He advises homeowners to get rid of their multiflora rose,
Norway maple, Oriental bittersweet, porcelain berry, Morrow's
honeysuckle, as well as Tatarian, Amur and Japanese honeysuckles,
burning bush, also known as winged euonymus, Japanese knotweed,
autumn olive, black locust, black swallowwort, common and Japanese
barberry (including those colored varieties), common and glossy
buckthorn, garlic mustard, goutweed, also known as bishop's-weed,
purple loosestrife, and yellow water iris (Iris pseudocorus).
</P>
<P>
   Other plants Simmons suggests gardeners avoid, as they may
eventually become problems here, include kiwi vine, rugosa rose,
Japanese and common hedge privet, Japanese hops, creeping
buttercup, chervil (Anthriscus sylvestris), Lysimachia nummularia,
silver lace vine, sycamore maple, tree of heaven, wild thyme, white
mulberry and Western catalpa trees, and Myosotis scorpioides.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable habitats
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some people telling me they can't even grow some of
these plants, so how can they be a problem? It depends on where you
live and the types of habitats around you. Flood plains, woodlands,
and wetlands are particularly vulnerable,'' said Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, individuals dumping yard wastes in natural areas are a
real problem,'' Simmons added.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these plants also have berries that are spread by birds,
but a recent Illinois study indicates that nesting is less
successful in landscapes dominated by invasives, said Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Mattrick calls buckthorn berries ``junk food for birds because
they're sweet, but they have little nutritional value. They just go
right through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Invasives are supertough, so just occasional cutting back
usually only encourages their roots to grow larger and the plants
more vigorous, said Mattrick. The root must be killed.
</P>
<P>
   If a plant is too large to pull by hand, the best way to uproot
medium-size shrubs and small trees is with a weed wrench, a large
lever that almost effortlessly pops the entire root systems of
honeysuckles, buckthorns, and barberries out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Invasives can come back to life after you think you've killed
them, so don't toss them aside. They will probably just reroot. And
don't add them to usable compost piles. ``Just create a separate
pile for them where you can check them occasionally for rerooting.
Or let them cook in black plastic trash bags for a month in the sun
until they turn to mush,'' advised Mattrick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Recommended herbicides
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herbicides are the easiest way to kill roots, and any homeowner
is free to apply herbicides on his or her property, provided
they're handled responsibly. The two herbicides that Mattrick
recommends are glyphosate and triclopyr. ``These get everything we
need to get done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Glyphosate, which breaks down into harmless molecules in 40 to
60 days, is the active ingredient in Monsanto's popular Round-Up,
the workhorse of herbicides, and Rodeo, which is safer to use
around wetlands. Triclopyr is the active ingredient in Weed-Be-Gone
and Brush-Be-Gone, which unlike glyphosate is effective on most
woody plants except Oriental bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattrick always wears hospital gloves inside elbow-length
pesticide gloves, eye protection, and a dust mask when spraying. He
also wears long pants and shirts with long sleeves, which are
washed separately from family laundry. He also carries an eye wash.
</P>
<P>
   Among the better tools are ``weed wands'' that allow you to
touch an herbicide-soaked sponge to herbaceous weeds such as
chervil and garlic mustard while standing.
</P>
<P>
   Chopping a few gashes into tree trunks in late fall when sap is
flowing back into the roots, then painting the wounds with
herbicide, is effective for large, problem trees such as buckthorn,
tree of heaven, black locust, and Norway maple.
</P>
<P>
   For the homeowner with a woodlot or a large problem there are
industrial strength tools such as ``hypohatchets,'' which can chop
gashes into the tree while injecting it with glyphosate, and the
``EZject,'' which drives small pellets of herbicide into tree
trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Ridding even a modest backyard of potentially invasive plants
can take years, warned Simmons. Though he spends his days
patrolling state lands for invasives, he says, ``I'm still in the
process of eradicating all these plants from my own yard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TOUGHEST OF THE TOUGH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Chris Mattrick and the State Division of Fisheries
and Wildlife's upcoming ``Guide to Invasive Plants in
Massachusetts'' (which, when published, will be available by
writing to the state's Natural Heritage and Endangered Species
Program, Route 135, Westborough, MA 01581), some of the most
difficult plants to kill include:
</P>
<P>
   --Barberry: These prickly plants must be pulled up by the roots.
Use a weed wrench for fully grown shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   --Buckthorn: Cut stems and apply herbicide to the stumps in
winter.
</P>
<P>
   --Garlic mustard: This garlic-smelling biennial with four white
petals outcompetes native wildflowers in shady woodlands. Hand-pull
or apply herbicide to rosettes of basal leaves during the winter,
and repeat for two to five years, as new seeds sprout.
</P>
<P>
   --Honeysuckles: Pull Lornicera morrowii, L. tatarica, L.
maackii, and L. xbella by hand or pull these shallow-rooted shrubs
with a weed wrench.
</P>
<P>
   --Japanese knotweed: A minimum of four cuttings for several
years are required to deplete underground rhizomes. Occasional
sporadic cutting back may be counterproductive. For faster results,
pour herbicide into the hollow canes after cutting.
</P>
<P>
   --Multiflora rose: It blooms once a year with clusters of many
white flowers, and produces tiny red hips. The stems look feathery
at the base of each leaflet. Hand-pull young plants. Use a machete,
not a chain saw, to cut through thorny branches to get to the trunk
in winter, when it can be pulled with a weed wrench, or cut and
paint the cut stem with herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   --Oriental bittersweet: This fast-growing vine can choke young
trees and smother vegetation, interfering with the natural
succession of forest regeneration. Because of its many underground
runners, it often requires the application of glyphosate to freshly
cut stems at the time of the first killing frost, usually in early
October, to destroy established plants. Because the bright-orange
berries are viable, do not use them in holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Purple loosestrife: Uproot when first seen because it is almost
impossible to remove once established. Each plant produces up to 2
million seeds. Nursery hybrids are not necessarily sterile.

BELLE OF THE BAWL: DOCUMENTARY LOOKS AT TAMMY FAYE WITH APPROVING
EYES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in this documentary, Tammy Faye Bakker Messner ruminates
on one of her many misfortunes, and predictably enough, the tears
flow and mascara runs. What's unexpected is the way filmmakers
Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey treat the moment: Rather than mock,
they're almost too earnest, letting Messner indulge in her sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   It's just sorrow, though, and not self-pity, and that's the
portrait ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' paints of Messner: a courageous
survivor who steadfastly declines to judge anyone who has wronged
her or to mourn the misfires in her past. It's a riches-to-rags
story, with the familiar arc of Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker's rise
with their PTL empire, their fall amid sexual and financial
scandals in the '80s, and Tammy Faye's recovery through her second
marriage to Bakker friend and aide Roe Messner, who would endure a
financial scandal of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Some early reviews have criticized this Sundance hit as too
kitschy, and with Messner, some kitsch was inevitable. But aside
from the sock puppets who, a la Babe, introduce the various
``chapters,'' the movie is a surprisingly respectful and
straightforward _ albeit hardly objective _ look at its subject.
Barbato and Bailey laud Tammy Faye for being among the first
televangelists to open the door to AIDS sufferers and homosexuals,
and portray ex-husband Jim Bakker as humble and penitent. Most
other people in the film are cast as opportunists, whether they be
Jessica Hahn (whose one-night stand with Jim Bakker helped lead to
his decline) or Jerry Falwell (whose takeover of PTL is portrayed
as hostile).
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Messner maintains a sense of humor and a refusal to
be seen as a victim. Barbato and Bailey's film may be lopsided, but
it remains eye-opening; in a climate in which the Bible is too
often quoted as a means to support mean-spiritedness, Messner
proves that there are still people who love not only their
neighbors, but their enemies as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JACO BEACH, Costa Rica _ Zach McDuffie had a degree from the
University of Georgia, a promising career at an Atlanta ad agency
and a rush-hour commute he couldn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped it all for a life in this Central American hideaway,
trading button-downs for baggies, his car for a surfboard, his
climb up the corporate ladder for free-form creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And he's loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here for a month the first time and fell in love
with Costa Rica,'' said McDuffie, 27. ``I went back to Atlanta and
was doing the I-285 commute, but I just kept dreaming about Costa
Rica. I finally came back to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie is one of an estimated 30,000 Americans and Canadians _
some believe the number might run as high as 70,000 _ who have been
lured to a life in this tropical oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little-known swath of mountains, jungle and beaches
sandwiched between the Caribbean and the Pacific, Costa Rica became
something of a '90s nirvana for those seeking escape, simplicity,
natural beauty and cheap living.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Nicaragua on the north and Panama on the south, the
country stands out among its neighbors, but mostly for good
reasons. In a region torn by dictatorships, drug trafficking and
political instability, Costa Rica has enjoyed free democratic
elections for decades.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors struggle to overcome poverty and illiteracy,
Costa Rica enjoys a 94 percent literacy rate and broad-based
economic prosperity with only 6 percent unemployment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While others lack basic sanitation and adequate health-care, 99
percent of Costa Rica's 3.6 million residents are served by piped
water and 90 percent receive public health services recognized as
among the best in the region. More than 90 percent have access to
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic measure of Costa Rica's
difference: the nation abolished its army in 1949 and plowed the
money into development and social services. That stunning move
earned Costa Rica the nickname, ``The Switzerland of Central
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In another far-reaching move, leaders also set aside huge chunks
of the gorgeous countryside, so that now nearly 25 percent of Costa
Rica's territory is protected as national parks or preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been everything I dreamed,'' McDuffie said. ``I'm
the happiest guy I know. It's such a different tempo here, a
different pace. All my dad's friends are mad at me, saying I
somehow managed to retire at 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in any paradise, there are a few potholes.
Literally. The roads, while better than in neighboring countries,
suffer washouts and sporadic repairs that make driving an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of foreigners has driven up real estate values, so
that prices in popular areas compare better to Miami than Managua.
The escalation has driven some would-be expatriates to look for
cheaper homesteads in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican crime has also shot up, with the high-profile
murders of two American college students in March triggering a bout
of unfavorable international publicity. There has also been a rash
of kidnappings, leading many Costa Ricans to ponder whether some of
the less-appealing aspects of modern life are catching up with
their paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreigners are still coming in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom started about 10 years ago,'' said Ryan Piercy,
manager of the Association of Residents of Costa Rica, a private
group that provides services to incoming foreigners. ``For a while,
our group was growing by 300 percent a year. Now it's evened out to
a steady 10 percent a year. But we're seeing a lot of young people.
A few years ago, it was mostly retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever visionary, Costa Rica's leaders years ago made it easy for
foreigners to move in. The law basically requires that would-be
residents have an income of US$600 per month and that they agree to
stay in Costa Rica at least four months each year.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can own businesses _ which means they often create
employment for native Costa Ricans, known as ``Ticos.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie spent several months traveling the country before
finally settling down in Jaco Beach, a surf town on the Pacific
coast about two-hours drive from the capital, San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   After casting around for opportunities, he decided to open a
school catering to the hordes of young backpacker tourists who have
made Costa Rica a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people who were going to language schools
in San Jose, and they were frustrated because they weren't seeing
the country,'' he said. ``So we designed a program that's hands-on
learning, with language, ecology, art and surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a struggle at times, but now in its third year,
McDuffie's ``Escuela del Mundo'' _ ``School of the World'' _ is a
growing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our students find out about us from the Internet,''
McDuffie said. ``That's been the key. I wouldn't have been able to
do this 10 years ago because nobody would've been able to find
us.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-pat who has found his place in Jaco Beach is Dave
Klostermann, who once ran a thriving but stressful swimming pool
construction business in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got fed up with high insurance rates, workers'
compensation, crime and traffic,'' he said. ``I was working harder
for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   After investigating Montana and Idaho, Klostermann , 40, came to
Costa Rica on a lark with a minister friend doing outreach work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been told by several friends that this was the place to
come with a grubstake to buy a big farm and just sit back and watch
property values go up,'' he said. ``I wanted a place that was
growing but safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that moving to Costa Rica is a
stress-free ticket to easy-street. Cars cost double what they do in
the United States. Most natives speak only Spanish. Petty theft is
a problem. Some natives grow resentful of ``gringos'' who open
businesses that compete with Tico shops.
</P>
<P>
   Klostermann wanted to open a construction business, but found
the market just wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he turned to his lifelong hobby: horses. It's taken
several years to establish his horse rental business, and along the
way there have been some spats with Ticos _ and other foreigners _
who run similar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But things are going well now, especially after a huge new
Marriott hotel opened nearby, bringing in corporate retreats and
large groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things you take for granted at home are harder
here,'' Klostermann said. ``Things like the power going out, and
Tico-brand washing machines. But it's a beautiful place with so
many things to do. I just hope they don't expand too much and ruin
what makes Costa Rica special.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While some people have found paradise and new careers near the
beach, Bob Miller came to Costa Rica to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an engineer and I came down here on a job about 30 years
ago and just loved the fact that instead of seeing guys with guns
everywhere like in other Latin countries, they didn't have an army
here,'' said Miller, 73. ``Back then, the cops were armed only with
pliers and screw drivers. If you did anything wrong, they took your
license plate and made you pay a fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his wife moved down permanently from Vancouver about
three years ago and now rent a house in the San Jose suburb of
Escazu. Along with thousands of other ex-pats in the San Jose area,
they have carved out a comfortable life, forming clubs, going to
movies, doing volunteer work and reading an English-language
newspaper, The Tico Times. There's now even a radio station
broadcasting in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet,'' Miller said. ``Every once in a while I hear a
cowbell, but that's about it. The cost of living is far lower than
in Canada, and we get full health coverage for only US$37 a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Piercy estimates that about 80 percent of the foreigners moving
to Costa Rica are retirees. His group offers monthly seminars on
everything from buying property to obtaining insurance and avoiding
scams. The sessions have grown so crowded _ 35 to 50 people _ that
he's considering adding a second seminar each month.
</P>
<P>
   But he recommends that would-be residents investigate carefully
before making such a big move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some people who have sold everything at home, moved
down here and signed contracts to buy a house in the first week,''
he said. ``Some of them have been burned. It's important to bring
your common sense just as if you were moving to Florida or
Arizona.''

YOU'LL LIKE WINDOWS ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 4 million of you purchased Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 98
operating system, and I'm still not sure why. That rather skimpy
upgrade to Windows 95 was absurdly overpriced at $89. But lots of
you paid it, so it's no surprise that Microsoft would try again,
next month, with Windows Millennium Edition, or Windows Me.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's different. There's a lower price _ $59 for
Windows 98 users, $89 for all others _ and, this time, value for
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Some rubbish, too. For a glimpse of Microsoft at its worst,
there's the built-in Movie Maker software, Microsoft's response to
Apple's marvelous iMovie video editing software, available free
with all new Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   iMovie is an advanced video editing suite that a beginner can
use without reading a manual. The new iMovie 2 is even better, with
features like multi-track audio dubbing thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's ersatz version is as satisfying as a plastic
corsage. Movie Maker's confusing user interface may have been
created on purpose, to keep the user from realizing how little the
program can do. For instance, it won't let you generate fancy
special effects for your videos, or even basic titles. For that,
you have to run Microsoft's ancient Paint program and import your
creations into the Movie Maker.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know _ by version 3.0, it'll be cool. But Apple got it
right the first time out. What's Microsoft's excuse?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their engineers were mastering the secret powers of my
boyhood hero, the Russian monk Grigori Rasputin. Historians today
dismiss the legend that Rasputin's murderers poisoned, shot,
bludgeoned and drowned the fellow before he finally gave up the
ghost. Still, it's a lovely story, which might have inspired a
Windows Me feature which guards the vital dynamic link library
files, or DLLs, that make Windows work.
</P>
<P>
   Most people will never deliberately alter a DLL file, but many
programs secretly fiddle with them, often with deadly results. I
recently trashed a laptop merely by installing AOL software on it;
several vital DLL files stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   But Windows Me locks down about 800 of these DLLs. If any
program tries to tinker with one of them, Windows Me preserves the
file from ruin.
</P>
<P>
   To test the system, I renamed a vital DLL. Within seconds the
original had reappeared. Then I tried deleting the file altogether.
It reappeared. I didn't try flinging my computer into the Volga
River, but you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad I failed to wreck the system; Microsoft claims that
Windows Me would still have been able to heal itself. The product
hides a compressed mirror image of the operating system in a corner
of your hard drive. If the operating system gets trashed, this
feature will supposedly resurrect it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says this feature isn't as complete as that offered by
some other firms, such as Adaptec Inc.'s GoBack software. GoBack
can restore an entire hard drive; Windows Me will rescue only
itself. But even this limited capability could be a lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   For a more obvious improvement, Windows Me offers a magically
easy way to link two or more home computers. If the Movie Maker is
clunky in that familiar Microsoft way, Windows Me's Home Networking
Wizard looks like something written by Apple programmers in their
spare time. Rarely has a Microsoft program done something so useful
in such a simple elegant way.
</P>
<P>
   First you hook up your network, either using Ethernet cable or a
wireless networking system. You run the wizard on your Windows Me
machine, with a blank floppy disk in the drive. It sets up the
computer as the hub of your home network, and loads a package of
software onto the floppy. Next, you plug the floppy into the other
Windows 95, 98 or ME computers on the network, and run the code
contained therein. And that's it. With the wizard, I added a
borrowed laptop to my home Ethernet in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The main Windows Me computer can also be your network's link to
the Internet. When it's online, all the other computers are online.
You don't have to know a blessed thing about IP masquerading or
DHCP servers; it all just works.
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of this is essential. If you're happy with your
present Windows software, feel free to give this one a pass. That
goes nearly double for those not using Windows 98 _ you'll have to
pay an extra $30. But if you're one of the suckers who paid $89 to
upgrade to Windows 98, you'll probably think $59 for Windows Me is
a real bargain. And this time you'll be right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Here are a few tips from the experts for the 7,000
lucky ticket holders planning to tote a treasure or two to an
``Antiques Roadshow'' taping.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the Hummels at home.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the Tupperware.
</P>
<P>
   And the black velvet Elvis makes three.
</P>
<P>
   People actually bring such things to be appraised on the
``Antiques Roadshow''?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they do, says Rudy Franchi, owner of the Nostalgia
Factory, a gallery specializing in movie memorabilia, in Boston's
North End. Franchi, an expert on books, manuscripts, and
collectibles has been an ``Antiques Roadshow'' appraiser for all of
the PBS show's five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appraisers try to keep a sense of humor,'' he says, ``but it
can be trying when I've been at it all day, and it's 3 o'clock in
the afternoon, and I've just seen my fifth piece of Tupperware, and
somebody has just dumped the contents of their sewing drawer on my
table.''
</P>
<P>
   All that can change in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then somebody will bring in something fantastic,'' Franchi
says, ``and it will all be worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Antiques Roadshow'' is produced by WGBH-TV and underwritten by
the Chubb Group, insurers of collectibles and fine arts. It is
PBS's highest-ranked prime-time show, with 14 million viewers each
week. When the Boston Herald revealed last year that two of the
show's appraisers had perpetrated a fraud on a segment of a 1997
show, the scandal didn't diminish the ``Roadshow'' 's popularity
one whit. The appraisers responsible for the scam were dismissed,
the segment was cut from the tape of the show, and the ``Roadshow''
moved on, virtually unscathed, and seemingly unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has history, mystery, romance,'' appraiser Colleene Fesko
says, attempting to explain the ``Roadshow'' 's appeal. Fesko, a
specialist in paintings at Skinner, the Boston appraisal and
auction firm, says she once described the ``Roadshow'' to a friend
as `` `Baywatch' with Meissen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also has the appeal of a game show,'' she adds. ``Anyone
can be a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roadshow'' fans are familiar with the big scores. A Tiffany
lamp bought in the 1960s for $125. Estimated worth:
$80,000-$125,000. A bad painting of the Titanic that was valueless,
apart from a luncheon menu from the doomed ship affixed to the
back. Estimated worth of the menu: $75,000-$100,000. A card table,
bought for $25 at a garage sale. Estimated worth: $200,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   These, and other stories of ``Roadshow'' discoveries, have got
millions of people sorting through their belongings, looking for
hidden treasures. Jamie Mercier, managing editor of New England
Antiques Journal, says the ``Roadshow'' has had a significant
impact on the antiques business in general. ``More people are going
into their attics and cellars and dusting things off and looking at
them with a new set of eyes,'' she said. ``It's probably driving
the prices of antiques up because people have great expectations,
which are sometimes justified and sometimes not.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wave of the future''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mercier said that the show has also piqued interest in
appraisals. ``More people are willing to bring things in to be
appraised,'' she said. ``And at antiques shows they have more
appraisers on site. It seems to be the wave of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is the next-to-last stop on the ``Roadshow's'' nine-city
summer tour, which has taken it to Denver, Charleston, and Las
Vegas, among other places. The free tickets for a Boston event,
distributed by Ticketmaster, were made available July 8 and were
gone the next day.
</P>
<P>
   This season the ``Roadshow'' has a new host, Daniel Elias of
Lincoln, Mass., a contemporary art dealer who has a gallery in
Boston's Allston section. He replaces Chris Jussel, who presented
the show in its first four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Elias says his wife, Karen Keane, an expert in Americana at
Skinner, urged him to try out for the host job. She has been an
appraiser on the ``Roadshow'' since it started. Elias says he
hesitated to audition. ``But then I started thinking about the fact
that there are parallels between what I do in the gallery and what
they do on the `Roadshow,' '' he says. ``One of the challenges for
an art dealer is to get people not only to look, but to listen to
what the artist is saying. `Antiques Roadshow' does that very
effectively. They get people to listen with great interest to the
objects that show up at the events.''
</P>
<P>
   Elias says his first season with the show has been an adventure.
``There's so much out there. People have this tremendous amount of
stuff; it's impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally it's stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Tulsa and this guy brought in his TV stand,'' Elias
recalls. ``Turns out it's a 1765 John Cogswell cabinet worth
$150,000. And he has his TV on it at the end of his bed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of submissions
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect ``Roadshow'' story, but such stories are rare.
During each taping the appraisers look at thousands of items. Of
these, only about 50 are taped for two shows from each city. And
many of those are never used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antiques Roadshow'' is patterned after the British show of the
same name, one of the highest-rated television programs in Britain
since its debut 22 years ago. The PBS program uses 60-70
appraisers, covering more than 20 specialties. None of them is
paid, and each picks up the cost of his or her own travel and
lodging. The exposure is good for their businesses, and has even
made celebrities of some of the appraisers, perhaps especially the
identical twin furniture experts Leigh and Leslie Keno, who
recently signed a book contract rumored to be in the high six
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the show has seen their careers blossom,''
Franchi says. ``I think of us as like the Hawaiian missionaries who
went out to do good and ended up doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Difficult personalities
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Roadshow'' appraisers' task is not easy. They must work
quickly, under a great deal of pressure. And they have to cope with
difficult personalities. ``Some people get really stroppy when they
think they have something of value and you tell them they don't,''
says Franchi. ``They have some family heirloom and stories have
built up about it, how it was handed down from Thomas Jefferson to
FDR, who gave it to their uncle Waldo.''
</P>
<P>
   The appraisers work their way through thousands of items that
have only ``sentimental value'' _ ``Roadshow''-speak for worthless,
or close to it _ to find the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The recent visit to Las Vegas produced scores of Elvis-related
artifacts. ``Panties, scarves, menus, acres of Elvis stuff,''
Franchi said. ``If he really signed it all he never would have had
time to ingest drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fesko says that one man who brought in an oil painting of Elvis
to the Las Vegas event refused to believe that it had no value.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's old,'' he protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from the '60s,'' Fesko told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's really old,'' the man insisted.
</P>
<P>
   This season, tickets for the show are timed at 90-minute
intervals to cut down on the crush. Ticket holders are limited to
two items. And they must bring at least one item. The producers
hope to discourage ``Roadshow'' groupies, who show up empty-handed
and wander around for hours, observing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes sort of an event, and people will grab anything
just to show up,'' says Carol Prisant, author of ``Antiques
Roadshow Primer'' (Workman, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How it works
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their eagerness is understandable, Prisant says, because the
production of the show is interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first come in there's a sort of triage table with
people who tell you where to go,'' Prisant says. ``Is it Asian?
Metal? Black memorabilia? Books? Whatever. They give you a ticket
and you get in line at the appropriate table.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the appraiser thinks your item is worthy of a segment
taping, the appraiser quickly finds one of the producers and sells
the story. If the producer agrees, you're immediately parted from
the appraiser and taken to the green room. That way, when you're
taped for the show, it's fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisant's book should be required reading for anybody who hopes
to attend the ``Roadshow.'' She offers suggestions about what sort
of things to bring for appraisal _ and what not to bring.
</P>
<P>
   Hummels are a ``Roadshow'' joke. ``The appraisers say that the
more carefully the tissue paper is unwrapped the more certain they
are it's a Hummel,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Prisant, too, has seen her share of Tupperware at the
``Roadshow'' while researching the book. ``There is a price guide;
some people collect it,'' she says. ``But some people collect glass
insulators or barbed wire.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Items to avoid
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the frequently seen but valueless items she's observed
people bring to the show lately are samovars, elaborately carved
furniture, and trays with butterflies trapped in plastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems such a shame that people would wait all that time and
stand in line and bring the wrong thing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Prisant suggests bringing something old,
with signs of wear, preferably something with a mark, a label, a
signature. ``But not the country of origin because that means it's
not old,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope in writing the book was that it would help people
choose the right thing to bring. Also, they could read the book
while standing in line. It would give them something to do, and
help them appraise the things brought by the people around them.
Because that's what everybody does while they're waiting.''

A FUNGUS AMONG US! WAYS TO KILL IT AND KEEP IT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you read about the biggest living thing in the world, miles
and miles long and thousands of feet deep, enjoying life under
Oregon?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a plant, although some seaweeds are huge, and it
certainly is not a mutated ant or any kind of animal. It is a
fungus, a 'shroom pof sorts, which is probably the only living
thing that can grow so big. It's a scientific curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, because other fungi are driving us all bananas.
Chief among those is mold, often misidentified as mildew, and it's
eating us out of house and home.
</P>
<P>
   The wet summer has aggravated the problem, providing wet
surfaces for the mold to grow on, on siding, foundations, and
roofs, and in basements. Mold spores, which are microscopic
``seeds,'' are flying around everywhere, waiting to land on a damp
surface and grow. &QL; 
 &QL; 
It'll grow anywhere &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mold will grow on anything _ wood, cloth, paper, plaster, brick,
concrete, vinyl, paint, stain, and sealer _ except glass and metal,
and even metal becomes a victim on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Shiny objects resist mold growth because the spores have
difficulty sticking to a hard, shiny surface. Many mold-resistant
paints are hard and shiny.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of paints, don't be fooled by claims that a paint is
mold-proof. It may be mold-resistant but not mold-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Most exterior paints and stains are mold-resistant, because they
contain a mildewcide, and will keep a surface mold free for perhaps
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Mold comes in all colors, but mostly black. Those black dots on
siding are mold. So is a gray or black haze on the house.
</P>
<P>
   The second most popular color is white. Other colors are
relatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   Most mold grows on the shady side of the house because shady
sides are damp longer than sunny sides, although you can get mold
in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we know what mold is, how do we get rid of it and, keep
it away?
</P>
<P>
   The first part is easy. The second part is impossible,
especially outdoors. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bleach: the primary weapon &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First, check to see if it is, indeed, mold. Treat a small area
with liquid chlorine bleach. If the black disappears, it was mold.
Now you can treat the whole area with a mix of one part bleach and
three parts water.
</P>
<P>
   Wear skin and eye protection when working with bleach. It is
caustic and toxic, even diluted. It can burn. In fact it did burn
the handyman, who ignored his own advice and worked barehanded.
Man, that hurt!
</P>
<P>
   Paint the bleach mix with a paint brush. If you don't plan to
paint in the near future, you don't have to rinse. If you plan to
paint, the bleach must be rinsed off.
</P>
<P>
   There are bleach helpers on the market designed to make the
bleach stick longer. Some of these helpers require addition of
bleach, others stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just leave the black marks, which to some are OK on
weathered cedar shingles? That's not a good idea, because the mold
can actually eat into the wood and cause decay.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a problem when using bleach, the most effective
mold killer. While it will not affect most paints and some stains,
chlorine bleach can deteriorate weathered wood or any bare wood.
</P>
<P>
   So, to guard against that, you can blast the mold off with
pressure washing. Be careful that you don't get a lot of water
under the shingles. Under the shingles, it will take months to dry.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a milder alternative to bleach that may be
effective. It is Era, a detergent with ``bleach alternative,'' an
oxygen bleach that is relatively benign. It is sold in
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you do, outdoor mold is likely to come back.
Keeping it away is impossible because there will always be
dampness. In dry years, there may be less. With dampness, more will
appear. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Keeping mold at bay &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All these treatments can be used indoors. Most indoor mold grows
in damp basements. But indoor mold can be kept away, simply by
keeping basements and all interior spaces dry.
</P>
<P>
   To keep a basement dry, ventilate it. Open windows for
cross-ventilation to get that damp air moving out. Put a fan in a
window to help it out. And, because basement windows are usually
high on the wall, they will ventilate only the top third of the
basement. So, put a fan on the floor to get all the air moving. Be
sure to screen and secure windows against invasion by critters and
burglars. If there are no windows, install vents in the foundation
wall or above it.
</P>
<P>
   Ventilation is your best bet. In July and August, when the whole
world is humid, venting won't work. That is the time to use a
dehumidifier.
</P>
<P>
   Mold seldom grows elsewhere indoors, except in bathrooms, where
there is a lot of moisture. Venting will solve that problem, too.
An open window will help, but best is an exhaust fan venting air to
the outdoors, not into the attic or anywhere else in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Attics are another place mold will grow, if it is not well
ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes mold will grow in peculiar areas, such as on a wall
behind a solid headboard or a large bureau or armoire. That is
because moist air gets caught in those restricted spaces, and
condenses on the cool wall.
</P>
<P>
   The cure there is to pull out the furniture several inches to
prevent the moist air from accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the information available on mold and bleach and
other mold killers, some homeowners complain that their house is
the only one in the neighborhood affected by so much mold. Why me,
they ask, and there is no answer, only guesses. Perhaps it is
because some houses are damper than others. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Algae and lichen, too &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, we've solved the mold problem, or at least dealt with it.
What about its dirty, rotten cousin, algae, and another seeming
plague, lichen?
</P>
<P>
   Algae is related to seaweed, a bright green growth on damp
surfaces. It does not have a thickness. Moss has a thickness, and
is most easily scraped off.
</P>
<P>
   For algae, the bleach treatment is effective, but it must be
scrubbed lightly with a soft scrub brush, then re-treated with the
bleach solution.
</P>
<P>
   Lichen is another matter. It appears as a light gray-green
color, with some little thickness, on stones and on asphalt roof
shingles. Lichen is a combination of algae and mold, the very
things we have been battling against.
</P>
<P>
   The algae and mold grow symbiotically, to form lichen, relying
on each other for life. Lichen resists chlorine bleach. It also
resists scrapers, which should not be used on asphalt shingles
anyway, because scraping can ruin them.
</P>
<P>
   One lichen killer is a mix of two tablespoons copper sulphate in
a gallon of water. Put this in a spray can and sprinkle it on the
lichen. (Sam Bordelon of Bloomington, Ind., sent us this
information.)
</P>
<P>
   Be extremely careful with copper sulphate. It is a powerful
poison, with a common name of blue vitriol.
</P>
<P>
   And, one positive note. Lichen will grow on roofs, but it may
not be urgent to take it off because it is slow growing and may
cause less damage than mold or algae. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Zinc as a deterrent &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another positive note about things growing on roofs: We
mentioned that these growths are impossible to keep away, but that
is not entirely true, especially on roofs.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy special zinc strips that will deter the growths, but
will not get rid of what is already there.
</P>
<P>
   These zinc strips, in various lengths and 3 to 4 inches wide,
are tucked under the second-highest roof shingle with two inches
exposed. Rainwater will run over this strip, leaching out zinc that
runs down the roof, deterring the growths.
</P>
<P>
   The strips are sold in some lumber and building supply stores.
If you can't find them, call the manufacturer or distributor to
find out where they are sold.

FIRE-BREATHING WRITER VOWS TO FRY NET THIEVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By his own estimation, writer Harlan Ellison exists in a state
of smoldering animosity. He goes from zero to ballistic in about
two seconds and threatens to put ``Harlan-sized holes'' in anyone
who crosses him, especially folks who refer to him as a science
fiction writer. (For the record: He prefers the term ``imaginative
fiction.'')
</P>
<P>
   He's had it with the greasy-thumbed adolescents, the demented
fans, the human offal, the idiots, the morons, and, well, just
about everyone else on the planet. In short, the man despises most
of the human race. ``Any society that allows Pauly Shore to make a
living doesn't deserve to exist,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Angry, are we? Ellison, whose best-known short story is about a
computer that wipes out humanity, hasn't even begun.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't even gotten to the scheming thieves, the pissant
hackers, the Napster nerds, and the unholy mooches who are pirating
his work online. ``They think they are the smartest people in the
world, like Zorro, James Bond, or Billy the Kid,'' he says, adding
a few choice descriptions that are unprintable in a family
newspaper. ``I say, `You want to be desperadoes? Well, let me take
you down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, 66, who still writes with a manual typewriter and
doesn't know the difference between a server and a search engine,
has launched a one-man legal crusade to protect his work online.
(``Don't call me a Luddite! I'm talking to you on a telephone and
not two cups attached by a string!'') So far, his attorney has gone
after individuals and companies, including America Online, that
have allegedly distributed or aided in the illegal distribution of
his work. In June, he won a judgment against Stephen Robertson of
California, who admitted posting Ellison's stories online and
agreed to pay Ellison's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But last week, a federal judge in Los Angeles decided against
Ellison in favor of AOL, ruling that the company is protected by
the ``safe harbor'' clause of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
which says that Internet access providers act as mere conduits and
are not responsible for material accessed through their service.
Ellison's attorney is considering an appeal; another case against
Critical Path, which runs the news group Web site remarq.com, is
set to go to court next month.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison hardly shies away from a good court battle: He's
supplemented his income over the years with lawsuits, including a
successful case against director James Cameron for appropriating
his work in ``The Terminator.'' But the tough-talking writer who
has written episodes for ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``Star Trek'' is
less than thrilled to find himself aligned with such rock stars as
Lars Ulrich of the heavy-metal band Metallica. ``I hate their
music,'' he says of the band that is suing Napster. ``And I find it
odd that I'm in bed with Metallica, Madonna, and Dr. Dre.'' In his
mind, that scenario is akin to performing bordello gymnastics with
Richard Nixon and Mae West _ just leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ellison is leading the charge for the publishing industry.
So far, most of the focus on online piracy has been on the music
and the film industries and their high-profile cases against
Napster, MP3.com, and Scour. But with the growth of electronic
books, the publishing industry is beginning to take notice of
digital book piracy. The wildly popular ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' was available for free on the Internet within
hours of its release in the stores; works by writers ranging from
Isaac Asimov to Roger Zalazny are readily available in news groups
and on pirate Web sites. Apart from technical manuals, most of the
works offered free online fall into the science fiction _ no,
imaginative literature _ genre; the Science Fiction and Fantasy
Writers Association is supporting Ellison in his suit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Association of American Publishers
launched an anti-piracy Web site and announced a strategy to combat
piracy while also promoting legal, protected books for sale online.
The book industry, which was slow to react to the Internet, was
pushed into the market when Stephen King boldly offered his story
``Riding the Bullet'' and his serial novel ``The Plant''
exclusively as e-books; illicit copies of both were available free
almost immediately after their release.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the book industry isn't necessarily going to come out
swinging like the film and music industries, which have taken
considerable heat for their anti-piracy crusades. ``We've seen the
public relations fallout, and we are trying to learn from those
experiences,'' says Allan Adler, vice president of legal and
government affairs for the publishers association.
</P>
<P>
   What does Ellison think of that wait-and-see attitude?
``Dinosaurs!'' He has other words, too, as you can well imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison doesn't need to worry about PR fallout: By his very
nature, he's already a publicist's nightmare. This is, after all, a
man who once brought a gun to a story meeting (``But it wasn't
loaded'') and who stormed off the set of WBUR's ``The Connection''
in Boston because host Christopher Lydon asked him why he hated
being called a science fiction writer. (``I don't write about
bug-eyed ants or Godzilla!'') Ellison even rejects the word
curmudgeon because it implies a sort of sweet irascibility; he
prefers to be described as a pain in a posterior body part.
</P>
<P>
   Angry? ``Do you think I deny the bolts standing out in my neck,
the florid countenance, the hyperventilation, the quadruple bypass
I had several years ago? I would much rather live the life of the
happy wanderer, but. . .''
</P>
<P>
   But no. There are leeches and mooches and desperadoes to take
out. Does he seriously think he can singlehandedly change Internet
culture? Does he seriously think he can stop the technology he
writes about in his, um, imaginative works? ``The average citizen
doesn't have the prayer of a snowball in a cyclotron,'' he says
with a dramatic sigh. He likes the phrase. He writes it down. He
may hurl it at someone some day.

&HT;     MEDIA DEBATE USE OF KIDNAP VICTIM'S NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When an 8-year-old kidnap victim was returned
safely to her family in Vallejo last weekend, it was cause for
relief and joy.
</P>
<P>
   But the news raised an ethical issue for the news media when the
police revealed that the child had been sexually assaulted by her
alleged abductor, Curtis Anderson. The child's name had been widely
publicized in the two days she was missing, though many news
organizations have policies against naming people who have been
sexually assaulted. Most do not identify children who are victims _
or perpetrators _ of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle and the San Jose Mercury News have
continued to publish the girl's name. Others _ including the San
Francisco Examiner, the Associated Press and the Contra Costa Times
_ stopped identifying the girl in stories.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Roberts, the Chronicle managing editor, said if the child
had been a victim of sexual assault, the newspaper would not have
named her. But the kidnapping changed the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw it as one continuous story _ the kidnap, the search,
the recovery, the obviously horrible allegations made against
Anderson,'' Roberts said. ``Her name was already out there. As a
practical matter, (naming her) wasn't going to have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that decision could change when the newspaper
covers Anderson's trial. Naming the girl in the future, after the
furor has died down, would ``unfairly cast her back into the public
discourse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saundra Keyes, managing editor of the Contra Costa Times said it
was a ``little awkward'' to shift gears suddenly and stop
identifying the child, since her name and picture had figured so
prominently in earlier stories. But the newspaper's editors decided
it was time to stop identifying her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you say that it's no use to adhere to our policy
because the name is already out there, or you say `That's our
choice to make,''' Keyes said. ``We decided that that's our policy.
And that it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Rosenhause, the Examiner managing editor, said it was
right to stop naming her when she was found and the accused
kidnapper was charged with sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be making someone a victim a second time _
especially a child,'' Rosenhause said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Blackstock, executive director of Bay Area Women Against
Rape, said a child who had been sexually assaulted needed privacy
to heal, just as adult victims did. Constant media attention would
interfere with that process, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media don't need to keep linking her with 10 sexual
assault charges, especially because she's a child and doesn't have
the option or information she needs to judge whether she wanted her
name out,'' Blackstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosenstiel, director of Project for Excellence in Journalism
at Columbia University, said journalists do not relinquish their
responsibility to protect an innocent child simply because they
published her name before the assault charges surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because something is out there doesn't mean it has to be
ubiquitous,'' he said. ``The public has a limited memory, and a
child's identity will be part of their short-term memory. We can do
more to protect an innocent child by not repeating the name.''

<P>
   JACO BEACH, Costa Rica _ Zach McDuffie had a degree from the
University of Georgia, a promising career at an Atlanta ad agency
and a rush-hour commute he couldn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped it all for a life in this Central American hideaway,
trading button-downs for baggies, his car for a surfboard, his
climb up the corporate ladder for free-form creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And he's loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here for a month the first time and fell in love
with Costa Rica,'' said McDuffie, 27. ``I went back to Atlanta and
was doing the I-285 commute, but I just kept dreaming about Costa
Rica. I finally came back to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie is one of an estimated 30,000 Americans and Canadians _
some believe the number might run as high as 70,000 _ who have been
lured to a life in this tropical oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little-known swath of mountains, jungle and beaches
sandwiched between the Caribbean and the Pacific, Costa Rica became
something of a '90s nirvana for those seeking escape, simplicity,
natural beauty and cheap living.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Nicaragua on the north and Panama on the south, the
country stands out among its neighbors, but mostly for good
reasons. In a region torn by dictatorships, drug trafficking and
political instability, Costa Rica has enjoyed free democratic
elections for decades.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors struggle to overcome poverty and illiteracy,
Costa Rica enjoys a 94 percent literacy rate and broad-based
economic prosperity with only 6 percent unemployment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While others lack basic sanitation and adequate health-care, 99
percent of Costa Rica's 3.6 million residents are served by piped
water and 90 percent receive public health services recognized as
among the best in the region. More than 90 percent have access to
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic measure of Costa Rica's
difference: the nation abolished its army in 1949 and plowed the
money into development and social services. That stunning move
earned Costa Rica the nickname, ``The Switzerland of Central
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In another far-reaching move, leaders also set aside huge chunks
of the gorgeous countryside, so that now nearly 25 percent of Costa
Rica's territory is protected as national parks or preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been everything I dreamed,'' McDuffie said. ``I'm
the happiest guy I know. It's such a different tempo here, a
different pace. All my dad's friends are mad at me, saying I
somehow managed to retire at 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in any paradise, there are a few potholes.
Literally. The roads, while better than in neighboring countries,
suffer washouts and sporadic repairs that make driving an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of foreigners has driven up real estate values, so
that prices in popular areas compare better to Miami than Managua.
The escalation has driven some would-be expatriates to look for
cheaper homesteads in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican crime has also shot up, with the high-profile
murders of two American college students in March triggering a bout
of unfavorable international publicity. There has also been a rash
of kidnappings, leading many Costa Ricans to ponder whether some of
the less-appealing aspects of modern life are catching up with
their paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreigners are still coming in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom started about 10 years ago,'' said Ryan Piercy,
manager of the Association of Residents of Costa Rica, a private
group that provides services to incoming foreigners. ``For a while,
our group was growing by 300 percent a year. Now it's evened out to
a steady 10 percent a year. But we're seeing a lot of young people.
A few years ago, it was mostly retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever visionary, Costa Rica's leaders years ago made it easy for
foreigners to move in. The law basically requires that would-be
residents have an income of US$600 per month and that they agree to
stay in Costa Rica at least four months each year.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can own businesses _ which means they often create
employment for native Costa Ricans, known as ``Ticos.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie spent several months traveling the country before
finally settling down in Jaco Beach, a surf town on the Pacific
coast about two-hours drive from the capital, San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   After casting around for opportunities, he decided to open a
school catering to the hordes of young backpacker tourists who have
made Costa Rica a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people who were going to language schools
in San Jose, and they were frustrated because they weren't seeing
the country,'' he said. ``So we designed a program that's hands-on
learning, with language, ecology, art and surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a struggle at times, but now in its third year,
McDuffie's ``Escuela del Mundo'' _ ``School of the World'' _ is a
growing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our students find out about us from the Internet,''
McDuffie said. ``That's been the key. I wouldn't have been able to
do this 10 years ago because nobody would've been able to find
us.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-pat who has found his place in Jaco Beach is Dave
Klostermann, who once ran a thriving but stressful swimming pool
construction business in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got fed up with high insurance rates, workers'
compensation, crime and traffic,'' he said. ``I was working harder
for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   After investigating Montana and Idaho, Klostermann , 40, came to
Costa Rica on a lark with a minister friend doing outreach work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been told by several friends that this was the place to
come with a grubstake to buy a big farm and just sit back and watch
property values go up,'' he said. ``I wanted a place that was
growing but safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that moving to Costa Rica is a
stress-free ticket to easy-street. Cars cost double what they do in
the United States. Most natives speak only Spanish. Petty theft is
a problem. Some natives grow resentful of ``gringos'' who open
businesses that compete with Tico shops.
</P>
<P>
   Klostermann wanted to open a construction business, but found
the market just wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he turned to his lifelong hobby: horses. It's taken
several years er ex-pats in the San Jose area, they have carved out
a comfortable life, forming clubs, going to movies, doing volunteer
work and reading an English-language newspaper, The Tico Times.
There's now even a radio station broadcasting in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet,'' Miller said. ``Every once in a while I hear a
cowbell, but that's about it. The cost of living is far lower than
in Canada, and we get full health coverage for only US$37 a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Piercy estimates that about 80 percent of the foreigners moving
to Costa Rica are retirees. His group offers monthly seminars on
everything from buying property to obtaining insurance and avoiding
scams. The sessions have grown so crowded _ 35 to 50 people _ that
he's considering adding a second seminar each month.
</P>
<P>
   But he recommends that would-be residents investigate carefully
before making such a big move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some people who have sold everything at home, moved
down here and signed contracts to buy a house in the first week,''
he said. ``Some of them have been burned. It's important to bring
your common sense just as if you were moving to Florida or
Arizona.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEREA, Ky. _ Sometimes Sarah Culbreth and her husband, Jeff
Enge, can go days without seeing a single client at their ceramics
studio in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains here.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are other days when a stream of clients and even a
busload of 50 tourists will visit Tater Knob Pottery and Farm to
see the potters work and buy their ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   That pace is just right, and is in fact the balance they
envisioned when they moved in 1992 to the 30-acre farm outside of
Berea, a small college town renowned for its arts and crafts in
rural Kentucky, about 90 miles southeast of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, e-commerce is making its way into their lives. They
have a Web site (www.taterknob.com), and get orders by e-mail
messages. But they do not accept credit cards yet. ``I have all the
work I can think of ever wanting to do,'' Culbreth said. ``We see
the Web site as, `OK, what are we going to put on there and make it
worth our while to check our e-mail every day?'''
</P>
<P>
   As an out-of-the-way center of specialized products _ antiques,
and crafts by artisans working in the Appalachian traditions _
Berea would seem an ideal laboratory for the transforming powers of
the Internet. And commerce here is moving online _ but slowly,
fitfully, in ways as individual as the craftspeople themselves.
Many of the artisans are trying to figure out whether the
technology will help them maintain the lives they have created or
force them from the traditions they cherish.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, young people are most comfortable with the
change. At Berea College, which charges no tuition as such,
students work in various campus jobs to pay their way, including in
a thriving furniture and crafts operation. For more than 50 years,
the college has produced a mail-order catalog with items ranging
from beds to brooms. In many ways, e-commerce was a natural
addition because the operations for order-taking and distribution
were in place.
</P>
<P>
   The college introduced its secure-order site in August 1999, and
now www.bereacollegecrafts.com offers about 50 items. Steve Fain,
the director of Berea College Crafts, said the college had
processed about 600 orders from the website since it came into
being, taking in about $20,000 in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Snapp, a computer consultant, worked with the Berea Chamber
of Commerce to create Berea.com, which links Berea College Crafts
and some of the other craftspeople in town. He is trying to move
more local artisans toward e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most artists and craftspeople are nontechnical,'' Snapp said.
``So we start out slowly, by looking at just getting their names on
the Web. Then, when they see a real success, like Berea College
Crafts, they start to come around to e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first craftspeople to set up a site in Berea was
Charles Harvey (www.charlesharveywoodwork.com), who makes
Shaker-style chairs and boxes but does not sell them online. ``My
strategy about the Web was not to encourage people to press a
button, and it will arrive on their doorstep three days later,'' he
said. ``My work takes time. Instead, my site is where people can go
to get information about my work and about Shaker furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Petty, who makes one-of-a-kind baskets, goes further,
but not much. ``I put the pictures up, and if anybody wants to buy
them, they can,'' she said. ``I'm not into marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bereans who are dealers in antiques and other rare items,
the Internet can provide a lifeline. Del Martin has been selling
Mission-style antique furniture and high-end rugs from his living
room since 1995. He uses his Web site, www.jaxrugs.com, to show his
customers new designs and to link to eBay, where he auctions his
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jax Rugs could survive without the Internet,'' Martin said,
``but I'd have to stop buying and selling the antiques, which I
love doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are others who adamantly reject the Web, like Harvey's
girlfriend, Teresa Cole, a potter who shares a storefront with him
in Berea. ``I absolutely hate the time I have to spend at the
computer,'' she said. ``It's so frustrating to use so few of my
senses at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of fierce defense of the slower pace of Berea against
a high-speed modem invasion prevails among many traditional
craftspeople. But some are softening.
</P>
<P>
   Take Warren May, who hand crafts traditional dulcimers (stringed
musical instruments). He sells about 500 a year in his shop, but
only two or three through a site at a gallery in town. May said he
did not have a computer in his home or in his shop because he
thought that time spent on computers was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   But even he has come to recognize the benefits of e-commerce.
``Craftspeople are usually so isolated,'' May said. ``Computers
give us tremendous outreach, not just to customers but to other
craftspeople. With computers you can reach people all the way from
Podunk Holler to New York City.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIJING _ Somewhere in the Turkish highlands this summer, a
camper will bed for the night with a Chinese-made tent and sleeping
bag, courtesy of a Turkish sporting goods wholesaler that bought
hundreds over the Internet from a Chinese company earlier this
year. It is the kind of transaction that many people hope is the
beginning of a revolution for China's formidable economy.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions for revolution are ripe: China is relaxing
central government control over its vast export machine, and the
Internet is linking that machine to buyers worldwide. Furthermore,
e-commerce is cutting through China's archaic distribution system,
a fragmented, multilayered realm that harks back to the nation's
feudal past. The government is also bringing the country's growing
online population new services, from Internet auctions to
electronic matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many barriers, both cultural and technical. And
for all the talk of the Internet's rapid spread, only a fraction of
the country is wired. Of those, only a fifth has shopped online.
The chief concern among consumers is the security of online
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that debt has always been scorned in
China, and collection is a challenge in a country that still has
only rudimentary rule of law. The nation's banks recently began
issuing true credit cards, but they are rare. And while many people
have debit cards, few trust using them online.
</P>
<P>
   So it will be a long time before China's e-commerce sector can
support more than a few big companies. The nation's Ministry of
Information Industries predicts that online transactions will reach
$42 million this year, more than six times last year's total. That
is far from enough to go around for the 1,100 consumer-oriented
e-commerce Web sites in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the state of e-commerce in China for
business-to-business, business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer
sites:
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS trade is the most promising because the
country has never developed a national distribution system, despite
the centralized administration of China's state industrial
conglomerates. Instead, production was localized _ nearly every
province had its own textile industry, tobacco factory, etc.
Selling products from one province to the next often required going
through Beijing. Meanwhile, the state-owned foreign-trade
corporations monopolized foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not much better now. The right to export is
still controlled, and state-owned corporations continue to dominate
foreign trade. Domestic distribution remains fragmented. But
e-commerce presents a way to cut through the bureaucratic thicket.
</P>
<P>
   Several business-to-business Web sites are providing the conduit
that China's traditional distribution system lacks. Sites like
MeetChina.com and Alibaba.com go further, bringing China to the
world. Even China's state trade companies are exploring the
cybertrade routes.
</P>
<P>
   From a blue cubicle in a white-tiled building in northwestern
Beijing, Rao Qinfu types into the Alibaba site the specifications
for an industrial ice-making machine designed for fisheries. The
mandate from his employer, the China National Technology Import and
Export Corp., is to see whether the Internet is a workable
marketing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Rao, 28, is an eager Alibaba convert. ``It's free, and you get
quick feedback because it's one of the services with lots of people
online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a sort of industrial clearinghouse that draws
together buyers and sellers from 186 countries and regions
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But there are problems. Because the site is free, few customer
inquiries are serious, Rao says. After six months, he has not sold
anything other than the tents and sleeping bags to the Turkish
wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder, says his main goal is to be the
premier business-to-business site for China's smaller exporters.
Investors, who include Goldman Sachs, the Softbank Corp. of Japan
and Investor A.B. of Sweden, have pumped $25 million into the site.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER companies are the most common type of
e-commerce start-up here. Because of China's byzantine distribution
system, online sales theoretically give anyone with a Web site
national reach. And direct sales cut out the multiple
intermediaries who help inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   At 8848.net _ whose name, derived from the height of Mount
Everest in meters, reflects the company's lofty goals _ Chinese
customers can buy books, software and computers. But in a country
rife with counterfeit goods and shoddy merchandise, China's
look-and-feel shopping habits are hard to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Tan Zhi, 8848's president, speaks frequently at universities,
hoping to engender online shopping habits among China's plugged-in
generation. ``We have to change people's way of thinking,'' Tan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to bring about that change involves flawless execution,
so the company has built a cavernous ``fulfillment center'' in
northwestern Beijing, where staff members roller-skate down
warehouse aisles loaded with goods. The skaters gather requested
items onto a conveyor belt that delivers them to the packing
department, where delivery trucks wait.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics is the biggest challenge for companies like 8848,
which came under early criticism for unreliable delivery by a
subcontractor. Now the company relies on the national postal
service to deliver goods and collect money for cash-on-delivery
orders, which is how most people pay despite the company's
agreements with several banks to clear their customers'
transactions online.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business is slow. The company's transaction volume in
September was nearly $1.2 million and rose to $1.5 million by
November, but the company stopped providing figures to the public
at the end of last year. It says that growth remains high, but that
the company's new business-to-business service accounts for most of
today's transactions.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER-TO-CONSUMER: Dozens of local online auction sites have
cropped up, though few generate enough activity to qualify as real
businesses. Part of the problem is trust; the kind of mutual
confidence that makes the transactions of America's eBay work is
rare in China.
</P>
<P>
   Eachnet.com, China's largest auction site, has solved that
problem by creating local sites that encourage transactions by
people in the same city who can meet before exchanging cash. The
total value of transactions settled on the site averages around
$2.5 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Eachnet eventually wishes to charge users a ``success'' fee, but
it currently makes nary a penny from those deals. Instead, it would
like to make money by renting space on its site to other
e-businesses.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What a week. I've been trapped between phalanxes
of cops every day.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard too many rap chants for Mumia. On Wednesday a bomb
threat kept me out of my hotel for hours. One thing has kept me
going _ the people I met at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But first I had to get past the signs at the front tables at the
daily California delegation breakfast. The tables have been
sponsored by PG&AMP;E, California Association of Realtors, the
Correctional Peace Officers Association, the Agua Caliente Band of
Cahuilla Indians and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, California. Let there be expensive light, real estate,
prisons, casinos and Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   But behind those front tables was seated Eliseo Medina, of Los
Angeles, the executive vice president of the Service Employees
International Union.
</P>
<P>
   When Medina got up to speak to the delegates, he said, ``You
know what? We can't always wait for the Republicans to be stupid.
This isn't about pretending to appreciate mariachi or salsa music.
This is about appreciating the people who do the hard work in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a Republicrat.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't all parties and big money. This convention is filled
with delegates from every background and of modest means and great
dreams. They're the ones who cheer and are treated like extras in
the TV coverage.
</P>
<P>
   TV doesn't show the important stuff at the convention, and the
little people who spend thousands of dollars to come here to make a
difference. They don't get to vote on candidates, but they come to
``rekindle the fire in the belly,'' as Rep. Tammy Baldwin of
Wisconsin put it.
</P>
<P>
   I met Baldwin, the only openly lesbian member of Congress, on
Wednesday after she spoke to the 200 gay and lesbian delegates.
There were no TV cameras in this cramped room at the Wilshire Grand
Hotel, but here were some people who had shaken up the political
system.
</P>
<P>
   After speeches by lesbian candidates for Congress, the meeting
took a small-town Democratic turn. The moderator asked if anybody
wanted to introduce himself or someone else. Someone said he wanted
to introduce Glen Maxey, the only openly gay member of the Texas
state Senate, and a man who knows Gov. George W. Bush very well.
Maxey told a story that tells you all you need to know about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supported a bill that would prevent gays and lesbians in
Texas from adopting children, and even take away their children.
After the bill was signed, according to Maxey, Bush said, ``Glen, I
like you as a person, I respect you as a person, and I want you to
know that what I say publicly about gays does not apply to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxey said he told Bush, ``Governor, when you say publicly that
I am not fit to be a parent, then I take it real personally.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of story you'll hear on TV. Neither will
you hear jokes like the one Maxey told. ``George W. Bush is thin on
policy,'' said Maxey. ``He knows more about baseball than politics
_ and he traded away Sammy Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Maxey added, ``I didn't know that. A lesbian told me.''
</P>
<P>
   In small places away from the cameras, I kept hearing people say
things that let me know the Democratic Party was still alive.
People are committed. I asked Alyson Abramowitz, a delegate from
Cupertino, Calif., if there was any big money in this convention
for her. ``Zero,'' she said. ``We pay our own way and it's very
expensive. . . . If I want to take a taxi to a party at Sony or
Paramount, it costs about $40. It would be cheaper if I fed
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts stress on our families,'' said Dang Pham, a delegate
from San Francisco. ``Sure, there are parties, but this isn't all
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it from the media, but not everybody is going
to parties in limousines. And when most people go to a party, they
don't have what normal people would describe as fun. They talk
politics.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for the average delegate? ``It's political fantasy
camp,'' said Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Rep. Nancy Pelosi of
San Francisco and a third-generation Democratic delegate. ``There's
a joy in it. It's their big event. Every other group from the AMA
to the AFL-CIO has conventions, but none gets to nominate a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Dustin Hall seemed like he'd rather be at a
baseball fantasy camp, but he was making the best of his second
Democratic convention by collecting autographs from politicians. He
had a Skip Humphrey and a Paul Wellstone from his home state of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   His dad, John Hall, is a shop steward for a Minneapolis local of
the electrical workers union. ``I'm a working stiff like anyone
else,'' he said. ``I work the 7 to 3 every day, and I'm here
because America is not for sale. The Republicans are backed by big
business, selling out America to strike-breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   And they say the parties are just the same and there's no
passion in electoral politics anymore? Nonsense.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Al Gore's vice presidential selection has put a
spotlight on what is usually only whispered in private.
</P>
<P>
   It bubbled to the surface when newspaper headlines across the
country announced in bold type that Al Gore had picked ``a Jew.''
Of course, disclaimers quickly followed, pointing out that, even
though he is ``a Jew,'' Joe Lieberman is one terrific, moral,
ethical guy, greatly respected in the Senate by Republicans and
Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts point out that it's only because he is
the first ``Jew''' to be placed on a national ticket that there is
so much brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   Others hint at something less pleasant. How long have Jews been
American citizens? How many generations are native-born, schooled
and raised right here in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   Jews helped build San Francisco. Starting in 1849, Levi Strauss
made blue jeans for dreamers who panned for gold in search of the
good life. Jews emigrated from Germany and other parts of Europe,
set up businesses, created social service agencies, designed homes
and schools. They raised families. They felt proud to play a part
in building a wonderful city, a meaningful life. They were happy to
be able to make a contribution, to give back something of value to
their society and their country.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and in other major and minor cities and towns
throughout America the story was the same.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for Joseph Lieberman, a man who went to Yale, became
Connecticut's attorney general and served with distinction in the
Senate, the headlines shouted: ``Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jews make up only 2 to 3 percent of the population of
this country, they have made their presence felt _ in philanthropy,
the arts, education, science and business. Nonetheless, for many
years they were not welcome in many American towns, neighborhoods,
businesses or social clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, who are not Jewish, feel that Jews are
``different.''Others hold Jews responsible for ancient wrongs. Many
have never met any Jewish people but distrust them just the same.
</P>
<P>
   These feelings are expressed in overt and covert ways. It's easy
to decry skinheads who paint swastikas on synagogues and threaten
little children. But it's the more insidious, subtle things that
help perpetuate stereotypes and hatred.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter, who is now 11, loves the books of T.A. Barron, a
Colorado writer with a deep reverence for nature. His fantasy
novels have taken her throughout the galaxy, beneath the sea and
into the magic realm of Merlin.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in this fantasy world, in a book on Merlin's
childhood, that boys threw rocks at a rag pile covering a human
being they identify as ``a dirty Jew.'' It's a jarring, discordant
note, totally out of keeping with the rest of the story. In fact,
nowhere else in any of Barron's books is anyone _ ogre, giant,
villain _ labeled in this pejorative way.
</P>
<P>
   The passage was so unexpectedly painful that it was hard to find
the words to try and explain it to my daughter, an American Jewish
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jews are not the only minorities to experience
discrimination. Sadly, it's a story that has repeated itself over
and over again throughout our country's history.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a child, people referred to America as a ``melting
pot,'' the place poet Emma Lazarus described as a welcoming haven:
``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to
breathe free.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, people from all kinds of diverse cultures have made
important and lasting contributions. In fact, every time a new wave
of immigrants becomes a part of this country, America is
reinvigorated and reborn in unexpected and meaningful ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yet negative labels still continue to be used.
</P>
<P>
   I think that in the year 2000, it's time for us to begin sharing
the things we have in common, that bind us _ celebrating, rather
than denigrating the differences that make us who we are.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lieberman, a decent, caring and highly moral man, is also
a Jew. Being Jewish has helped shape him, and is part of what
guided him to speak his mind on what he believes to be right and
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out on right and wrong is how this country was founded.
I like to think of Joe Lieberman, Al Gore, George Bush, Dick Cheney
and you and me as part of that great tradition.

&HT;     RETIRED QUARTERBACK VISITS NINERS' CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Shirt untucked, shoes untied and khaki pants
ruffled, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young very
much looked like a man reveling in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, visited his old team at the request of coach Steve
Mariucci. Young didn't sound quite convincing when he said he
didn't miss football.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leading a team of 52 players, Young is now looking
after a team of one. ``A lot of my time is being married,'' said
Young, who married former model Barbara Graham in March. ``(I'm)
making sure she's happy and settled. I'm the cook. I'm the one who
has to take care of a lot of little things because my wife has some
risks in her pregnancy. It's really different to serve someone
else. It's a good lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The only news Young has made lately has been his invocation at
the recent Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and his
well-publicized tiff with quarterback Jeff Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Young regretted dipping his head during his prayer at the
Republican convention, because it revealed his bald spot. Otherwise
he enjoyed the experience. Still, Young reiterated that he would
not seek political office.
</P>
<P>
   He was dragged into the news when Garcia recently said Young
wasn't much of a help to him after Garcia assumed Young's starter's
role last season. After exchanging messages, the two men talked
briefly following Wednesday's morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there was much to straighten out,'' Young said.
``I don't like to firehouse people with a lot of information
especially when you're trying to play. . . . If he had needed more,
I would have given it to him.''

<P>
   JACO BEACH, Costa Rica _ Zach McDuffie had a degree from the
University of Georgia, a promising career at an Atlanta ad agency
and a rush-hour commute he couldn't stand.
</P>
<P>
   He dumped it all for a life in this Central American hideaway,
trading button-downs for baggies, his car for a surfboard, his
climb up the corporate ladder for free-form creativity.
</P>
<P>
   And he's loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came down here for a month the first time and fell in love
with Costa Rica,'' said McDuffie, 27. ``I went back to Atlanta and
was doing the I-285 commute, but I just kept dreaming about Costa
Rica. I finally came back to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie is one of an estimated 30,000 Americans and Canadians _
some believe the number might run as high as 70,000 _ who have been
lured to a life in this tropical oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Once a little-known swath of mountains, jungle and beaches
sandwiched between the Caribbean and the Pacific, Costa Rica became
something of a '90s nirvana for those seeking escape, simplicity,
natural beauty and cheap living.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Nicaragua on the north and Panama on the south, the
country stands out among its neighbors, but mostly for good
reasons. In a region torn by dictatorships, drug trafficking and
political instability, Costa Rica has enjoyed free democratic
elections for decades.
</P>
<P>
   While its neighbors struggle to overcome poverty and illiteracy,
Costa Rica enjoys a 94 percent literacy rate and broad-based
economic prosperity with only 6 percent unemployment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While others lack basic sanitation and adequate health-care, 99
percent of Costa Rica's 3.6 million residents are served by piped
water and 90 percent receive public health services recognized as
among the best in the region. More than 90 percent have access to
telephones.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic measure of Costa Rica's
difference: the nation abolished its army in 1949 and plowed the
money into development and social services. That stunning move
earned Costa Rica the nickname, ``The Switzerland of Central
America.''
</P>
<P>
   In another far-reaching move, leaders also set aside huge chunks
of the gorgeous countryside, so that now nearly 25 percent of Costa
Rica's territory is protected as national parks or preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been everything I dreamed,'' McDuffie said. ``I'm
the happiest guy I know. It's such a different tempo here, a
different pace. All my dad's friends are mad at me, saying I
somehow managed to retire at 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in any paradise, there are a few potholes.
Literally. The roads, while better than in neighboring countries,
suffer washouts and sporadic repairs that make driving an
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The influx of foreigners has driven up real estate values, so
that prices in popular areas compare better to Miami than Managua.
The escalation has driven some would-be expatriates to look for
cheaper homesteads in Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican crime has also shot up, with the high-profile
murders of two American college students in March triggering a bout
of unfavorable international publicity. There has also been a rash
of kidnappings, leading many Costa Ricans to ponder whether some of
the less-appealing aspects of modern life are catching up with
their paradise.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreigners are still coming in droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom started about 10 years ago,'' said Ryan Piercy,
manager of the Association of Residents of Costa Rica, a private
group that provides services to incoming foreigners. ``For a while,
our group was growing by 300 percent a year. Now it's evened out to
a steady 10 percent a year. But we're seeing a lot of young people.
A few years ago, it was mostly retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever visionary, Costa Rica's leaders years ago made it easy for
foreigners to move in. The law basically requires that would-be
residents have an income of US$600 per month and that they agree to
stay in Costa Rica at least four months each year.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders can own businesses _ which means they often create
employment for native Costa Ricans, known as ``Ticos.''
</P>
<P>
   McDuffie spent several months traveling the country before
finally settling down in Jaco Beach, a surf town on the Pacific
coast about two-hours drive from the capital, San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   After casting around for opportunities, he decided to open a
school catering to the hordes of young backpacker tourists who have
made Costa Rica a favorite destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to a lot of people who were going to language schools
in San Jose, and they were frustrated because they weren't seeing
the country,'' he said. ``So we designed a program that's hands-on
learning, with language, ecology, art and surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a struggle at times, but now in its third year,
McDuffie's ``Escuela del Mundo'' _ ``School of the World'' _ is a
growing enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our students find out about us from the Internet,''
McDuffie said. ``That's been the key. I wouldn't have been able to
do this 10 years ago because nobody would've been able to find
us.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Another ex-pat who has found his place in Jaco Beach is Dave
Klostermann, who once ran a thriving but stressful swimming pool
construction business in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got fed up with high insurance rates, workers'
compensation, crime and traffic,'' he said. ``I was working harder
for less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ais was the place to come with a grubstake to buy a big farm and
just sit back and watch property values go up,'' he said. ``I
wanted a place that was growing but safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that moving to Costa Rica is a
stress-free ticket to easy-street. Cars cost double what they do in
the United States. Most natives speak only Spanish. Petty theft is
a problem. Some natives grow resentful of ``gringos'' who open
businesses that compete with Tico shops.
</P>
<P>
   Klostermann wanted to open a construction business, but found
the market just wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he turned to his lifelong hobby: horses. It's taken
several years to establish his horse rental business, and along the
way there have been some spats with Ticos _ and other foreigners _
who run similar businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But things are going well now, especially after a huge new
Marriott hotel opened nearby, bringing in corporate retreats and
large groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little things you take for granted at home are harder
here,'' Klostermann said. ``Things like the power going out, and
Tico-brand washing machines. But it's a beautiful place with so
many things to do. I just hope they don't expand too much and ruin
what makes Costa Rica special.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While some people have found paradise and new careers near the
beach, Bob Miller came to Costa Rica to coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an engineer and I came down here on a job about 30 years
ago and just loved the fact that instead of seeing guys with guns
everywhere like in other Latin countries, they didn't have an army
here,'' said Miller, 73. ``Back then, the cops were armed only with
pliers and screw drivers. If you did anything wrong, they took your
license plate and made you pay a fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and his wife moved down permanently from Vancouver about
three years ago and now rent a house in the San Jose suburb of
Escazu. Along with thousands of other ex-pats in the San Jose area,
they have carved out a comfortable life, forming clubs, going to
movies, doing volunteer work and reading an English-language
newspaper, The Tico Times. There's now even a radio station
broadcasting in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet,'' Miller said. ``Every once in a while I hear a
cowbell, but that's about it. The cost of living is far lower than
in Canada, and we get full health coverage for only US$37 a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Piercy estimates that about 80 percent of the foreigners moving
to Costa Rica are retirees. His group offers monthly seminars on
everything from buying property to obtaining insurance and avoiding
scams. The sessions have grown so crowded _ 35 to 50 people _ that
he's considering adding a second seminar each month.
</P>
<P>
   But he recommends that would-be residents investigate carefully
before making such a big move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some people who have sold everything at home, moved
down here and signed contracts to buy a house in the first week,''
he said. ``Some of them have been burned. It's important to bring
your common sense just as if you were moving to Florida or
Arizona.''

ACTING ON EMOTIONS RATHER THAN FACTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CECIL JOHNSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emotion more often than not trumps knowledge, observed the
former nuclear engineer.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't put it in exactly those words, but that was the gist
of his comments in reaction to a woman's remarks to me and my
daughter about the Firestone tire recall.
</P>
<P>
   We were all seated in the waiting room of one of the branches of
a company whose name suggests that it dispenses top-of-line tires
at marked-down prices.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had asked if we were in the black Ford Explorer. When
I said ``yes,'' she asked if we had heard about the Firestone
recall.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter said: ``Been there, tried to do that.'' Then I went
on to explain how the Firestone dealer had said that all they could
do was put people on a list because they didn't have any
replacement tires yet. And when they get them, which could take
months, the replacements more than likely would be other Firestone
tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' said my daughter, ``they said my tires didn't
qualify because their serial numbers indicated that they were not
made at Firestone's Decatur, Ill., plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone and federal investigators, I pointed out,
have pinpointed that plant as the source of the problem with the
tires whose tread has separated and reportedly caused several major
accidents, some involving fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   The woman turned what African-Americans refer to as ``soulful''
and said: ``I don't care where mine were made _ they are gonna give
me some new tires or some money to get some, or I'm gonna turn the
place out.''
</P>
<P>
   I wished her luck. But I pointed out that I wasn't going to let
my daughter drive on her Wilderness ATs another day, regardless of
where they were made. I'd gamble on being reimbursed someday. I
expressed concern that if we waited, drivers of Ford trucks and
SUVs would buy up all the compatible tires of different brands.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the former nuclear engineer said to me that the
Firestones made at other plants probably were safe because both
Bridgestone/Firestone and federal inspectors had conducted a
thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is going to be hard to convince the public of that
because most people make their judgments on such things based on
emotion rather than facts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion about the supremacy of emotion in such contexts,
he said, was based on his experience as an engineer involved in the
construction of the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant near Glen
Rose in north Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plant unquestionably is one of the safest in the world.
It was way overbuilt for safety because we got caught up in an
emotion-driven regulatory environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed the view that the American people are unnecessarily
anxious about the so-called perils of nuclear energy when it is the
safest and most environmentally friendly energy source now
available.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned the Three Mile Island meltdown and triggered a
strong reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Mile Island was a success story. We had a meltdown, but
no radiation escaped from the containment area. We had a meltdown,
but we didn't have a Chernobyl disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked about the problems of disposing of nuclear waste,
he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That problem already has been solved,'' he said, but the
public, caught up in uninformed emotion, doesn't want to accept the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   He described that solution as simply converting the waste into
chunks of ceramic material and burying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still radioactive. But the radiation doesn't extend but a
few feet, and because the stuff is ceramic, it won't leach into the
ground water.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm ruled too much by my emotions, but I couldn't quite
buy that. But I didn't try to put up an argument because he knew
much more about what he was expounding upon than I did.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the subject, I asked him what he was having done to his
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm replacing the Wilderness ATs on my Explorer with
Michelins,'' he said.

NOTHING SMUG OR SLICK ABOUT `GODZILLA 2000,' AND THAT'S THE WAY WE
LIKE IT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinyl-record junkies often say that they like LPs because they
have a warmth that CDs don't have; the higher-tech sound is too
sterile and compressed. ``Godzilla 2000'' is sort of like a vinyl
movie; although it contains computer-generated effects, it looks
pleasingly retro, with obvious miniatures, occasional glimpses of
latex, and awkward dubbing. It has a warmth that, say, ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make it great, but it is the real deal: a Toho
Pictures spectacular, brought to the United States by TriStar _
possibly as an apology for TriStar's bombastic, smugly winking
Hollywood ``Godzilla'' from 1998. The American version planted its
tongue in its cheek, and was worse for it; ``Godzilla 2000'' plays
it so straight that it's often hard to tell which of the jokes are
intentional and which aren't. It lets moviegoers do the work,
deciding just how ironic they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   And if the preview was any indication, this is a movie that
needs an audience _ which it's unlikely to get as it battles ``The
Cell,'' ``Hollow Man'' and ``Space Cowboys'' for box-office bucks.
But Godzilla fans were out in force at the screening, often
pontificating with touching depth on their hero. The polite ones
even waited till the movie was over to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla elements are so familiar, you don't have to be a
fanatic to know about them, and many are in this movie: a scientist
(Takehiro Murata) who works for the amusingly named Godzilla
Prediction Network strives to understand the creature. A government
agency led by hilariously stoic Chief Katagiri (Hiroshi Abe) _
who's so stern and macho that only his hair and clothes blow
dramatically during the windy scenes _ wants to kill Godzilla,
who's wreaking havoc on communications systems. The agency also has
its hands full with an island-size rock that turns out to be full
of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, contemporary anxieties _ about mass media and,
apparently, the most highly developed computer hacking imaginable _
provide the plot with a little meat, and Godzilla gets into a
climactic battle with another huge beast. Yet despite the movie's
earnestness, it never takes itself so seriously that it stops being
fun. Sometimes you laugh at it instead of with it, and it seems to
invite that kind of condescension. You could call it a ready-made
midnight movie, except that it seems better-suited to a Saturday
matinee, preferably with bargain popcorn and a double feature with
a Gamera movie. Too bad nobody does monster-movie marathons
anymore.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``Why has the president been silent?'' asked the daily
Komsomolskaya Pravda in two-inch high red letters on its front page
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Below the headline there is a photograph of President Vladimir
Putin in a peaked naval cap taking the salute on the bridge of a
Russian naval vessel earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper asks why Putin took five days to make his first
brief comment on the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine to the
bottom of the Barents Sea: ``There was only one man who kept
silent. The Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of Russia. The
honorary sailor.''
</P>
<P>
   It notes acidly that during this period he has found time to
appoint new ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile and reverse a decision
by the city of Tula on the disposal of scrap metal, but he has not
talked to the distraught relatives of the 118 sailors entombed
aboard the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year Putin has projected the image of the
strong-willed Russian leader who would seek to restore his
country's military strength. He owed his initial popularity to his
decision to send the Russian army into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the presidential election in March he dressed up in
a military pilot's uniform to fly in a fighter-bomber. He even
spent a night underwater in a nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   It is these images which are now coming back to haunt Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to Russian radio programs ask why, given his liking for
military uniform during the presidential election campaign, did he
appear in a beige T-shirt at the Black Sea vacation resort of Sochi
to make his first remarks about the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Putin's low profile is obvious enough. From the
moment the Kursk plunged to the bottom of the sea last Saturday _
the day the president went on holiday _ Kremlin officials probably
thought things would end badly.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Kommersant says bluntly that they did not want to take
responsibility. They preferred that those carrying out the rescue
should be seen as ``ultimately responsible for the people's
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin may have underestimated the impact of the long,
drawn out drama of the Kursk is having on Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of the 118 sailors, already dead or slowly
suffocating in their submarine, is having a bigger popular impact
than the death of over 2,500 Russian soldiers in Chechnya,'' said
Andrei Mironov, a Russian human-rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Putin, there is a limit to what he can do, but
what he has done he has done late. First there was a long delay in
accepting foreign help to try to save the men in the submarine.
Only Thursday was a naval conference called in Severomorsk to
investigate the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Putin directly responsible for the stream of
misinformation and apparent lies about the Kursk which followed the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The giant submarine was first described as ``malfunctioning''
and ``descending to the ocean floor'' last Sunday. In fact an
explosion _ or just possibly a collision _ on the evening of the
previous day sent the Kursk crashing into the sea floor with no
time to send a signal or release its satellite communications
beacon.
</P>
<P>
   A major military disaster was always likely as the armed forces
try to keep highly sophisticated equipment operating on a military
budget of only $5 billion. A senior submarine officer gets paid
only $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Putin is that he has portrayed himself as a
``hands-on'' president, in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it difficult for him to distance himself from the
tragedy of the Kursk. It does not mean, however, that he will not
try. When Chechen suicide bombers killed 36 Russian soldiers in
Chechnya earlier in the summer, he publicly dressed down Marshal
Igor Segeyev, his defense minister on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk submarine disaster does not prove that Putin is
personally ineffective, but it does show the emptiness of his
rhetoric about restoring Russia's military and political strength. &QL;

appoint new ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile and reverse a decision
by the city of Tula on the disposal of scrap metal, but he has not
talked to the distraught relatives of the 118 sailors entombed
aboard the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year Putin has projected the image of the
strong-willed Russian leader who would seek to restore his
country's military strength. He owed his initial popularity to his
decision to send the Russian army into Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the presidential election in March he dressed up in
a military pilot's uniform to fly in a fighter-bomber. He even
spent a night underwater in a nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   It is these images which are now coming back to haunt Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Callers to Russian radio programs ask why, given his liking for
military uniform during the presidential election campaign, did he
appear in a beige T-shirt at the Black Sea vacation resort of Sochi
to make his first remarks about the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Putin's low profile is obvious enough. From the
moment the Kursk plunged to the bottom of the sea last Saturday _
the day the president went on holiday _ Kremlin officials probably
thought things would end badly.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Kommersant says bluntly that they did not want to take
responsibility. They preferred that those carrying out the rescue
should be seen as ``ultimately responsible for the people's
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin may have underestimated the impact of the long,
drawn out drama of the Kursk is having on Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of the 118 sailors, already dead or slowly
suffocating in their submarine, is having a bigger popular impact
than the death of over 2,500 Russian soldiers in Chechnya,'' said
Andrei Mironov, a Russian human-rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Putin, there is a limit to what he can do, but
what he has done he has done late. First there was a long delay in
accepting foreign help to try to save the men in the submarine.
Only Thursday was a naval conference called in Severomorsk to
investigate the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Putin directly responsible for the stream of
misinformation and apparent lies about the Kursk which followed the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The giant submarine was first described as ``malfunctioning''
and ``descending to the ocean floor'' last Sunday. In fact an
explosion _ or just possibly a collision _ on the evening of the
previous day sent the Kursk crashing into the sea floor with no
time to send a signal or release its satellite communications
beacon.
</P>
<P>
   A major military disaster was always likely as the armed forces
try to keep highly sophisticated equipment operating on a military
budget of only $5 billion. A senior submarine officer gets paid
only $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Putin is that he has portrayed himself as a
``hands-on'' president, in sharp contrast to his predecessor, Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it difficult for him to distance himself from the
tragedy of the Kursk. It does not mean, however, that he will not
try. When Chechen suicide bombers killed 36 Russian soldiers in
Chechnya earlier in the summer, he publicly dressed down Marshal
Igor Segeyev, his defense minister on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk submarine disaster does not prove that Putin is
personally ineffective, but it does show the emptiness of his
rhetoric about restoring Russia's military and political strength. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ ``I can't sit around waiting here any longer. I must go
up there,'' cried Valentina Staroseltseva, whose 20-year-old son,
Dmitry, is among the 118 submariners trapped on the Kursk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the city of Kursk, which regularly sends its young
men to serve in the Northern Fleet and after which the submarine
was named, collected money to help relatives like Mrs.
Staroseltseva to travel to the Arctic coast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their 45-hour train ride will bring them to Severomorsk, where
they will be able to see no more of the frantic rescue operation
than they have seen for the past five days on their television sets
at home. But at least they will feel nearer to their loved ones in
their underwater nightmare _ if, that is, the sailors are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   As it dawned on Russians that their image-obsessed leaders had
wasted days before allowing a British team to join the rescue
effort, there was mounting public anger and more sympathy for the
conscripts than the top brass on the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of the conscripts came from the city of Kursk,
500 km (325 miles) south of Moscow, which until the tragedy at sea
was known chiefly as the site of a major tank battle during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Kursk relatives, Mrs. Staroseltseva, a nurse, was most
open to being filmed by Russian television. The independent NTV
station showed her, looking businesslike in a red suit, preparing
to channel her desperate, maternal energy into the practicalities
of the long journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry that we did not let the British come sooner,'' she
said, referring to Moscow's three-day delay in accepting the
British offer of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I want everything to be done faster and better. I
think maybe he (Dmitry) is lying silently. As a mother, I hope he
is calm. The main thing is not to panic,'' said Mrs. Staroseltseva,
who had passed her own Orthodox Christian beliefs on to her son.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that Mrs. Staroseltseva had been pleased to see
Dmitry sent to the prestigious Northern Fleet instead of the
notorious ``stroibat'' (construction brigade), where bullying is
rife, or, worse, to what Russians call the ``meat grinder'' _
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' she said. ``We called
it our submarine. We were 100 percent confident in it. We really
believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry, who graduated with high marks from a railway college
before joining the navy, had to compete with other conscripts for a
posting on the Kursk. ``He has always loved swimming in the
river,'' said his mother. ``It was impossible to pull him out of
there. He loves machinery too.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent letter home, he enthused about life on the
modern, 14,000-ton, nuclear submarine, which had been the pride of
the fleet. ``It is just like home here. I'm really happy. We have
four meals a day, just like home. We will resurface in the middle
of August. See you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Staroseltseva had a premonition of disaster. She said
she felt ``ill and out of sorts'' on Sunday before the news of the
sinking broke. ``Then I heard the submarine was lying on the
seabed. I understood that something had gone wrong. The only thing
that helps me now is to pray.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ With every hour that passes, the chances of any of
the Kursk submarine crew surviving its sinking are dwindling. The
likely outcome will be a human tragedy and another blow to the
fragile, edgy pride of military Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the nuclear-powered submarine _ the flagship of the
Northern Fleet _ has strong symbolic significance for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle rescue, it will be the first major disaster
President Vladimir Putin has had to deal with since coming to
power, and a test of his ability to comfort and sustain, as well as
to rule.
</P>
<P>
   An untested politician and product of the foreign intelligence
apparatchik, Putin rose to power on the back of Boris Yeltsin's
senescence and the war in Chechnya. He has not, so far, had to
expend emotional or political capital on shoring up his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the vast scale of the Russian Federation, its
diverse population is highly engaged in and affected by national
tragedies. Those that emphasize the gap between the faded power of
the ``Great Soviet Union'' and associated mythologies and battered,
confused present-day Russia are especially deeply felt.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin donned an admiral's uniform when he went to
inspect the Northern Fleet after his election, a significant
gesture intended to remind the armed forces that he, rather than
any uppity defense minister or ambitious general, is ultimately in
charge of Russia's future and the projection of its military force.
</P>
<P>
   This costume drama has been followed by more concrete
undertakings. Last week's National Security Council meeting was a
bridgehead for his armed forces reform agenda. The outcome was
highly welcome to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to provide real and unsparing strategic focus, an
honest assessment of the country's decaying nuclear capability and
commitment to cut back on intercontinental ballistic missiles are
Putin's way of telling Russia's conservative military men to get
real.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the resigned joke within the Russian army was that
the nuclear forces had been ``decaying according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also seems to have settled the tug-of-war over the
future of military doctrine and the place of nuclear weapons in
that vision in favor of the more open-minded chief-of-staff of the
armed forces, Anatoli Kvashnin, and against the hidebound defense
minister, Marshall Sergeyev. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The only caveat is that Russians have heard at least some of
this before. First Yuri Andropov, then Mikhail Gorbachev,
recognized that the military doctrine which had led the USSR into
humiliation in Afghanistan and eaten up the defence budget
preparing to fight a war to keep the satellite states of Eastern
European within the sphere of influence had ended in tears,
humiliation and retreat. Yeltsin vowed to reform the armed forces
only to end up in an ungainly wrestling match with a succession of
appalling defence ministers, the desperate, ill-considered
intervention in Chechnya and subsequent humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin was the beneficiary of this chaos and carnage.
That does not mean that he is immune from the pressures that came
to weigh so heavily on his predecessors. He may be extremely smart:
but then neither Gorbachev nor Yeltsin - before the drink and
illness got him - were stupid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Russians speak of the new president as bringing ``a year of
hope'' _ the very modesty of the compliment being a recognition of
their low expectations of success.
</P>
<P>
   At such a time, the Barents Sea disaster is a highly
inconvenient distraction. As the land forces have declined in
status, bedevilled by their role in Afghanistan and the high
casualty rate suffered in Chechnya, the navy has come to be seen as
the most reliable and best-trained of the services.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of NATO's Kosovo intervention, where the Russian
navy was so short-shipped and short-staffed that it could not
provide adequate naval intelligence, Putin made clear that he
intends to revive it as a modestly sized but efficient force.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a trapped submarine, forfeited to the sea in these
most sensitive of international waters, is badly at odds with the
image of revived maritime glory and confident projection of power.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin struggled to pit their reforming zeal
against the grimmer realities of Russian life, and lost. When the
gap between the two grew too wide, their leaderships became mere
survival battles. From that point on, very little reform gets done
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Putin knows that he needs one big institutional reform under way
early in his presidency to provide a solid base. The armed forces
are the obvious place to start. Two pillars support his presidency
_ the domestic and the international. Both will be strengthened if
he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   He has no shortage of brand-new friends in the West. A new U.S.
president, be it Bush or Gore, will have no interest in picking a
fight with a halfway reasonable Russian leader. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all the alarmist talk of the impact on U.S.-Russian
relations of the proposed U.S. Nuclear Missile Defense (NMD)
program, some senior Russian officials are privately far more
relaxed at the prospect than Western liberal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Putin's incisions into the nuclear stockpiles indicate
that he has a clear understanding of how different the post-Cold
War order really is to the old bi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NMD, like any major shift in the security
architecture, needs to be conducted steadily and carefully. That is
not the same as saying that it should not be considered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the technology works now or not is beside the point. The
likelihood is that it _ or something like it _ will be made to work
some day in the none-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason if none other, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
did the right thing in seeking to create a link to Putin early in
the presidency and establishing his voice at the beginning of a new
conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Russian leaders, however promising, a grain
of caution is never amiss. Yeltsin's falling star exhibited the
Western tendency to back the man rather than the reform.
</P>
<P>
   I notice that Peter Hain, the smooth-talking British Foreign
Office minister, has taken to describing the Blair-Putin
relationship as ``close friendship.'' This is ludicrous, given that
they have met briefly twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the strangled tones of diplomacy, friendship means more
than that, unless he was using the Soviet-speak of druzhba _ the
vow of friendship rhetorically extended to anyone Moscow was not
actually at war with.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Putin's reforms and of Russia's relations with
the outside world are shrouded in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   We know that the reigning in of the corrupt business oligarchs,
the reconfiguration of nuclear capability and the armed forces, and
the willingness to play a conciliatory role in the Balkans are
positive beginnings which should be recognized and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But we also know, from the zigzags of recent Russian history,
how vulnerable its leaders are to the corrosive seepage of internal
resistance and the undermining of their first year of hope. That
has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The West's calculations and the schmoozy boasts of intimacy on
behalf of the British government should not be based on the airy
assumption that it has. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ With every hour that passes, the chances of any of
the Kursk submarine crew surviving its sinking are dwindling. The
likely outcome will be a human tragedy and another blow to the
fragile, edgy pride of military Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the nuclear-powered submarine _ the flagship of the
Northern Fleet _ has strong symbolic significance for the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle rescue, it will be the first major disaster
President Vladimir Putin has had to deal with since coming to
power, and a test of his ability to comfort and sustain, as well as
to rule.
</P>
<P>
   An untested politician and product of the foreign intelligence
apparatchik, Putin rose to power on the back of Boris Yeltsin's
senescence and the war in Chechnya. He has not, so far, had to
expend emotional or political capital on shoring up his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the vast scale of the Russian Federation, its
diverse population is highly engaged in and affected by national
tragedies. Those that emphasize the gap between the faded power of
the ``Great Soviet Union'' and associated mythologies and battered,
confused present-day Russia are especially deeply felt.
</P>
<P>
   President Putin donned an admiral's uniform when he went to
inspect the Northern Fleet after his election, a significant
gesture intended to remind the armed forces that he, rather than
any uppity defense minister or ambitious general, is ultimately in
charge of Russia's future and the projection of its military force.
</P>
<P>
   This costume drama has been followed by more concrete
undertakings. Last week's National Security Council meeting was a
bridgehead for his armed forces reform agenda. The outcome was
highly welcome to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to provide real and unsparing strategic focus, an
honest assessment of the country's decaying nuclear capability and
commitment to cut back on intercontinental ballistic missiles are
Putin's way of telling Russia's conservative military men to get
real.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the resigned joke within the Russian army was that
the nuclear forces had been ``decaying according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also seems to have settled the tug-of-war over the
future of military doctrine and the place of nuclear weapons in
that vision in favor of the more open-minded chief-of-staff of the
armed forces, Anatoli Kvashnin, and against the hidebound defense
minister, Marshall Sergeyev. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 400) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The only caveat is that Russians have heard at least some of
this before. First Yuri Andropov, then Mikhail Gorbachev,
recognized that the military doctrine which had led the USSR into
humiliation in Afghanistan and eaten up the defence budget
preparing to fight a war to keep the satellite states of Eastern
European within the sphere of influence had ended in tears,
humiliation and retreat. Yeltsin vowed to reform the armed forces
only to end up in an ungainly wrestling match with a succession of
appalling defence ministers, the desperate, ill-considered
intervention in Chechnya and subsequent humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin was the beneficiary of this chaos and carnage.
That does not mean that he is immune from the pressures that came
to weigh so heavily on his predecessors. He may be extremely smart:
but then neither Gorbachev nor Yeltsin - before the drink and
illness got him - were stupid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Russians speak of the new president as bringing ``a year of
hope'' _ the very modesty of the compliment being a recognition of
their low expectations of success.
</P>
<P>
   At such a time, the Barents Sea disaster is a highly
inconvenient distraction. As the land forces have declined in
status, bedevilled by their role in Afghanistan and the high
casualty rate suffered in Chechnya, the navy has come to be seen as
the most reliable and best-trained of the services.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of NATO's Kosovo intervention, where the Russian
navy was so short-shipped and short-staffed that it could not
provide adequate naval intelligence, Putin made clear that he
intends to revive it as a modestly sized but efficient force.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a trapped submarine, forfeited to the sea in these
most sensitive of international waters, is badly at odds with the
image of revived maritime glory and confident projection of power.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin struggled to pit their reforming zeal
against the grimmer realities of Russian life, and lost. When the
gap between the two grew too wide, their leaderships became mere
survival battles. From that point on, very little reform gets done
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Putin knows that he needs one big institutional reform under way
early in his presidency to provide a solid base. The armed forces
are the obvious place to start. Two pillars support his presidency
_ the domestic and the international. Both will be strengthened if
he succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   He has no shortage of brand-new friends in the West. A new U.S.
president, be it Bush or Gore, will have no interest in picking a
fight with a halfway reasonable Russian leader. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all the alarmist talk of the impact on U.S.-Russian
relations of the proposed U.S. Nuclear Missile Defense (NMD)
program, some senior Russian officials are privately far more
relaxed at the prospect than Western liberal opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Putin's incisions into the nuclear stockpiles indicate
that he has a clear understanding of how different the post-Cold
War order really is to the old bi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NMD, like any major shift in the security
architecture, needs to be conducted steadily and carefully. That is
not the same as saying that it should not be considered at all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the technology works now or not is beside the point. The
likelihood is that it _ or something like it _ will be made to work
some day in the none-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason if none other, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
did the right thing in seeking to create a link to Putin early in
the presidency and establishing his voice at the beginning of a new
conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to Russian leaders, however promising, a grain
of caution is never amiss. Yeltsin's falling star exhibited the
Western tendency to back the man rather than the reform.
</P>
<P>
   I notice that Peter Hain, the smooth-talking British Foreign
Office minister, has taken to describing the Blair-Putin
relationship as ``close friendship.'' This is ludicrous, given that
they have met briefly twice.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the strangled tones of diplomacy, friendship means more
than that, unless he was using the Soviet-speak of druzhba _ the
vow of friendship rhetorically extended to anyone Moscow was not
actually at war with.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Putin's reforms and of Russia's relations with
the outside world are shrouded in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   We know that the reigning in of the corrupt business oligarchs,
the reconfiguration of nuclear capability and the armed forces, and
the willingness to play a conciliatory role in the Balkans are
positive beginnings which should be recognized and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   But we also know, from the zigzags of recent Russian history,
how vulnerable its leaders are to the corrosive seepage of internal
resistance and the undermining of their first year of hope. That
has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The West's calculations and the schmoozy boasts of intimacy on
behalf of the British government should not be based on the airy
assumption that it has. &QL;

   BERLIN _ Reacting to the relentless drumbeat of daily
atrocities, the German government Wednesday announced the first of
its sweeping measures to combat the far right.
</P>
<P>
   Some DM75 million has been earmarked for a program that seeks
the de-Nazification of German youth.
</P>
<P>
   Further steps will be unveiled by Gerhard Schroder personally
when he returns from his vacation at the weekend. What seemed like
a gentle comeback for the chancellor now promises to be a gruelling
chore: Schroder will be touring the East for the next two weeks,
visiting some of the worst hot spots of the resurgent far right.
</P>
<P>
   The program unveiled Wednesday is intended to be just the
beginning of what promises to be the most concerted attack on
right-wing extremism since the immediate aftermath of the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   The money is to be spent on extra lessons for children on German
history and on the threatening concept _ often denounced by
mainstream conservatives _ of ``multiculturalism.''
</P>
<P>
   A hot line for reporting racist violence will be set up. Private
groups and charities combating ignorance and xenophobia on
shoestring budgets can look forward to a windfall of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   The government will train staff who work on public transport not
to look away when foreigners are being harassed, and hire young
computer experts to track down neo-Nazi Web sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, social workers have been arguing that
poor education, especially in the East, was one of the main causes
of the simmering hatred towards foreigners. Their pleas have until
now fallen on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is most acute in parts of the East where the local youth
have no experience of immigrants. Two years ago, nearly 13 percent
of voters in the eastern Land of Saxony-Anhalt voted for a far
right party, even though only 2 percent of the region's population
was of foreign origin.
</P>
<P>
   Extra lessons, though, will not be enough. Renate Kunast, one of
the Greens' two co-leaders, Wednesday called for retraining of
teachers in the East, because they are seen as part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The communist authorities planted the myth that Nazism had been
the work of an isolated bunch of people, successfully purged from
the Workers' Paradise, but still lurking in the decadent West.
</P>
<P>
   Many East German teachers therefore have an ambivalent attitude
to the Third Reich, and fail to see similarities between today's
xenophobic banter in the classroom and the chain of events that had
led to the rise of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot more than DM75 million to wipe away the
ingrained misconceptions of two generations. The opposition Free
Democrats are urging as much as DM300 million to be splashed out on
a national brainwashing program at schools.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond further training, the government is expected to set up a
panel of eminent personalities to coordinate the intellectual drive
against far-right tendencies. The real problem, as many politicians
are increasingly prepared to admit, is that the dislike of
foreigners is anything but a marginal phenomenon in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Xenophobia is socially respectable. Crime, for instance, is
routinely portrayed by the media and leading politicians as a
foreign pursuit. Such an initiative was launched earlier this week
in Germany's most populous Land, North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The regional capital Dusseldorf was the scene last month of a
bomb attack injuring 10 immigrants from the former Soviet Union,
including six Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Clement, the Land prime minister and one of Schroder`s
closest political allies, is putting pressure on the local police
and judiciary to act tough on hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   This line of attack, coupled with moves to ban the far right
National Democratic Party (NPD), is expected to be at the center of
Schroder's plan to rid the country of neo-Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uproar over Dusseldorf and a string of outrages,
every day brings news of fresh attacks. Wednesday, for instance,
came reports from Hamburg of a neo-Nazi youth stabbing a Turkish
man.
</P>
<P>
   On the northeastern coast, about 250 posters have gone up
attacking the ``murder'' of Rudolf Hess. Today (Thursday) marks the
anniversary of the death of Hitler's deputy at Spandau prison, and
the lads in black leather jackets and combat boots will be marching
again. &QL;

 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, Yajalon is located about 90
miles north of San Cristobal de las Casas, in Chiapas state.
 &HT;    For Use Sun. Aug. 20 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAJALON, MEXICO _ Pigs snorted in mud and a chilly rain soaked
the mountains outside as Nicolas Lopez described how armed men
staged a terrifying raid on his hamlet earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Firing weapons into the air, the invaders claimed rights to the
villagers' land, setting fire to five huts, chasing about 30
families into hiding, and looting what little corn and clothes the
peasants had, Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as he shivered at the memory, Lopez managed a smile. On
Sunday(8/20) the Mayan Indian will vote in a historic election for
the new governor of Chiapas, one of Mexico's most impoverished and
volatile states. And if pre-election opinion polls are accurate,
Mexico's 71-year-old ruling party is headed for another defeat
after being trounced in July 2's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for a solution to our problems,'' said Lopez,
who will vote for Pablo Salazar, candidate of an opposition
alliance that could unseat Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, from a state considered a barometer of social
justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is home to the Zapatista Indian rebels, who launched an
insurrection against the Mexican government here in January 1994
that still hasn't been resolved. Since that time, armed
paramilitary groups loyal to the ruling party have also evolved,
periodically attacking Zapatista sympathizers like Lopez's hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All government ties to these paramilitary groups will end (if
the PRI loses). One way to dismantle these groups is to simply not
guarantee them impunity any longer,'' said a sweat-soaked Salazar,
pausing for an interview and quick lunch during one of his final
grueling all-day campaign swings along Chiapas' sweltering tropical
coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up and want change. And change is contagious,''
he said, waving at a marimba band in a restaurant that played a
song as a tribute to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiapas is considered a bulwark state for the PRI, and its
candidate, Sami David, has counted on a sympathetic state media
establishment that, as usual, offered slavishly favorable coverage
to him. A cordial man who is warm one-on-one, David also touched a
traditionally conservative nerve here with a campaign warning that
a Salazar victory could provoke even more instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, an era of stability is at stake,'' David told a
recent gathering of PRI youth in the capital city of Tuxtla
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern part of Chiapas is a checkerboard of Mayan
Indian villages divided between Zapatistas and PRI loyalists who
sporadically clash over land rights and political differences. The
collection of huts where Lopez lived _ nestled in rugged hills
above the city of Yajalon (pronounced, ``ya-ha-LONE'') _ was
eventually occupied by Mexican Army troops. But since the villagers
also fear the army, they refused to return.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox has sparked
hope for a peaceful resolution to the cycle of violence. Fox
ousted, for the first time in seven decades, the PRI, which the
Zapatistas blame for the squalid conditions the southern state's
Indians live in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, Subcommander Marcos, the primary
Zapatista spokesman, issued a statement reiterating the rebels'
position that they would negotiate again if a peace accord signed
in 1996 is implemented and federal troops are withdrawn from Indian
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a promoter of free-market economic policies, which the
Zapatistas oppose, but he has pledged to revive negotiations with
the rebels and send Mexico's Congress the stalled 1996 accord that
grants sweeping Indian rights. If elected, Salazar could also set
an example that change can be forced at the ballot box rather than
at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, not even the most radical person in the country can
dispute the legitimacy of a Fox government,'' Salazar said,
predicting that the Zapatistas can't dismiss electoral change.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent campaign stop in the gritty border town of Hidalgo
on the Guatemala border, supporters were enraptured with Salazar's
pledge to address the demands of the poor _ including the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Zapatistas said our fight is against being forgotten. They
said there is a worse death than dying from diarrhea or from
curable diseases,'' the candidate shouted from the stage to wild
cheers. ``There is a worse death, say our Indian brothers, and that
is , you people are about to do something about that painful
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar is a federal senator and former member of the PRI, which
he says used to be the only option available to someone who wanted
to get into political office. But he left the party in May 1999
after a long string of disputes over the government's handling of
the Chiapas conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He is unaffiliated now, but is representing a four-party
alliance that includes Fox's conservative National Action Party, or
PAN, and the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD. The two
parties clash ideologically, but for the purpose of defeating the
PRI in Chiapas they pooled their funds and worked hand-in-hand for
Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   An exhausted-looking David said he isn't giving up, and he
dismisses polls like one conducted by Reforma newspapers, which
gave Salazar a 9-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Chiapas, the conditions to avoid confrontations or even
social collapse are being constructed with great difficulty,'' he
said an interview with Cox Newspapers. He had a badly bruised and
swollen ear, the result of an injury when someone threw a metal
weight at him in Salazar's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a platform for electoral reform,'' he insisted. ``The
offers for change have to be based on clarity and not on
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida, won in
Chiapas last month. But Salazar is counting on the combined votes
of the PAN and the PRD to carry him to victory. His campaign
posters say, ``the PRI has already lost in Chiapas, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory could also inspire PRI desertion.
</P>
<P>
   Among some of Chiapas' poor peasant farmers, Fox is now seen as
Mexico's new ``tlatoani,'' the Aztec word for ``maximum leader,''
Salazar campaign aide Mauricio Gandara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the 'Papa PRI' has died now. So they are
wondering who will be managing the money and resources. They are
thinking that now there is a 'Papa Fox,''' Gandara said. ``This is
the product of 71 years of domination by one party.''
</P>
<P>
   Araceli Burguete, a Chiapas sociologist, said the PRI still
controls many Indians in the state. It will probably be business as
usual in Indian towns where the local PRI leader habitually orders
residents how to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But even in PRI strongholds, some residents appeared to be
bracing for change.
</P>
<P>
   Chenalho is an Indian town that produced at least one of the
convicted killers implicated in the infamous December 1997 massacre
of 45 people in the pro-Zapatista village of Acteal, just minutes
away.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Jimenez, 82, said he would listen to the advice of
village leaders, but wasn't sure who he'd vote for. He pulled
dismissively at a PRI T-shirt he was wearing and said almost
apologetically, ``This is five years old now.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Luis Ortiz, a resident who has joined the movement to
deploy thousands of election observers here, complained that the
PRI had donated a Ford truck to the town ``in exchange for votes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Acteal, the site of the massacre, affiliates of the Zapatista
Army said they didn't plan to vote and declined to speak further.
Rebel leaders have been silent, other than to say they won't call
for a general boycott of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Acteal who sympathize with the rebels but don't belong
to the army will cast ballots for Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Salazar doesn't win, we will think there has been fraud,''
said Spanish-speaking spokesman Agustin Vasquez. ``Acteal is
willing to vote for Salazar. The victims of the massacre are
waiting for justice and for change.''

Philly, all things Texan and Bush were cool, hinting at the
possibility that a Bush win might make Texas trendier than it has

scarcer and less effective in a digital economy. Indeed, 1999 saw
fewer work stoppages than any other year in six decades. (Dart, Cox

dams on the lower Chattahoochee to float what was expected to be

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill wanted to hook up his
computer to the Internet, his dorm room was a mess of disassembled
beds. Aside from start-of-the-school-year housekeeping lapses,
North Carolina's flagship public university is taking major steps

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I am on the lookout for

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Texans like to brag about big.
Everything is braggable here, and size certainly qualifies. But one

   UPS-TRACKING _ ATLANTA _ Deep in the fine print of all UPS
shipping contracts, there's an item that allows the company to
charge $3 each time a shipper tracks a package on the company Web
site. The charge is only used for companies that track hundreds of
packages a day and place great demands on the UPS information
network. But critics say it's meant to keep freight bill auditors
from collecting refunds on ``guaranteed'' shipments that arrive
late. This is the Information Age, UPS has figured out a way to
keep some information away from those who would use it to cost the
company money. (Hirschman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

more Kid's Meal to get a dinosaur from the latest Disney movie? But

 &HT;    Waters wit runs dry in `Demented'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been decades since Divine and dog feces became one of
cinema's signature moments. While the rest of the world was lining
up for stuff like ``The Poseidon Adventure,'' John Waters was
making, well, John Waters movies _ savvy outsider flicks with a
nice sick edge and a gleefully amateurish tone.
</P>
<P>
   The world has wised up (and dumbed down) considerably since
then. Now mainstream audiences groove on the gross-out obviousness
of ``Scary Movie'' or ``Road Trip.'' But John Waters is still
making John Waters movies. Sicker, yes, but the sickness comes off
as almost benign compared with the daily crudeness of tabloid TV.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the trouble with the amusing but ultimately tiresome
``Cecil B. DeMented.'' It's just not demented enough.
</P>
<P>
   A gang of self-described outlaw filmmakers kidnaps a glamorous
Hollywood star named Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith), who's come
to Baltimore for the premiere of her newest bit of glossy schlock.
Led by the titular Cecil (Stephen Dorff), whose motto is ``Death to
Mainstream Cinema,'' they force her to star in their no-budget
underground movie. Initially appalled by teen freaks with the
hallowed names of such independent-minded filmmakers as Sam Fuller
or David Lynch tattooed on their bodies, Honey is won over to their
cause. In other words, it's the Patty Hearst story refracted
through a melange of cinema in-jokes (which becomes especially
fitting since Hearst herself, a Waters regular, plays the mom of
one of the guerrilla moviemakers).
</P>
<P>
   You have to like a movie in which the protagonists storm a
theater playing ``Patch Adams: The Director's Cut'' or crash the
set of the ``Forrest Gump'' sequel, ``Gump Again.'' Plus, in
attacking the megaplex mentality, Waters also manages to pinpoint a
central problem in today's independent movie scene. As one
character proclaims, the studios ``have stolen our sex and co-opted
our violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, too much of ``Cecil B. DeMented'' is silly
and just plain slapdash. There's a laziness in Waters' work that,
in his outlaw days, seemed simultaneously daring and necessary. But
today, he's a veritable brand name _ a safe choice (relatively
speaking) for those moviegoers who want to be hip but don't really
want to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Dorff is appropriately wild-eyed and off-the-wall, but he
actually gave a riskier performance in the same vein in the little
seen ``City of Industry.'' As for Griffith, she's absolutely
convincing as the catered-to star who throws a hissy fit when
forced to ride in a white stretch limo (her contract specifies
black). But she's less effective as the newly minted revolutionary.
Still, it's good to hear her declare, ``It's a free country. People
can make bad movies if they so desire.'' Having inflicted stuff
like ``Milk Money'' and ``A Stranger Among Us'' on moviegoers, she
should know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith and Stephen Dorff. Directed by John
Waters. Rated R for profanity, sex, violence and substance abuse.
At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not quite demented enough.

 &HT;    Gentle humor as a saving grace
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' has everything it takes to be hopelessly twee:
steaming teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a rowdy
pub and some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the
credit of everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title
role, the comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. It's a
guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned Devine'' mold.
</P>
<P>
   Recently widowed when her husband chose to step off an airplane
sans parachute, Blethyn's Grace is a middle-aged woman we meet
trying to keep herself together at his funeral. Her customary
gentility threatens to give way to hysteria, and no wonder. Not
only has her husband's mistress, Honey (Diana Quick), shown up at
the graveside, but Grace is soon to learn what everyone else in the
seaside village already knows: The dearly departed has left her
saddled with massive debt.
</P>
<P>
   As creditors turn up at the front door to evaluate her assets
(furniture, antiques, even the lawn mower), Grace meets an unlikely
savior: her gardener, Mathew (Craig Ferguson, also co-writer and
producer of the film). It seems that the kindhearted pothead is
having trouble growing his secret stash of marijuana and wonders if
Grace _ an enthusiastic horticulturist with a state-of-the-art
greenhouse _ might lend her expertise. The profits from selling the
crop, he explains, could save her house from foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Director Nigel Cole aims for the genial charms of the old Ealing
comedies, and often comes close. As Grace and Matthew embark on
their enterprise, the neighbors keep tabs. Their illegal project is
an open secret, thanks to the beacon of light that shoots out of
Grace's greenhouse every night. The whole village, as in ``Ned
Devine'' or Bill Forsyth's lovely ``Local Hero,'' becomes a
supporting character. Some standouts in the cast are Martin Clunes
as a doctor who does inhale, and Valerie Edmond as Matthew's
strong-willed, disapproving girlfriend. Phyllida Law and Linda Kerr
Scott as a couple of spinster shopkeepers deliver the movie's
funniest scene, unwittingly brewing up some ganja tea and melting
down in stoned hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   When the plot contrives to send Grace off to London to find a
dealer (Tcheky Karyo, a mix of sexy and sinister), it's mainly an
excuse to parade Blethyn around in an all-white suit, a
hausfrau-turned-Superfly. The movie loses some of its charm at the
very end, with a too-neat coda that seems tacked on. But for the
most part, ``Saving Grace'' can give you a mild contact high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson. Rated R for drug
content and profanity. At AMC Phipps Plaza 14 and United Artists
North Point Market. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A sweet little comedy in the Ealing spirit.

 &HT;    Odd `Bridge' leads nowhere special
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrice Leconte has made two of my favorite films _ ``Monsieur
Hire'' and ``The Hairdresser's Husband'' _ so I was hardly
surprised when his new picture, ``Girl on the Bridge,'' began on
such an enticingly dolorous and intriguing note.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacularly gorgeous gamin (Vanessa Paradis) _ we're talking
in the same league as Jean Seberg in ``Breathless'' _ is making a
confession to an off-screen presence (a therapist, we assume). We
soon learn she's as stunningly depressed as she is stunningly
beautiful. Barely in her 20s, she already sees her life as ``a
waiting room in which all sorts of people rush by with places to
go, people to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Her point is, she has no people to meet, no places to go. No
wonder the next time we see her she's perched on a bridge, about to
plunge into the Seine. Just in time, a soulful-looking middle-aged
man (Daniel Auteuil) happens by and says, ``You look like a girl
who's about to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, it turns out, a match made in movie heaven. She's
suicidal. He's a professional knife thrower, always in search of a
new target. They become a team, and suddenly their luck turns.
Everything that happens is good. Her faith in him restores both his
skill and his faith in himself. His faith in her . . . well, let's
just say that soon she's flashing her smashing smile and back to
sleeping around (though not with him, despite the undeniable erotic
charge in their relationship).
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in a luminous black and white, ``Girl on the Bridge''
initially creates an aura of romantic intensity as well as a
humorous look at the fringe life of a specialty act (knife
throwers, we learn, never follow silent acts). But after about an
hour, the movie loses its way.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the embarassing age difference between
the two leads, which, of course, is a pointless complaint these
days. More troubling is the way their relationship never grows. At
first we're engaged by these characters, but then we want something
to grab us emotionally, to make us want them to stay together at
all costs. And that simply doesn't happen. It's as if Auteuil _ a
tremendously skilled actor _ has taken a seat in his co-star's
waiting room and she never notices.
</P>
<P>
   The movie wants to say things about luck and chance and the
freakish fairy tale aspect of true love. But mostly it just says
that if you ever feel like jumping off a bridge, you're more likely
to be stopped if you look like Paradis than if you look like Janet
Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl on the Bridge''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis. Directed by Patrice
Leconte. Rated R for sexual themes. Subtitles. At Tara. 1 hour, 31
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Starts great but loses steam.

THESE `KINGS' ARE CRUDE, NOT ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
For some people, the title ``The Original Kings of Comedy''
doubtless evokes images of Charlie Chaplin or the Marx Brothers.
<P>
   With narrower definitions, you could probably get away with
calling such comedians as Lenny Bruce or Richard Pryor ``original
kings.'' They were all originals, though deciding who deserves the
article ``the'' before the title is a problem. What of the hairy
forebear who kept his clan in stitches, rolling with laughter on
the cold cave floor?
</P>
<P>
   Right away then, Spike Lee's new movie gets into trouble. One
wonders what went through Eddie Murphy's mind when he heard the
title. Why isn't he a comedy king? And surely he's as original as
the funny men featured here.
</P>
<P>
   The four comedians who make up the Kings of Comedy road show
from which this concert movie was extracted all hail from
television. They rose to fame on shows such as HBO's ``Def Comedy
Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   These programs target an audience often called urban but which
more accurately includes hip black teens, young blacks who want to
be hip and supposed hipsters who want to be black.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the favored subject matter, comedians who let on
that they read newspapers (or, heaven forbid, books) or who think
about anything other than sex and music are automatically
disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   A more accurate title would've been ``The Current Kings of
Vulgarity.'' Or maybe: ``Today's Boobs of Crude.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the jokes can be printed here. The comics _ Steve Harvey,
D.L. Hughley, Bernie Mac and Cedric the Entertainer _ like to say
their profanity- and stereotype-filled bits draw on life as they
know it. Each comically exaggerates his own experience, they say,
and then offers it back to an appreciative audience that can relate
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Young black audiences seem to eat this stuff up. It's probably
safe to say, though, that for a large portion of the audience, much
like the mixed crowd who buy rap records, the shows provide their
primary window to African-American life.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, Hughley, Lee and Cedric the Entertainer (what kind of
name is Cedric the Entertainer anyway?) appeared on the ABC talk
show ``Politically Incorrect'' the other night. Host Bill Maher
mentioned that their jokes repeatedly portray black people as
violent, sports-loving, sex-obsessed, dance-crazed alcoholics and
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a way to laugh at yourself without dehumanizing
yourself or degrading yourself,'' Lee volunteered in the comedians'
defense. ``There's a difference between laughing at somebody and
laughing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not explain what that difference might be.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the humor on display in the movie is very funny, but
much of it is offensive and demeaning; it is of interest primarily
for its sociological value. It's instructive to know what young
people are laughing at these days. It's instructive to see what
type of minstrelsy black performers still think they must do to
attract and hold an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Of all of these comics, Harvey is the one most likely to be
remembered 10 years from now, the one most likely to earn the right
to be called a king of comedy for his keenly observant and socially
aware, sly humor.
</P>
<P>
   He'd do well to get himself away from the bulging-eyed shuckers
and jivers he appears with here. They can do nothing but bring him
down, the same way they drag the audience down into the gutter
during their acts.

 &HT;    Latex and all, the lizard's back in step in Tokyo
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Godzilla, king of the monsters, ruler of the rubber suit, mack
daddy of the megaplex, has gone back to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Not Madison Square Garden _ that ill-conceived place where
``Godzilla'' director Roland Emmerich and his computerized giant
iguana limped through a thoroughly disgusting and maddening film
version two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No, we're talking about the big lizard's Eden. His early film
roots in movies like 1956's ``Godzilla, King of the Monsters.'' His
Tokyo. Now, after 1998's Matthew Broderick debacle, the biggest of
the big guys is back and firmly in the hands of the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody does him better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' is everything hard-core fans want it to be. So
corny. So campy. So ``MST3K''-ready. And, God bless it, so badly
dubbed in English it soars.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's bad filmmaking. Sure it's a guy _ actor Tsutomu
Kitagawa _ clad in a nearly vintage latex Godzilla getup and
stomping through Tokyo, knocking down cardboard mini-buildings and
upending toy-sized cars with his gnarly feet. But that's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Godzilla movies have little use for computer-generated
images. And though they are employed in ``Godzilla 2000,'' they are
mostly background enhancements that give the film a more modern
feel.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is achingly simple. A corporate bigwig wants to kill
Godzilla. Others want to scientifically study and understand him.
There's also an eerie, kabillion-years-old alien ship that awakens
and fights with Godzilla, then sucks up the monster's essence and
creates its own formidable, giant, actor-in-a-suit freakazoid.
</P>
<P>
   The film smartly pokes fun at several American-made summer epics
_ like ``Jurassic Park,'' ``Independence Day'' and ``Twister.'' One
witty turn features a trio of Godzilla chasers known as the
Godzilla Prediction Network. Like tornado hunters, they race in a
mini-van to the latest sighting of Godzilla to track his movements.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, ``Godzilla 2000'' forthrightly skewers Emmerich's
failed ``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans complained bitterly that at the end of the 1998 movie,
Emmerich's Godzilla was killed by two simple jet missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000's'' answer: In an early confrontation with the
Japanese military, a fuselage of dozens of missiles relentlessly
peppers the monster again and again with ever-violent explosions.
Once the smoke finally clears, Godzilla stands tall.
</P>
<P>
   They don't call him the king of the monsters for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Takehiro Murata, Hiroshi Abe, Naomi Nishida and Tsutomu
Kitagawa (as Godzilla). Rated PG for monster violence and mild
profanity. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Wazzup!

BRENDA BLETHYN SPLENDID IN SAVING GRACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC HARRISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
The first we see of the greenhouse that is a major setting in
``Saving Grace,'' the title character is inside, solemnly picking a
lily. A puff of what looks like smoke drifts into view. Because of
what we've already seen _ a gravedigger kicking back to enjoy
marijuana, a movie title that turns to smoke and blows away _ we
assume yet another local is having a furtive toke.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It turns out the cloud is from a humidifier. Not everyone in
this picturesque village is sky-high on grass, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   We've already been sent several clues that this latest English
import takes place in environs not unlike the ones In ``Waking Ned
Divine'' and ``The Full Monty.'' This is an England filled with
eccentric characters and gentle humor, yet one not untouched by the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' is particularly reminiscent of ``Waking Ned
Divine'' in that the village's good and charming denizens, while
unfailingly polite, harbor complete disregard for anything smacking
of authority or officialdom. There's nothing wrong with
circumventing the law, in their book, if some good might come of it
for the local folk.
</P>
<P>
   And in both movies, outsiders _ especially those wearing
neckties and the haughty air of a Londoner _ are to be dodged or
outsmarted; chances are they come carrying trouble.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of ``Saving Grace,'' there's even a skinny old codger
running around naked, just like in the earlier comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful Brenda Blethyn plays Grace, a recent widow (and
world-class gardener) who learns that her husband not only was
stepping out on her with another woman, but also that he's
squandered their money and left her deeply in debt. Everybody in
town seemed to know it before Grace did.
</P>
<P>
   Having sold her furniture to pay creditors, Grace now is on the
verge of losing her home. Her only salvation, she slowly realizes,
is to go into the marijuana business with her hired hand, who is
played by Craig Ferguson, who also is one of this movie's writers
and producers.
</P>
<P>
   Blethyn, who gave splendid performances as disheveled,
less-savory characters in ``Secrets &AMP; Lies'' in 1996 and ``Little
Voice'' in 1998, here plays someone who looks and behaves closer to
the way she does in real life _ an attractive if average
middle-aged woman. This is a less-showy performance than the ones
she gave in those other two movies, for which she was nominated for
Academy Awards, but it's just as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Grace appears to be a rather proper lady in
mourning. As her troubles build, she moves up in notches to shock
and outrage and then to resignation before finally emerging a
survivor, a determined and resourceful woman willing to do almost
anything to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's funniest scenes has her, dressed in a white
pantsuit, a scarf and jaunty feathered hat, standing on a crowded,
seedy London street corner, trying to peddle drugs to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Learning the ropes, she wrangles a meeting with a high-level
dealer. They hold their business meeting in the dank men's restroom
of a closed nightclub, beside the ever-sighing urinals. With the
sound of water dripping all around them, they seal their deal with
a toast.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, from time to time, succumbs to cutesiness, the
primary pitfall for these gentle British comedies that the best of
them manage to sidestep. You can't object too strenuously, though,
because one or two of the cuter scenes also happen to be among the
funniest. Nobody goes to movies like this looking for gritty
realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' once and for all establishes that the ``just
say no'' era now is officially behind us. After largely
disappearing from the movies, marijuana has come back in a big way.
Central characters smoke and/or sell the stuff in ``American
Beauty,'' the upcoming ``Tao of Steve,'' Ice Cube's ``Friday''
movies and in other recent films. In none of those movies, though,
is it presented as so wholesome an endeavor as it is here.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the biggest pot smokers are portrayed as ditzy
dropouts from the high-pressured way of life _ not the sort of role
models today's young people would want to have. And the biggest
pothead of all in this movie is a doctor who's downright
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Saving Grace,'' that will have to suffice as social
statement. &QL;

 &HT;    `Cell' confined by poor story line
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' is the visually provocative, narratively impaired
feature debut by Tarsem (full name: Tarsem Singh), who made his rep
in commercials and music videos, including R.E.M.'s ``Losing My
Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagery, you might say, is his middle name, and he certainly
knows his audience, i.e. teenage boys. But anyone hoping for
something with the sci-fi smarts of, say, ``Blade Runner'' best
wait for the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' centers on warped serial killer Carl Stargher
(Vincent D'Onofrio), who likes to trap his female victims in a
subterranean tank that, after 40 hours, automatically fills with
water. They drown and he then does various unspeakable things
(mostly unseen) to them, which, as far as I could tell, involve
bleach and Barbie dolls. He's also into body-piercing. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   When he captures his latest prey, a young woman named Julie
(Tara Subkoff), who does all the things the TV specials tell young
women to do when entering a deserted garage and still gets
snatched, the police, led by Detective Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn),
manage to track him down. But Carl, who suffers from a rare brain
disorder, has a seizure and goes into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   What's a cop to do when the killer is in custody but the victim
is still in danger?
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, just nearby, a team of scientists (Marianne
Jean-Baptiste and Dylan Baker) have been experimenting with a
radical form of sci-fi therapy. An intrepid child psychologist
named Catherine (Jennifer Lopez) enters the mind of her patient _
in this case, a young boy named Edward who's been in a coma for
years. Would she be willing to take a stroll through Carl's
deranged brain to find out where he's stashed Julie?
</P>
<P>
   Parts of ``The Cell'' are impressively imaginative. The opening
sequence, in which Catherine travels through Edward's dream desert,
is like ``Lawrence of Arabia'' on acid. But being inside Carl's
head is like being trapped inside a bad music video. So many of the
images are so garishly adolescent in their misogynist fantasies of
female bondage and mutilation that they're more laughable than
horrifying. Other ``trippy'' sequences suggest failed Fruitopia
ads. And the way that Catherine connects with the inner Carl _ by
connecting with his abused child-self _ is TV-movie sappy.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who seemed so promising in ``Swingers,'' is a virtual
blank while the ever-talented D'Onofrio wisely spends most of the
movie unconscious _ except for some fantasy sequences in which he's
required to dress like Elton John circa 1975 and jerk around like
he did as the bug-possessed farmer in ``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez isn't too bad. She's more a likable presence than an
accomplished actress, but she pulls off what's required of her.
Which includes wearing some truly over-the-top costumes that are so
extreme that they may snag an Oscar nomination for Japanese costume
designer Eiko Ishioka. Among the outfits: a feathered white gown, a
black-and-bare bodysuit and something that looks like Buddhist nun
wear.
</P>
<P>
   The major problem is that ``The Cell'' constantly echoes ``The
Silence of the Lambs,'' only minus the intricate character
interplay, Jonathan Demme's direction and the taut story line. But
give Tarsem credit for anticipating the inevitable comparisons.
Carl's first victim _ dead by the time we see her _ looks a bit
like Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez, Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
Directed by Tarsem. Rated R for violence, language and nudity. 1
hour, 52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Don't get trapped in this one.

 &HT;    A `Psycho' spoof of surfer films
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to parody something that was goofy to start with. Or
maybe it's too easy. That's the problem with ``Psycho Beach
Party,'' playwright Charles Busch's affectionate but muddled
tribute to 1950s surfer-boy-and-bikini-babe movies, spiced with
dollops of Freudian psychology and campy humor.
</P>
<P>
   The original Frankie-and-Annette movies (and their clones) were
cartoons to begin with. Spoofing them is redundant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' starts off pleasantly silly, as 16-year-old Florence
(Lauren Ambrose) tests her mettle with the cool surfing crowd, led
by Starcat (Nicholas Brendan) and hep senior sun god Kanaka (Thomas
Gibson), who spouts rhyming beatnik aphorisms. Lauren learns to
hang 10 and earns the nickname ``Chicklet,'' because she's not
quite a full-fledged chick.
</P>
<P>
   And every now and then, Chicklet channels a second personality,
the diva Ann Bowman, a man-hungry dominatrix (much to the secretly
masochistic Kanaka's delight). Could the girl's split personality
be connected with the serial killing of surf-happy teens?
</P>
<P>
   It's up to police captain Monica Stark to find out, as played by
cross-dressing Busch, channeling Susan Hayward. Busch starred as
li'l Chicklet on the New York stage, and while Ambrose is perky and
game as the multiple-personality teen queen (especially in a third
persona, sassy homegirl Tylene), the part really begs for a guy in
a dress: Ann Bowman is a classic drag-queen role, a gay man's
construct of a martini-fueled madonna-monster.
</P>
<P>
   The game cast includes Matt Keeslar working a heavy accent as a
Swedish exchange student staying with Chicklet and her mother (Beth
Broderick, doing a lethal Donna Reed impression). Nick Cornish and
Andrew Levitas play a couple of buff, repressed surfers whose
constant horseplay increasingly looks like foreplay. There's also a
sharp turn by Kimberley Davies as a baby-voiced, Monroe-like
starlet, whose films include such drive-in wonders as ``The Pizza
Waitress With Three Heads'' and ``Sex Kittens Go Bossa Nova.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho Beach Party'' is sometimes more fun to describe than to
watch. Its middle section feels soft and aimless. Director Robert
Lee King shoots most of the scenes as master shots, with no
intercutting, no reaction shots or closeups. You can't tell if he's
paying homage to slack '50s cinematography or being slack himself.
The actors appear physically uneasy as scenes tick on without a cut
or a change of camera. Busch, adapting his play, has tweaked some
of the script, adding a nifty trick ending. But ``Psycho'' never
really slays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho Beach Party''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lauren Ambrose, Thomas Gibson and Nicholas Brendon.
Unrated. At Lefont Plaza. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An affectionate but awkward campy spoof of beach
movies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Complaining seems to be an inherent part
of Argentine life, coupled with easy disappointment and fast
disenchantment. These laments haunt the words and music of the
tango and the busy offices of the nation's psychoanalysts.
</P>
<P>
   But I haven't seen Argentineans so depressed as when I passed
fleetingly through Buenos Aires and on my journey to Argentina's
northern provinces last month.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has just released discouraging unemployment
figures _ 15.4 percent _ a recent Gallup poll reveals that fully
one third of young Argentineans yearn to leave the country. Things,
though, appear to be no worse than in 1995, when those indexes were
higher, or in 1988, when the country was stuck in a relentless
recession. Argentineans today are simply tired of so many miseries
piling up, one after the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the local bars in Ceres, a small city in northern Santa Fe
Province, in the sleepy service stations on Route 34, or in the
small grocery shops in the seaport district of San Telmo, you can
hear the same chorus of complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Their criticism is not centered solely on President Fernando de
la Rua's government, but on the entire spectrum of political
leadership. Their desperation is extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for this, on first examination, seem to be more
subjective than objective, so it's rather difficult to rationalize.
What is obvious is the fact that the government has had only seven
months in power and its sluggish ``globalized'' economy offers few
means for performing miracles.
</P>
<P>
   But who can forget Carlos Menem's catastrophic first seven
months in office, complete with a runaway economy, rumors of
corruption in presidential circles and an imminent threat of
military coup.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a marked difference between the decade's
early years and now: the popularity of the former president, who
had once played on Argentina's national soccer team, and who
nightly could be seen dining with celebrities, was always very high
_ 70 percent to 80 percent. De la Rua's popularity, on the other
hand, has plummeted to less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Few people forget that Menem's government was characterized by a
general ongoing levity in the handling of public affairs, while the
honest determination of this administration is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   So, where's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A community's state of mind is better reflected in popular
expression than in opinion polls. During the 1990s everything was
spectacular. Now, reality has set it and it is terrifying: rising
prices, taxes hikes, so-called Budget tightening, shrinking
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the sound of fear has been heard off and on in
Buenos Aires. Now it envelopes the whole country. The cold is
terrifying, the helplessness, too.
</P>
<P>
   When I crossed the wintry fields of Santiago de Estero in
mid-July, I was surprised to hear village folk sending each other
trifling messages over the radio. I wrote down two of them,
redolent with regional intonations and colloquialisms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cachito: Go to Aunt Juana Rosa's house and tell her Mother is
waiting for her at the bus stop, and tell her not to be too long
because Mother's legs are hurting.'' And this other message:
``Anibal, I won't be able to be at your cousin's house at five
o'clock. I can get there by eight o'clock, but if you can't make
it, we'll see each other tomorrow. Please give me an answer through
this radio.''
</P>
<P>
   At the service station in Colonia Dora, in the heart of the
province, I asked how important these radio announcements were.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are very poor,'' the station manager told me.
``Nobody has a telephone. We `talk' by radio, when we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tucuman, the unemployment numbers are staggering. Twenty
percent of able-bodied workers do not have jobs and 50 percent have
no fixed occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalks of 25 de Mayo Street, the nerve center of the
provincial capital, teem with peddlers hawking their wares that
include everything imaginable, from fortune telling to Bolivian
spices.
</P>
<P>
   Legal money is almost nonexistent. Most of the transactions are
conducted with provincial bonds, bills of 1 to 20 pesos that look
like Monopoly money and have uncertain bank endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Argentina, the U.S. dollar is as common as the peso.
</P>
<P>
   But not in Tucuman.
</P>
<P>
   More than once I saw merchants suspicious of dollar bills, but
happily accepting the battered and crumpled ``monopoly'' bonds.
Money exchanges, you see, won't tolerate the least imperfection in
a U.S. dollar, and pay much less than they are worth if there's an
ink mark or the slightest stain.
</P>
<P>
   When I got back to Buenos Aires, I was struck by the
hopelessness of the young. Those who are in university feel there's
no point to finishing their studies, because at the end of the road
there are no jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, I watched on television a molecular-biology student who
was leaving for Italy knowing he would never return. ``What reason
would I have?'' he asked. ``Right now, I earn 930 pesos as a
research scientist, and with four more years of training my salary
will barely reach 980 pesos. If I come back, what would be the
purpose of all my efforts?''
</P>
<P>
   Science, education, health care and culture were never
priorities in Menem's government, but the sorry plight of Argentine
intellectuals has not improved much with the new government. Forced
to reduce public spending and to correct an oppressive legacy of
social inequalities, the government has to turn its attention
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide of cardiologist Rene Favaloro _ the country's most
celebrated surgeon _ has weighed even further on the public mood.
In one of his last letters, Favaloro complained that even the
lowliest government health officers consistently declined to answer
his telephone calls. The surgeon's desolation parallels that felt
by poets Leopoldo Lugones and Alfonsina Stormi, who committed
suicide in 1938, overwhelmed by a somber time to which they could
see no end.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to blame Fernando de la Rua's government for
these ills _ the emigration of so many young people, the increasing
level of poverty, an exceptional scientist's suicide _ but, taken
together, all these facts add up to a clear cry of alarm. If Menem
managed to maintain his popularity amidst a blizzard of disasters,
why then is De la Rua, whose honest efforts are undeniable, having
such a hard time?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the fact that the average Argentine doesn't know where
the country is heading, explains a lot. The wave of Menem's
privatizations and the great flow of foreign investment in the
1990s created the illusion of an economic boom that government
officials implied would never end.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nobody can be sure if tightening the economy and increasing
taxes will translate into a more stable economy and greater job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   While the government downplays current hardships, it has yet to
present the nation with a coherent plan for the future that will
spark the Argentine spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Today's reality weighs too heavily, and there's no breath of
hope that will help it take flight.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless the Child'' R (violence, drug content
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger
</P>
<P>
   and Jimmy Smits.
</P>
<P>
   A junky would-be religious thriller about a little girl with
special powers. The latest cinematic struggle of good vs. evil, the
film swipes everything it can from ``The Omen,'' ``The Exorcist,''
``End of Days,'' ``Stigmata'' and other Catholic/satanic epics, all
while managing to bore the pants off you. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes.
D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood Simple'' R (violence, sex, nudity and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dan Hedaya,
</P>
<P>
   Frances McDormand
</P>
<P>
   and M. Emmet Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers' first film is back in all its devilishly
degenerate glory. Re-released in a spruced-up but still-smirking
so-called director's cut, the movie is pretty much exactly as it
was when it hit theaters in 1984. That is, a good-old-boy gothic
full of flashy camera angles and trashy people. What's astonishing
is how much of the Coens' unique talent was evident from the start.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' R (profanity and sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natasha Lyonne
</P>
<P>
   and Clea DuVall.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``Girl, Intercepted.'' Megan (Natasha Lyonne) is a
cheerleader shipped off to a homosexual rehab center called True
Directions because of certain ``telling'' signs. There's potential
here for some funny, nasty satire, but filmmaker Jamie Babbit soon
backs off the risky stuff. The funniest thing in the movie is
RuPaul as a rehab counselor who proudly disowns his gay past and
wears a ``Straight is Great'' T-shirt. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil B. Demented'' R (profanity, sex, violence
</P>
<P>
   and substance abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Melanie Griffith
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Dorff.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite demented enough. There are some amusing bits and some
savvy cinema in-jokes in John Waters' movie about a Hollywood star
(Melanie Griffith) kidnapped by underground filmmakers and forced
to star in their no-budget flick. Like Patty Hearst (who appears in
the film), Griffith becomes a convert to their cause and their
wild-eyed leader (Stephen Dorff). Too much of the film is slapdash
and just plain silly. (ERG) C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' R (violence, language and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Lopez,
</P>
<P>
   Vince Vaughn and Vincent D'Onofrio.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get trapped in this one. Jennifer Lopez plays an intrepid
child therapist who, through an experimental sci-fi technique, can
enter the minds of others. A detective (Vince Vaughn) asks her to
stroll through the brain of a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio) so
he can find where he's stashed his latest victim. Visually
provocative, narratively impaired, it's like ``Silence of the
Lambs'' without the compelling characters. (ERG) 1 hour, 52
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' PG-13 (sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello and John
Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   Dog-face hideous. The come-on is five hot chicks serving liquor
in a rowdy fun-time saloon (they splash whiskey across the bar and
set it afire; they douse each others' T-shirts with big pitchers of
water). But it's really the slapdash story of a young waif, a
struggling songwriter aching for stardom in New York City.
``Coyote'' is profoundly stupid and earnestly inept at conveying a
story. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 34 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 film involves a struggling author who takes a job at a
casino running a roulette wheel to look for writing inspiration.
Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme. ``Croupier'' has more
on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's a fascinating,
hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't gamble. (SM) 1
hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' PG-13 (some sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary about
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Faye Bakker Messner,
</P>
<P>
   narrated by RuPaul Charles.
</P>
<P>
   The rise and fall of evangelical diva Tammy Faye Bakker Messner,
the PTL Club and her marriage to Jim Bakker makes a fascinating
story. But somewhere along the way, directors Fenton Bailey and
Randy Barbato turned the subject of their documentary into its
mascot. Often captivating and informative, but full of gaps and
lacking key interviews. (SM) 1 hour, 19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl on the Bridge'' R (sexual themes) Subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Daniel Auteuil
</P>
<P>
   and Vanessa Paradis.
</P>
<P>
   Starts great but loses steam. The fine French director Patrice
Leconte (``Monsieur Hire'') has cooked up a romantic fairy tale
about a suicidal gamin (Vanessa Paradis) and a professional
knife-thrower who persuades her to become his new target. After an
impressive first hour in which the film creates an aura of
unresolved romantic tension and intensity, it goes adrift. (ERG) 1
hour, 31 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' PG (monster violence
</P>
<P>
   and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Takehiro Murata,
</P>
<P>
   and Tsutomu Kitagawa (as Godzilla).
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' is everything hard-core fans want it to be. So
corny and campy. And, God bless it, so badly dubbed in English it
soars. Sure it's bad filmmaking. Sure it's a guy _ actor Tsutomu
Kitagawa _ clad in a nearly vintage latex Godzilla getup and
stomping through Tokyo, knocking down cardboard mini-buildings and
upending toy-sized cars with his gnarly feet. But that's the point.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' R (graphic violence,
</P>
<P>
   nudity, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech fusion of ``The Invisible Man'' and ``Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,'' it lets director Paul Verhoeven (``Starship Troopers,''
``Total Recall'') show off some gruesome, state-of-the-art computer
effects and exercise his gleeful brand of brutal action. But his
filmmaking energy is wasted on a weak script and characters so
two-dimensional, they're virtually all transparent. (SM) 1 hour, 54
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the One That I Want'' Unrated (contains strong profanity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual subject matter)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Margaret Cho.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed over two nights in San Francisco, it's stand-up comic
Margaret Cho's raunchy and hilarious act. Some memorable bits
include comparisons of straight and gay porn and recalling her one
sexual experience with a woman. She also details the idiocies of TV
execs during her experiences as the star of the very first
Asian-American sitcom (``All-American Girl''). (SM) 1 hour, 36
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.

   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-

<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes.

   ``Nutty Professor II:
</P>
<P>
   The Klumps'' PG-13 (crude humor and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Janet Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem in ``Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'' is the
nutty professor. This sequel to the 1996 hit seems designed for
video: You want to fast-forward through all the parts focused on
tubby scientist Sherman (Eddie Murphy) so you can get back to the
rest of his family (played by Murphy, Murphy, Murphy and Murphy,
plus a fat kid). Murphy is jaw-droppingly funny. But the script is
simply not nutty enough. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. C+

<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' R (language and sex-related
humor)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Steve Harvey,
</P>
<P>
   Cedric the Entertainer,
</P>
<P>
   D.L. Hughley and Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing that original. It's just a lot of funny stuff
knocked out by four sharp stand-up comics. And under Spike Lee's
direction, it's one of the liveliest concert films in years. The
routines get raucous and rude, but hold off on the blistering
verbal assaults of other comedians. Lee looses several cameras
through the venue, capturing audience reactions and giving the
movie the dynamic spark of the live event. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest movie directed by Wolfgang Petersen.
Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates the
collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the
battle of men (George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) trying to survive the monstrous sea. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes. B+

   ``Pokemon the Movie 2000'' G

<P>
   Animated film featuring the
</P>
<P>
   voices of Ikue Ootani
</P>
<P>
   and Unsho Ishizuka.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pokemon movie is a lot better than last year's first
flick. And slightly better than a poke in the eye. ``Pokemon the
Movie 2000'' has more accomplished animation, more drama and a
decent-enough sprinkling of jokes, all adding up to something
barely watchable. Still, it's mostly cheaply made, barely
interesting and focused on niche marketing. (Bob Longino) 1 hour,
24 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho Beach Party'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lauren Ambrose,
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gibson and Nicholas Brendon.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to parody something that was goofy to start with. Or
maybe it's too easy. That's the problem with ``Psycho Beach
Party,'' playwright Charles Busch's affectionate but muddled
tribute to 1950s surfer-boy-and-bikini-babe movies, spiced with
dollops of Freudian psychology and campy humor. (SM) 1 hour, 35
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Replacements'' PG-13 (some crude sexual humor
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves
</P>
<P>
   and Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   It's got it all. Bone-crunching football plays. Boneheaded
comedy (the team kicker, a wire-thin Welsh soccer player, puffs
cigs while booting field goals). And a dumb-as-dirt pep squad whose
sideline lap-dance cheers cause the opposition to fumble a lot.
Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman star in this dumb romp about adult
scabs taking over for striking pro players.
</P>
<P>
   (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' R (drug content and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brenda Blethyn
</P>
<P>
   and Craig Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   A guiltless, feel-good flick in the ``Waking Ned Devine'' mold.
The film has everything it takes to be hopelessly twee: steaming
teacups and scenic seascapes, eccentric villagers, a rowdy pub and
some naughty business involving marijuana. But to the credit of
everyone involved, especially Brenda Blethyn in the title role, the
comedy mainly skirts the pitfalls of preciousness. (SM) 1 hour, 33
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' R (strong crude sexual humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, drug use and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris, Shawn Wayans
</P>
<P>
   and Marlon Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ Keenen (writer/director),
Shawn (writer/actor) and Marlon (writer/actor) _ ``Scary Movie'' is
a parody of teen horror flicks. The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know
What You Did Last Summer,'' ``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just
because it was popular, ``The Matrix,'' all get skewered in a
thousand jokes that are either hilarious, funny, not funny or
simply crude. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 28 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shower'' PG-13 (profanity and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Zhu Xu
</P>
<P>
   and Pu Cun Xin.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing where it's going doesn't really spoil the charm of
``Shower,'' a gentle Chinese comedy about the restorative power of
water, tradition and family ties. (In Mandarin with subtitles.)
(SM)1 hour, 32 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' PG-13 (some profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clint Eastwood,
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner
</P>
<P>
   and Donald Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
   The right stuff. Geezer chic gets a grand showcase in Clint
Eastwood's shamelessly crowd-pleasing comedy-thriller. When a
decrepit Russian satellite threatens to crash to Earth, four aging
astronauts who were axed from the program in the '50s are summoned
into service to repair the thing. The best part of the film is
watching these veterans play off each other like seasoned pros on
the Senior Tour. (ERG) 2 hours, 15 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas and the Magic Railroad'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alec Baldwin
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't always stay on track. For anyone older than 6 or who
isn't already a fan of the British TV series, this could be
subtitled ``The Little Engine That Couldn't.'' Things start to go
wrong in a magical land where talking trains are menaced by a
bullying diesel and their protector, Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin).
It's not total a wreck, but avoid being railroaded into sitting
through it unless there's no choice. (ERG) 1 hour, 20 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lies Beneath'' PG-13 (terror, violence, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michelle Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   and Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath ``What Lies Beneath'' is a script that could
have come from a 1970s TV movie. Narratively old-fashioned, but
boosted by star performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford and suspenseful direction, it's a lovingly crafted throwback
to haunted-house movies that relied more on suggestion and slowly
building creepiness than over-the-top effects. (SM) 2 hours, 10
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Heart Is'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natalie Portman
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   A corn pone comedy-drama about a single mother, made with enough
polish to be a guilty pleasure. Natalie Portman plays the pregnant
teenager who heads for California and winds up becoming the
Wal-Mart Mom in Oklahoma. She gets good support from Stockard
Channing, Ashley Judd and Sally Field. (SM) 2 hours. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' PG-13 (sci-fi action violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman,
</P>
<P>
   Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   and Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' never comes close to classic status. The best movie to
work this superhero turf lately was the shamelessly entertaining
``The Matrix.'' But director Bryan Singer and his collaborators
treat the comic's mythology with seriousness and respect (unlike
other recent, slapdash comic adaptations ``Spawn'' and ``Blade'').
It's an engaging popcorn movie in a summer that's littered with
duds. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. B-

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twelve years after his first try for the
presidency ended in failure, and after eight years toiling in the
political shadow of President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore on
Thursday prepared to formally become the Democratic Party's
presidential nominee and his party's new leader.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10 p.m. EDT Thursday evening _ at the peak of the
television networks' prime-time viewing _ Albert Arnold Gore Jr.
will accept the nomination at the Staples Center in downtown Los
Angeles, where 4,339 delegates convened four days ago to work
toward that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Before delegates began the roll call vote on Wednesday night
that gave Gore the 2,170 votes needed for the nomination, his
running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, introduced
himself to the nation in a speech that brought cheers and served as
a testimonial to the Democratic ticket leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``For his entire career, Al Gore's values have guided the way he
meets the challenges that lie ahead,'' Lieberman said. ``That's why
I hope you will conclude, you at home, as I have, that for his
honesty, for his strength, for his integrity and for his character,
Al Gore must become the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told journalists who arrived in Los Angeles with him aboard
Air Force Two on Thursday morning that his own speech would rely
heavily on personal biography, details of his policy and his vision
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he had composed the speech on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This speech I have written; I will deserve the credit or the
blame,'' Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that those who watch and listen will feel afterward
that they have a clearer idea of exactly what I'm proposing to
do,'' Gore continued. ``They'll also know how the ideas and
proposals I'm making are rooted in experiences that I've had. I'll
give a few specific examples. I'll tell them why I feel as strongly
as I do about the choices we have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was nominated as the Democratic Party's
presidential candidate Wednesday night by the actor Tommy Lee
Jones, who was Gore's roommate at Harvard. That nomination was
seconded by his eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As Schiff finished a speech filled with family reminiscences,
Gore, unannounced, stepped on to the stage to embrace his daughter
and to wave, without speaking, to the wildly cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That broke with tradition and so did the manner in which Gore
became the party's official nominee. Instead of the 68 delegates
from his home state of Tennessee casting the ballots that would put
him over the top, that honor went to the 144 delegates from
Florida. That was a clear indication that one of the battleground
states this fall will be Florida, where Gov. George W. Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, is thought to have an advantage
because his brother, Jeb Bush, is the governor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All the convention days leading up to Gore's political ascension
Thursday night were scripted to ensure that the attention would
fall on him and that he would speak before a united and energized
party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke on Monday night, symbolically handing over control
of the party to his No. 2 of the last eight years and then leaving
the convention so that the spotlight was Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the luminaries of the party's vital left _ including
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, daughter of the late President John
F. Kennedy; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts; the Rev. Jesse
Jackson Sr.; labor leaders; and former Sen. Bill Bradley, whom the
vice president vanquished nearly six months ago to win the party's
nomination _ have stepped forward to praise Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After his speech Thursday night, Gore plans to return to the
campaign trail. He will fly from Los Angeles late Thursday evening
bound for La Crosse, Wis., to begin a four-day campaign swing down
the Mississippi River aboard a paddle-wheeled boat.

   MOSCOW _ ``I can't sit around waiting here any longer. I must go
up there,'' cried Valentina Staroseltseva, whose 20-year-old son,
Dmitry, is among the 118 submariners trapped on the Kursk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the city of Kursk, which regularly sends its young
men to serve in the Northern Fleet and after which the submarine
was named, collected money to help relatives like Mrs.
Staroseltseva to travel to the Arctic coast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their 45-hour train ride will bring them to Severomorsk, where
they will be able to see no more of the frantic rescue operation
than they have seen for the past five days on their television sets
at home. But at least they will feel nearer to their loved ones in
their underwater nightmare _ if, that is, the sailors are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   As it dawned on Russians that their image-obsessed leaders had
wasted days before allowing a British team to join the rescue
effort, there was mounting public anger and more sympathy for the
conscripts than the top brass on the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of the conscripts came from the city of Kursk,
500 km (325 miles) south of Moscow, which until the tragedy at sea
was known chiefly as the site of a major tank battle during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Kursk relatives, Mrs. Staroseltseva, a nurse, was most
open to being filmed by Russian television. The independent NTV
station showed her, looking businesslike in a red suit, preparing
to channel her desperate, maternal energy into the practicalities
of the long journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry that we did not let the British come sooner,'' she
said, referring to Moscow's three-day delay in accepting the
British offer of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I want everything to be done faster and better. I
think maybe he (Dmitry) is lying silently. As a mother, I hope he
is calm. The main thing is not to panic,'' said Mrs. Staroseltseva,
who had passed her own Orthodox Christian beliefs on to her son.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that Mrs. Staroseltseva had been pleased to see
Dmitry sent to the prestigious Northern Fleet instead of the
notorious ``stroibat'' (construction brigade), where bullying is
rife, or, worse, to what Russians call the ``meat grinder'' _
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' she said. ``We called
it our submarine. We were 100 percent confident in it. We really
believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry, who graduated with high marks from a railway college
before joining the navy, had to compete with other conscripts for a
posting on the Kursk. ``He has always loved swimming in the
river,'' said his mother. ``It was impossible to pull him out of
there. He loves machinery too.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent letter home, he enthused about life on the
modern, 14,000-ton, nuclear submarine, which had been the pride of
the fleet. ``It is just like home here. I'm really happy. We have
four meals a day, just like home. We will resurface in the middle
of August. See you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Staroseltseva had a premonition of disaster. She said
she felt ``ill and out of sorts'' on Sunday before the news of the
sinking broke. ``Then I heard the submarine was lying on the
seabed. I understood that something had gone wrong. The only thing
that helps me now is to pray.'' &QL;

 &HT;    (Mike McManus is a syndicated columnist whose ``Ethics &AMP;
Religion'' appears in almost 100 newspapers)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Bill Bradley eloquently told the Democratic National Convention,
''Most of us would never turn our backs on a starving child, yet
every day, we ignore 13 million poor children in America.
 &HT;    ``If all of them were gathered in one place they would create a
city bigger than New York and we would then see child poverty as
the slow-motion national disaster that it is. If we don't end child
poverty in our lifetime, shame on me, shame on you, shame on all of
us.''
 &HT;    Yet he failed to cite the cause of child poverty: the lack of
enduring marriages.
 &HT;    One-third of the nation's 4 million births are out-of-wedlock.
Another 1 million children see their parents divorce annually.
These children are headed for poverty.
 &HT;    One study reports that in 1994 when children lived with two
parents, their family income averaged $43,600. After divorce, these
kids had to live with one parent, on only $25,300.
 &HT;    Such children are likely to have diminished learning capacity,
are twice as likely to drop out of school as those from intact
homes, are three times more likely to become pregnant as teens, six
times more likely to commit suicide and twelve times more likely to
be incarcerated.
 &HT;    Therefore, for the sake of children, isn't it time to make
marriage a political issue?
 &HT;    Two governors of states with high rates of poverty and divorce
have done so. They demonstrate what political leaders can do.
 &HT;    First, set high goals. Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating told his
Legislature that 35 of 77 counties had more divorces than
marriages, and set a goal to cut the divorce rate by one-third in a
decade. Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee declared ''a state of marital
emergency'' and set a goal of ''slashing the divorce rate in half
by the year 2010.''
 &HT;    Second, both governors asked their states' pastors to create
''Community Marriage Policies'' in which clergy sign a covenant
that they will require premarital counseling before marrying
anyone. The purpose is to say, ``Honor and care for your spouse in
a lifetime partnership commitment. Learn about finances and learn
how to fight fairly,'' Keating told the Heritage Foundation last
month.
 &HT;    In June Heritage published a landmark study, ''The Effects of
Divorce on America,'' which urged all states to ''promote''
Community Marriage Policies or Community Marriage Covenants:
 &HT;    ''A well-executed Community Marriage Covenant project can save
up to 80 percent of marriages headed toward divorce, reconcile more
than half of the separated couples, and enable 80 percent of those
in stepfamilies to become successful parents and partners.
 &HT;    ``Many cities that have undertaken a Community Marriage Covenant
project have seen divorce rates plunge. For instance, in Modesto,
California, the divorce rate has fallen 35 percent in 10 years; in
Kansas City, the rate dropped 35 percent in two years. Community
Marriage Covenant projects are tangible, practical, and
results-oriented,'' said the report written by Patrick Fagan and
Robert Rector.
 &HT;    How are they so successful? The core idea is simple. Couples in
good marriages are trained to help prepare couples for a lifelong
marriage, to strengthen existing ones and save troubled marriages.
A network of Mentor Couples can put a ''safety net'' under every
marriage.
 &HT;    Astonishingly, that can virtually eliminate divorce in any local
church.
 &HT;    Killearn United Methodist Church in Tallahassee, with 2,500
members, has had no divorces since January 1999, when it began to
train mentors. The First Assembly of God in Rockford, Ill., trained
14 couples whose marriages had nearly failed, to meet with those
considering divorce. Local therapists heard about it and sent over
dozens of their worst cases. In three years mentors have seen more
than 100 troubled couples and saved all but four of the marriages.
To learn more see profiles of six Marriage Saver Congregations on
the Web at marriagesavers.org.
 &HT;    Governor Keating also asked his Legislature, ''What is the sense
of a system where it is more difficult to get a hunting license
than a marriage license and it is easier to get out of a marriage
contract with children than out of a tupperware contract?''
 &HT;    He proposed lowering the cost of a marriage license if couples
got marriage preparation, and giving them the option to get a
''Covenant Marriage Certificate'' that waives their rights to
no-fault or unilateral divorce, as passed in Louisiana and Arizona.
They pledge to seek help if in trouble,
 &HT;    Finally, Keating is appropriating $10 million of surplus welfare
reform funds for innovative programs to train state health, welfare
and agricultural workers to teach skills of communication and
conflict resolution to thousands of couples not reached by
churches, to hire several people to work with the churches to
develop Community Marriage Policies, and pay for ads with the
message that those who marry are healthier, happier, wealthier and
live longer.
 &HT;    I predict the poverty rate of Oklahoma and Arkansas will drop as
marriages are strengthened.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``I can't sit around waiting here any longer. I must go
up there,'' cried Valentina Staroseltseva, whose 20-year-old son,
Dmitry, is among the 118 submariners trapped on the Kursk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the city of Kursk, which regularly sends its young
men to serve in the Northern Fleet and after which the submarine
was named, collected money to help relatives like Mrs.
Staroseltseva to travel to the Arctic coast Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Their 45-hour train ride will bring them to Severomorsk, where
they will be able to see no more of the frantic rescue operation
than they have seen for the past five days on their television sets
at home. But at least they will feel nearer to their loved ones in
their underwater nightmare _ if, that is, the sailors are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   As it dawned on Russians that their image-obsessed leaders had
wasted days before allowing a British team to join the rescue
effort, there was mounting public anger and more sympathy for the
conscripts than the top brass on the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven of the conscripts came from the city of Kursk,
500 km (325 miles) south of Moscow, which until the tragedy at sea
was known chiefly as the site of a major tank battle during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Kursk relatives, Mrs. Staroseltseva, a nurse, was most
open to being filmed by Russian television. The independent NTV
station showed her, looking businesslike in a red suit, preparing
to channel her desperate, maternal energy into the practicalities
of the long journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry that we did not let the British come sooner,'' she
said, referring to Moscow's three-day delay in accepting the
British offer of help.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a mother, I want everything to be done faster and better. I
think maybe he (Dmitry) is lying silently. As a mother, I hope he
is calm. The main thing is not to panic,'' said Mrs. Staroseltseva,
who had passed her own Orthodox Christian beliefs on to her son.
</P>
<P>
   The irony was that Mrs. Staroseltseva had been pleased to see
Dmitry sent to the prestigious Northern Fleet instead of the
notorious ``stroibat'' (construction brigade), where bullying is
rife, or, worse, to what Russians call the ``meat grinder'' _
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the submarine was so safe,'' she said. ``We called
it our submarine. We were 100 percent confident in it. We really
believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitry, who graduated with high marks from a railway college
before joining the navy, had to compete with other conscripts for a
posting on the Kursk. ``He has always loved swimming in the
river,'' said his mother. ``It was impossible to pull him out of
there. He loves machinery too.''
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent letter home, he enthused about life on the
modern, 14,000-ton, nuclear submarine, which had been the pride of
the fleet. ``It is just like home here. I'm really happy. We have
four meals a day, just like home. We will resurface in the middle
of August. See you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Staroseltseva had a premonition of disaster. She said
she felt ``ill and out of sorts'' on Sunday before the news of the
sinking broke. ``Then I heard the submarine was lying on the
seabed. I understood that something had gone wrong. The only thing
that helps me now is to pray.'' &QL;

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    While America was focused on the Republican Convention this week
in Philadelphia, Billy Graham, 81, attracted 10,000 evangelists to
a conference in Amsterdam.
 &HT;    Sadly, Graham was unable to attend the first week's events due
to the discovery of a buildup of fluid on his brain. It was hoped
he would be able to attend the final session on Sunday at least by
satellite hookup, so he can ''pass the torch'' of evangelism on to
a new generation.
 &HT;    However, Graham was ably represented by his son, Franklin
Graham, a daughter, Anne Graham Lotz, plus such notables as
evangelist Luis Palau, Anglican Archbishop George Carey, and by
Ravi Zacharias, the Indian-born Christian evangelist.
 &HT;    Zacharias, interestingly, challenges the ''tolerance'' of our
culture, which embraces everything from Eastern mysticism to New
Age spirituality, with the uncompromising conviction that Jesus is
the only way.
 &HT;    Speaking at an opening plenary session in Amsterdam, Zacharias
said, ''Religions from the East have come flooding in. Ideas like,
`Discover the God that is in you,' or reincarnation, or meditation
upon a mantra or a chant of another deity have gradually taken on a
huge following'' at the very time that western culture ''has
evicted Christianity as a dominant factor.''
 &HT;    ''The result, I fear, may well be the pointed question whether
Jesus Christ is indeed unique, or is He just one among many ways?'
 &HT;    Four days after Zacharias spoke, George Barna released a new
poll reporting that more than 100 million U.S. adults ''are stumped
as to the meaning and purpose of their life.'' Yet a substantial
majority describe themselves as ''deeply spiritual.''
 &HT;    How can people call themselves deeply spiritual while being
stumped on the meaning or purpose of life?
 &HT;    Zacharias identified some sources of dramatic change. First is
the ''dominance of the visual.... The camera controls the
imagination of young minds.'' True. The new generation does not
read newspapers, for example.
 &HT;    ''The increasing power of a youth-dominated world,'' is another
sign of the time. ''How are cultures that have cherished the past
going to cope with a generation which lives only for the moment?''
 &HT;    Another is ''the bold face of atheism'' seen on university
campuses where many even deny that good and evil exist.
 &HT;    Zacharias summed up these trends to the young evangelists in one
sentence: ''How do you reach a generation that hears with its eyes
and thinks with its feelings?''
 &HT;    First, ''We cannot just speak the Gospel. We will have to embody
the Gospel,'' as did the Belgian missionary Joseph Damien, who
ministered to lepers. One day Father Damien spilled hot water on
his foot and did not feel it. He changed his sermon opening from
''My fellow believers'' to ''My fellow lepers.''
 &HT;    Second, we need a ''proclamation that is not merely argued but
felt.'' Clergy who have to read their sermons to me are speaking
from the head, not the heart.
 &HT;    Finally, Zacharias suggests rescuing not only the ends of the
Gospel, but also the means. Find language that communicates with
power. He notes the way poet Alexander Pope described Jesus'
miracle of Cana turning water into wine, ''The conscious water saw
its Master and blushed.''
 &HT;    In his latest book, ``Jesus Among Other Gods,'' Zacharias
compares Buddha and Mohammed, who merely taught, with Jesus, who
''did not only teach or expound his message. He was identical with
His message.''
 &HT;    ''He did not just proclaim the truth. He said, `I am the truth.'
He did not just show a way. He said `I am the way.''
 &HT;    Zacharias argues, ''All religions are not the same. All
religions do not point to God.''
 &HT;    In an interview from Singapore, Zacharias elaborated: ''Buddhism
at its core is non-theist or atheist. It gives you a way of life
that gives you the retention of your autonomy, your own
sovereignty. Hinduism teaches that every life is a moral repayment
of the previous life, and in the next life you could be mothered by
a boar or a donkey.''
 &HT;    By contrast, Christianity teaches ''We are not in need merely of
a superior ethic, we are in need of a transformed heart and will
that seeks to do the will of God.''

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Whether they know it or not, when Westerners
try to conjure an image of fine Arab culture, it's probably close
to the courtyards and covered market streets of Syria's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go into the city,'' wrote travel writer Henry
Van Dyke, ``we step into a chapter of the 'Arabian Nights'
Entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation was made in 1908, but it still fits a city that
manages, amid its modernity, to stay alive with elegant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cats slumber across finely carved tables with inlaid
mother-of-pearl oyster shell. Thick vines dangle over the walls of
the Old City. Diners smoke water pipes and sip tea in tile-lined
courtyards around quiet fountains. Swordmakers discuss their
ancient craft even as they consider advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria slowly opens to the west, a small but growing number of
Americans are getting to know the exotic city of about 3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus prides itself as the oldest capital in the world _
going back at least 5,000 years _ and as a showcase of Arab
tradition. It shows itself off with sometimes grand, and sometimes
funky flourishes. For the former, there's the stately tomb of
Saladin (pronounced, ``sala-DEEN''), probably the most heroic,
non-religious, Muslim figure in all history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the army museum, where the power might go out as
you wander between the run-down artillery, tanks, rifles and the
dusty exhibit on Syrian Hamad Feris, who joined Soviet cosmonauts
in space. One of the few English signs at the exit states, with no
apparent irony, ``Tanks(CQ) for your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, Syria is largely crime free. Arabic is the common
language and many Syrians also speak French. There are few
proficient English speakers, but some taxi drivers or hotel staff
will know a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to get a Syrian visa before departing. Those can
be obtained in about a week from Syrian embassies or consulates.
Syria still does not recognize Israel and will not grant visas to
people with Israeli stamps in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian countryside is flush with archeological digs and
dozens of Crusader and Muslim castles. But the capital offers a
sampling of the great mix of cultures to come through this corner
of the Mediterranean. It's also a shopping wonder, offering rugs,
furniture and metal work from around the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medicinal herb stalls, a
paste of the little lizards is supposed to cure ills and provide
sexual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other exotic venues where the locals serve the
tourists, in Damascus' Old City, the relatively few tourists and
locals line up together at the prime spots.
</P>
<P>
   That can be at Bakdash, a crowded ice cream parlor. It sells a
delicious firm ice cream that, for some reason, requires loud
pounding by fit men with wooden hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it can be at the mausoleum of Saladin. He was the Muslim
general who ruled over most of the Arab world and drove the
European Crusaders out of Jerusalem. While his Crusader opponent,
England's Richard the Lion-Hearted, was known for brutality,
Saladin was honorable.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1192 in Damascus. Though he is a hero of the Arabs,
he was an ethnic Kurd. You can still find Kurds _ who are mostly in
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria _ visiting the tomb today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leader who conquered places taken by the
foreigners,'' said Kurd Ali Mohammed, 21, a laborer in Damascus.
``He was very powerful, but he was also very merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two tombs. A faded box of carved,
walnut-colored wood appears to be the original. In 1899, Germany's
Kaiser Wilhelm II added a marble tomb beside it, in honor of
Saladin.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of streets away is the mausoleum of another central
figure in Middle Eastern history, Sultan Baibars (pronounced,
``BAY-bears''). He was the Mamluke ruler who, before his death in
1277, defeated the Mongols and almost finished off the Crusaders
who had hung on after Saladin. He was violent and unforgiving, but
his tomb is decorated with the palaces and lush plants awaiting him
in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Old City is the Omayyad Mosque, a huge
courtyard bordered by a large prayer hall built around 708 A.D.
Inside and out are mosaics of glass beads from as far back as the
12th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling between Islam and Christianity is apparent. The
mosque's minaret towers include the Jesus tower, where locals
believe he will return on judgment day. Inside the mosque is a
shrine to John the Baptist, revered and called Yahia by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the mosque should remove their shoes, but keep their
arms and legs covered or borrow the robes offered at the ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City also offers a Christian landmark. The underground
Chapel of Ananias is named after a disciple of Jesus who is
believed to have lived there. Ananias was ordered, according to the
New Testament, to go to ``the street which is called Straight'' to
heal a blind man. The Street Called Straight is still a main road
through the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   After sightseeing, tourists can join the genteel Arab elite in
Old City restaurants built around what used to be private palaces.
The Elizer and Arabesque restaurants are two fine examples where
you can dine on lamb kabobs and traditional yogurt stews.
</P>
<P>
   When you have enough of the living history in the Old City, you
can see Syria's ancient history in the National Museum. Most
explanations are in Arabic and French, but the museum is excellent.
Most interesting are the expressive, big-eyed statuettes carved by
the Canaanites, the pagan people who populated the region in 3000
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   There are also haunting relief statues from the Second Century
Roman period. Each depicts in personal detail men and women who had
been entombed behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also contains a synagogue transported from Dura
Europus, near the Syrian-Iraqi border. Though nearly 1,800 years
old, the synagogue still holds colorful painted scenes from the
bible that brighten the small sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Museum visitors might want to stop and dash off some postcards
in the museum's tranquil archeological garden. Here, under trees
that quiet the city bustle outside the walls, you can stroll amid
detailed relief sculptures and statues that form the foundations of
today's Damascus.

<P>
   PALMYRA, Syria _ This was a working city, made rich from the
caravans that passed through and paid taxes on each goatskin of
oriental perfume and every camel-load of foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than 1,700 years past its prime. But Palmyra was once
the bustling home to 350,000 people. Water pipes of hollowed-out
stones still line the streets and an inscription urges locals to be
helpful to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ancient example of the importance of location. Palmyra
was on the Silk Road between the Orient and the Mediterranean and
near a source of water, which travelers would pay for dearly.
</P>
<P>
   When its main competitor, the Nabataean(CQ) trading city of
Petra in what is now Jordan, fell to the Romans in the Second
Century, Palmyra blossomed. It reached its peak in the Third
Century, gaining freedom from taxation by the Roman rulers.
</P>
<P>
   But the city would decline starting 272 A.D. Zenobia, the shrewd
Arab queen who claimed her lineage from Egypt's Cleopatra, tried to
gain independence. Instead, Roman armies crushed her rebellion and
took her prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient city stands in the desert about a three-hour drive
northeast from Damascus. Among the sites on the way is a
Palestinian refugee camp (more than 370,00 refugees live in Syria).
Eventually, the road is lined by the modern pipeline bringing oil
to the Mediterranean from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   About 35,000 people live in the new town of Palmyra next to the
ruins. There are several hotels. The ruins can be seen in a hurried
day. But, it's better to take two days for wandering through the
amphitheater, temples, public market and caravan stopping post,
museum and residential homes. The ruins are said to be magnificent
at dawn and dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra still possesses huge walls and spectacular colonnades
that stand out with a ghost-like presence in the dusty, hilly
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra is a Roman name, meaning city of palms. In Arabic, it is
Tadmor, meaning city of dates. Date palms abound.
</P>
<P>
   Intricate relief statues illustrate the city's people and gods.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Temple of Bel, the Babylonian god of the sky, one stone
panel shows women covered in swirls of cloth, a sign that veiling
took place even before Muslim times. Other panels show soldiers in
their armor and with their camels.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 32 A.D., the temple took 200 years to build. That's
longer than modern construction jobs but, then, most of the
structure has lasted nearly 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, still with its massive walls and many of
the surrounding columns, reliefs carved on the ceiling of an altar
show Bel surrounded by other gods and the signs of the Zodiac.

   The best look at the people of Palmyra _ a mix of Arab and Greek
bloodlines _ comes from their tombs on the edge of town. The
wealthy were entombed in towers, the poor in underground crypts.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of each tomb, lined with shelves where bodies were
laid on top of each other, were relief portraits of the people
inside. Those reliefs are in the Palmyra museum.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits are individual enough to make you feel like you're
meeting the inhabitants of the ancient city. Wealthy merchants are
portrayed with big bellies, a sign of prosperity. Some men have
curly hair, others straight. Women are shown holding their veils
slightly to the side to show their faces.
</P>
<P>
   About 480 feet above the desert floor, on a mountaintop, is the
12th Century Muslim Qala'at Ibn Ma'an castle. The castle,
surrounded by a moat and guard towers, provides a sweeping view of
the tombs, ancient Palmyra and the new city next door.

By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   PHILIPPINES-HOSTAGES (Manila) _ Nine Western vacationers who
were seized by Muslim rebels from an island diving resort nearly
four months ago were to have been released Thursday in exchange for
a payment that could reach several million dollars, but something
has caused a delay. Officially, the reason is weather, but local
officials say the real snag seems to involve money. By Seth Mydans.

<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SF-QUAKE (Undated) _ A notorious fault that runs through
Berkeley, Calif., may not be capable of generating a large
earthquake on its own, scientists report Thursday. Using a new
technique based on measurements taken from space and from deep
within the earth, the researchers conclude that the Hayward fault
is creeping steadily along its entire width and depth, relieving
the tectonic stresses. However, people who live near the fault are
still in danger of heavy damage from quakes along faults nearby. By
Sandra Blakeslee.

   SCI-SKIN-CANCER (Undated) _ The stem cells for the skin, long
thought to reside in the basement layer of the skin, in fact hide
out in the hair follicles, researchers report. This is important
for understanding how the skin heals and may also shed light on the
causes of skin cancer. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>

Verizon Communications. By Simon Romero.
</P>
<P>
   TOOTH-TECH (Undated) _ The business of straightening teeth has
always been a small-scale, fairly low-tech affair _ a one-on-one
interaction between orthodontist and patient. It seems a stretch
that a classic Silicon Valley startup could create a role for
itself in this highly local profession, but that is exactly what
seems to be happening with Align Technology, a manufacturer of a
clear plastic alternative to braces aimed at appearance-conscious
adults. Now, armed with promising early results and backed by
venture capital on a scale that has stunned the industry, Align is
unrolling the most aggressive consumer advertising plan the
industry has ever seen. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>

   HMO-SUITS (Undated) _ Looking at what has happened to the many
class-action lawsuits against managed-care companies. A judge in
Miami is expected to rule Thursday on a motion by Humana to dismiss
a number of suits and may also rule on whether to consolidate the
suits. The law cited by these suits has narrowed considerably
following a number of recent decisions. By Milt Freudenheim.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS REPORT POSSIBLE ADVANCES IN TREATING TB 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   Tuberculosis is a clever bug that has learned how to live inside
the very cells that are supposed to protect the body from invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists say they may have unmasked a key player that
allows the TB bacteria to go dormant for years, waiting for an
opportunity to attack. It is a discovery that could lead to a whole
new approach in treating a disease that kills 2 million people
worldwide every year.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, reporting in Thursday's edition of the journal
Nature, say they have identified an enzyme called ICL that allows
the TB bug to change itself and survive the body's efforts to kill
it.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists also say they have found compounds that appear to
outsmart the bug by blocking this enzyme. It could lead to drugs
that dramatically shorten the length of time it now takes to treat
TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that we may actually have new drugs to test in
animals as soon as this year, which is wonderful, considering we've
had no new TB drugs since the 1960s,'' said John McKinney, an
assistant professor at Rockefeller University in New York, the lead
author in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study also involved researchers from Texas A&AMP;M University,
Washington University School of Medicine and the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the world's population is infected with the TB
bacteria. Most of the cases are in developing nations. But TB
remains a persistent threat in Texas, particularly in the
Texas-Mexico border counties, where disease rates are two to three
times higher than the state average.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 million Texans carry the bacteria, and 200,000 of them
probably will develop the disease at some time in their lives, said
Jeff Taylor, an epidemiologist with the Texas Department of
Health's tuberculosis elimination program.
</P>
<P>
   TB treatment is lengthy, requiring people to take medications
for 6 months or longer. Many people drop out, which is giving rise
to drug-resistant strains of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have struggled for years to understand how TB
persists in the body.
</P>
<P>
   When the bacteria are actively causing disease, current drugs
can kill them. But these drugs are ineffective when the microbe
goes dormant in macrophages, cells that are part of the body's
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has really known how these bacteria survive when they
are in the chronic phase,'' said James Sacchettini, a professor of
biochemistry at Texas A&AMP;M. ``All we know is that the drugs we
currently use don't work against the chronic stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In their current experiments with laboratory animals, scientists
discovered that the bacteria are able to chemically change
themselves once they take hold inside the macrophages. They begin
producing ICL, which then allows them to eat fatty acids, the most
abundant source of stored energy in their host cells.
</P>
<P>
   Using sophisticated techniques, Sacchettini's laboratory was
able to discern the three-dimensional structure of this enzyme, and
also identify compounds that potentially could interfere with it.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical giant Glaxo-Wellcome, which helped fund the
research, is now developing drugs with the researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most optimistic view of this is it would lead to drugs
that allow us to treat TB like any other bacterial infection, in
the course of two or three weeks,'' Sacchettini said. ``I think
this would change the perspective of TB around the world.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine if a right-wing pundit such as Rush Limbaugh went on
network television and delivered a tasteless visual joke about Al
Gore _ something that would cross anybody's boundary of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   Something like showing a photo of Gore at the podium at the
Democratic National Convention along with a flashing graphic
proclaiming, ``SNIPERS WANTED.''
</P>
<P>
   Gee, you think ol' Rush would take some heavy heat for that? You
think the liberal pundits (like me) would be typing so vigorously
on their keyboards they'd be in danger of erasing their own
fingerprints?
</P>
<P>
   Molly Ivins would sprain her sense of humor. Al Franken would
fracture his funnybone. Maureen Dowd would try to figure out a way
to make a reference to ``Big Brother'' or Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Democratic officials would be calling press
conferences to demand Limbaugh's resignation, and special-interest
groups would be organizing boycotts of his sponsors and protests
outside his broadcast facility. Some politician would even be
asking the Secret Service and the FBI to investigate whether
Limbaugh could be brought up on charges for encouraging the
assassination of a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? At least some of that reaction would be
justified. Any would-be comedian who would broadcast such a
``joke'' in our assassination-saturated times is the kind of
intellectual who would have to take night courses just to upgrade
himself to idiot status.
</P>
<P>
   Let's leave that hornet's nest unattended for a moment. In
hypothetical scenario No. 2, we'll envision Dr. Laura Schlessinger
as the one making an incendiary comment. Picture Dr. Laura going on
the radio or her upcoming TV show and making a juvenile joke about
Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, e.g., ``Apparently she loves
Bush.'' How long would it take gay-rights groups to pounce on that?
The anti-Schlessinger web sites would be pulsating and the press
releases would be mass-faxed within hours, if not minutes, of such
an incident.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, imagine if a broadcaster with conservative stripes _
say, Ann Coulter _ did a late-night TV appearance and offered her
take on the selection of Joseph Lieberman as Gore's running mate
with this monologue:
</P>
<P>
   ``This Gore-Lieberman ticket is working because Bush, you know
... he had a 19-point lead the other day. It is now down to 2
percent. Wow. Whatever. But this is the first time in history a Jew
has knocked 80 percent off.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa. Coulter would be ripped for a crack like that, wouldn't
she? And rightfully so, it's a rotten joke.
</P>
<P>
   I think we can all agree that Limbaugh, Schlessinger and
Coulter, had they made the comments outlined above, would have been
creamed by the media and by liberal-leaning politicos. Subjected to
day after day of sharp and stinging rebukes. Ripped like John
Rocker was ripped.
</P>
<P>
   But let's make it perfectly clear that Limbaugh didn't do the
assassination joke, and Schlessinger didn't go for the cheap laugh
at Cheney's daughter's expense, and Coulter did not utter the
anti-Semitic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Craig Kilborn who did the ``SNIPERS WANTED'' gag _ only
it was George Bush who was the subject of the ill-advised attempt
at humor, not Al Gore. And it was Bill Maher who did the jokes
about Cheney and Lieberman, on ``Politically Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   So where's the outrage? Where are the scathing columns and the
calls for suspensions? Could it be that many of the liberal
commentators and politicians whom we'd expect to be so offended by
such comments are offended only when it serves their agendas?
</P>
<P>
   Look, I'm often the first to chortle at tasteless, mean, even
sick humor _ so I'm not about to say these guys should be banished
from the airwaves over their admittedly regrettable stabs at humor.
(Although Kilborn's pathetic gag probably should result in a
weeklong suspension _ something that would be considered a favor by
any viewer who isn't into smarmy narcissism anyway.) Their comments
didn't shock me, nor did they rattle my own value system. I'm
content to call Kilborn a clueless jerk and say the normally witty
Maher should have known better, and leave it at that _ but what
intrigues me is the near-total silence from the media and the
activists and the elected officials about these two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Usually I snort at conservatives who write and call to complain
about the hypocrisy of liberals and moderates _ who say we're much
quicker to jump on someone's remarks if that person happens to be a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   This time I'd say they're right.

   EUROPEAN-DRESS (New York) _ ``Curios and Treasures,'' a modest,
yet serenely beautiful exhibition at the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, displays 65 garments and accessories
that range through four or five centuries of European dress. By
Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   APPLES-SEATTLE (Seattle) _ It is difficult to think of any city,
other than the urban behemoths like New York and Los Angeles, and
maybe Washington, that has shaped modern living in the United
States as much as this one. Nordstrom, Boeing, Microsoft,
Starbucks, Amazon: all innovators, all based here in the Pacific
Northwest, off in a remote corner of the nation, far from the main
centers of population. Yet they play a central part in daily life
across this continent and beyond. Seattle still has its funky side.
It revels in its mellow small-town atmosphere; a Seattle ad man
popularized the ``happy face.'' But it has become an unmistakably
rich, high-tech, high-rise, high-expectation metropolis. By R.W.
Apple Jr.

   NY-ALTERNATIVE-THEATER (New York) _ Scores of shows are now on
at the Fringe, the annual two-week downtown theater festival that
revels in all things dramatic and different. Every day, the Fringe
will present almost 80 performances, staged by some 2,000 artists
from 13 countries. The Fringe is only one of several theater
festivals currently running in the city. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-ARTISTS (New York) _ Institutional group exhibitions of
up-and-coming artists have long been an annual feature in the
city's art season. Three are on view now, at the Studio Museum in
Harlem, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and El Museo del Barrio. The
museums themselves are still seen as fringe venues, but they're
also integral players in the big picture of American art, and their
shows feed the larger pool of talent from which mainstream stars
emerge. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-COLUMN (Undated) _ When you are selling 800 vintage,
classic and antique sports cars in one place, you are bound to come
across a big party or two. There are nonstop festivities planned
around the car sales in Pebble Beach, Calif., this weekend, and the
auction houses and car dealers expect about 20,000 people. By Wendy

F-150 SUPERCAB SHARES FORD, HARLEY ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen.
</P>
<P>
   That staccato burble you hear might be coming from a
Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Look.
</P>
<P>
   You're half right. The tuned exhaust notes are pouring forth
from a 2000 Ford F150 SuperCab pickup truck that has been restyled
and customized in the first year of a five-year joint partnership
between Ford Motor Co. and Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Limited Edition Harley-Davidson F-150. Black with
distinct Harley-orange pinstriping. Black leather all over the
inside. Chrome glistening in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   And that sound is the perfect purr to announce the joining of
two companies, both founded in 1903 _ same year the Wright Brothers
flew at Kitty Hawk _ and hooked at least through their centennial
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Their recipe for this truck? Drop in Ford's 5.4-liter Triton
V-8, make it sound something like a Harley V-Twin engine, and let
the folks at Harley _ with ol' Willie G. Davidson himself taking a
heavy hand _ give it a distinct look.
</P>
<P>
   What you get is an F-150 SuperCab that is lowered so low it
looks like it is crouching. It's the cruiser look.
</P>
<P>
   You've got a chrome billet grill and remarkable 20-by-9-inch
wheels _ biggest ever on a Ford production vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20-inch wheels pose a significant problem when you add them
to a rig that can spin them at high speeds. Bigger wheels means
bigger tires. Bigger tires, at high speeds, mean more centrifugal
force, and that could mean tire distortion or failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the thing we worked hardest on,'' George Magor, the
project manager for the Ford-Harley Alliance, said of the
wheel-tire combo.
</P>
<P>
   They built the wheels out of aluminum and coated them with
chrome. For the tires, they turned to Goodyear, which developed
Eagle GT2s that incorporate the company's ``run-flat'' technology
which, in effect, produces very strong sidewalls. They are rated to
130 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The result is some of the most beautiful wheels I have seen on
any vehicle. They give this F-150 a distinct presence.
</P>
<P>
   The other remarkable distinction is the sound, produced, Magor
said, by ``tinkering with the lengths and numbers of tubes inside
the exhaust can.'' Like building a musical instrument. It's a tune
that does it for me.
</P>
<P>
   The Triton V-8 that produces the power that produces the burble
cranks out 260 horsepower and 350 ft.-lb. of torque. It delivered
15.6 miles per gallon in more than a week of driving.
</P>
<P>
   It is a very responsive engine, hurtling the truck forward when
asked to do so and, with that torque rating, I'm sure it would be a
hauling and towing beast.
</P>
<P>
   To smooth the ride _ no easy task on a truck with big wheels _
the suspension has been lowered an inch and the springs and sway
bar suspension have been strengthened. They've done a good job in
tuning the suspension _ coil springs up front, leaf springs in the
rear _ and on most roads and in highway travel, it is a crisp,
smooth charger. Only when the suspension encountered a repetitive
series of bumps _ such as washboard _ did a noticeable shudder
develop, running diagonally from front to opposite rear.
</P>
<P>
   In hard corners, it sat remarkably upright and you quickly
realized the only leaning being done was by the occupants of the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   With four doors, getting in and out of the front and rear seats
was easy _ made easier for adults, at least, by the fact the truck
sits lower than normal.
</P>
<P>
   The front seats _ leather captain's chairs embossed with the
Harley logo were firm and supportive _ like a good saddle on a
Softail Springer.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the rear seat, where three people could sit with
decent legroom, was a bit upright, and as the four-door pickup
evolves increasingly into a popular family transport choice,
manufacturers are going to have to make this rear seat just a bit
more comfortable. Some folks will make their decisions on whether
or not to buy a particular truck with the back seat a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   Leather, as I said, is all over the inside: seats, steering
wheel, armrests.
</P>
<P>
   When it was first introduced, the Harley-Davidson F-150 came
with a tonneau cover and it was a slick-looking cap. But Ford had
quality problems with the supplier _ the covers wouldn't hold the
paint job Ford/Harley wanted on them _ so Harley dropped $550 off
the MSRP and delivered this year's model without the cover. The
problem with that is it leaves the big rubber bedliner _ loose in
the bed and embossed with a huge Harley logo _ in easy reach of
thieves.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bedliner that would make a nice wall hanging or rug in
certain homes. I can see one in, say, a living room in winter with
a Harley parked on it.
</P>
<P>
   But news for the future is good. The tonneau cover will return
and, Magro assured me, Ford/Harley will offer a new model of the
specialized truck for each of the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to sell 8,000 this year, 8,000 next year, and remain
limited in production throughout the run of the joint venture.
Colors will change and mechanics will change.
</P>
<P>
   Is that an F-150 SVT Harley-Davidson Lightning I hear rumbling
just over the hill?
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The arrow just below that fuel gauge that reminds you which
side the gas cap is on. If you're a family that swaps vehicles
around, it's sometimes easy to forget how to pull up to a pump.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The chrome pseudo-step-up-bars tucked under the rocker panels.
Don't tread on me, they say. Problem is, lots of families with what
some Harley types call ``rug rats'' would probably prefer some
semblance of a usable step those kids could use to get out of the
truck.

HOPES OF SAVING SUBMARINE CREW DIM AS RESCUE EFFORTS CONTINUE TO
FAIL  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In frantic efforts made against increasingly hopeless
odds to save the crew of the crippled nuclear-powered submarine
Kursk, Russian rescue teams failed again Thursday to lock onto a
rear escape hatch of the shattered vessel. As they worked, new
reports emerged of catastrophic damage to the hull, suggesting that
the ship went down in a torrent of fire and flooding that may have
killed or mortally wounded everyone on board.
</P>
<P>
   With no signs of life for two days from any of the 118 sailors
and officers, Russia's top navy commanders met with Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebvanov at Severodmorsk, headquarters of the
Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were to discuss whether to continue the so-far
fruitless attempts to land a rescue vessel on the Kursk's rear deck
or whether to use other methods to raise and begin salvaging the
vessel, whose two nuclear reactors pose a threat to Arctic
fisheries. The submarine sank last weekend during naval maneuvers
in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The grim damage assessments were made after viewing hours of
underwater video of the Kursk's shattered bow section, cracked deck
plates, shredded foredeck and battered conning tower. And stark
differences between Moscow and Washington were emerging over the
fundamental cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister said he had ``irrefutable data''
pointing to a collision. But senior U.S. defense and intelligence
officials said the Kursk had suffered powerful internal explosions.
No scenario yet bridged the two versions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov called the situation ``next to
catastrophic,'' as engineers and admirals studied whether giant
pontoons could be fitted to the rear of the Kursk to bring its rear
escape hatch nearer to the surface where divers might open it.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past night, there were no changes for better or
worse,'' Kasyanov told a meeting of senior government officials in
Moscow. He added that ``we want to hope that there are chances''
remaining to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   In Murmansk, where Russian naval officials mobilized the
hospital ship Svir to treat sailors who might be freed by rescuers,
a sense of gloom set in. Some families said they had all but lost
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the whole crew may be lost, making the sinking
of the Kursk Russia's worst peacetime naval disaster, generated a
wave of recriminations through the Russian news media.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism was aimed at the military, but also at the
Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who remained on vacation at
the Black Sea resort of Sochi and planned to meet with leaders of
former Soviet republics on Friday, the day when navy officials were
expected to acknowledge that the crew no longer had breathable air.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian media also questioned why the military and Putin had
failed to disclose to the nation that a tragedy had occurred on
Saturday, when the first reports of underwater explosions rattled
Western intelligence sensors in the region. The government
acknowledged the accident only on Monday, saying the mishap had
occurred on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sailors on the Kursk fell silent yesterday,'' the
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda stated Thursday in large red type.
``Why has the president been silent? Why on earth did he think it
was possible to keep mum for five days, when the entire nation has
spent those days consumed with only one thought _ will they be
saved or won't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia said the catastrophe had ``sunk the people's faith'' in
government. ``It is the authorities themselves who have hit
bottom,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater video taken over several days and analyzed at navy
headquarters Thursday confirmed massive structural damage to the
forward compartments of the ship, including the bridge section
under the conning tower where Capt. Gennadi Lyachin, 45, and a
number of senior officers of the Northern Fleet would have been
stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a
flash,'' said a navy spokesman, Igor Dygalo.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest mystery that remains is what triggered the
disaster as the 14,000-ton vessel steamed through the Barents Sea
at a depth that longtime Russian naval officers regarded as
dangerously shallow for the Kursk to operate in, given its length
of 490 feet and height of more than 100 feet from the bottom of the
keel to the top of its conning tower and periscope masts. A simple
failure of a torpedo tube or of the steering mechanism could pull
its nose down and send it crashing into the bottom, Western and
Russian naval experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's remarks Thursday injected a new mystery into the sea
tragedy. U.S. defense and intelligence officials said Wednesday
that they detected the sound of two underwater explosions, one much
larger than the other, near the Kursk's location on Saturday
morning. The U.S. officials cast doubt on any speculation that the
submarine was involved in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   But Sergeyev, in remarks to the Interfax news agency, asserted
Thursday that ``The scenario in which the Kursk submarine suffered
from a collision with another object is now the main one _
irrefutable data are already available.'' He did not elaborate on
that evidence and whether it arose exclusively from an examination
of the hull or from interrogation of naval officers aboard other
Russian ships operating with the Kursk at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Eduard Baltin, former commander of Russian submarine forces in
the Pacific, said Thursday that the Kursk was operating in a sea
lane frequently used by cargo vessels traveling between the ports
of Murmansk and Dikson, a remote port east of Murmansk on the Kara
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only realistic version is the sub collided with a
cargo vessel,'' Baltin said, writing in Thursday's Komsomolskaya
Pravda, ``because it is in this area where there is a recommended
course for civil navigation between Murmansk and Dikson.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a similar collision, with less catastrophic results for
the submarine, occurred in the same area about 15 years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in July, compared with
a 0.6 percent rise in June, the Labor Department said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What in tarnation does that mean and why does everyone in the
market care so much?
</P>
<P>
   Market professionals and just about everybody else seem obsessed
with the major economic indicators, such as the CPI. The reason:
These economic figures offer the best indication of whether the
economy is growing, shrinking or holding steady.
</P>
<P>
   When released by government agencies, market participants digest
the numbers with two questions in mind: Will these numbers trigger
a move by the Federal Reserve to change interest rates? How will
the data affect the stocks and sectors I follow?
</P>
<P>
   Investors and market professionals watch economic indicators to
gauge what is happening to the economy, to predict what the Fed
will do to interest rates, and to prepare themselves for a rising
or falling stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates slow the growth of the economy and
ultimately hurt the stock market. (Of course, some areas, like food
stocks, are considered havens during a slowing economy and should
do well.) As rates rise, risk-free Treasury bonds become more
attractive as investments.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, on the other hand, become less desirable. With stocks,
you're taking on more risk than with Treasuries. To compensate for
that risk, stocks must produce ever-higher returns, which becomes
increasingly difficult if the economy is slowing.
</P>
<P>
   You might be asking: Then why is a healthy, growing economy bad?
</P>
<P>
   A blossoming, strong economy isn't bad. But an economy that's
growing too quickly can lead to inflation, which is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation means that prices for goods and services are rising.
And as prices rise, your dollar buys less and less. If inflation is
out of control, businesses cannot accurately price their goods and
services, which leads to economic instability.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Federal Reserve's broad mandates is to control
prices, which means controlling inflation. The Fed, led by the
always-popular Alan Greenspan, does that by raising or lowering
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed abhors accelerating inflation,'' says Mitchell Held,
economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates slow the economy and reduce the risk of
inflation, while lower interest rates spur the economy and entice
consumers and companies to borrow and spend. Lower rates are
traditionally good for the stock market. Higher rates are not.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates three
times in an effort to tame inflation and throw water on the hot
economy. Right now, the thinking is that the economy has
sufficiently cooled, inflation is in check and the Fed is done
raising rates _ at least for the time being. (The Fed's Federal
Open Market Committee meets again next week.)
</P>
<P>
   However _ and it's a big however _ one wild economic indicator
or two can sometimes change the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That view will change if it turns out that we're looking at
bigger gains in employment coupled with a great-enough increase by
wages and salaries to suggest that consumer spending is
rejuvenated,'' says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's
Investors Service. ``Market sentiment will shift from a neutral
view and investors should prepare themselves for additional Federal
Reserve rate hikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street monitors a host of different economic indicators in
every effort to predict the direction of the economy and the Fed.
Here's a primer on the most important ones.
</P>
<P>
   JOBS DATA
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, you want to pay attention to the employment
report that comes out on the first Friday of every month.
</P>
<P>
   This Labor Department report is usually the first major economic
announcement during any given month and is the single best measure
of the health of the economy. ``The first is always the easiest to
remember,'' jokes Held at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   This release, containing information about job and wage growth,
delivers a broad view of what is going on with the economy. This
report provides an overview of what happened to the economy during
the previous month and usually sets the tenor for the other
economic indicators that are released through the rest of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people use the employment stats to generate their own
economic forecasts,'' says Held.
</P>
<P>
   If job growth is rising, for example, you might conclude that
production of goods and services is likewise expanding, says
Lonski. If people are making more money, they are probably going to
be spending more money.
</P>
<P>
   And if all indicators point to an economy that's growing out of
control, the Fed could very well feel obligated to raise rates. And
rising rates are usually bad for most stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report is key for another reason: Greenspan thinks it's
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any favored indicator of Alan Greenspan's is a favorite of
ours,'' says Held. ``He will run hot and cold on various indicators
but the employment report is a keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER PRICE INDEX
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index is another closely watched indicator
that's released around the 15th of every month.
</P>
<P>
   This index measures the change in cost of a basket of goods and
services such as food, energy, housing, clothing, transportation,
medical care, entertainment and education. It's a direct gauge of
whether prices are rising or not. And rising prices can mean
inflation. And you know what the Fed likes to do to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want to watch the core number, which excludes the
volatile food and energy sectors and gives a better indication of
inflationary trends.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER PRICE INDEX
</P>
<P>
   The Producer Price Index, or PPI, is an indicator of wholesale
prices in the country. This index measures the change in prices
received by domestic producers of commodities in all stages of
processing. The Labor Department releases both the CPI and the PPI,
which is released around the 13th of the month.
</P>
<P>
   This number can also give you an indication if spending is
growing and prices are on the rise. However, the CPI is arguably
the most direct measure of inflation. ``The CPI is a broader
measure,'' says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial
Services Group. It includes not just goods but services like
medical care and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL SALES
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, the Commerce Department releases a measure of
sales at retail outlets. Although retail sales don't include
spending on services, it can tell you a lot about consumer
spending. Are folks buying more clothes or less?
</P>
<P>
   Anything that gives an indication that consumer spending is on
the rise and inflation is coming back can roil the market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, any of these economic indicators can move the stock
market when they're announced, if they dramatically exceed what the
market is expecting.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that anyone knows from one measure or two if the Fed
will raise rates. It's the expectation of what the Fed might do.
</P>
<P>
   If the CPI number came in much higher than expected, it would be
an unpleasant surprise for the market and have a negative effect on
stocks and bonds. ``Inflation is the enemy of bond holders,'' says
Hoffman. With inflation, bonds will be worth less by the time they
mature because of rising prices. Any signs of inflation can hurt
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   If the market thinks rates will continue to rise, investors
might sell financial stocks, which are typically hurt by rising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rates and a slowing economy can put downward pressure on
the stock market. In a slowing economy, businesses that make
expendable goods might get hurt. You may want to avoid buying the
stocks of companies that make cars or equipment used in home
construction _ sectors that will be dramatically affected in a
slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors will go for defensive stocks like utilities
or pharmaceuticals, companies that manufacture products that
consumers cannot do without. Think drugs, toilet paper and food.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are buying stocks to own for decades, you don't need
to be too fixated on these economic numbers. There are plenty of
people in the market who will do that for you.

   EUROPEAN-DRESS (New York) _ ``Curios and Treasures,'' a modest,

<P>
   APPLES-SEATTLE (Seattle) _ It is difficult to think of any city,
other than the urban behemoths like New York and Los Angeles, and
maybe Washington, that has shaped modern living in the United
States as much as this one. Nordstrom, Boeing, Microsoft,
Starbucks, Amazon: all innovators, all based here in the Pacific
Northwest, off in a remote corner of the nation, far from the main
centers of population. Yet they play a central part in daily life
across this continent and beyond. Seattle still has its funky side.
It revels in its mellow small-town atmosphere; a Seattle ad man
popularized the ``happy face.'' But it has become an unmistakably
rich, high-tech, high-rise, high-expectation metropolis. By R.W.
Apple Jr.

   NY-ALTERNATIVE-THEATER (New York) _ Scores of shows are now on
at the Fringe, the annual two-week downtown theater festival that
revels in all things dramatic and different. Every day, the Fringe
will present almost 80 performances, staged by some 2,000 artists
from 13 countries. The Fringe is only one of several theater
festivals currently running in the city. By Jesse McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-ARTISTS (New York) _ Institutional group exhibitions of
up-and-coming artists have long been an annual feature in the
city's art season. Three are on view now, at the Studio Museum in
Harlem, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and El Museo del Barrio. The
museums themselves are still seen as fringe venues, but they're
also integral players in the big picture of American art, and their
shows feed the larger pool of talent from which mainstream stars
emerge. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-COLUMN (Undated) _ When you are selling 800 vintage,
classic and antique sports cars in one place, you are bound to come
across a big party or two. There are nonstop festivities planned
around the car sales in Pebble Beach, Calif., this weekend, and the
auction houses and car dealers expect about 20,000 people. By Wendy

   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Whether they know it or not, when Westerners
try to conjure an image of fine Arab culture, it's probably close
to the courtyards and covered market streets of Syria's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go into the city,'' wrote travel writer Henry
Van Dyke, ``we step into a chapter of the 'Arabian Nights'
Entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation was made in 1908, but it still fits a city that
manages, amid its modernity, to stay alive with elegant detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cats slumber across finely carved tables with inlaid
mother-of-pearl oyster shell. Thick vines dangle over the walls of
the Old City. Diners smoke water pipes and sip tea in tile-lined
courtyards around quiet fountains. Swordmakers discuss their
ancient craft even as they consider advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria slowly opens to the west, a small but growing number of
Americans are getting to know the exotic city of about 3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Damascus prides itself as the oldest capital in the world _
going back at least 5,000 years _ and as a showcase of Arab
tradition. It shows itself off with sometimes grand, and sometimes
funky flourishes. For the former, there's the stately tomb of
Saladin (pronounced, ``sala-DEEN''), probably the most heroic,
non-religious, Muslim figure in all history.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the army museum, where the power might go out as
you wander between the run-down artillery, tanks, rifles and the
dusty exhibit on Syrian Hamad Feris, who joined Soviet cosmonauts
in space. One of the few English signs at the exit states, with no
apparent irony, ``Tanks(CQ) for your visit.''
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, Syria is largely crime free. Arabic is the common
language and many Syrians also speak French. There are few
proficient English speakers, but some taxi drivers or hotel staff
will know a few words.
</P>
<P>
   Americans need to get a Syrian visa before departing. Those can
be obtained in about a week from Syrian embassies or consulates.
Syria still does not recognize Israel and will not grant visas to
people with Israeli stamps in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian countryside is flush with archeological digs and
dozens of Crusader and Muslim castles. But the capital offers a
sampling of the great mix of cultures to come through this corner
of the Mediterranean. It's also a shopping wonder, offering rugs,
furniture and metal work from around the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medi''). He was the Mamluke
ruler who, before his death in 1277, defeated the Mongols and
almost finished off the Crusaders who had hung on after Saladin. He
was violent and unforgiving, but his tomb is decorated with the
palaces and lush plants awaiting him in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Old City is the Omayyad Mosque, a huge
courtyard bordered by a large prayer hall built around 708 A.D.
Inside and out are mosaics of glass beads from as far back as the
12th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The mingling between Islam and Christianity is apparent. The
mosque's minaret towers include the Jesus tower, where locals
believe he will return on judgment day. Inside the mosque is a
shrine to John the Baptist, revered and called Yahia by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the mosque should remove their shoes, but keep their
arms and legs covered or borrow the robes offered at the ticket
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Old City also offers a Christian landmark. The underground
Chapel of Ananias is named after a disciple of Jesus who is
believed to have lived there. Ananias was ordered, according to the
New Testament, to go to ``the street which is called Straight'' to
heal a blind man. The Street Called Straight is still a main road
through the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   After sightseeing, tourists can join the genteel Arab elite in
Old City restaurants built around what used to be private palaces.
The Elizer and Arabesque restaurants are two fine examples where
you can dine on lamb kabobs and traditional yogurt stews.
</P>
<P>
   When you have enough of the living history in the Old City, you
can see Syria's ancient history in the National Museum. Most
explanations are in Arabic and French, but the museum is excellent.
Most interesting are the expressive, big-eyed statuettes carved by
the Canaanites, the pagan people who populated the region in 3000
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   There are also haunting relief statues from the Second Century
Roman period. Each depicts in personal detail men and women who had
been entombed behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also contains a synagogue transported from Dura
Europus, near the Syrian-Iraqi border. Though nearly 1,800 years
old, the synagogue still holds colorful painted scenes from the
bible that brighten the small sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Museum visitors might want to stop and dash off some postcards
in the museum's tranquil archeological garden. Here, under trees
that quiet the city bustle outside the walls, you can stroll amid
detailed relief sculptures and statues that form the foundations of
today's Damascus.

</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the walled Old City. It's a large,
working district where Syrians shop for everything from clothes to
dehydrated Newts. Sold in jars in the medicinal herb stalls, a
paste of the little lizards is supposed to cure ills and provide
sexual vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to other exotic venues where the locals serve the
tourists, in Damascus' Old City, the relatively few tourists and
locals line up together at the prime spots.
</P>
<P>
   That can be at Bakdash, a crowded ice cream parlor. It sells a
delicious firm ice cream that, for some reason, requires loud
pounding by fit men with wooden hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, it can be at the mausoleum of Saladin. He was the Muslim
general who ruled over most of the Arab world and drove the
European Crusaders out of Jerusalem. While his Crusader opponent,
England's Richard the Lion-Hearted, was known for brutality,
Saladin was honorable.
</P>
<P>
   He died in 1192 in Damascus. Though he is a hero of the Arabs,
he was an ethnic Kurd. You can still find Kurds _ who are mostly in
Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria _ visiting the tomb today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the leader who conquered places taken by the
foreigners,'' said Kurd Ali Mohammed, 21, a laborer in Damascus.
``He was very powerful, but he was also very merciful.''
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two tombs. A faded box of carved,
walnut-colored wood appears to be the original. In 1899, Germany's
Kaiser Wilhelm II added a marble tomb beside it, in honor of
Saladin.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of streets away is the mausoleum of another central
figure in Middle Eastern history, Sultan Baibars (pronounced,
``BAY-bears''). He was the Mamluke ruler who, before his death in
1277, defeated the Mongols and almost finished off the Crusaders
who had hung on after Saladin. He was violent and unforgiving, but
his tomb is decorated with the palaces and lush plants awaiting him
in heaven.

<P>
   PALMYRA, Syria _ This was a working city, made rich from the
caravans that passed through and paid taxes on each goatskin of
oriental perfume and every camel-load of foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than 1,700 years past its prime. But Palmyra was once
the bustling home to 350,000 people. Water pipes of hollowed-out
stones still line the streets and an inscription urges locals to be
helpful to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ancient example of the importance of location. Palmyra
was on the Silk Road between the Orient and the Mediterranean and
near a source of water, which travelers would pay for dearly.
</P>
<P>
   When its main competitor, the Nabataean(CQ) trading city of
Petra in what is now Jordan, fell to the Romans in the Second
Century, Palmyra blossomed. It reached its peak in the Third
Century, gaining freedom from taxation by the Roman rulers.
</P>
<P>
   But the city would decline starting 272 A.D. Zenobia, the shrewd
Arab queen who claimed her lineage from Egypt's Cleopatra, tried to
gain independence. Instead, Roman armies crushed her rebellion and
took her prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient city stands in the desert about a three-hour drive
northeast from Damascus. Among the sites on the way is a
Palestinian refugee camp (more than 370,00 refugees live in Syria).
Eventually, the road is lined by the modern pipeline bringing oil
to the Mediterranean from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   About 35,000 people live in the new town of Palmyra next to the
ruins. There are several hotels. The ruins can be seen in a hurried
day. But, it's better to take two days for wandering through the
amphitheater, temples, public market and caravan stopping post,
museum and residential homes. The ruins are said to be magnificent
at dawn and dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra still possesses huge walls and spectacular colonnades
that stand out with a ghost-like presence in the dusty, hilly
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Palmyra is a Roman name, meaning city of palms. In Arabic, it is
Tadmor, meaning city of dates. Date palms abound.
</P>
<P>
   Intricate relief statues illustrate the city's people and gods.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Temple of Bel, the Babylonian god of the sky, one stone
panel shows women covered in swirls of cloth, a sign that veiling
took place even before Muslim times. Other panels show soldiers in
their armor and with their camels.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 32 A.D., the temple took 200 years to build. That's
longer than modern construction jobs but, then, most of the
structure has lasted nearly 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, still with its massive walls and many of
the surrounding columns, reliefs carved on the ceiling of an altar
show Bel surrounded by other gods and the signs of the Zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   The best look at the people of Palmyra _ a mix of Arab and Greek
bloodlines _ comes from their tombs on the edge of town. The
wealthy were entombed in towers, the poor in underground crypts.
</P>
<P>
   At the front of each tomb, lined with shelves where bodies were
laid on top of each other, were relief portraits of the people
inside. Those reliefs are in the Palmyra museum.
</P>
<P>
   The portraits are individual enough to make you feel like you're
meeting the inhabitants of the ancient city. Wealthy merchants are
portrayed with big bellies, a sign of prosperity. Some men have
curly hair, others straight. Women are shown holding their veils
slightly to the side to show their faces.
</P>
<P>
   About 480 feet above the desert floor, on a mountaintop, is the
12th Century Muslim Qala'at Ibn Ma'an castle. The castle,
surrounded by a moat and guard towers, provides a sweeping view of
the tombs, ancient Palmyra and the new city next door.

   VH1 has scored big ratings with its ``Behind the Music'' series
and other kinds of documentary programming. Its latest effort is
``VH1 Confidential,'' debuting at 10 tonight, a kind of ``Behind
the Music Without the Boring Parts.''
</P>
<P>
   The show will explore the mysteries and myths of rock 'n' roll _
maybe they can get to the truth of Dylan's motorcycle accident. But
tonight's choice is more predictable _ one more rehash of the
controversy surrounding Kurt Cobain's suicide, which some factions
inevitably claim was murder. This is one second gunman theory to
which we'll say thanks but no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Karen's gone, but we still have to
listen to poor love-starved ``cuddle bunny'' Brittany _ cruel and
unusual punishment indeed.

hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' WB at 8: The Scooby Gang has to go
back to the ghostly ruins of their high school to prevent the
apocalypse one more time. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysterious Ways,'' Pax at 8: Corporate synergy between NBC and
its new toy, the Pax network, means that this show moves over to
the latter beginning tonight with the pilot. Adrian Pasdar and Rae
Dawn Chong star in a series that might be called ``Touched By An
X-File.'' We're not sure if we call this a rerun or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ABC at 9: Straight-laced Greg ponders the
meaning of his lawyerly existence. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' NBC at 9: Frasier hosts a bachelor party for Donny
and swears he won't be a stuffy fussbudget as usual. What are the
odds? Rerun.
</P>

sitcom ``Bewitched,'' including the real life drama of the two

</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the Music,'' VH1 at 9: Speaking of wringing out, VH1
also manages to stretch the story of the short-lived 1980s band The
Bangles to an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Right Temptation,'' HBO at 9: This R-rated 2000 cheapo
noir flick about a female private eye involved in messy sexual
intrigues has the potential to be so bad it's good. Consider the
cast: Rebecca De Mornay, Kiefer Sutherland, Dana Delany, Adam
Baldwin, Joanna Cassidy.

   Two interesting specials tonight look at two different sides of
pop music and its effect on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand and Be Counted,'' on TLC at 9, finds David Crosby
hosting the first of a two-part documentary series on social
activism in rock 'n' roll, from the early days of the folk boom
through ``The Concert for Bangla Desh,'' right up to today's
benefits for the rain forests and a free Tibet. (Part two airs
Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   Crosby may be best known today as a test-tube daddy and liver
transplant recipient, but he was a stalwart rock activist even
before he wrote ``Almost Cut My Hair'' for Crosby, Stills and Nash.
The story he tells here and in a companion book begins with
nonviolent civil rights protests and moves through the tumult of
the 1960s to the all-star benefit cycle kicked off by Live Aid in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of rock-star interviews here (Bob Geldof,
Carlos Santana, Joan Baez, Peter Gabriel, Sting, Tracy Chapman and
Willie Nelson), as well as performance footage by Bruce
Springsteen, Woody Guthrie and CSN. Unfortunately, we'll also have
to sit through flashbacks to the ``We Are The World'' recording
session, which proved once and for all that an all-star performance
doesn't necessarily make for good art.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting companion piece airs on MTV at 7. ``When Lyrics
Attack'' looks at the controversies generated at the other end of
the musical spectrum over racist, violent, misogynist and
homophobic lyrics, especially from rappers like Eminem. Must
artists be role models? Do hateful lyrics influence young
listeners?
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Loder hosts, and we'll hear everyone from Eminem himself to
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, plus the Beastie
Boys, who'll also be featured in the Crosby special. And at the end
of the 30-minute special, a round-table discussion will bring in
some young fans. But of course this topic could use two hours too,
or more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Monday Night Football,'' ABC at 8: Preseason game finds Green
Bay at Miami. But most people are tuning in to hear color man
Dennis Miller's erudite wisecracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Tonight, the cute little dog goes
into the red room and tearfully begs his former owners to remove
him from his reality-TV nightmare. (OK, not really, but it's more
interesting than whatever will really happen on the show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysterious Ways,'' NBC at 8: Adrian Pasdar and Rae Dawn Chong
star in a series that might be called ``Touched By An X-File.''
Tonight they investigate a haunted railroad crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of Queens,'' CBS at 8:30: A crossover episode finds Doug
and Carrie having an eventful dinner with Ray and Debra of
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS at 9: Raymond's mother
browbeats him into hiring his loathsome cousin Gerard (Fred
Stoller). Then he finds out that everyone thinks they're a lot
alike. A funny rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order,'' NBC at 9: Is a young girl responsible for the
death of a boy found at a construction site? Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal,'' Fox at 9: In a first-season episode, Ally and
the gang get help from the lawyers over at ``The Practice'' when a
client goes Lizzie Borden on her husband. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Untamed Amazonia,'' Animal Planet at 8: Tapirs! Sloths!
Otters! Agouti! (What?)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CABLE CAST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF Raw,'' USA at 9: Wrestling and vaudeville, followed at 10
by ``WWF War Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection Boulevard,'' Showtime at 10: On the eve of a big
fight, Alex gets involved with a powerful woman and may be losing
his focus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATE NIGHT TALK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' CBS at 11:35: Wesley Snipes,
musical guest Dido and the latest ``Survivor'' castoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight Show with Jay Leno,'' NBC at 11:35: TBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher,'' ABC at 12:05: Green
Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader. He's got to get airtime
somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late, Late Show with Craig Kilborn,'' CBS at 12:35 a.m.: John
Spencer of ``West Wing.''
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Thursday night, Vice President Al Gore must
walk on to the platform at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and
give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Success, as he accepts the Democratic nomination, will keep him
in the presidential race with a sporting chance of winning. Failure
could spell the beginning of the end of his political career, at
52.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, Gore must parry the attacks _ overt and implied _
from the platform of the Republican Convention two weeks ago, but
he must also present himself as a party leader and
president-in-waiting, a superior alternative to George W. Bush and
his well-drilled, seemingly moderate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The last is perhaps the simplest. The policy ideas set out by
Bush left gaping holes just waiting for the Democratic nominee to
fill.
</P>
<P>
   Health care, pensions, low pay and the environment, as well as
reform of the business-dominated system of political funding, are
areas of public concern that Gore can usefully exploit.
</P>
<P>
   He can claim a share of the credit for the U.S.'s longest period
of economic expansion and cite his eight years' White House
experience to support his claim to be a better steward of the
country's prosperity into the future.
</P>
<P>
   He can also upstage Bush's boast of leading a diverse and
inclusive party by having named Joseph Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew,
as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But Gore's weaknesses lie less in content than
in manner and character. From his earliest years as a congressman
from Tennessee, even his supporters had nagging doubts about the
mismatch between the scale of his ambition and his political and
intellectual abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Having attained his party's presidential nomination after two
failed attempts, he must now show that there is genuine substance
beneath the exaggerated ardor or anger he often displays in his
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows he has experience; what they question is whether
he has the spine to take the hard decisions and the insight to read
the nation's mood.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's intellectual caliber, compared with that of
Bush anyway, is not at issue; his political sensitivity and his
ability to connect with the voters are.
</P>
<P>
   While described universally as delightful and even funny in
private, Gore lacks Bush's charm in public. It may be that the
presence of his running mate, the far more relaxed and even
garrulous Lieberman, will loosen him up.
</P>
<P>
   But unless he can make up in gravitas and honesty what he lacks
in charisma, Gore will fare badly by comparison with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas, though, is not the only, or even the most
threatening, point of comparison. In Los Angeles, Gore has somehow
to emerge from the giant shadow of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Making the move from vice president to presidential nominee is
always problematical, but Clinton has given Gore an even harder job
than Ronald Reagan gave George Bush senior in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Both two-term presidents had an exceptional talent for
communicating and an uncanny sense of the national mood. Like Bush
with Reagan, Gore will never match Clinton: he lacks his personal
magnetism, political instinct and quickness of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gore is worse off than Bush, however, is in the issue of
ethics. Clinton bequeaths to Gore the fallout from White House
sleaze and his own scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Against that, Gore can set the solidity of his family. The
choice of Lieberman, one of Clinton's earliest critics in the
Lewinsky affair, has given him one degree of separation. Clinton's
own new apology last week gave him another.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is not without ethical burdens of his own: his
hesitation about condemning Clinton's conduct with Lewinsky is one;
the legality of his fund-raising and his equivocation about it is
another. Somehow he must allay voters' doubts on these scores.
</P>
<P>
   While planned to look less slick than the Republicans'
song-and-dance show of unity and moderation, the Democratic
Convention has been no less choreographed, and to one end alone:
portraying Al Gore as president-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The progressive reintroduction of Al Gore _ family man, caring
politician, national leader _ will culminate tonight. &QL;

   ``The Crisis Counselor'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Step-by-Step Guide to Managing a Business Crisis &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Jeffrey R. Caponigro &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary Books, $16.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Crisis skulks around businesses like a hyena around a camp site
_ watching and waiting, and then dashing in, all teeth and claws,
shredding reputations, trashing earnings, leaving behind bloodied
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in his right mind would camp on a veldt swarming with
ravenous hyenas without taking protective measures. Yet businesses
and other organizations operate in an environment just as perilous,
metaphorically speaking, and most take no crisis precautions.
According to a survey taken in the early 1990s and quoted by author
Jeffrey Caponigro in his book ``The Crisis Counselor,'' only 5
percent to 10 percent of large organizations had a crisis
management plan.
</P>
<P>
   Caponigro says no business is too small or too large for crisis
planning. All businesses, regardless of size, face problems every
day. Many problems are handled quickly and dissolve, but others
erupt into crises. ``The Crisis Counselor'' is a practical guide
that defines crises, describes ways to prevent them and explains
how to manage them.
</P>
<P>
   The biggies _ oil spills, plane crashes, explosions, product
tampering _ spring to mind when ``business crisis'' is mentioned.
``The Crisis Counselor'' is unusual among crisis literature,
however, in that it doesn't focus on high-profile disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Caponigro takes aim at garden-variety events that are
more common and more likely to harm reputations or credibility. On
his list are employee layoffs, product recalls, lawsuits, irate
customers and the death of a senior executive.
</P>
<P>
   Most books and workshops on the subject are heavily slanted
toward ways to survive and contain damage. ``The Crisis Counselor''
focuses strongly on avoiding crises.
</P>
<P>
   Caponigro offers good basic advice, beginning with public
relations. He emphasizes its value as a tool to mitigate damage.
The best way to survive a corporate crisis, Caponigro says, is to
have a substantial store of good will from key ``publics'':
customers, employees, news media, suppliers, and civic and
community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Also important in a corporate crisis-management program is an
assessment of vulnerabilities based on information gathered from
the organization's key publics. Having a realistic written list of
possible vulnerabilities allows the crisis-management team to take
preventive action, conduct practice sessions for employees, assign
the best-prepared people to respond, stockpile supplies and take
other steps to lessen damage.
</P>
<P>
   Caponigro also recommends that every business prepare a written
crisis-response plan, in which each person's duties are spelled
out. He warns, however, against thinking of the plan as the end
result. Sometimes people make a crisis-response plan, place it on
the shelf and say, ``That's that.'' Later, when a disaster strikes,
executives react intuitively, forgetting the plan. The plan,
Caponigro writes, is just one part of a crisis-management culture
that should include awareness and response training, even when no
crises threaten.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most business books, this one is a refreshing
breeze. Each chapter starts with questions to help readers assess
their knowledge of the material to be covered. The text is
organized into comfortable paragraphs containing immediately useful
guidance, applicable to businesses and organizations from the
smallest to the largest. The author provides direction and
professional criticism on how everyday crises can be handled and
includes examples and case studies.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an executive or a manager in a business or
organization that hasn't faced up to crisis planning, this book may
be the best business investment you'll ever make. If you don't have
time to read it at work as part of your job, keep it on the night
stand and read a chapter each evening.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis hyenas are always circling. The professional way to
deal with them is to take precautions: appoint a crisis-management
team to seek vulnerabilities, establish preventive measures, review
and keep current a crisis response plan, periodically conduct
practice sessions and take the lead when a crisis strikes. This
book can help you do all that. &QL;

`GODZILLA 2000': SIZE REALLY DOES MATTER AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a diehard fan of the long-running Japanese ``Godzilla''
series could love ``Godzilla 2000,'' the 23rd screen appearance of
the indestructible fire-breathing monster that emerges from the sea
to wreak awesome destruction. This is not to say that there aren't
thousands (perhaps even millions) of cultists who won't adore it.
Watching this transcendentally tacky movie, which wants us to laugh
at it and with it at the same time, it is easy to see why the
series threatens to be as enduring as its namesake.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese version, as opposed to Roland Emmerich's
pretentious, clanking Hollywood update of a few years back, takes a
more philosophical view of Godzilla. Is the monster a super-clumsy
lumbering friend of mankind. Or is he our enemy? Or is he both?
Might his longevity owe itself to the fact that he is really
ourselves in a different form? Ah, who knows what evil lurks?
</P>
<P>
   The beast's latest resurrection, directed by Takao Okawara, has
been scaled back from 328 feet (his height from 1991 through 1995),
to 170 feet, which is close to his original size (from 1954 to
1975, the production notes, inform us, Godzilla was 164 feet). Such
things matter to cult audiences.
</P>
<P>
   What really hasn't changed radically in 46 years is the series'
1950s-style comic book pacing and dialogue. The movie wastes no
time cutting to the chase. In the first five minutes, Godzilla
destroys a submarine and a seaside restaurant. By the end of the
film, most of Tokyo lies smoking at his feet. Unlike the Hollywood
version, ``Godzilla 2000'' doesn't try too terribly hard for
realism. The structures that are toppled and snapped like match
sticks look like toys.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the fun is the awfulness of the dialogue that has
been hilariously (and badly) dubbed into English and is always
spoken in the semi-robotic gee-whiz tones of Saturday morning
cartoons. It reaches a peak of silliness when one startled
character actually exclaims, ``Great Caesar's ghost!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla 2000'' has enough story to fill three movies. The
fable basically pits the good guys (those who want to study
Godzilla and learn from him) against the baddies (those determined
to destroy Godzilla as quickly as possible and who are willing to
sacrifice human lives to get the dirty deed done).
</P>
<P>
   This time, the debate over Godzilla's fate is complicated by the
discovery of what at first seems to be a meteorite on the bottom of
the ocean. It metamorphoses into a flying rock and then a UFO with
designs on taking over the Earth. Ultimately, Godzilla goes
literally head to head (and in one scene head in mouth) with a
Godzilla-like monster the aliens have conjured up on the smoking
ruins of what used to be Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond being an obvious fable about nuclear power in the
computer age, none of this adds up unless you are determined to
force every square peg into every round hole and pretend they fit.
The most ardent fans, no doubt, will be able to piece together an
allegorical puzzle.

`THE PRINCE OF TENNESSEE: THE RISE OF AL GORE': TRYING TO FIND THE
REAL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scattered throughout David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima's flimsy
new book, ``The Prince of Tennessee,'' are a few telling glimpses
of the vice president: Al Gore, at age 10, asking a teacher during
a field trip, ``Sir, is this the time to be rowdy?''; Al Gore, as a
Harvard sophomore during the escalating debate over Vietnam,
organizing a protest against the dining room's nightly servings of
fried chicken and gravy and lobbying for less-fattening fare; and
Al Gore, running for Congress in 1976, bulling his way through
nausea and nervousness, to prevail through sheer will.
</P>
<P>
   Maraniss and Nakashima tell us that Al Gore was a tattletale as
a boy, and that he always played a cowboy when he played cowboys
and Indians. They tell us that he was a plodding but tenacious
basketball player who invariably ended up in foul trouble; that
Harvard classmates occasionally allowed him into their all-night
poker games ``with the understanding that they would teach him how
to play while relieving him of his money, a few hundred dollars at
a time''; that he once contemplated writing a book called ``Salt
III'' about ``the different ways sodium affects our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the reader, the authors never pull together
such anecdotes into a coherent portrait of Al Gore. A similar
problem afflicted Maraniss' 1995 biography of Bill Clinton, ``First
in His Class,'' but that earlier book seems a model of diligence
compared to this hasty and perfunctory volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Tennessee'' grew out of a series of articles for
The Washington Post, and it still has a hurried, improvisational
air. Though the authors contend that ``many of the behavioral
patterns of the figure who would run for president in 2000 are best
explained by the boy he once was,'' their book hops and skips
through Gore's youth, and it proves even more arbitrary and
desultory in dealing with his political career.
</P>
<P>
   There is no serious assessment of Gore's record in Congress or
his performance as vice president and no real grappling with such
controversies as his involvement in the 1996 campaign finance
scandals or his changing views on abortion. Any reader looking for
a carefully considered appraisal of the vice president's life and
career would be better off reading Bill Turque's biography
``Inventing Al Gore,'' recently published by Houghton Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   Like Turque, Maraniss and Nakashima repeatedly use terms like
``cautious,'' ``self-righteous'' and ``competitive'' to describe Al
Gore, adjectives that readily come to mind to anyone who has
watched him on television or followed accounts of him in the press.
Once again we are told about the pressures the young Al Gore faced
in living up to the expectations of his father, Sen. Albert Gore of
Tennessee. Once again we hear about his halfhearted efforts to
rebel against a destiny in politics. And once again we hear about
his love of facts and his tendency to follow his head over his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   In his writings on President Clinton, Maraniss has frequently
spoken of his vacillation between idealism and opportunism, and in
the case of Gore, he and Nakashima come up with a similar equation,
arguing that the vice president has always moved between two poles:
between ``farsightedness and caution, selflessness and
self-aggrandizement,'' between ``principle and expediency,''
politeness and a ``studied viciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to Gore's behavior, the authors suggest, is an
insecurity that they say many of his former aides believe ``brought
out his tendency to be bureaucratic, defensive about his turf,
wooden in public presentation, prone to exaggerate his own
accomplishments, impressed by resumes and the conventions of the
establishment, and more timid than he wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so much in this sloppy book, this assessment of Gore is
contradicted by other observations made by the authors. In an early
chapter they write that Al Gore, unlike Bill Clinton, never seemed
driven to win the approval of strangers: ``he had a high enough
opinion of himself''; what set him apart from his prep school
classmates, they write, was ``his air of supreme confidence.''
Later they suggest that overconfidence played a significant role in
his failed 1988 run for the White House, a run fueled, they imply,
by a hubristic desire to place himself in a grand 28-year
historical cycle, going back to Teddy Roosevelt (1904), FDR (1932)
and John Kennedy (1960).
</P>
<P>
   Although the authors point out that ``there would be no great
28-year cycle,'' they add that Gore still shared a connection with
the Kennedy tradition: ``Family tragedies. Prep schools, Harvard.
Controversial fathers. Aggressive foreign/domestic policies.
Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the only case in which they demonstrate a knee-jerk
inclination to ratify Gore's view of himself or to rationalize
criticisms directed at him by other journalists. They argue, for
instance, that his tendency to overstate his accomplishments (like
taking credit for the Internet) should be put in a cultural
context, namely ``a country storytelling style that he inherited
from his father, built on grandiosity and hyperbole''; in any case,
they add, ``manipulating reality is an inherent aspect of
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   They note that Gore _ who wrote in his 1992 book ``Earth in the
Balance'' that he was impatient with his own ``tendency to put a
finger to the political winds'' _ has remained ``beholden to polls
and conventional wisdom,'' ``relying on consultants to calibrate
his image and message,'' but they nonetheless give him points for
showing ``that he knew the person he wished he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his environmental record as vice president, a record
criticized by reporters like Bill Turque for demonstrating ``a
pattern of passivity and timidity,'' the authors point out that
Gore decided to attend the 1997 global-warming talks in Kyoto,
Japan, in the face of pressure not to go. Never mind that the White
House did not even attempt to send the treaty to Congress amid
opposition from Republicans in the Senate: ``for those around him
who had seen the struggle between his idealism and ambition and who
knew how his insecurity could hold him back,'' Maraniss and
Nakashima write, ``this was a victory of a deeper sort. He had
found his gut.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of reflexive eagerness to pat Gore on the back,
combined with an unwillingness to assess his record rigorously,
underscores the cursory nature of this book, a volume that in the
end feels less like a real book than a patched-together production
brought out to cash in on the fall campaign.

`PLACE VENDOME': IN A SETTING FIT FOR A STAR, DENEUVE FINDS THE
FACETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By DAVID KEHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Named after the Parisian square that is home to the Ritz Hotel,
several haute couture boutiques and some of the world's most
expensive jewelry shops, ``Place Vendome'' provides a perfect
setting for Catherine Deneuve, herself one of the French cinema's
most precious gems.
</P>
<P>
   Now 56, an age when most American actresses would have been
shuffled off to play eccentric grandmothers in television movies,
Deneuve remains a star of regal proportions. The face has filled
out a tiny bit, the figure a bit more, but the piercing eyes and
granite jaw remain as formidable as ever.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Place Vendome'' she is Marianne Malivert, the unhappy,
alcoholic wife of a prominent jeweler (Bernard Fresson, a veteran
who appeared with Deneuve back in 1967's ``Belle de Jour''). Busy
checking herself in and out of assorted clinics, Madame Malivert is
too far gone to notice that her husband is facing bankruptcy. One
night he brings home a pouch containing five exquisite diamonds,
which he places in his wife's care; the next day, he kills himself
by driving his car into a logging truck.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds turn out to be stolen, and soon the befogged
Marianne finds herself besieged from all directions _ by
representatives of the De Beers cartel, who believe the stones to
have been taken from their stock; by her contemptuous
brother-in-law (Francois Berleand), who needs the gems to save the
family business; and by the mysterious Battistelli (Jacques
Dutronc), a shady operator with connections to the Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   All of which proves to be immensely therapeutic for Marianne,
who rises to the occasion by tossing out her bottles of Bordeaux
and rediscovering the canny businesswoman she was before her
marriage. Adding spice to the situation is the fact that in the
distant past she and Battistelli were lovers, until he abandoned
her to the police when one of his dubious deals went sour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to imagine Lana Turner or Elizabeth Taylor
playing Marianne in a high camp Hollywood melodrama of the late
1950s, but ``Place Vendome'' takes a more restrained approach.
Though Deneuve is given plenty of opportunities to wear fabulous
gowns while drifting through fabulous locations, the film is so
darkly lit (by the cinematographer Laurent Dailland) that it's
often difficult to make out the details. The mood, nicely sustained
by the director, Nicole Garcia, is one of muffled despair,
world-weary resignation and faintly rekindled hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, herself a fine actress (in such films as Alain Resnais'
1980 ``Mon Oncle d'Amerique''), has now made three features as a
writer-director (including 1990s ``Every Other Weekend'' and 1994's
``Favorite Son''), and she certainly knows how to frame a
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The script of ``Place Vendome, `` which Garcia wrote with her
usual collaborator, Jacques Fieschi, is filled with superfluous
characters and strained coincidences _ Emmanuelle Seigner turns up
as Battistelli's current lover, a salesgirl at the Malivert
boutique, and Jean-Pierre Bacri is a disbarred lawyer with a
romantic interest in Marianne. But in spite of its many flaws, the
film never loses its focus on its fascinating central figure.
Grandly suffering, grandly triumphant or just plain grand, Deneuve
is a spectacle to behold.

   ``Technique is nothing more than failed style,'' Stephen Dorff's
deranged director rants in the new John Waters film, ``Cecil B.
DeMented.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing Waters has that crocheted on a throw pillow in his
guest room, right under his original John Wayne Gacy clown
painting. After all, when it comes to style, Waters is one of the
few originals left in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the whiners who complained that ``Cry-Baby'' and
``Pecker'' were merely apocalyptic signs that the reigning king of
bad taste had sold his soul to the Hollywood equivalent of Old
Scratch (better known as Jack Valenti), rest assured that
``DeMented'' is a triumphant return to form. It's a trashy, nasty,
perverted, non-PC romp destined to offend almost anybody; in other
words, it's a good, old-fashioned John Waters movie.
</P>
<P>
   Dorff plays the title character, an insane auteur willing to
suffer, endure celibacy, commit murder and even die for his art.
Together with his crew of misfits, the Sprocket Holes, DeMented
stages an elaborate kidnapping scheme to secure the talents of
A-list actress Honey Whitlock (Melanie Griffith). Nabbed from the
Baltimore premiere of her new film ``Some Kind of Happiness,'' the
pampered starlet is whisked off to DeMented's lair, the decrepit
old Hippodrome Theater, where his gang plots a grassroots ``cinema
terrorism'' attack on mainstream movies, while simultaneously
shooting their exploits as part of an ongoing film.
</P>
<P>
   Honey is its unwilling star, of course, her clothes and makeup
punked out by a suicidal devil worshipper, her hair bleached blond
by a self-loathing heterosexual angry that he can't return the
affections of his gay lover. Militant lesbians and blacks, sex and
drug addicts and porn stars fill out the Sprocket Hole Corp., each
tattooed with the name of one of Waters' influences, from
exploitation kings such as Herschell Gordon Lewis and William
Castle to film legends such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Otto
Preminger.
</P>
<P>
   Their attacks start off innocently enough _ smoke-bombing a
theater auditorium playing ``Patch Adams: The Director's Cut'' _
but grow increasingly violent. Honey slowly finds herself siding
with Cecil as she watches her old career as a Hollywood hack wither
and her new career as a cult legend blossom.
</P>
<P>
   Waters crams in plenty of commentary, taking potshots at stars,
studios, censors, moviegoers and, to a large extent, himself. And
it's hard for any film critic not to take secret delight in the
terrorists' murderous rampage on the set of ``Gump Again,'' the
``Forrest Gump'' sequel shooting in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Waters populates ``DeMented'' with familiar faces from his
previous films, including Mink Stole, Ricki Lake and Patricia
Hearst (which is particularly twisted, considering how similar the
story line is to her own kidnapping saga.)
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all of Waters' works, it's a film that's not for all
tastes. But in a Hollywood where crudity and toilet humor have
become mainstream, it's nice to see bad taste delivered with a
little style.

`STEAL THIS MOVIE!': THAT WAS A HEADY TIME ON THE LEFT, RIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Steal This Movie!,'' Robert Greenwald's likable but muddled
screen biography of the charismatic Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman,
raises a ticklish question: how can a contemporary film ``do'' the
late 1960s in a way that isn't a sentimental retread of countless
documentaries that have trotted out the same old television news
clips to push the same old nostalgic buttons?
</P>
<P>
   Those filmmakers who have tackled the '60s, most notably Oliver
Stone, have typically pulled out every emotional stop, exalting the
era's Dionysian pretensions along with its self-righteous paranoia
and apocalyptic cant.
</P>
<P>
   Such movies only reinforce a myth that, its excesses and
burnouts notwithstanding, the era was American democracy's glorious
last moment of endless possibility. Despite the film's obvious
fondness for its subject and for the era, ``Steal This Movie!,''
adapted from two books _ Abbie and Anita Hoffman's ``To America
With Love: Letters From the Underground'' and Marty Jezer's ``Abbie
Hoffman: American Rebel'' _ doesn't sanctify either the '60s or the
main character, whom Vincent D'Onofrio plays with an appealing,
self-conscious gusto. The way the movie (quite accurately)
remembers the period, it was messy, frenetic and unglamorous. A lot
of what happened on the left had an ad hoc, improvisatory quality.
</P>
<P>
   Antiwar marchers may have descended on Washington by the
hundreds of thousands to protest the Vietnam War, but those (like
Hoffman) who actually had the nerve to stick flowers in soldiers'
rifle barrels while urging them to join them were few in number.
</P>
<P>
   Strapping and heroic, D'Onofrio may not physically resemble the
more diminutive Hoffman. And the actor's odd Boston-meets-Brooklyn
accent sounds somewhat forced. Yet his portrayal of this excitable,
mischievous proponent of ``the politics of joy'' still emerges as a
reasonable enough facsimile. Hoffman was a charming merry
prankster, an inspired political comic whose cheerfully anarchic
message was decidedly nonviolent and upbeat. His gift for
politically charged charades and hilarious verbal jousting reached
a dizzying summit during the notorious trial of the so-called
Chicago Seven. That trial, whose grim, punitive judge, Julius
Hoffman, made a perfect comic foil to the younger Hoffman's
potty-mouthed clown, is really worth a whole movie in itself, and
it's a shame that ``Steal This Movie!'' gives us only a sample.
</P>
<P>
   The source of Hoffman's downfall, the movie suggests, was his
own willful naivete. He just couldn't believe that his playfully
provocative political theater could make people so angry and
vindictive. Later diagnosed as manic-depressive, Hoffman had to go
underground in 1974 and lived on the run under various disguises
for the next seven years as ``Barry Freed.'' As Freed, he even
became an environmental activist of some note in upstate New York.
In 1980 he surrendered to the government and spent a short time in
prison. Nine years later, he died, a probable suicide. The
screenplay (by Bruce Graham) notes that he didn't like taking his
lithium medication because it robbed him of his inner spark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steal This Movie!'' uses the familiar and rather awkward
device of having the story unfold in flashbacks and voice-over
reminiscences, as an interviewer (Alan Van Sprang) prepares a major
article for an unidentified national magazine. When they meet, it
is 1977, and Hoffman is living a fugitive, hand-to-mouth existence,
taking low-paying temporary jobs in constantly changing locations.
</P>
<P>
   From those desperate days the story jumps back a decade to the
happier times. In some of the movie's warmest moments, he meets his
future wife, Anita (Janeane Garofalo), and sweeps her off her feet.
Garofalo gives a tender, finely shaded portrait of a woman of
remarkable flexibility, strength, humor and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Such antic public happenings as Hoffman's organizing a group to
surround and ``levitate'' the Pentagon, and his trip to the New
York Stock Exchange, where money was strewn and burned, are briefly
glossed. In its eagerness to touch on so many of the events from
this heady period, the movie gives them too short a shrift.
Although we meet Hoffman's fellow activists Tom Hayden (Troy
Garity) and Jerry Rubin (Kevin Corrigan), they remain peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   It's only after those heady days have ended that the movie comes
into sharp dramatic focus to tell the disheartening tale of a man
worn down by a governmental vendetta until he begins to question
(and to lose) his own sanity. Once the FBI, under J. Edgar Hoover
and goaded by Richard Nixon, decided Hoffman was an enemy of the
state, the bureau made his life miserable by spying on him, trying
to bust him for drug possession, and playing assorted dirty tricks.
It was all because he had the effrontery to embarrass the United
States government. The persecution could be read as the
paradigmatic revenge of a classically square father upon a
disrespectful, disobedient hippie son.
</P>
<P>
   Even in exile, Hoffman had emotional support. Although cut off
from Anita and his young son, America, he was tended by a new
woman, Johanna Lawrenson (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who stuck by him in
spite of his increasing instability. Another hero of the movie is
its associate producer Gerald Lefcourt (Kevin Pollak), Hoffman's
lawyer, who took no fees for his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steal This Movie!'' is saddled with a fake inspirational
ending in which Hoffman delivers a stiff, upbeat courtroom speech.
The Crosby, Stills and Nash anthem ``Carry On'' follows. Such phony
uplift only makes the sad story seem even sadder.

`THE CELL' KEEPS YOU RIGHT WHERE IT WANTS YOU

<TEXT>
<P>
   At its worst, music video/commercial director Tarsem Singh's
``The Cell'' is a gaudy exercise in style over substance with a
preconceived ``artiness'' that is likely to turn off fans of the
serial-killer subgenre.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, it's a horrifically gorgeous, masterful exploration
of the dark recesses of the human mind, a bold new direction for
the horror genre.
</P>
<P>
   Expect comparisons with Clive Barker and his directorial debut,
1987's ``Hellraiser,'' which was a stylish, terrifying new twist on
tried-and-true horror conventions. But in a genre slump dominated
by garden variety stalk-and-slash yarns (even this summer's
visually nifty ``Hollow Man'' turns into ``Friday the 13th)'' or
parodies thereof (the ``Scream'' films made fun of themselves
better than ``Scary Movie'' ever did), ``The Cell'' is a refreshing
new take on a familiar Hollywood premise.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as ``Silence of the Lambs'' on drugs. Same basic
story: Law enforcement authorities try to coerce a captured serial
killer into revealing the whereabouts of his last victim before
it's too late. Except what if, instead of Jodie Foster trying to
get into the mind of Hannibal Lector in a metaphorical sense, she
had done so in a literal sense?
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lopez is about to find out ``what if.'' Vicious killer
Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls into the hands of the FBI
just as he falls into an irreversible coma, unable to reveal the
location of his latest abductee, who is trapped in a hidden,
water-tight cell awaiting a torturous death by drowning.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) is willing to try anything
to get the information, including turning to the practitioners of a
ground-breaking new transcendental therapy that enables one to
literally tap into _ and become a participant in _ a person's
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   So child therapist Catherine Deane (Lopez) agrees to try to tap
into Stargher's nightmarish noggin. Trouble is, the arid, desolate
sand dunes of Deane's last patient's imagination are nothing
compared with the monstrously bizarre and terrifying imagery of
Stargher's demented mind. And if Catherine loses her ability to
distinguish reality from the killer's macabre mindscape, she runs
the risk of remaining trapped there.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Singh's past of directing music videos (including
REM's award-winning ``Losing My Religion''), it figures that ``The
Cell'' is visually stunning. The film is art-directed to the nth
degree (pay attention, Academy) _ borrowing from everything from
the haunted paintings of Hieronymus Bosch to the campy religious
imagery of Pierre &AMP; Gilles photography. The film also boasts
stunning costume creations by Eiko Ishioka (''Bram Stoker's
Dracula'') and an ominously pervasive score by Howard Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But Singh manages to avoid turning his players into parts of the
scenery, pulling solid albeit subdued performances from his leads
while actually providing thoughtful commentary on our culture's
view of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the chilling and often grisly fantasy elements are
sure to turn off some, so moviegoers with more timid tastes are
cautioned to enter this nightmare at their own risk.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Democrats looking for nothing less than an
epiphany to breathe new life into their struggling campaign for the
White House, all eyes turned Thursday night to the man who embodies
many of the party's misgivings but is the only one who can truly
rekindle its hopes _ its candidate, for better or worse, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to formally accept the party's nomination at the
closing night of the convention, the vice president knew that he
had to give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, he had to allay fears that he is too distant and
aloof, set out a compelling policy program without appearing to
fudge on the key issues, win the confidence of the Democratic
Party's liberal grass roots while at the same time reaching out to
centrist swing voters and, above all, bridge the charisma gap that
has left him deep in Bill Clinton's shadow for the past eight years
and stir his audience to true enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the very least, a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore would seem to have every advantage _ experience,
brains, and the benefit of the longest boom in postwar U.S. history
_ this week's Democratic National Convention has revealed a party
fraught with doubt about his suitability for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, George W. Bush, has been ahead in
opinion polls for months and appears to enjoy a more favorable
public perception even on issues where Gore should in theory excel,
such as foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since no Democrat seriously believes Bush, with his limited
experience of public office, can hold a candle to Gore's grasp of
the issues, they suspect the real deficiency is one of character.
</P>
<P>
   One poll this week showed that 47 percent of voters had decided
that whoever they picked for president it would not be Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are fears that Gore is taking the
Democrats so far to the right _ by choosing the conservative
Connecticut senator, Joseph Lieberman, as his running mate, for
example _ that he is alienating the very people he needs to
emphasize what should be clearly demonstrable differences between
his positions and Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the Democratic Party has been so shaky that even
this week's high points _ Clinton's bravura speech on Monday night
and an similarly compelling oration by Lieberman on Wednesday _
have been tempered by the same haunting questions: Will this be
enough? Will Gore be able to top these fine performances, or will
he fall short?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that has emerged is to go populist, to show Gore as
being far more in touch with the concerns of ordinary people than
the ordinary people might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the vice president down off his intellectual perch,
much of the focus has been on his ``human journey'' _ presenting
his career in dramatic, personal terms, and emphasizing his other
side as a family man with down-to-earth feelings and tastes like
any other American.
</P>
<P>
   As she presented his nomination to the floor, Gore's daughter
Karenna Gore Schiff reminisced about him making breakfast for the
family _ even if it was just toast and butter. Gore's roommate from
his Harvard days, the actor Tommy Lee Jones, recalled them shooting
pool and ``catching the odd cow'' together.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an effort to convert Gore's awkwardness into
strengths by making it the butt of self-deprecating jokes. When
looking for a director to shoot a video of the Gore family vacation
in North Carolina earlier this month, Gore made the inspired choice
of Spike Jonze, the man who made the wacky comedy ``Being John
Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the characters in that film find a portal leading into
the brain of the eponymous actor, so Jonze was asked to find a
portal into the enigmatic, elusive head of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, shown at the convention Thursday night, Gore
appears relaxed and understanding of the misgivings about him.
``The guy standing motionless on stage behind the president _ what
the hell makes him think he can be president?'' Gore laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He also admits his discomfort at the glad-handing side of
politics. ``I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up
my sleeves and making the system work than I am with the
campaigning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This theme, and the contrast it establishes with the easygoing,
good ol' boyish Bush, is clearly one that will continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was echoed on Wednesday by the governor of California, Gray
Davis (no king of charisma himself), who told delegates: ``The
American people are not looking for a rock star to be president,''
he argued, ``they want a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the substance is there, however, a lot of Democrats are
anxious to know exactly what it consists of. &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Away from the convention floor, this week has seen the biggest
orgy of corporate-sponsored fund-raising parties in Democratic
Party history, leading many delegates to wonder whether they aren't
straying too far from the party's roots and whether Gore wouldn't
be beholden to the special interests offering to bankroll his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are policy concerns on everything from education and
Social Security to affirmative action and defense.
African-Americans, for example, need to be convinced the ticket

gave to Clinton might simply melt away.

<P>
   Other liberals, meanwhile, are being wooed by the consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, who is running on the Green Party ticket and
enjoying around 8 percent support.

<P>

alone. He gave perhaps the truest indication of his character by

</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Democrats looking for nothing less than an
epiphany to breathe new life into their struggling campaign for the
White House, all eyes turned Thursday night to the man who embodies
many of the party's misgivings but is the only one who can truly
rekindle its hopes _ its candidate, for better or worse, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to formally accept the party's nomination at the
closing night of the convention, the vice president knew that he
had to give the speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In one swoop, he had to allay fears that he is too distant and
aloof, set out a compelling policy program without appearing to
fudge on the key issues, win the confidence of the Democratic
Party's liberal grass roots while at the same time reaching out to
centrist swing voters and, above all, bridge the charisma gap that
has left him deep in Bill Clinton's shadow for the past eight years
and stir his audience to true enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the very least, a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore would seem to have every advantage _ experience,
brains, and the benefit of the longest boom in postwar U.S. history
_ this week's Democratic National Convention has revealed a party
fraught with doubt about his suitability for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, George W. Bush, has been ahead in
opinion polls for months and appears to enjoy a more favorable
public perception even on issues where Gore should in theory excel,
such as foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since no Democrat seriously believes Bush, with his limited
experience of public office, can hold a candle to Gore's grasp of
the issues, they suspect the real deficiency is one of character.
</P>
<P>
   One poll this week showed that 47 percent of voters had decided
that whoever they picked for president it would not be Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are fears that Gore is taking the
Democrats so far to the right _ by choosing the conservative
Connecticut senator, Joseph Lieberman, as his running mate, for
example _ that he is alienating the very people he needs to
emphasize what should be clearly demonstrable differences between
his positions and Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the Democratic Party has been so shaky that even
this week's high points _ Clinton's bravura speech on Monday night
and an similarly compelling oration by Lieberman on Wednesday _
have been tempered by the same haunting questions: Will this be
enough? Will Gore be able to top these fine performances, or will
he fall short?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that has emerged is to go populist, to show Gore as
being far more in touch with the concerns of ordinary people than
the ordinary people might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the vice president down off his intellectual perch,
much of the focus has been on his ``human journey'' _ presenting
his career in dramatic, personal terms, and emphasizing his other

`THE CELL': PROWLING THE CORRIDORS OF A VERY TWISTED PSYCHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You're already exhausted,'' someone says to Catherine Deane
(Jennifer Lopez), a child psychologist, early in the new suspense
thriller ``The Cell.'' Catherine is slaving to break through to a
little boy who is comatose from advanced schizophrenia, using an
experimental technique that allows her to enter his subconscious.
In this picture, it's called the ``neurological synaptic transfer
system'' by Catherine's colleague Henry West (Dylan Baker). But
Alec Guinness would have called it ``mumbo jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' was made by Tarsem Singh, a director whose talents
haven't quite jelled into storytelling yet. He folds this tale over
and over on itself, working with a script by Mark Protosevich that
blends elements of ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' ``Manhunter,''
``The Matrix,'' ``Seven,'' ``Dreamscape'' and ``Spellbound'' with
the stop-motion animation of the brothers Quay (``Street of
Crocodiles''), the moody photography of Matt Mahurin, the paintings
of Francis Bacon and possibly of the abstract graphics artist Bill
Sienkiewicz, and so many other things that there's no there there.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine has an extraordinary empathy with her patients, and
Lopez uses her little-girl voice _ it has an inviting tremolo _ in
a new way here. Instead of speaking in her usual tough inflections,
she offers a soft, intimate whisper; you can hear the hurt in each
syllable, but there is also an undercurrent of determination.
</P>
<P>
   The picture wouldn't work without her, but it doesn't quite work
with her. She gives a provocative and nuanced performance, a
contrast to the film's florid visual schemes, in which she goes
from looking like a princess bride in a white-feather wedding dress
(she's so chic that even in someone's subconscious she's wearing
this season's colors) to embodying the coy, strumpet-next-door
calculation of Madonna during her midlife electronica stage. And
her presence offers a tickling spin on the central idea of ``The
Cell''; what boy doesn't want Jennifer Lopez in his dreams?
</P>
<P>
   The film introduces a ticking bomb to its angst-ridden story
when Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a serial killer, has a
seizure and goes into a coma similar to the boy's. Stargher abducts
women and imprisons them in a Plexiglas cell that slowly fills with
water; he then fixes up their drowned corpses to look like dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn), an FBI agent who has gone without
sleep tracking Stargher and looks as haggard as anyone can in a Jil
Sander suit, talks Catherine into entering the killer's mind;
Stargher's latest kidnapping victim (Tara Subkoff) is trapped in
his cell, and she has to be found before the automated torture
takes her life.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine slips into her dream-penetrating ensemble, a red vinyl
suit that looks as if it's made from strawberry Twizzlers (Stargher
wears the same thing) and invades his subconscious. When things
take a bad turn, Novak persuades Catherine's team to let him join
her.
</P>
<P>
   There is powerful and unforgettable imagery in ``The Cell,'' but
it's nihilism under glass, reminiscent of the honeyed yet grim
tableaus of a Nine Inch Nails music video. Singh also perfected
this look, in videos like R.E.M.'s ``Losing My Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The director is a dextrous visual stylist, moving effortlessly
from smooth, gleaming surfaces photographed in slow motion to
grainy, slightly sped-up frames in the very same shot. You could
say that ``The Cell'' has been production-designed within an inch
of its life: Tom Foden sets a new standard in his field. Few
pictures have been visually coordinated on such a scale, and many
of the details will be lost on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, just when ``The Cell,'' which is so cool to the
touch that it could be kept in your grocer's freezer, seems about
to shut you out totally, an actor shows up to capture your
attention. James Gammon, as an FBI supervisor, sports a Panama hat
that suggests that he thinks of himself as a style maven. He
commands the screen with his gravelly warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent D'Onofrio dominates in his own way. In a cue taken from
Thomas Harris, Stargher has been conceived as a monster and as an
object of pity; we see his memories of the abuse he endured as a
child. D'Onofrio plays him as more than a monster; he's scared and
tired, desperate to leave his burden behind. Vaughn has his
moments, too, and doesn't rely on his baby-face charm to get him
through.
</P>
<P>
   The material can't help building a sense of dread, and
special-effects technology has never been better at the manufacture
of maiming. Stargher walks around with rings hanging from his back;
he likes to hover above his victims, suspended by chains.
</P>
<P>
   But at no point do you feel frightened, despite rivers of blood,
entrails stretched out of a living person and a vivisection of a
horse by huge panes of glass while its exposed organs still
function. Each frame has been composed like a still. And when the
actors move across the screen, they often look like toys in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about bad taste in comedy, but few seem to
note the institutionalization of cruelty in dramas. When Bunuel
pulled a razor blade across an eyeball in ``Un Chien Andalou,'' he
was using surrealism to make a point about the most primal sort of
invasion. Today such a feat would be staged merely for kicks, to
titillate an audience.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie pops in and out of distinct scenarios, ``The Cell''
feels like a new video game: ``Quake'' as designed by David
Fincher, the director of ``Seven'' and ``Fight Club.'' Fincher's
work comes from a specific sensibility, an artist's temperament
working out assaultive rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Singh may have an artist's temperament, and he shows signs of
being a director. The scariest scene in ``The Cell'' is the
simplest: Stargher sits in his bathtub, playing with the water,
spitting out mouthfuls and quietly singing ``Mairzy Doats'' to
himself. You sit up as you realize you're watching a man capable of
anything _ and Singh gets what he wants without resorting to the
flamboyance of the director's cut of Nine-Inch Nails' ``Closer.''

IDA: ``WILL YOU FIND ME''

<TEXT>
<P>
   IDA: ``Will You Find Me'' (Tiger Style).
</P>
<P>
   Voices harmonize closely, somewhere between intimacy and
claustrophobia, in the quiet, unhurried songs on ``Will You Find
Me,'' the fifth album by Ida. Instruments are discreet, unwilling
to break a silence unnecessarily; if a lone guitar or piano is all
that's needed, Ida uses nothing else. Ida is a four-piece band
intent on sounding smaller and more private, the better to
contemplate questions like ``Am I still the one you wanted me to
be?'' That song, ``Maybelle,'' unfolds over nearly seven minutes of
billowing counterpoint, a minimalist bossa nova that never resolves
itself. Even when Ida, which plays the Knitting Factory in New York
on Aug. 27, allows itself to use a rock beat or guitar feedback,
its songs seem hushed. They're like the whispers of uncertain
lovers in a perpetual dance of vulnerability and assurance, parting
and reconciliation.

and an similarly compelling oration by Lieberman on Wednesday _
have been tempered by the same haunting questions: Will this be
enough? Will Gore be able to top these fine performances, or will
he fall short?
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that has emerged is to go populist, to show Gore as
being far more in touch with the concerns of ordinary people than
the ordinary people might suspect.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the vice president down off his intellectual perch,
much of the focus has been on his ``human journey'' _ presenting
his career in dramatic, personal terms, and emphasizing his other
side as a family man with down-to-earth feelings and tastes like
any other American.
</P>
<P>
   As she presented his nomination to the floor, Gore's daughter
Karenna Gore Schiff reminisced about him making breakfast for the
family _ even if it was just toast and butter. Gore's roommate from
his Harvard days, the actor Tommy Lee Jones, recalled them shooting
pool and ``catching the odd cow'' together.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been an effort to convert Gore's awkwardness into
strengths by making it the butt of self-deprecating jokes. When
looking for a director to shoot a video of the Gore family vacation
in North Carolina earlier this month, Gore made the inspired choice
of Spike Jonze, the man who made the wacky comedy ``Being John
Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the characters in that film find a portal leading into
the brain of the eponymous actor, so Jonze was asked to find a
portal into the enigmatic, elusive head of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, shown at the convention Thursday night, Gore
appears relaxed and understanding of the misgivings about him.
``The guy standing motionless on stage behind the president _ what
the hell makes him think he can be president?'' Gore laughs.
</P>
<P>
   He also admits his discomfort at the glad-handing side of
politics. ``I'm a lot more comfortable with the idea of rolling up
my sleeves and making the system work than I am with the
campaigning,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This theme, and the contrast it establishes with the easygoing,
good ol' boyish Bush, is clearly one that will continue.
</P>
<P>
   It was echoed on Wednesday by the governor of California, Gray
Davis (no king of charisma himself), who told delegates: ``The
American people are not looking for a rock star to be president,''
he argued, ``they want a serious man of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   If the substance is there, however, a lot of Democrats are
anxious to know exactly what it consists of. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Away from the convention floor, this week has seen the biggest
orgy of corporate-sponsored fund-raising parties in Democratic
Party history, leading many delegates to wonder whether they aren't
straying too far from the party's roots and whether Gore wouldn't
be beholden to the special interests offering to bankroll his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There are policy concerns on everything from education and
Social Security to affirmative action and defense.
African-Americans, for example, need to be convinced the ticket
represents their interests, or else the support they consistently
gave to Clinton might simply melt away.
</P>
<P>
   Other liberals, meanwhile, are being wooed by the consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, who is running on the Green Party ticket and
enjoying around 8 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman went some way to address these issues in his speech,
itself a model of easygoing populism. But it is Gore's name that
appears at the top of the ticket, and Gore alone who can overcome
the misgivings of party and country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   For all his policy wonkishness and experience of focus groups
and committee work, he is essentially a man who makes decisions
alone. He gave perhaps the truest indication of his character by
withdrawing from view earlier this month and writing his speech by
himself, with little input from even his closest colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   His appearances across Middle America earlier this week, and
again briefly on the convention floor on Wednesday, suggest he is
energized and ready to meet the challenge. Whether he succeeds or
fails, he knows it is all down to him. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ ``Why has the president been silent?'' demanded the
daily Komsomolskaya Pravda in two-inch high red letters on its
front page Thursday. The newspaper asks why vacationing Vladimir
Putin took five days to make his first brief comment on the sinking
of the Kursk nuclear submarine to the bottom of the Barents Sea,
while finding time to appoint new ambassadors to Jamaica and Chile.
Just before the presidential election in March Putin dressed up in
a military pilot's uniform to fly in a fighter-bomber. He even,
ironically, spent a night underwater in a nuclear submarine. It is

   From Singers To Swingers
</P>
<P>
   This week's DVD releases include ``Nashville,'' with a
commentary by Robert Altman, and ``Planet of the Apes: The
Evolution,'' Fox's umbrella title for the Charlton Heston epic and
its four sequels (``Beneath the ... '' ``Escape From ...''
``Conquest of ...' and ``Battle for ...'') on five discs, along
with a sixth disc with the documentary ``Behind the Planet of the
Apes,'' about the making of the series. And on Tuesday will come
``The Tigger Movie,'' with assorted games and songs about the Pooh
clan augmenting a sweet little film from Disney with muscle enough
to take in more than $40 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   But the DVD of the month will arrive a week later: James
Cameron's ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (1991), to be released by
Artisan on Aug. 29. In the minds of many disc aficionados, ``T2,''
as it is known, is the ultimate. ``The general consensus was that
it was the greatest laser disk ever produced,'' said Douglas Pratt,
editor of the DVD Newsletter and author of The DVD Video Guide.
When DVD was new, ``T2,'' a sequel starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
as a machine man dispatched from the future to rescue a little boy
destined to save mankind, was issued at its original theater
length. Now, scenes have been added and many of the supplements
that were on the laser disc have been transferred to accompany new
ones on a special DVD edition.
</P>
<P>
   The list of extra features totals 40. ``For all the people who
haven't seen the laser disc, which is 99 percent of the population,
the DVD will be a revelation,'' said Van Ling, a DVD producer who
put together the supplements for laser in 1993 and helped create
the new DVD. That has to do primarily with the quality of picture
and sound. ``It is considered one of the standard demonstration
films for home theater,'' he said. And the effects, with machine
men rising from melting silvery puddles, play at their best on
large television screens.
</P>
<P>
   But in other respects this is a movie with a good reputation.
``From the standpoint of a film and disc buff, it's a virtual
catalog of cinematic technique,'' he said. Or as Janet Maslin put
it in The New York Times, ``Surprise. Cameron has made a swift,
exciting special-effects epic'' with ``better developed characters
(after all, the first Terminator was barely verbal), a livelier wit
and a more ambitious, if nuttier, message.''
</P>
<P>
   For the DVD, Ling said, he tried to present a film school class,
with much material on production and editing and other aspects of
big-budget moviemaking, from writing and editing to location
scouting and promotion. The new disc employs an interesting
approach to the director's commentary, also borrowed from the laser
disc. Instead of a film-length discourse by Cameron and
Schwarzenegger, which neither would do in the first place, the
commentary pieces together parts of interviews with 26 people who
made the movie. ``Sometimes,'' Ling said, ``directors get so
engrossed watching the movie they stop talking.''
</P>

<P>
   Mifune
</P>
<P>
   Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's film violates at least one of the
principles of Dogma 95, the Danish school of stripped-down
filmmaking, by divulging the directorial credit. Otherwise, it's a
pretty good little movie about a Copenhagen businessman (Anders W.
Berthelsen) with a BMW and a trophy wife who returns to the rotting
farmhouse where he grew up to find his father stretched out dead on
top of the kitchen table and his mentally retarded brother (Jasper
Asholt) hiding underneath it. A prostitute on the run (Iben Hjejle)
and her brother (Emil Tarding), a raffish boarding-school student,
fill out an eccentric menage while, A.O. Scott wrote in The New
York Times, the ``brusque realism of Kragh-Jacobsen's style _ his
careful suppression of style _ allows a surprising sweetness to
emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37. 99 minutes. Danish with
English subtitles. R. Release date: Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Brown
</P>
<P>
   The indefatigable, plucky, good-humored mother of seven adoring
children in 1967 Dublin, Agnes (Anjelica Huston) rarely loses her
temper despite being poor and newly widowed with mouths to feed.
That dazzles the French baker (Arno Chevrier) in her neighborhood,
though she prefers the strapping Welsh belter Tom Jones (who puts
in an appearance as an inflated 1999 version of his 1967 self). And
how does Agnes remain such an ideal gal? ``Only heaven and the
creators of upbeat radio serials and popular novels and the people
who turn them into treacly feel-good movies could tell you''
(Stephen Holden).

   _ 1999. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 91 minutes. R. Release date:
Aug 22.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Rage
</P>
<P>
   A limping homage to Robert Altman, James D. Stern's film
intertwines the fates of nine characters (Gary Sinise, Anna Paquin,
Giovanni Ribisi, David Schwimmer, Andre Braugher, Robert Forster,
Joan Allen, Josh Brolin, Bokeem Woodbine), each of them either a
perpetrator or a victim of gun violence and sometimes both. But
satire turns into ``a ham-fisted, high-concept public service
announcement, directed with stagy deliberateness and tin-ear
vernacular speechiness'' (Scott).

Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Here on Earth
</P>
<P>
   You know the drill. Suffering young lovers are kept apart by
class and tragedy. Sam (Leelee Sobieski), the winsome farm girl,
falls for Kelley (Chris Klein), a spoiled young god from the
wealthier side of the tracks. Only she is dying of cancer. And
underneath Kelley's blank look is actually a poor little rich boy
waiting to get out. With its shameless sob story on teen loss,
Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, here is ``the Best
Movie of 1961, lacking only the beautiful and vacant visages of
Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette.''

   MY BEST FIEND. ``Every gray hair on my head I call Kinski,''
says Werner Herzog in his documentary about his stormy relationship
with the actor Klaus Kinski. The two made films together, including
``Aguirre: Wrath of God,'' ``Woyzeck'' and ``Fitzcarraldo,'' in the
Amazon jungle. ``Quite often it was very difficult to talk to him
because he answered back like Jesus,'' Herzog recalls. ``A splendid
job of chronicling the high drama and creative pinnacles of their
work together,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. 1999.
Anchor Bay. $14.98; DVD, $29.98. 100 minutes. No rating.

<P>
   CAUSE CELEBRE. John Gorrie's television film, adapted from
Terence Rattigan's play and broadcast on PBS' ``Mystery,'' recounts
the case of Alma Rattenbury (Helen Mirren), a 38-year-old former
singer who, with her 18-year-old lover, is charged with the murder
of her 61-year-old husband (Harry Andrews). Hardly proper and the
boy isn't even of the right social class, her lawyer (David Suchet)
tells Alma. Mirren, John J. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times,
gives ``a wonderfully complex depiction of a confused woman caught
in a situation that suddenly reveals her to herself.'' 1988. Lance
Entertainment. $19.95. 105 minutes.

   The quotable Richard Karn on matters of home improvement:
</P>
<P>
   On tiles: ``Don't ever put fake tile next to real tile. Don't
ever make that comparison because there's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   On finding a contractor: ``If you have friends who did something
reasonably on time and for what the bid was, start there. When you
get something bid out, you're going to see somebody who bids it at
$1,000 and you're going to see somebody who bids it at $10,000, and
the guy who bids $1,000 is not necessarily the guy to go with
because he's not going to tell you about all the little things that
are going to pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   On what you're up against: ``The person who owned the house
before you or the person who owned it before the person you bought
it from _ nobody plays by the rules. Nobody built it right. So you
end up having to do it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   On the marriage/remodeling partnership: ``You could be married
one year to 15 years and all of a sudden you're remodeling, and you
go, `Yeah, well I think we should do this.' 'Really? I thought you
would say we should do this.' 'No, I don't like that.' 'Well I do.'
All of a sudden, everybody has a very different sense of style deep
inside that doesn't really get pulled out until you're feathering
your nest.''

THE ACCIDENTAL HANDYMAN
</HEADLINE>
  Richard Karn no professional, but he played one on TV 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With sidebar, `Tools of the Trade') 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Karn is sitting in a Studio City coffee shop talking
about the house he recently bought in Big Bear _ and the summer
legacy he hopes the house will start for his 7-year-old son,
Cooper. And he's telling me the place is a 3/4-acre lot with a big
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The place is ``perfectly fine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And I do not, for one second, believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is not an easy person to doubt. Karn is, after
all, the man who spent eight years playing steady Al Borland on
``Home Improvement,'' the nice guy handyman's handyman, the guy who
would pull back and urge caution whenever Tim ``The Tool Man''
Taylor (a k a series star Tim Allen) would concoct some
hair-brained scheme to rip out another wall or amp up an already
lethal electric chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Karn is the guy whose friendly, bearded face has launched a
thousand real-life endorsements, from wares at Orchard Supply
Hardware to beard trimmers, rechargeable battery recycling and the
Internet Tool Box. The man once scored the second highest Q rating
_ which measures a performer's recognizability and likability
quotient _ of any actor on primetime TV (Allen was No. 1). My God,
if you can't trust Richard ``Al Borland'' Karn, whom can you trust?
</P>
<P>
   ``That character is him, in many ways,'' says Ralph Millard,
executive vice president of the Rechargeable Battery Recycling
Corporation, for which Karn is a spokesperson. ``He comes across as
very genuine in his speech and his actions, and he's got a certain
believability of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when Richard Karn tells you his newly purchased house
is ``pretty much fine,'' you sense the man is itching _ if not to
pull out his own tool box _ then certainly to find the home's blue
prints, make a few well-placed calls and get busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My inner idea of a summer cabin is more like a log cabin,''
says Karn, 44. ``So now, I'm thinking like I did in my book when my
dad said, `Why replace the windows? They're perfectly fine.' I'm
figuring, `Why replace the house? It's perfectly fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an Al Borland way of thinking. Richard Karn, on the
other hand, might have a different approach when it comes to
improving a homestead.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``House Broken: How I Remodeled My Home for Just
Under Three Times the Original Bid'' (Harper Collins; $23), trusty,
affable Richard Karn puts a seriocomic ``Money Pit''-like spin on
the full-scale overhaul he and his wife did to their Studio City
home in 1996. It's as close as one will get to a blurring of the
lines between Karn and his ``Al-ter'' ego: the actor who plays a
handyman remodeling his house _ with the help of professionals _
and then writing a book about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle native, Karn's an actor first, last and always. He
worked in professional theater before a couple of breaks landed him
the ``Home Improvement'' gig. But his tool-savvy signature role
isn't entirely fabricated. If Karn comes across as being more than
a little bit handy, you might say there's spackle in his DNA.
Karn's father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all
carpenters. He never gave family trade serious consideration.
(``That was something my dad did. I didn't seem to excel at it,''
he says.) And while tool proficiency wasn't a prerequisite for
landing the role of Al Borland, Karn admits that ``I know how to
play these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers apparently thought so as well. Focus group studies
would always reveal Al Borland as being the kind of guy you could
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be getting these calls from all sorts of people. I
think there was a sense that Al knew what he was doing, and that he
was good at it,'' Karn says. ``The home improvement industry is
huge. If you've ever been to the hardware show in Chicago, it's
like there are so many millions of dollars going into that
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   When tackling his own house, Karn was anything but hands-off. He
didn't exactly hammer in nails or pour cement, but he and his wife,
Tudi Roche, knew exactly what they wanted. When the project grew
from simply redoing two rooms to performing nearly $300,000 worth
of remodeling, it was Karn _ still playing cautious Al as a day job
_ who OK'd the change orders and wrote the checks. Each experience,
he later discovered, became a chapter in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come back with stories,'' Karn says. ``Tim was going
through the same thing. (``Home Improvement'' co-star Patricia
Richardson) was going through the same thing as well. They were all
building their own homes or remodeling, especially after the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Tim is who he is, his stories are a lot funnier. Maybe
it's just the way he tells it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that could be Karn or Al Borland talking. Both are
unfailingly modest.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the author isn't giving himself enough credit.
``House Broken,'' co-written with George Mair, is both funny and
wise. In addition to the anecdotes _ a few of which make Karn look
a little bit foolish _ there's good advice to homeowners both on
home buying and remodeling: what the language means, the mistakes
you'll make and the ones you might avoid. The book is also laced
with anecdotes about historic building goofs (plumbing problems in
the Pentagon, why that tower in Pisa leans).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Karn's beautiful house came with a price. In the
course of their odyssey, the Karns did everything from stripping
their roof and replacing gas lines to rebuilding a wine rack and
replacing kitchen cabinet knob handles. After a year and a half of
work and 101 change orders, they ended up with a home that, one
suspects is better than ``perfectly fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all began with windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first domino, just going `dink,''' Karn says. ``You've
got 78 styles of windows, and you're going, `Well, I should just
change those out.' So once that fatal decision is made, while the
windows are out the contractor says, `Well, you're going to see the
patchwork.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So the stucco comes off and instead of putting the fake tile,
we can shoal up the walls, make it stronger, and use real tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it just kept going. One thing leads to the next.
There would be a dark wall. Now all of a sudden the curtains don't
match the throw rug.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Karn is slightly shorter than he appears on TV. His
beard, which he shaved for an upcoming episode of the American
Movie Classics' ``The Lot,'' is back and, no, he's not wearing the
Al Borland signature flannel shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Lot,'' the shorn Karn takes on a Fargo-esque accent to
play a representative from the Legion of Decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really interesting thing hiring him,'' says show
executive producer Rick Mitz. ``I only know him one way _ he's the
straight man on 'Home Improvement' and the guy who sells tools on
commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   But that changed, Mitz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him _ and I'm sure it drives him crazy _ `Hey,
you're really funny,''' Mitz says. ``I think he gets pigeon-holed
into the best friend roles. But he really is funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since ``Home Improvement'' called it quits
and four years since he completed his real-life ``misadventures in
home improvement.'' In addition to appearing in a TV movie ``The
Pooch &AMP; the Pauper,'' Karn has traveled, worked on his golf game
and appeared at a couple of charity events. A spokesman for the
Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, Karn helped
rehabilitate a house for Habitat for Humanity last April in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after ``Home Improvement'' ended, Karn had the
opportunity to appear in a Broadway play, but the process of
uprooting his family for a temporary move back east wasn't in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Television seems to present a more friendly work schedule to a
man who claims to be fully in the family mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't have this overall plan of how to move my
career. It just kind of happens.'' Karn says. ``On stage, it's
going to take you every night of the week. And you know, we're just
starting (reading) `Harry Potter.' That's my evening theater right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the Karn family handyman legacy seem to be in any
danger of dying out. After a visit to the Wild Wild West stunt show
at Universal Studios, young Cooper Karn has decided that, like his
father, he too wants to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's putting on a stunt show in the back yard, and he's cast
all the kids in his class,'' Karn says. ``So we're needing to build
breakaway walls and all sorts of things that he's outlined and
blue-printed.'' &QL;

SPIKE LEE CAPTURES COMIC GENIUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Kings of Comedy'' can pack a stadium anywhere in America,
no problem. But try to get a movie made in Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   Few people in mainstream entertainment have ever heard of the
tour, let alone caught one of the dozens of sold-out shows, though
they are probably familiar with some of its African-American
headliners _ Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer and
Bernie Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the ``Kings of Comedy'' raked in more money from
its tours last year than even the Backstreet Boys, or that it has
grossed $37 million since its inception two years ago. Being the
top grossing comedy tour in history had not meant diddley squat in
Hollywood until director Spike Lee came along.
</P>
<P>
   And that just amazes him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ever heard of a tour where you're selling out 20,000 seats
(a show) in two years?'' Lee says. ``We're not talking about Janet
Jackson. We're talking about four comedians onstage with nothing
more than a microphone, who have the audience captivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee documents this underground phenomenon that's been sweeping
urban America in his latest movie, which opens today, ``The
Original Kings of Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The film taps into the pulse of what is really a throwback to a
comic tradition started in the black community at the turn of the
20th century and includes such legendary comics as Jackie ``Moms''
Mabley right next to today's stars like Chris Tucker and the Kings
of Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   But the four comedians wanted to expand their audience and pick
up where such ground-breaking films as Richard Pryor's ``Live on
the Sunset Strip,'' Eddie Murphy's ``Raw'' and Martin Lawrence's
``You So Crazy'' left off.
</P>
<P>
   If only somebody in Hollywood would get a clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is, they didn't know who the guys were,''
says Walter Latham, the mastermind behind the ``Kings of Comedy''
tour. ``And that was our selling point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's these guys you say you don't know, but when they go to
Washington D.C., they sell 55,000 tickets,'' Latham says. ``Chicago
_ they sell 48,000 tickets. Every year they sell more tickets. So
someone knows who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't the Kings of Comedy caught on with mainstream
America yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we've got urban fans and have had them for a long
time without any media coverage. Well, the movie will expose (the
concert) to the general public, the masses of America,'' says
Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   And producer David M. Gale thinks the appeal of the ``Kings''
will be across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that line, `Funny is funny,''' says Gale. ``Whether
you're black or white or you're young or you're older, it has that
effect. There were a couple of jokes I didn't get the first time
around, but what's really cool about this movie is you start to
understand the culture that maybe you didn't appreciate before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee says he knew who the comedians were, even though he'd only
before worked with Mac, who was part of the ensemble cast for the
Spike Lee movie ``Get on the Bus.''
</P>
<P>
   The other comedians on the tour are mostly familiar to audiences
through television. Harvey stars in the WB's ``The Steve Harvey
Show'' and hosts the cable series ``Showtime at the Apollo.''
Hughley stars in the sitcom ``The Hughleys,'' formerly on ABC and
moving to UPN in the fall. Cedric the Entertainer co-stars with
Harvey on the ``Steve Harvey Show,'' and he also appeared in Martin
Lawrence's summer hit comedy, ``Big Momma's House.''
</P>
<P>
   The four did this while touring as the ``Kings of Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee admits that before shooting the film he had never seen the
``Kings of Comedy'' show live because of his work schedule.
Although he had just finished shooting ``Bamboozled,'' a comedy
which stars Damon Wayans, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Tommy Davidson and
Savion Glover, he says he jumped at the chance after seeing a tape
of the concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw this great sense of community,'' Lee says about the
phenomenon of the tour. ``People (were) coming from all around the
country and putting on their Sunday best _ you know, it's a big
night to just have a good time and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, laughter is therapuetic.''
</P>
<P>
   While making the film, Lee says he got a big dose of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dyin' (of laughter),'' Lee says. ``And you surely
shouldn't do that because then you're neglecting what you're there
for. But I'll be honest, sometimes I was negligent in my job, I was
laughing so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Original Kings of Comedy'' is not Lee's first comedy
concert.
</P>
<P>
   He directed John Leguizamo in an HBO special that he says helped
prepare him for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Lee blanketed the Coliseum in Charlotte, N.C. _ where the film
was shot _ with cameras and a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   He says he filmed everything he could, from members of the
audience laughing so hard that they're standing up and clapping, to
the comedians doing their shtick on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted people to see this and think they're actually in the
Charlotte Coliseum among this great mass of humanity laughing,''
Lee says.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also tried to show the comics when they weren't on, getting
footage of the guys just killing time playing cards or throwing
around a basketball, some of which was staged for the film's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cats are great athletes,'' says Hughley says about his
fellow comedians. ``I never was. I was so deep on the bench they
put me on a futon.''
</P>
<P>
   The cameras also tried to capture the relationship between the
comedians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the thing we do most that didn't get captured on film
is trade cigars,'' says Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we don't trade cigars,'' Hughley chimes in. ``Steve takes
my damn cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac says that despite what it might look like on film, the truth
is they really don't spend all that much time together off stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't got no business, a 42-year-old man, horning in on
everything they do, every place they go,'' he says. ``I don't like
that. Too much of everything leaves something to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody respects everybody's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mac says that's probably why the tour has been so successful for
them: They're all equals. And that's probably why they got a movie
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things come to those who wait,'' he says. ``And we've
been waiting a long time.'' &QL;

RELEASE OF WESTERN HOSTAGES DELAYED AS DEAL-MAKING CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ The entrepreneurs of the Sulu Sea are on
to their biggest deal yet, and like deal-making anywhere, the
last-minute bargaining appears to be intense.
</P>
<P>
   The business is kidnapping, and the deal involves nine Western
vacationers and four local workers who were seized by Muslim rebels
from an island diving resort nearly four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Westerners were to have been released Thursday in exchange
for a payment that could reach several million dollars, but
something has caused a delay. Officially, the reason is weather,
but local officials say the real snag seems to involve money.
</P>
<P>
   The release has been brokered by Libya, which has sent a plane
to fly the captives to Tripoli before they are sent home. Local
reports say the Libyans are prepared to give the hostage takers
millions of dollars in what is being described as development aid.
</P>
<P>
   But prospects for smooth negotiations cannot have been helped by
the comments on Thursday of Ricardo Puno, a spokesman for President
Joseph Estrada, who said: ``Once this matter is resolved, and it
will be resolved sooner or later, the government is going to take
certain actions against them. They're not going to have an easy
life after this.''
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting release are two Germans, two South Africans, two Finns,
two French citizens and a French-Lebanese woman as well as three
Malaysians and a Filipino from the diving resort. Three French
television journalists who trekked in to interview the hostages are
also being held, as well as a dozen evangelical Christians who said
they wanted to pray with them and may have remained voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny island of Jolo, in a remote area that for centuries has
been home to pirates and roaming bands of brigands, is already
awash in cash from a dozen earlier releases.
</P>
<P>
   The thatched villages and jungle-covered mountains have come
alive with gem dealers and gun runners. The 1,000-peso note _ worth
$22 and rarely seen outside the country's major cities _ has become
common currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine military says as much as $5.5 million in ransom
has already been paid to the kidnappers, a Muslim rebel group
numbering only a few hundred.
</P>
<P>
   From among the original hostages a German woman, six Malaysian
resort workers and several other captives have been released after
separate deals were struck.
</P>
<P>
   With those payments, the group, calling itself Abu Sayyaf and
claiming to be fighting for a separate Muslim state, has entered
the big time in the area's kidnapping industry. The usual going
rate, local officials say, is $5,000 per hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine government policy bars the payment of ransoms, so the
payments for hostages are generally described as ``room and
board.'' But little of the money paid so far seems to have been
spent on accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   According to reporters who have visited them, they have been fed
a skimpy diet of rice and sardines and have slept on the ground,
hustled by their captors through the jungle whenever military
patrols approached. Through their visitors they have sent periodic
messages of anger and despair, sometimes threatening suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Since the original 21 people were seized on April 23 from the
Malaysian diving resort of Sipadan _ a short speedboat ride from
the islands of the southern Philippines _ a dozen news reporters
have been captured and released.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When 10 European journalists were seized in June, their editors
paid $25,000 for their freedom in what they described as a ``gift''
in return for their interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Others who managed to get out after interviewing the hostages
were stripped of their watches, tape recorders, cameras and
sometimes shoes. According to other journalists, a number of
reporters paid cash for their safe passage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some officials here say that one reason for the current
delay involves negotiations for the freedom of the three French
television journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments Thursday, Puno said, ``The government is
concerned about this kind of thing becoming a continuing
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be little it could do to halt the
long-established kidnapping industry, in which gunmen disappear
into the local population once they have received payment.
</P>
<P>
   Jolo island is now a battleground filled with thousands of
frustrated Philippine soldiers who have been able to take little
action as long as the hostages are held.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that in the last couple of years they have
stepped up their kidnapping activities basically as a fund-raising
exercise,'' Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence groups are working double time to try to
determine what gunrunning syndicates are being contacted, where are
the possible sources going to be, and we're also trying to get
assistance from other countries,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with millions to spend, Abu Sayyaf could become a real
military force.

A CENTURY AFTER THE STORM, GALVESTON CELEBRATES SPIRIT OF SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by GALVESTON-IF YOU GO)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems, perhaps, an odd event for a tourist destination to be
commemorating _ the 100th anniversary of the greatest natural
disaster in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But with their weekend-long observance next month, the folks in
Galveston are not celebrating the great hurricane of 1900, which on
Sept. 8, 1900, virtually decimated the island, killing more than
6,000 people and destroying more than 3,000 buildings. They're
really honoring the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That storm was the defining moment in Galveston's history. It
wasn't just an ordinary storm; it has everything to do with the
spirit of the community and its survival,'' says Maureen Patton, a
Galveston native who now is director of the Grand 1894 Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Galveston could have packed up their tents and
left, but they didn't. The way they rebuilt this city really stands
as a great human accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The coastal city has been observing the storm's anniversary all
year with a series of lectures, exhibits and tours, culminating in
a full weekend of activities Sept. 8-10. There will be a
communitywide tribute, featuring CBS anchor Dan Rather; a
dedication ceremony for a public sculpture by a fourth-generation
Galveston artist; a series of open houses and parties; and arts
events including a modern dance performance and a play, both
centered on the storm and commissioned for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   And although the events will recognize the great losses suffered
by Galveston _ the weekend schedule includes the placement of a
wreath at the site of St. Mary's Orphanage, where 90 children and
at least 10 nuns perished _ the theme of the weekend is survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to share with people who are visiting, look at what
happened to this city, but look at what its citizens did to rebuild
it because they loved it so much,'' says Ruby Adams, operations
manager at the Strand Theatre, which on Sept. 8 will present the
regional premiere of ``Malhado,'' a fictionalized account of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by New York playwright and director DeLora Whitney, a
Galveston native, is set in the two-week period before, during and
after the storm. Though fictionalized, it draws from the
experiences of real survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the play re-creates, Galveston was one of the
richest cities and biggest ports in the United States. Its 37,000
residents enjoyed an atmosphere of sophistication and luxury _ they
were the first in Texas to enjoy electricity and telephones. And,
perhaps tellingly, because they had lived through storms in the
past, many ignored the signs that a great hurricane was
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is sometimes assumed that the entire island was
flattened by the 1900 storm, many buildings survived in some
fashion, and thanks to a massive rebuilding effort immediately
after the hurricane, many parts of the island look much as they did
a century ago. The island boasts about 1,500 buildings and four
districts on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change precipitated by the storm, in fact, has
become Galveston's calling card _ the 17-foot-high, three-mile-long
seawall, built in the two years following the storm at a cost of
$1.5 million. (The wall was later extended to 11 miles long.) Also,
between 1904 and 1910, the elevation of the entire island was
lifted by several feet, with each existing structure lifted from
its foundation and filled underneath with sand.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston never fully recovered its stature as one of America's
richest cities, but it did return to prominence as a tourist
destination, a tradition that continues to this day. In fact, 7
million visitors are counted annually, according to figures from
the island's convention and visitors bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Many are still drawn by the beach, says Christine Hopkins,
spokeswoman for the Galveston Island Convention and Visitors
Bureau, but especially in the past five years, they've come to see
other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Moody Gardens opened an acclaimed aquarium last
year, joining its IMAX theater, rain-forest exhibit and other
displays. The posh San Luis Resort and the historic Hotel Galvez
both recently completed multimillion-dollar renovations. Downtown
renovation has spread to the Postoffice Street Arts &AMP; Entertainment
District, home to several new restaurants, clubs and art galleries.
And Carnival Cruise Lines will begin short cruises to Mexico from
Galveston's newly renovated Texas Cruise Ship Terminal in
September; Royal Caribbean will also offer some Galveston-based
cruises next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, many of the storm-related events will be held in or
near buildings or areas that date to the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand Theatre, for instance, housed in a former sail
factory built in 1871, is a storm survivor. So is the Grand 1894
Opera House, where an original piece by the Parsons Dance Company
of New York will premiere Sept. 9; the opera hall was barely 5
years old when the hurricane ripped off its roof and destroyed
portions of the back wall, but the citizens had it restored and
operating within a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of spirit Maureen Patton and the opera house
board wanted to commemorate with its commissioned dance. And don't
think that spirit is not alive today.
</P>
<P>
   New York choreographer David Parsons was chosen to create the
dance, titled ``The Whip,'' because of his unique connection to the
city. The first time he performed in Galveston, some 15 years ago,
was on a day a hurricane was forecast to hit the coast. He and the
opera house managers talked it over. The show went on, and that
night, he and his dancers rode out the storm at a Galveston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laughingly said at the time, we need to commission a work
from you commemorating a hurricane, because you've been through
one,'' Patton says. ``So when this came up and we really started
thinking about doing it, it was really the perfect thing. Because
that's what this is all really about, celebrating how people's
spirit can be undaunted by whatever befalls them.''

LOOKS GREAT, BUT `CELL' IS A VILE PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood's latest serial-killer thriller, ``The Cell,'' is a
visually impressive but exceedingly unpleasant little nail-biter
about a child psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) who uses some new
virtual-reality gizmo that allows her to enter the subconscious
mind of her patients.
</P>
<P>
   One day, a handsome FBI agent (Vince Vaughn) knocks on her door
with a problem only she can solve: It seems a brutal ladykiller
(Vincent D'Onofrio) has gone into a coma just as he was captured,
and his latest victim is imprisoned in some elaborate torture
chamber in some unknown remote location.
</P>
<P>
   Without too much hesitation, she jumps right into the monster's
brain, hoping to find his inner child, get its sympathy and
convince it to reveal the location of the titular prison cell
before it's too late. And believe you me, this guy's mind is not a
pretty place.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any good news about the result of this unlikely
quest, it's that Lopez proves once again she has no trouble
carrying a movie on her attractive shoulders. And first-time
feature filmmaker Tarsem Singh also establishes what must be a new
high in computer-generated surrealist imagery _ taking up more than
half the running time with Daliesque visuals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there's so many dream sequences that they
soon lose their impact, and become rather boring. In fact, seeing
this movie is a bit like hearing a lengthy discourse on someone
else's nightmare: it may mean a lot to him, but it soon beccomes
extremely tiresome to you.
</P>
<P>
   And since most of what we see is happening in someone's
subconscious mind and not _ we're often reminded by the script _
``really happening,'' it gives the filmmakers license to load the
movie down with stomach-turning scenes of women being bound and
tortured, people being disemboweled and children being horrendously
abused.
</P>
<P>
   You may find a better way to spend an hour-and-a-half.

`HIGH NOON': THE DAY GARY COOPER DIDN'T WALK DOWN MAIN STREET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Broadcast notes at end of review. Time and station are for New
York area; see local listings.) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no need to get in a snit about remaking a movie, however
great. Every half-century or so, even a classic can use some
dusting off. But ``High Noon''? Even people who have never seen the
film probably have an image of Gary Cooper as the heroic marshal
striding down Main Street, alone, to face a killer. Few movies have
been so inseparable from the star, or so deeply embedded in the
popular imagination. (Harry Thomason, who produced Bill Clinton's
lone walk along a long corridor before his entrance at the
Democratic convention this week, said he was inspired by that
scene; for the record, Cooper was not shot from such a low angle
that his body looked as elongated as a space invader's.)
</P>
<P>
   The new TBS version is a faithful, pallid, thoroughly
wrongheaded echo of the 1952 original. The laughable phrase ``the
Tom Skerritt `High Noon''' merely hints at the many problems with
this movie, which doesn't begin to do what good remakes can:
reinvent a film for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   What is ``High Noon'' divorced from Cooper's haunting presence?
Even without him, there could have been new life in the story of
Will Kane, the marshall who cleaned up Hadleyville. On the day he
marries, Kane is about to leave town with his Quaker bride when he
learns that Frank Miller, a killer he sent to prison, is arriving
on the noon train and gunning for him.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is fraught with moral issues. Should Kane stay and
defend himself, or listen to his pacifist wife and flee? That
question should carry even more resonance today, when the legacy of
the Vietnam War makes the wife's arguments more familiar than they
might have been in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   And it is loaded with mythic Western figures in addition to the
noble marshal. There are the archetypal light and dark women: Amy
Kane, the virginal bride (Grace Kelly in the original), and Helen
Ramirez, the sensual Mexican who used to be the lover of both Kane
and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Though the script makes few changes in Carl Foreman's original
screenplay, here the archetypes become caricatures. Every choice
backfires. The film maintains the idea of unfolding in real time,
running an hour and a quarter from the minute Kane hears that
Miller is coming until the train arrives. That stunt demands the
tautness that Fred Zinnemann brought to the original, but here Rod
Hardy's direction and pacing are slack. And how absurd is it to
shoot a film in real time, then break it up with commercials?
</P>
<P>
   The acting is timid. As Amy, who threatens to leave if her
husband stays to fight, Susanna Thompson is washed out and whiny.
(Grace Kelly's bride, shining with vitality, was no wimp.) Maria
Conchita Alonso seems equally worn down as Helen, who is supposed
to be fiercely in love with Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Skerritt doesn't even get points for having the gall to take on
the Cooper role because he does nothing to try to make it his own.
He mumbles through most of the movie. At one point he squints as a
reaction to bad news. As he lumbers from the church to the saloon
trying to deputize the townsmen, he looks pathetic rather than
brave. He might as well be an amateur impressionist doing Gary
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Diamond (Mike Kellerman on ``Homicide'') plays the callow,
selfish deputy, Harvey Pell, and Michael Madsen is the villainous
Miller. Reed looks conspicuously thin, while Madsen makes you
wonder how Miller ate so well in prison. The fact that such details
leap out is a sign of how uninvolving the movie is.
</P>
<P>
   And despite its slavish fidelity, this new version does not
include one original element that might have helped: the theme
song. (The producers were not able to get the rights.) ``Do Not
Forsake Me, Oh My Darling,'' runs through the original so
effectively it has become a Western anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Any remake deserves to be taken on its own terms, but the best
that can be said about the new ``High Noon'' is: Rent the old one
(or watch it on Turner Classic Movies on Sunday at 2 p.m.). It
holds up remarkably well and explains why Gary Cooper helped define
the Hollywood Western at its height.

 `STEAL' POSITIVELY PORTRAYS NOTORIOUS '60s PROTESTER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood movies of the '80s and '90s have tended to be very
hard on the student protesters of the '60s, invariably portraying
them as self-indulgent, dope-smoking cowards who spit on the flag
and didn't have the guts to fight in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Greenwald's ``Steal This Movie'' balances this ledger
somewhat with an unashamedly positive look at the rise of the '60s
counterculture in terms of a mostly admiring chronicle of the life
of one of its most notorious figures: Abbie Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   There's some irony here because Hoffman _ the self-appointed
leader of the handful of ``Yippie'' protesters at the 1968 Chicago
Democratic Convention _ has gone down in history as perhaps the
least admirable of the '60s radicals: a publicity-seeking clown who
represented little but his own ego.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenwald's movie _ and Vincent D'Onofrio's fearless (if
uneven) portrayal _ dig beneath this stereotype to find a character
of considerable humanity and much personal courage who paid a
tremendous personal price for the in-your-face audacity that so
enraged the Nixon administration and the '60s establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The story opens in 1977, from the point of view of a reluctant
magazine reporter summoned to a secret meeting with Hoffman, who
has been living on the run and undercover for too many years and is
now a paranoid wreck who desperately wants the reporter to tell the
``true story'' of his life.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the film takes a ``Citizen Kane'' approach, telling
Hoffman's story in flashbacks sparked by the reporter's interviews
with a succession of witnesses, most prominently his longtime
attorney Gerry Lefcourt (Kevin Pollack) and his long-suffering and
magnificently supportive wife, Anita (Janeane Garofalo).
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is depicted as a nice New York Jewish kid whose path is
bent after being assaulted by a red-neck lawman while working for
the civil rights movement in the South. He finds a home in the
emerging '60s revolution and brief media glory as the most
uncooperative defendant in the famous trial of the ``Chicago
Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter half of his life is much sadder, and the last third
of the movie is out to prove (as if any one would doubt it) that,
after Chicago, Hoffman was endlessly and illegally hounded by the
FBI and then personally set up by J. Edgar Hoover in a drug sting
that put him on the run for six years.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, 6-foot-3 D'Onofrio looks nothing at all like the
short, homely Hoffman; his accent keeps shifting incongruously
between New England and the deep South. The movie has some clumsy
elements (a terrible Nixon vocal impersonation on the soundtrack,
for one), and it's noticeably fuzzy about Hoffman's motives in the
big-time drug deal that was his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenwald, who knew Hoffman in his later years, infuses the
film with authenticity (to the point of having co-defendant Tom
Hayden played by his real-life son) and does an excellent job of
evoking the '60s in not just the usual bold strokes and barrage of
classic rock music but in a string of delicate small touches that
could only come from a veteran of the era.
</P>
<P>
   D'Onofrio's brash, take-no-prisoners performance also captures
something elemental about the '60s and works well off Garofalo to
create a genuinely moving love story that is so strong it's somehow
not hindered a bit when the fugitive Hoffman takes on a lover
(Jeanne Tripplehorn), and his marriage turns into a rather awkward
menage-a-trois.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald (best known for the TV-movie ``The Burning Bed'') has
infused his movie with nostalgic appeal, but it's actually aimed
less at aging boomers than at their children: an intention that's
wonderfully crystallized in a teary-eyed speech in which the
now-50ish Hoffman praises the ``fire of youth'' and its absolute
necessity to endlessly question authority, challenge the system and
accept no compromise.

A CENTURY AFTER THE STORM, GALVESTON CELEBRATES SPIRIT OF SURVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanied by GALVESTON-IF YOU GO)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems, perhaps, an odd event for a tourist destination to be
commemorating _ the 100th anniversary of the greatest natural
disaster in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But with their weekend-long observance next month, the folks in
Galveston are not celebrating the great hurricane of 1900, which on
Sept. 8, 1900, virtually decimated the island, killing more than
6,000 people and destroying more than 3,000 buildings. They're
really honoring the city itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That storm was the defining moment in Galveston's history. It
wasn't just an ordinary storm; it has everything to do with the
spirit of the community and its survival,'' says Maureen Patton, a
Galveston native who now is director of the Grand 1894 Opera House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Galveston could have packed up their tents and
left, but they didn't. The way they rebuilt this city really stands
as a great human accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The coastal city has been observing the storm's anniversary all
year with a series of lectures, exhibits and tours, culminating in
a full weekend of activities Sept. 8-10. There will be a
communitywide tribute, featuring CBS anchor Dan Rather; a
dedication ceremony for a public sculpture by a fourth-generation
Galveston artist; a series of open houses and parties; and arts
events including a modern dance performance and a play, both
centered on the storm and commissioned for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   And although the events will recognize the great losses suffered
by Galveston _ the weekend schedule includes the placement of a
wreath at the site of St. Mary's Orphanage, where 90 children and
at least 10 nuns perished _ the theme of the weekend is survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to share with people who are visiting, look at what
happened to this city, but look at what its citizens did to rebuild
it because they loved it so much,'' says Ruby Adams, operations
manager at the Strand Theatre, which on Sept. 8 will present the
regional premiere of ``Malhado,'' a fictionalized account of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   The play, by New York playwright and director DeLora Whitney, a
Galveston native, is set in the two-week period before, during and
after the storm. Though fictionalized, it draws from the
experiences of real survivors.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the play re-creates, Galveston was one of the
richest cities and biggest ports in the United States. Its 37,000
residents enjoyed an atmosphere of sophistication and luxury _ they
were the first in Texas to enjoy electricity and telephones. And,
perhaps tellingly, because they had lived through storms in the
past, many ignored the signs that a great hurricane was
approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is sometimes assumed that the entire island was
flattened by the 1900 storm, many buildings survived in some
fashion, and thanks to a massive rebuilding effort immediately
after the hurricane, many parts of the island look much as they did
a century ago. The island boasts about 1,500 buildings and four
districts on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change precipitated by the storm, in fact, has
become Galveston's calling card _ the 17-foot-high, three-mile-long
seawall, built in the two years following the storm at a cost of
$1.5 million. (The wall was later extended to 11 miles long.) Also,
between 1904 and 1910, the elevation of the entire island was
lifted by several feet, with each existing structure lifted from
its foundation and filled underneath with sand.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston never fully recovered its stature as one of America's
richest cities, but it did return to prominence as a tourist
destination, a tradition that continues to this day. In fact, 7
million visitors are counted annually, according to figures from
the island's convention and visitors bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Many are still drawn by the beach, says Christine Hopkins,
spokeswoman for the Galveston Island Convention and Visitors
Bureau, but especially in the past five years, they've come to see
other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Moody Gardens opened an acclaimed aquarium last
year, joining its IMAX theater, rain-forest exhibit and other
displays. The posh San Luis Resort and the historic Hotel Galvez
both recently completed multimillion-dollar renovations. Downtown
renovation has spread to the Postoffice Street Arts &AMP; Entertainment
District, home to several new restaurants, clubs and art galleries.
And Carnival Cruise Lines will begin short cruises to Mexico from
Galveston's newly renovated Texas Cruise Ship Terminal in
September; Royal Caribbean will also offer some Galveston-based
cruises next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, many of the storm-related events will be held in or
near buildings or areas that date to the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand Theatre, for instance, housed in a former sail
factory built in 1871, is a storm survivor. So is the Grand 1894
Opera House, where an original piece by the Parsons Dance Company
of New York will premiere Sept. 9; the opera hall was barely 5
years old when the hurricane ripped off its roof and destroyed
portions of the back wall, but the citizens had it restored and
operating within a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of spirit Maureen Patton and the opera house
board wanted to commemorate with its commissioned dance. And don't
think that spirit is not alive today.
</P>
<P>
   New York choreographer David Parsons was chosen to create the
dance, titled ``The Whip,'' because of his unique connection to the
city. The first time he performed in Galveston, some 15 years ago,
was on a day a hurricane was forecast to hit the coast. He and the
opera house managers talked it over. The show went on, and that
night, he and his dancers rode out the storm at a Galveston hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laughingly said at the time, we need to commission a work
from you commemorating a hurricane, because you've been through
one,'' Patton says. ``So when this came up and we really started
thinking about doing it, it was really the perfect thing. Because
that's what this is all really about, celebrating how people's
spirit can be undaunted by whatever befalls them.''

FORD HIGHLIGHT FILM STARTED EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Childhood memories are quirky, sometimes not so much
in what they leave in as what they leave out. I remember watching
the fourth game of the 1950 World Series on television _ it was an
October afternoon, a time on the calendar when kids across the
country suddenly developed mysterious illnesses and had to stay
home from school, and no one had even dreamed of playing a World
Series game at night.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember a single pitch thrown by Whitey Ford, a
21-year-old left-handed Yankee rookie, as he went into the ninth
inning that day having held the National League champs, the
Phillies, scoreless. What I remember was Casey Stengel, the old,
bowlegged Yankee manager, leaving the mound with Ford after having
taken him out of the game and actually apologizing to the sellout
crowd in Yankee Stadium for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid in my memory is Stengel's shrug, palms up at his sides,
gesturing in response to the mixture of cheers for Ford and boos
for his removal. It was a display of sympathy for the kid from
Astoria, Queens, who just a few years earlier was playing in street
stickball games, and now under a national spotlight and World
Series pressure had pitched so beautifully. The fans believed the
young man deserved to finish the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had the Phillies shut out by 5-0 when, with two out and two
on, Gene Woodling muffed a fly ball in left field. Two runs scored.
Mike Goliat followed with a single through the left side of the
infield. And that is when Stengel came out of the dugout and
motioned for a relief pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Allie Reynolds retired the last batter and Ford got his victory.
Ford would go on to win nine more games in World Series play, a
record, as well as break a Babe Ruth pitching mark with 33
consecutive scoreless innings in World Series games. In 16 major
league seasons, all with the Yankees, Ford won 236 games and lost
106, for the best winning percentage (.690) of any pitcher in the
20th century, and in 1974 he was elected to the Baseball Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, in Yankee Stadium, the Yankees will hold Whitey
Ford Day, for 50 years of continuous service to the Yankees as a
player, a coach, a broadcaster, a consultant, and, finally, as
Chairman of the Board, the nickname he earned for being someone who
was regularly called upon in the clutch, and invariably came
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees called and asked if I'd be open to a day for me,''
Ford said Wednesday by phone from his home in Lake Success on Long
Island. ``Twenty minutes later I called back: `That'll be fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he's feeling fine _ ``a lot better than I was
a few months ago'' _ and that he was finished with the radiation
treatments he had been undergoing after removal of a cancerous
brain tumor from the left side of his head in November. Five years
ago, he went through a similar procedure after a cancerous tumor
had been discovered on the right side of his brain.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a day for you is approaching, it is a time for
reminiscence. He remembers being in awe of Joe DiMaggio _ ``my hero
since I was 8 years old and just starting to follow baseball'' _
and seeing him and Lou Gehrig in 1938 from a bleacher seat. Ford
recalled meeting a very shy Yogi Berra on the day in 1947 when
Berra came up for the first time to the Yankees, from Newark, and
Ford was in the dugout after having just signed his first contract
with the Yankees, at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   And he laughed about his days as bon vivant on the road with
Billy Martin and Mickey Mantle, and being ``preached'' to by
Stengel about the dangers of ruining their careers by staying out
late. (At one point in the 1962 World Series against the Giants,
Stengel told them: ``If you're trying to outdrink San Francisco,
you're overmatched.'')
</P>
<P>
   One has to believe that whatever Ford was doing, he wasn't doing
it _ or no longer was doing it _ to harmful excess. When he
retired, partway in the 1967 season, it was because of problems
with his pitching elbow.
</P>
<P>
   While there were always rumors that he may have scuffed or
moistened a ball or two or more in his time, success for the
5-foot-10-inch, 180-pound Ford was due to great control, superb
breaking balls and an uncanny wit on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be amazed,'' he once said, ``how many important outs
you can get by working the count down to where the hitter is sure
you're going to throw to his weakness and then throw to his power
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   What would he like to be remembered for? ``For being nice,
having a good family life, and I think I was liked by other
players,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And his greatest baseball memory? ``Not one single moment stands
out,'' he said. But literally a series of moments: pitching in 11
World Series in his first 13 seasons in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the rest of us, his first World Series, 50 years ago
this year, and that poignant moment when he was sent to the
showers, remains most compelling.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN

<P>
   A 1960s Story, About Hoffman
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Robert Greenwald said the idea for making his new
film, ``Steal This Movie!,'' about the life of the 1960s
radical-prankster Abbie Hoffman, began when he was talking to his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in their 20s, college-educated young women who had
great interest and excitement about the '60s,'' he said. ``You
know, the tie-dyed clothes, the music. They even heard rumors there
were drugs back then. But they didn't know much more about it than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, while at a Los Angeles bookstore, he came
across an old copy of ``Letters From the Underground,'' the book of
correspondence between Hoffman, who died in 1989, and his wife,
Anita, during the years the radical was living incognito, on the
run from the law. ``It was a wonderful love story,'' Greenwald
said. ``A bell went off. This would make a wonderful movie.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he said, the sudden re-emergence of mass street
protests _ at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle last
year, at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and,
again this week, at the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles _ has only made the story of Hoffman's emergence at the
1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and his subsequent trial,
flight and descent into manic-depression more relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, when we finished the movie and delivered it to
Lions Gate Films to be distributed, the thinking was that it would
appeal mostly to people who were there back then, to baby boomers
and others interested in the nostalgia factor,'' Greenwald said.
``Then, after the WTO demonstrations, it was like an alarm clock
went off. We started getting letters from youth groups all around
the country who wanted to screen the film. You know, there's a
scene in the film where the protesters are trying to get a permit,
and they keep getting the runaround, and it's the same sort of
thing that happened to the protesters in Philadelphia and Los
Angeles this year. It's eerie, like history repeating itself.''
</P>
<P>
   After he read the book, he said, he tracked down Anita Hoffman
in California and got to know her. ``We played volleyball together
in Venice, like all good radicals,'' he said. He told how he had
discussed the '60s with his daughters, how he found her book and
now wanted to make it into a movie. ``She said, `Absolutely not.
It's Hollywood and they'll just screw it up.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he promised to make the movie independent of any studio
_ ``there wasn't any studio that was going to make a movie on this
subject, anyway'' _ and promised to show her every draft of the
screenplay. And he sent her some of the television movies he had
made in the past, like ``Forgotten Prisoners'' in 1990 (about a
crusading lawyer for Amnesty International) and ``The Burning Bed''
in 1984 (about spousal abuse), and finally Hoffman said he could go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   That was three and a half years ago, Greenwald said. He
commissioned a screenplay, began to interview people about
Hoffman's life and started to think about casting and raising
production money. ``We got very lucky,'' he said. ``There was
something called a hedge fund. I'll never understand what it is,
but they had the money and wanted to invest it.'' In the end,
Vincent D'Onofrio was cast as Abbie and Janeane Garofalo as Anita,
who died in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Two pre-release screenings were set for this week in Los
Angeles, for some of the people who were in town to protest at the
convention. And the film's limited release begins Friday in New
York and a few other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Greenwald said, he hopes his daughters will have at least a
little better understanding of what the '60s were about.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is about that period of time,'' he said. ``And
Abbie is the tour guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramblin' Jack Revisited
</P>
<P>
   Aiyana Elliott said she ``did not intend to make a personal film
when I set out to make this movie; I wanted to make as objective a
film about my dad as I could.'' But in the making, ``The Ballad of
Ramblin' Jack,'' a documentary about her father, the folk singer
Jack Elliott, turned into a much more personal film than she had
ever anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was this interview I did with my mother,'' Elliott
said. ``She was just talking to me, her daughter, and talking about
what it had been like for me to grow up with my dad on the road all
the time. And when we brought the footage back to New York, our
editor looked at it and said that it was really interesting. It
changed the whole direction of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Her film was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January,
with her father in the audience, seeing it for the first time. He
had resisted making the film, she said, and was not at all
comfortable with some of the more personal material about their
family life. ``But I think it helped for him to see it with an
audience,'' she said, ``to hear them laugh and to applaud and to
see how people were reacting to his story.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is a contemporary of such legendary folk artists as
Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, and in the critically acclaimed
film, which opened in New York on Wednesday, their stories
intertwine with his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out thinking it would be a more traditional verite
film, following my dad around with the camera, listening to his
stories,'' she said. ``It would be a natural. But then the movie
changed, and it was very difficult to tell such a personal story,
sometimes very painful. I often wondered if it wasn't just creating
more tension and problems for me and my dad, but in the end, I
think we have gotten closer because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Men of Summer
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dinner said he hadn't seen Clint Eastwood's ``Space
Cowboys'' yet, and it's just a coincidence that he, too, had a
summer movie coming out in which older actors played the central
roles. ``It's kind of nice to be able to see these actors in a
summer movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner's film is ``The Crew,'' a comedy that opens August 25
about a foursome of aging gangsters in a Miami Beach hotel who
inadvertently find themselves in a dangerous duel with a South
American drug lord. Burt Reynolds, Richard Dreyfuss, Dan Hedaya and
Seymour Cassell play the old wise guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the audience is used to the big extravaganzas, and now
it's August and maybe it's time for some older actors and some
smaller movies that aren't all about special effects,'' Dinner
said. ``There's always the conventional wisdom that in the summer
the kids are out of school, so all the movies have to be geared to
kids. Maybe the success of a `Space Cowboys' can show that it
doesn't always have to be like that. Besides, I grew up watching
all of these actors. It's fun to see them working in a summer movie
again.''

OPTING FOR LADYLIKE LOOKS 
WITH PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
(UNDATED) It had to happen: Almost the minute large companies
amended their dress codes to read ``casual every day,'' fashion
designers declared that dressing up is back in style.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think this trend of ladylike dressing up will be one that is
accepted very readily,'' said LaVelle Olexa, senior vice president
of fashion merchandising for Lord &AMP; Taylor. And she views the trend
as positive for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw something recently about world power that said the
dressed have always ruled the undressed,'' Olexa said. ``Now I see
some men going to work looking like little boys going off to
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Casual every day really started way back in the '60s, when
women didn't have to wear hats and gloves to work anymore,'' said
Jaqui Lividini, senior vice president of fashion merchandising and
communications for Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she said, it was spoken of as ``the damnation of
America, but now dressing is all about options. There are days when
you really want a pulled-together look. However, I think a woman is
going to wear what's most comfortable and what's right for her.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is no reason a woman cannot dress casually
one day and glamour-puss perfect the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dress down more when I go to work than I did a couple of
years ago,'' said Roz Pactor, vice president and fashion director
for Foley's, ``but I believe we went to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every jacket was replaced with a twin set,'' Pactor said. ``We
went way too casual in women's wear, and now I think customers are
ready to put a jacket on again. They'll feel more complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of the '80s lady is certainly the biggest push for
fall, said Erin Carmack, director of fashion presentation for
Neiman Marcus, ``but it's a return to the '80s that's modern and
new _ an uptown lady. The designers borrowed a little bit from each
decade from the 1920s forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Several elements go into achieving this fall's new ladylike
look, and in the clothing department the return of the suit is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suits haven't been around in a lot of seasons,'' Lividini
said, ``so now they look right again.''
</P>
<P>
   Suits this year have peplums with nipped-in waists so that
jackets will need to be worn buttoned for best effect, perhaps even
with a narrow belt. The adventurous might make that a narrow
ostrich or even rhinestone belt.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts tend to be longer, often below the knee for slim designs,
but Lividini sees more volume returning in skirts with pleats and
kilts _ ``skirts with some movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladylike outerwear is going in the opposite direction, however.
Credit the '60s fitted coats and coat dresses, such as those worn
by Braniff flight attendants, for this trend to body-conscious fit.
Some coats also have belts across the back.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the blouse is another ladylike sign for fall, but
its style will surprise many.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the bow-tie blouse?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no, you moan. Not the dreaded silk blouse with the floppy
bow tie!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Shades of the feminist uniform. Dustin Hoffman in
``Tootsie'' and former Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   These blouses are already on store racks for fall, in matte silk
or shiny charmeuse, with attached or unattached ties.
</P>
<P>
   And _ would you believe? _ shoulder pads are back, said
Stephanie McKinley, owner of Pixie &AMP; Ivy, a Houston boutique.
</P>
<P>
   For young women who have never worn the look, it will be fun and
a feminine way to dress professionally.
</P>
<P>
   More mature women might want to choose from wrap blouses or ones
with soft ruffles at the neck. In fact, young women are snapping
these up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are more girly than a business blouse, more feminine''
said Tess Hall, manager of Arden B in Houston's Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk of suits and feminine blouses by no means heralds
the demise of pant dressing. Pactor said pants are changing,
however, from straight legs to cigarette-slim styles such as the
high-waisted ones Audrey Hepburn wore. Pactor refers to these as
``Hollywood pants.''
</P>
<P>
   More ladylike dressing includes the return of pumps _ high- or
midheeled shoes with closed toes and either closed heels or
slingback straps. Heels range from sharp stilettos to thick and
stacked to little princess styles.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these heel designs bode well for the return of the
covered leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to get reacquainted with the look,'' Lividini
said. ``A woman will have to put a little more thought into getting
dressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lividini said Saks allowed its sales associates to go without
stockings for the summer, not only for comfort but because the
company wanted its personnel to reflect the new business-casual
attitude of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, however, she sees them returning to stockings because
of fashion trends.
</P>
<P>
   Colored or patterned hosiery is the modern take on this legwear
trend, and it is closed heels or heel straps that will keep
stockinged feet from slipping out of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the new pumps a matching handbag and perhaps a belt or
gloves. Yes, matchy-matchy is back, and if gloves are returning,
hats cannot be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   For fall, the beret will probably be the hat of choice, one that
effectively integrates sportswear fabrics such as tweed and leather
and patterns such as plaid with ladylike looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But handbags are the most important accessory this fall,''
said Harriet Hart, owner of the Houston shop that bears her name.
``There is lots of embellishment, with beads, feathers and fur.
It's almost like having a piece of jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   But not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl, diamond and even rhinestone jewelry will abound this
fall, shown off at the ears and neck by sleek, pulled-back
hairstyles, such as chignons worn at the base of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Griffin, owner of Scruples in Houston, said today's
self-assured woman will go for this '80s bejeweled look, but it
won't be contrived. ``It's not the grunge look or the big beehive
hairdos you're seeing in the magazines. Most women are
self-confident enough to know what's best for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news in jewelry is not Barbara Bush pearls but the
return of gold or gold-tone jewelry, especially large hoop
earrings. Maybe Charlie's Angels were not precisely ladylike, but
they were the inspiration for this retro trend.
</P>
<P>
   In handbags, the top-handled purse with rigid framing, one that
has to be carried by hand or looped over the forearm, looks best
with the new ladylike styles. And Pactor reports that manufacturers
are quickly switching from silver and pewter to gold-tone hardware,
both shiny and matte.
</P>
<P>
   Lividini is among fashion-industry insiders who see the return
of the little black dress, which surely was out of style for only
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The return of pearl necklaces, from one strand to several and
with larger pearls, makes this wardrobe standard almost a must,
said Pactor.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman's Carmack cautions women against ``junking up'' their
ladylike looks by going overboard with accessories.
</P>
<P>
   With minimalist dressing, she said, the rule was look in the
mirror and take off one accessory before going out. ``Now the new
rule will be put on two more,'' Carmack said, ``but don't overdo
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind this fall's large hoop earrings is not a return
to gypsy fashion but rather a slight casualizing of the ladylike
looks. The same idea follows with shoulder-dusting chandelier
earrings, Carmack said, earrings that look like Venetian glass.
</P>
<P>
   Anything that smacks of Coco Chanel's classic styles appears hot
for fall. Karl Lagerfeld is reintroducing the quilted,
chain-handled accordion bag, and another Chanel classic popular
this summer _ camel-colored shoes with black toe caps _ will
continue through fall and winter, replacing the basic black shoe.

WHAT'S A PEPLUM? (WITH PHOTO OF LAURA BUSH) 
BY LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Fashion's return to ladylike styles this fall heralds the return of
the peplum.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But what, you may ask, is a peplum?
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, it is the extension of a fitted jacket that
flares over the hips. A peplum may be cut in one piece with the
bodice or joined to it by a seam.
</P>
<P>
   Popular in the 1860s, peplums looked new again in the 1930s and
'40s.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently the style appeared in the over-the-top dressing of
the 1980s, when it was often executed in elaborate brocade cocktail
suits and styles dubbed ``fit and flare.''
</P>
<P>
   The best examples in recent years have been seen on women in the
political arena, especially in Washington, D.C., in that genre of
fashion dubbed ``inside the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   While the peplum's return this year is considered a retro
fashion look, women in Washington have clung to the style since the
'80s. Only a year ago, high fashion standards would have labeled
peplums tame or even boring _ a sort of female political uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush prefers the style for many of the jackets made for
her by designer Michael Faircloth, who works exclusively at Lily
Dodson in Dallas. The white suit Bush wore on the final night of
the Republican National Convention was a Faircloth design.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth said the peplum is particularly good for women who
have lower and longer hips because it bridges the space from a tiny
waistline to the fullest part of the hips.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't like a real flouncy peplum. It looks too girly,''
he said.

<P>
   You could say that art critics are almost always, inescapably,
writing about installation art, or at least the art of
installation. This is because they are usually writing about
exhibitions, that is, groupings of artworks whose physical
arrangement, or installation, is basic to their impact.
</P>
<P>
   These arrangements require an unusual, probably unteachable
talent for placing objects in space and in relation to one another,
one reason a doctorate in art history does not necessarily a
curator make. Poorly done, installations can be an assault on art
and viewer alike. At their best they can cast spells, convert the
skeptic, provide transcendent moments of seeing, and make all kinds
of points about art and its display.
</P>
<P>
   This is the case with ``Curios and Treasures,'' a modest, yet
serenely beautiful exhibition at the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. Its 65 garments and accessories travel
through four or five centuries of European dress, touching down
lightly here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find it a stretch to call this assortment an
exhibition. Organized by Myra Walker, acting associate curator in
charge of the institute, it is really little more than a potpourri
of items whose primary common trait seems to be that they have
almost never been exhibited since joining the institute's
collection. But Walker has chosen her items well, juxtaposed them
tellingly and given them plenty of space (which is slightly unusual
for the Costume Institute). And she has had excellent backup from
the museum's design department, especially where lighting is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The results are close to magical: an elegant, meditative
atmosphere in which the art of wearable clothes is unusually
palpable. The overall effect is so different from Walker's previous
effort, the raucous and overcrowded ``Rock Style,'' that it almost
seems an act of penance. Compared to rock 'n' roll, this is the
``Moonlight'' Sonata. Which is not to condone the only misstep: the
piping in of various bits of music, at rather high volume _ a
waltz, something Baroque, something modern _ to clue visitors into
the show's shifting focus. This is another example of the
inexplicable practice, on the rise in museums, of asking people
concentrating on still, silent objects to use their ears, too. If
the art itself isn't deliberately making noise, nothing else
should.
</P>
<P>
   It is always interesting to see what happens when the Costume
Institute falls back on its own collection without benefit of
outside loans or some big theme or epochal frame. This show
includes garments plain and fancy, representing the efforts of
people famous, forgotten or never known. There are 19th- and
20th-century evening dresses and tea gowns, including a suite of
dresses by the great Mariano Fortuny; three rare men's doublets;
and a group of men's and women's at-home wear from the 17th and
18th centuries. This last section is especially spare, with seven
examples of the short, close-fitting jackets and bodices that women
typically wore over loose dresses, seemingly suspended in midair.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a small vitrine contrasts accessories and social strata.
On the one hand are richly embroidered gloves, slippers and silk
purses, mostly from 16th- and 17th-century Spain and England, items
clearly reserved for the palace-born. On the other are two simple
knitted wool caps and four leather shoes, all English and dating
from as early as the late 14th century. On the whole they resemble
sows' ears, except a sharp-toed shoe called a poulaine. It's a
little like a face-off between the royal portraiture of Velazquez
and one of Breugel's roiling village scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But the true sovereign of this vitrine is an Austrian hat, an
early-17th-century ancestor of the Tyrolean. Made of buff leather
with a braid-trimmed rim, it has a full, slightly exaggerated crown
that is divided into sections and accented with sharp, short
diagonals, all embroidered in black. It suggests a hunter's hat
fused with a hunter's well-stuffed game pie, and beyond that it has
the slightly clumsy volupte of a Marsden Hartley still life.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly buff leather, this time in the form of a sturdy man's
doublet, presides over another vitrine. It contrasts strikingly
with a far fancier version in polychrome silk brocade bordered with
mauve silk braid, its front panels evoking the geometry of armor,
its sleeves slashed for decorative effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curios and Treasures'' presents several thin, wonderfully
transparent slices of aesthetic and social history, like random
frames excerpted from a film. These excerpts don't give us history,
but they convey a vivid sense of how history happens, of the
combination of invention, evolution and historical borrowing that
constitutes the life of any art form.
</P>
<P>
   All these tendencies meet in the Fortuny display, where more
than a dozen gowns and evening capes reflect unusual depth in the
institute's holdings. Fortuny (1871-1949) was born in Spain, where
he studied drawing and painting, spent time in France and Germany,
where he studied chemistry and dyes, before settling in Venice. His
clothing design (like his set designs for theater and opera) drew
on many cultural sources: Japanese kimonos; monks' habits; flowing,
trumpet-sleeved Renaissance gowns; diaphanous Greek chemieses.
</P>
<P>
   Fortuny was known for unusually rich, luminous colors, and he
also figured out how to stencil velvet with gold patterns
(variously Celtic, Islamic and Baroque in origin). Most important
he invented and patented a method for inflicting incredibly fine,
permanent pleats on silk, so it was both form-fitting and
expandable, like an early form of stretch fabric, and yet had some
body of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In a way Fortuny is the touchstone for the show. Nearby are
gowns by two little-known designers whom he influenced: Maria
Monaci Gallenga (Italian, 1880-1944) and Mme. Babani, a French
designer who opened a boutique on the Boulevard Haussmann in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   At another point the modernity and functionality of Fortuny's
pleating contrasts with a less progressive evocation of things
Greek: a yellow silk evening gown from the 1880s, attributed to
Liberty &AMP; Co., whose cascade of horizontally draped fabric is
actually carefully tacked down. It was inspired by Oscar Wilde's
pronouncements that women should dress according to ``Grecian
form,'' and its traditionalism is hinted at by a tiny row of box
pleats at the hem; all these also suggest the toothlike details
(called dentils) on the entablature of a Greek temple.
</P>
<P>
   Such mixed messages are not surprising, given that clothes often
reflect complicated knots of function, fantasy, art and desire.
Even more deeply divided is a French evening dress in blue silk
with a high bustle, a lace overdress and a skirt whose horizontal
draping is similar to the Wilde concoction. As if that weren't
enough, the skirt is completed by a deep border of box pleats and
gathered bands that resemble an inverted dust ruffle.
</P>
<P>
   A more harmonious alliance of old and new is to be found in an
ivory silk shantung dress, also French, from 1908. It updates a
relatively conventional hourglass silhouette with curling tendrils
of self-piping, whose bold spirals and undulations may have been
inspired by Art Nouveau but also presage Alexander Calder's
hammered silver-wire jewelry in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Another showstopper is a formidable worker's smock in
buff-colored linen from 19th-century rural England. In all
likelihood the handiwork of some farmer's wife, intended for Sunday
best, it has a broad densely embroidered collar and a square panel
of smocking that forms a kind of grillwork across the chest and
also appears in broad bands at the wrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curios and Treasures'' is at the Costume Institute of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)
879-5500, through Jan. 21.

The influence of Coco Chanel is undeniable in fashions for fall and
winter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clockwise from top left, Chanel's reintroduced classic accordion
bag with gold-tone chain strap, $1,285.
</P>
<P>
   Add a floral touch around the shoulders of a suit with a printed
cashmere shawl. Loro Piana scarf, $795.
</P>
<P>
   Cloche hats will add the perfect 1920s touch to fall suits. This
one is by Philip Treacy, $225.
</P>
<P>
   Although the influence is from Chanel, these taupe stacked-heel
pumps with black toe caps are by Joan &AMP; David shoes, $225.
</P>
<P>
   Legwear is back, from neutral-colored pantyhose to brightly
colored or even printed tights. Double C's on taupe tights and
pin-on flowers are more Chanel trademarks. Tights are $115 and
flowers $160 each.
</P>
<P>
   Ladylike fashions demand pearl accessories. These faux pearls
with glass ornament are by Houstonian Mariquita Masterson, $540.
</P>
<P>
   A camel-colored fine leather bag is one of the must-haves for
fall. This one is by Gucci, $730.
</P>
<P>
   Center, a coral sweater set takes a different twist. For
starters, the TSE cashmere shell top is sleeveless with a
turtleneck, $290. Then there are the decorative stitching and
hidden mother-of-pearl buttons on the cardigan, $395.

WATERS LEAVES NO DOUBTS `CECIL B. DEMENTED' IS ONLY SILLY MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The revolution will not be televised, but if John Waters has his
way, it may play at a theater near you.
</P>
<P>
   A spoof of independent filmmaking at its most absurdly radical
(and contradictory) fringe, ``Cecil B. Demented'' affectionately
lampoons both Hollywood and guerrilla cinema in a bizarre revision
of the Patty Hearst story.
</P>
<P>
   Shrill, bitchy Hollywood screen queen Honey Whitlock (Melanie
Griffith, whose kewpie doll voice and aging baby face are right at
home) is kidnapped by shaggy, bottle-blonde, would-be auteur Cecil
(Stephen Dorff) and his slogan-spouting crew of cinema outlaws
``The Sprocket Holes,'' a combination guerrilla cell, filmmaking
collective, and cinema cult.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil declares war against Hollywood with the ultimate
underground movie ``Raving Beauty,'' a series of assaults on
mainstream cinema played as both political statement and film
realism. Honey, his initially reluctant star, becomes invigorated
by the sheer thrill of rebellion and adopts her young misfit
captors as a worried Mommy as she sees her cultural cachet rise
with her new reputation as a cinema rebel.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil is not so much a rebel as the ultimate indie filmmaker as
cult leader. All of the Sprockets are branded with tattoos of their
cinema heroes; Cecil's is the infamous Otto Preminger, the patron
saint of high minded tyrants. It's a gag bound to go over the heads
of Water's young target audience, as are many of the 1960s
revolutionary references and film insider jokes (who's going to
notice that Cecil's theme music quotes Preminger's ``Exodus''?).
</P>
<P>
   Never the most technically accomplished of filmmakers, Waters
gets the job done with a flat, at times clumsy, style that
periodically flags and drags the momentum down. Like all his other
films, he relies on his cast's enthusiasm to bring his script to
life. When they click, it's good, giddy fun.
</P>
<P>
   Water has always celebrated misfits, outcasts and cultural
rebels and their self-made families and this is his most
outrageous, anarchic such bunch in decades. They assault a Maryland
Film Commission luncheon, crash the Baltimore set of ``Forrest Gump
2: Gump Again'' (``Life is like a crab cake''), and shoot it out
with angry Teamsters, but there's an odd sense of innocence to the
entire enterprise which recasts the entire film in an innocuous
vein. Waters never mines their bundle of contradictions, he just
enjoys their passion.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Honey makes an impossible 30-foot jump (a pure
action hero movie move), looked up in wondered astonishment after
landing without a scratch, and shrugs acceptingly.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment, simple movie magic collapses the distance
between the sloganeering, filmmaking and film viewing into one big
fantasy. It's Waters' way of saying: It's only a movie.
</P>
<P>

FINDING WAYS TO PRACTICE, AND NOT ANNOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

 By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most musicians here, practicing without the
interruption of a broom handle banging on the ceiling is a
perennial problem. Practice rooms are expensive, and there are only
so many rooftops. So the solutions have become more and more
creative, from using high-tech gizmos to funnel an instrument's
sound into headphones to retreating to the privacy of a boat deck.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians tramping up and down the narrow stairway of
Smalls, a jazz club in a Greenwich Village basement, readily grouse
about the practice problem. ``People will almost never complain
about a TV,'' said John Mosca, a trombonist who leads the Vanguard
Jazz Orchestra and has been evicted from an Upper West Side
Manhattan apartment for soundproofing the floor. ``It's an
inalienable right. But about practicing, people will complain
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that is the case, Mitchell Borden, the proprietor of
Smalls, extends the come-one, come-all largess he offers customers
($10 for 10 hours of music, plus free soft drinks) to the jazz cats
who play there. The club, which used to be a restaurant, came with
a walk-in refrigerator, coincidentally soundproof, where Borden now
keeps a piano. Musicians practice there at all hours, even during
performances. Borden also keeps a large black book in which
musicians can sign up to use the club as a free rehearsal hall
during the day. He is, Mosca says, a saint.
</P>
<P>
   But such generosity is rare. Practice rooms, $25 an hour at a
minimum, are out of reach for many musicians who need a few hours a
day to do the kind of bleating musical calisthenics that build fine
motor skills but can induce migraines in involuntary listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians are lucky. Marco Katz hasn't rented a practice
room since 1988, when he moved into his 1969 Nautaline houseboat,
the Misty. Katz, 48, a freelance trombonist who often plays in
schools, said the boat is an ideal place to have jam sessions. But
not because he can motor the boat out of earshot _ it doesn't run.
Rather, he said, it's because the ``characters'' who surround him
at the 79th Street Boat Basin, where the Misty is docked, have a
live-and-let-live attitude.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor used to come over and bang on the door during
rehearsals, Katz recalled. ``He'd say, `I have a complaint about
the music. You guys aren't playing loud enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, Katz said, his jazz quartet was playing on the
marina's wave wall at sunset, when a sailboat full of tourists
disembarked. ``Just another service offered to you by the city of
New York,'' he told them. One guy laid a twenty on them.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Katz's, Johannes Pfannkuch, 39, has another kind of
retreat, thanks to a longstanding deal with the West End
Presbyterian Church on 105th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In
exchange for playing at church services once in a while, Pfannkuch,
a classical trombonist, practices in the sanctuary or the choir
room almost every day, sometimes with his Meridian Brass Quintet.
``I can play loud, which is something you have to do once in a
while,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church has a bonus feature: remarkable acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Katz's boat reminded Rod Baltimore, an old-timer in the music
world who owns International Woodwinds and Brass on 48th Street, of
practicing hi-jinks that crossed the line to criminal trespassing.
Two musicians, a clarinetist and a saxophonist, once unmoored a
construction barge under the George Washington Bridge and went
floating down the Hudson, playing away, Baltimore said. ``Before
they got killed, the Coast Guard had to rescue them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another clarinetist, Baltimore remembered, took a rowboat to the
middle of the Central Park Reservoir to practice late one night.
Some weeks later, walking through the park, the man was chased by
the mounted police, who asked him if he had been the culprit. ``He
said, `No, I don't even swim. I'm afraid of rowboats.'''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore himself used to break into the basement pool of the
Paris Hotel on West 97th Street, which used to close at 10 p.m.
``Nobody ever came down there, and we never got caught,'' he said.
``Then we'd go swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most legendary example of resourceful practicing is
Sonny Rollins' tenor sax sessions on the Williamsburg Bridge, atop
a pedestrian walkway out of view of the cars. In 1959, at an early
peak in his fame, Rollins abruptly stopped playing public concerts
so he could ``get something under my fingers,'' Rollins, 69, said
by phone from Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He played al fresco on the bridge, warmed by Cognac in cold
weather, because he did not want to disturb the neighbors in his
apartment building on Grand Street. And he liked the anonymity.
``People would walk right by and they didn't hardly look at me,''
he said. ``You know how sophisticated New Yorkers are. It was
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also inspiring. In 1962, Rollins released an album called
``The Bridge,'' and the romantic notion of a celebrated musician
practicing, unrecognized, became the stuff of articles, short
stories and documentary films.
</P>
<P>
   But some practice solutions are born of desperation, not
inspiration. For those without a church or a boat at their
disposal, standing with one's face buried in the coat closet can
become tiresome. Susan Stoderl, 48, said she and her husband, both
opera singers, had dealt with the problem for a combined 79 years,
hanging tapestries in their bathroom to muffle the sound or singing
in the car. But then they found their savior: a deaf landlady.
</P>
<P>
   ``A singer told me about the apartment,'' said Stoderl, who is
co-director of a small company called Opera Nova and who moved in
above the landlady in Astoria, Queens, nine years ago. ``I've had
full-scale opera rehearsals there.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When she does have her hearing aid in,'' Stoderl said of the
apartment's owner, ``she's just happy to have a good tenant.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians who can afford it have chosen a more high-tech route.
Kamau Adilifu, a trumpeter who has played in ``The Wild Party,''
``Guys and Dolls'' and other Broadway hits, has outfitted his Upper
West Side high-rise apartment with a $3,000 soundproof glass booth
called the Whisper Room.
</P>
<P>
   Barely big enough for a chair and music stand, it looks like a
small radio station booth. When he's inside playing, it's
impossible to hear more than a faint melody.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was a priority for him not to bother his neighbors or
his wife. ``I've always been very self-conscious about playing the
trumpet,'' Adilifu said softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of what I practice, it's not necessarily musical. It's
the physical aspects of playing trumpet.''
</P>
<P>
   Adilifu said he bought the Whisper Room because he liked to
practice at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the muse struck me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Whisper Room, Adilifu has a newer gadget,
Silent Brass, that fits into the bell of his horn, silencing it and
channeling the sound into headphones. It can alter the music to
make it sound as if it's being played in a church or a concert
hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freedom that it gives me more than compensates for what it
lacks in realism,'' Adilifu said. But it doesn't work for every
kind of instrument; saxophones, for example, emit sounds through
the finger holes, not just the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the stairwell at Smalls, as the musicians discussed
whether to have a drink or a jam session, a few pointed out that
someone who really wanted to practice would find a way.
</P>
<P>
   But most reminisced about the good old days, when downtown lofts
came without plumbing, but also without neighbors, and no one had
ever heard of a noise ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Borden seemed of the opinion that even the music, back then, was
better.
</P>
<P>
   His theory: ``There's gotta be a reason why there's such a big
rift between good music and music that's considered good now. Maybe
that's it. There's no place to practice.''

 &HT;    Parents exonerated in child's death
 &HT;    By Zack Barnett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ The parents of a two-day old baby who
died last month in Clifton trailer park will not face criminal
charges for relying on prayer instead of doctors to treat their
ailing son, Mesa County's chief prosecutor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Billy and Barbara Reed ``clearly wanted to do the best for their
child,'' Mesa County District Attorney Frank Daniels wrote in a
statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Reeds' son, Billy Ray Reed Jr., died the evening of July 9
because a thumb tack-sized hole in his heart prevented him from
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's parents belong to the General Assembly and Church of
the Firstborn, a congregation that prefers faith healing to modern
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Church members Joshua and Mindy Glory were sentenced in February
to 16 years for probation for not seeking medical care while their
infant died of pneumonia that advanced to bacterial meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said last week they would not prosecute another
member of the church whose baby died during birth.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa County Coroner Dr. Rob Kurtzman said earlier this month
that Billy and Barbara Reed may not have known their son was dying
when they summoned church elders to pray for him. After reading
police reports and interviewing Barbara Reed, Kurtzman ruled Billy
Ray's manner of death was undetermined, rather than homicide.

<P>
   Several hours before Billy Ray died, he started to turn blue and
have trouble breathing but his condition seemed to improve when the
church members prayed for him, Kurtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtzman said the baby's condition, which rarely results in
death, probably would have been recognized and treated by a
physician during a routine examination.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado law allows parents to practice faith healing and
requires them to seek a doctor's help only when their children are
in life-threatening situations or ones that will leave them with
serious disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtzman and Daniels said the Reeds may not have recognized the
urgency of their son's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels called Colorado laws ``cumbersome'' and ``unwieldy''
before saying they were ``seriously flawed and should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said he is not lobbying to limit religious freedoms. He
said people should always have a right to pray for sick people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the use of prayer to the absolute exclusion of medical
care is a remnant of the Dark Ages,'' Daniels wrote. ``This
practice endangers children.''

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ In frantic efforts against
increasingly hopeless odds to save the crew of the sunken nuclear
submarine Kursk, Russian rescue teams tried and failed through
another stormy night and throughout Thursday to lock onto a rear
escape hatch of the shattered vessel. New reports emerged of
catastrophic damage to the hull, suggesting the ship went down in a
torrent of fire and flooding that may have killed or mortally
wounded everyone aboard. The growing prospect that the crew may be
beyond rescue, making the sinking of the Kursk Russia's worst
peacetime naval disaster, generated a wave of recriminations
through the Russian news media, much of it aimed at the military,
but also at the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who remained
on vacation at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. By Patrick E. Tyler.

rejected as baseless the argument by defense lawyers in a trial

code essentially is exempt from government regulation. ``Computer

Robert W. Lee, who founded the IBF as an alternative to sanctioning

TWEED: THE SPORTY SIDE OF DRESSING UP (WITH PHOTOS)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
(UNDATED) Anyone who has ever puzzled over the weird and often
wacky world of fashion knows one of designers' most important
techniques lies in exploiting incongruities.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most creative combine the high with the low, softly feminine
elements with something roughshod, light with heavy, glitter with
matte or brassy with beguiling. For fall and winter 2000, designers
hit on perhaps the perfect odd coupling, that of ladylike,
glamorous styles with the lowly born fabric known as tweed.
</P>
<P>
   This rough and nubby fabric, named for the Tweed River in
Scotland, is usually made of a very coarse wool, dyed in its yarn
stage, so that two or more colors are woven together to create a
pebble effect.
</P>
<P>
   Television golf fans will recognize tweed plus fours, warm and
weather-resistant, as the traditional attire for men at St.
Andrews. But tweeds also became a standby for women.
</P>
<P>
   In the British Isles, a tweed skirt worn with a cashmere or
thick woolen sweater and sturdy shoes eventually became the
benchmark for upper-crust women's outdoor dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet tweed was not anointed by high-fashion women's wear
designers until the post-World War II 1940s, when it appeared in
shapely peplum suits with Paris labels. Now these suits have been
resurrected with some modern touches.
</P>
<P>
   Tweed, which can be woven in plaid, check or herringbone
patterns, also comes in varying weights, allowing a range of
garments from thick coats to pliable dresses. Today manufacturers
also combine other fibers with wool to achieve lighter-weight and
even stretch fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors is among designers again raising tweed to
near-couture status, adding feather collars, tossing on pearl and
diamond accessories, fur flings and outfitting tweed-suited models
in high-heeled pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``At market, we saw a lot of menswear-inspired tweed nipped in
at the waist and very slim,'' said Erin Carmack, director of
fashion presentation for Neiman Marcus. ``You can tailor it, and
it's a very crisp, polished and put-together look.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaqui Lividini, senior vice president of fashion merchandising
and communications for Saks Fifth Avenue, lists a fitted tweed suit
among fall must-haves for the fashion crowd. ``Now tweed looks
young and sexy and very sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not at all the styles one would expect to see on the
back nine at St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   This season's tweeds are often updated with leather trims _
either piping or strip _ edging or bisecting jackets and skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Cari Kerns, buyer for Leonard Rutan, believes her clients will
go for tweeds because they are something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our customers have their basics, like the little black
dress. Now they want something else.''
</P>
<P>
   With a buttoned-up jacket, a tweed suit can be very elegant, but
a tweed skirt or pants worn simply with a silk blouse can go from
the office to dinner. And with this season's return of blouses,
expect to see that look a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a tweed skirt or pants to a wardrobe will also allow an
easy way to update last season's sweater sets.
</P>
<P>
   While many people think of tweed only in its rusty brown,
oatmeal, camel and black-and-white forms, today tweeds appear in
permutations from loden green to hot pink to baby blue.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories include quality leathers and skins, such as ostrich
or alligator, fur and feathers, and fabrics from velvet to
pleather.
</P>
<P>
   But one should not overlook the fun of wearing rhinestones, or
even diamonds, with tweed. Viva the incongruities!

ALBUQUERQUE BALLOON FEST GIVES THE SPIRIT A LIFT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KATHRYN HOPPER 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Traveling down Interstate 25 just before
dawn, we spotted what looked like giant lightning bugs hovering
over the New Mexico desert.
</P>
<P>
   I nudged my 3-year-old son, Henry, to look up from his Pop-Tart.
We drove closer to the glowing orbs, which were not errant UFOs up
from Roswell, but simply a few early-risers at the Kodak
Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, the annual nine-day
extravaganza billed as the world's largest balloon event.
</P>
<P>
   I was desperately trying to get to the Fiesta grounds for the
daily mass ascension at 7 a.m., when hundreds of balloons in all
shapes and sizes lift off at dawn. But even though we had left
Santa Fe at 4:30 a.m., we were cutting it close; traffic was backed
up the last mile going into the parking lot of Balloon Fiesta Park.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the million spectators who come to watch the hundreds of
balloons at this famous festival plan their trip months, even a
year, in advance. We were winging it.
</P>
<P>
   But with a little patience _ and luck _ we found that it's
possible to see Fiesta with only a minimum of planning. (This
year's Fiesta is barely six weeks away, scheduled for Oct. 7-15.)
The caveats: Be prepared to find hotels outside Albuquerque _ Santa
Fe, in our case _ and to spend extra time looking for flights and
rental cars, or to make the 10-hour drive from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, luck was with us when I found a cheap flight and a
not-so-cheap rental car at pretty much the last minute. And it was
with us again when a wind delay pushed that day's ascension back an
hour. We had plenty of time to park, grab a breakfast burrito and
stake out a viewing spot.
</P>
<P>
   I'd expected to watch the liftoff from a distance, but we were
soon standing in the midst of hundreds of uninflated balloon
envelopes, their gondolas and eager crews.
</P>
<P>
   Henry and other kids ran around, poking the balloons as fans
filled with them with air. Then hot burners heated the air,
breathing the balloons to life. As the balloons loomed larger, the
kids grew less bold, slinking away in awe. In only a few minutes,
the colorful balloons were fully inflated and sent into the sky,
row by row, by event officials.
</P>
<P>
   The balloons came in all shapes and sizes, and we had fun
picking out our favorites. Henry liked the one shaped like a cow. I
liked the alien face, with its big eyes and tiny mouth. There was
also a huge chile ristra, a frog, a grocery bag and a tequila
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   They slowly floated south, gradually gaining altitude. As they
rose, they hit another wind current, which drove them back north,
allowing the balloons to circle the grounds. The weather pattern,
created by the Sandia Mountains, is dubbed the ``Albuquerque Box''
and is responsible for making the area one of the best ballooning
sites in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As I clicked away with my camera, amazed by the spectacle, Henry
grew bored and started playing in the sand. We ambled over to the
special kids' area where Henry frolicked inside a half-filled
balloon and bounded around a bouncy house. By noon, we were ready
to head back to Santa Fe and an afternoon nap.
</P>
<P>
   When we'd first decided to travel to northern New Mexico about a
month before the early October event, I'd mistakenly figured it was
the off-season. The first tipoff I got that this wasn't the case
was when I tried to rent a car and found out Dodge Neons were going
for $60 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The rental agent told me I was lucky to get a car at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Balloon Fiesta,'' she said. ``Everything in town is
booked.''
</P>
<P>
   Grateful for the opportunity at the Neon, I went ahead with the
rest of my planning. By some weird quirk of airline scheduling, I
snared a $170 round-trip ticket on United through Denver.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in Santa Fe, about an hour north of Albuquerque, where
we had little trouble booking at room at the Fort Marcy complex
just north of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   I had not intended to go to Balloon Fiesta, planning on sticking
to Santa Fe and Taos, but I got wrapped up in the round-the-clock
television coverage of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Local stations pre-empt network programming to cover events such
as the key ring grab, when balloonists compete to pick off a set of
keys hanging on a telephone pole. The winner gets to keep the keys
and a new Ford truck that goes with them. There are also ``balloon
glows,'' nighttime spectacles where balloonists synchronize their
burners in elaborate light shows set to music.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of watching it on television, I decided to see it
firsthand. Once there, I realized what a big deal the Fiesta really
is. The natives stage elaborate tailgate parties around the mass
ascensions and have lively debates about the best viewing sites.
(Tempting though it may be to pull over right on the side of
Interstate 25, which passes by the Fiesta grounds, don't do it;
signs are posted warning drivers not to do so.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's Fiesta, the 29th, promises to be bigger than ever,
with 1,000 hot-air and gas-filled balloons and crews from 27
countries participating. There's also a new event called the New
Mexico Challenge Long Distance Hot Air Balloon Race, which will
feature 40 balloon teams attempting to fly the farthest distance
from Fiesta Park.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether you plan the trip a year in advance or just go
on the spur of the moment, going to Balloon Fiesta is a truly
uplifting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hard time explaining the event to people who have
never been here,'' says Susan Wilson, who handles public relations
for the Fiesta. ``Seeing so many balloons at close range lift off
at sunrise. It's surreal.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If you go:
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Kodak Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta is Oct. 7-15.
</P>
<P>
   General-admission tickets are $4, and are well worth it to get
the intimate vantage point. For an even closer look, spectators can
become participants by paying $175 and up to ride inside a balloon
during an ascension offered by Rainbow Ryders.

GODZILLA SAVES WORLD (AND FILM) WITH STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most American viewers, the Japanese Toho Godzilla films will
never be more than exercises in camp. In this age of
computer-generated images, who's going to take a man in a rubber
suit stomping on toy trucks and miniature cities seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's the only thing audiences will embrace in
``Godzilla 2000.'' The final third is a giant monster version of a
World Wrestling Federation match between the Big G (looking more
fierce and royal than ever) and an alien upstart (something between
a skyscraper-size ``Predator'' and Jabba the Hutt's dungeon ogre
from ``Return of the Jedi''), with the pug ugly alien mutating on
the move.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch of lovingly detailed buildings rendered to splinters
in a single step, the rubble and dust left in the wake of a
prehistoric body slam, the noble profile of the scaly gray one in
action. It's a juvenile thrill that a CGI can't touch.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of ``Godzilla 2000'' isn't going to change anyone's
mind about Japan's favorite atomic lizard. Godzilla is on the move
again (didn't he die last time out? oh, never mind) just as an
ancient UFO is dredged up from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   In a fitting bit of turnabout, the script appropriates Roland
Emmerich's ``Independence Day,'' though on a significantly smaller
scale. This lone silver spaceship parks on a Shinjuku skyscraper,
drains the city of all computer information and turns himself into
a mutant monster.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an all-volunteer force of science nerds called the
Godzilla Prediction Network, run by peacenik professor Yuji
(Takehiro Murata) and his precocious adolescent daughter, clashes
with their arch rivals, the Crisis Control Institute, a government
strike force armed to destroy Godzilla run by Yuji's bloodthirsty
nemesis Katagiri (Hiroshi Abe, whose eyes bug out in glee every
time he launches a missile).
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonish English dubbing dumbs down an already painful script
and slipshod special effects run through the film. It had a preview
audience almost in stitches until the finale, a grand roar of old
time glories but hardly enough to justify sitting through a film
that seems destined for kiddie matinees.
</P>
<P>
   Its one saving grace is Godzilla himself, the James Bond of
giant monsters. Screaming his roar while stomping through modern
cities like some avenging force of nature, this isn't Emmerich's
post-``Jurassic Park'' garden variety dinosaur of the blandly
Americanized 1998 ``Godzilla,'' but a lizard king with dignity,
stature and personality. He deserves better than this overripe
afterthought.

SMILING THROUGH THE MIST AT LIFE'S DELIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's difficult to think of any city, other than the
urban behemoths like New York and Los Angeles, and maybe
Washington, that has shaped modern living in the United States as
much as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom, Boeing, Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon: all innovators,
all based here in the Pacific Northwest, off in a remote corner of
the nation, far from the main centers of population. Yet they play
a central part in daily life across this continent and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's man of the millennium, of course, is Bill Gates, who
created the corporate principality named Microsoft, making powerful
enemies in Washington, D.C., along the way. His company, housed in
40-odd X-shaped buildings on a 30-acre campus in suburban Redmond,
was for a time the most valuable in America, and Gates still
commands one of the greatest fortunes in history.
</P>
<P>
   The nerd-in-chief and his wife, Melinda, live in a $100 million
giga-mansion with a rather wistful quotation from ``The Great
Gatsby'' inscribed on the ceiling of the library: ``He had come a
long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close
that he could hardly fail to grasp it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle still has its funky side. It revels in its mellow
small-town atmosphere; a Seattle ad man popularized the ``happy
face.'' But it has become an unmistakably rich, high-tech,
high-rise, high-expectation metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Paul Schell, the mayor, what he's up to, and he will tell
you:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to manage the transition from regional center to
major international city without losing the core values of the
place in the process. We're eight and one-half hours from Tokyo and
eight and one-half hours from London; a basically conservative
city; a collection of small communities, now overlaid with 110
languages and living at the epicenter of technological change. It's
not an easy job.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle makes room for creators. It takes pride in its part in
the careers of Quincy Jones, Ray Charles, Kurt Cobain and Jimi
Hendrix and waxes nostalgic about Pearl Jam. August Wilson, the
playwright, lives close by at Enumclaw. Raymond Carver, the writer,
lived out the last years of his short, hard life at Port Angeles on
the Olympic Peninsula, just across Puget Sound, crafting terse,
claustrophobic short stories at the edge of the forest primeval.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Larson draws here, and the mystic Mark Tobey painted here.
So did the Harlem Renaissance master Jacob Lawrence, who died this
summer. Dale Chihuly, the flamboyant one-eyed glass sculptor,
produces his extravagantly vivid showpieces, which have been
displayed everywhere from Las Vegas to Venice to Jerusalem, in a
workshop on Lake Union where George Y. Pocock once built the
world's finest racing shells.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle always reminds me and my wife, Betsey, of San Francisco.
It belongs to the sea; around every corner there is a view of the
water. Its streets and its skyscrapers cling to hillsides. It has
more than a whiff of the Orient about it, and it is obsessed by
food, wine and restaurants. I know a Seattle native living in exile
in Washington, D.C., who has a whole Pacific salmon air-freighted
to him when he and his wife give a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle is different. It is less full of itself than its
rival down the coast. Less cynical, too. Young families and the
middle class here have resisted the stampede to the suburbs. People
worry that they'll be spoiled by success, yes. They worry that they
will have to wear neckties. But on balance they are optimistic,
even about the weather, smiling through the mist; it is all that
water, after all, that turns buddleias from butterfly bushes into
20-foot butterfly trees and brings out the flashing crimsons of the
fuchsias.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, a culture of self-effacement prevails in
the city. There are techno-millionaires here, geeks worth 20 times
as much as New Yorkers with chauffeurs, who wear sandals and ride
the bus to work. Everyone is cheerful, pleasant, upbeat, from the
bank presidents to the bellhops. And everyone is pathologically
polite; people would rather die than honk, no matter how maniacal
the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets on your nerves,'' said Michael Kinsley, himself a
manifestly mannerly gent, who came west four years back to edit
Microsoft's online magazine, Slate. ``You keep wondering if you can
live up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wild and Urban
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a hundred years and more to fully hit its stride,
but almost from the start it has been an unusual blend of wild and
urban.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1851 on a series of waterside hills then clad with
magnificent Douglas firs, it always had those noble vistas of the
Cascades and the Olympic Mountains, when weather permitted (as it
often didn't and doesn't, especially before the fog lifts at noon).
It always had Lake Washington and Lake Union, Elliott Bay and Puget
Sound, inhabited by salmon and giant octopuses with arms 15 feet
long, crossed these days by floating bridges, steel-arch spans and
ferries. By 1900 timber and trade with Asia as well as the
financial backwash from the Klondike gold rush of 1897-98 had put
big bucks in local pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, visitors from more cosmopolitan cities weren't much
impressed. Several decades ago Sir Thomas Beecham, the conductor,
who waggled his baton for a few seasons in these parts, called
Seattle ``an aesthetic dustbin.'' His countryman Alistair Cooke
called it ``a rain-soaked fishing village halfway between San
Francisco and Alaska.'' But that was before the World's Fair of
1962, with its monorail and its Space Needle (recently given a $20
million face-lift), and the 35-year population explosion that
followed it.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Pike Place Market, the zesty souk on the waterfront _ my
colleague Timothy Egan once described it as ``the Marrakesh of the
Northwest'' _ was saved from the wrecker's ball during the Vietnam
era. It has lived on as the heart and soul of the city, notable
alike for the goofy exuberance of its merchants and the quality of
its fare: Dungeness crab and Olympia oysters, pale pink stargazer
lilies and beaming yellow sunflowers, Rainier cherries and Walla
Walla onions. It is the outstanding public market in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As the country rediscovered the outdoors, it discovered Seattle,
a city whose residents can sail among the orca whales in the San
Juan Islands, with bald eagles cruising overhead, and climb
snow-capped Mount Rainier in the same week. With its mild if
legendarily rainy climate, the place was made, positively made, for
skiing, cycling, running, rowing, sailing, hydroplane racing and a
dozen other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the Eddie Bauer store here, originally an outfitter
for mountaineers, grew into a national sporting-goods powerhouse.
Seattle's Recreational Equipment flagship superstore, a co-op to
which almost one of three people in the region belong, has a
65-foot indoor artificial pinnacle where young studs practice rock
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   A Building Boom
</P>
<P>
   By 1975 Seattle was in fashion. The Seattle Opera produced
Wagner's ``Ring'' that summer _ the first time the cycle had ever
been produced within a week's time, as originally prescribed by the
Wagner family, anywhere in the United States aside from the
Metropolitan Opera in New York. New York took notice, as did London
and Bayreuth.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 15 years, a half-dozen books and magazines,
including Harper's and Money, rated Seattle as the nation's most
livable city. It got a snazzy new art museum, cunningly slotted
into the urban streetscape downtown by Robert Venturi in 1991, and
a heralded new home for the Seattle Symphony, Benaroya Hall, opened
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A new park for the Seattle Mariners, Safeco Field, was unveiled
last year to replace the unloved Kingdome, demolished in a mere
16.8 seconds on March 26, 1999, known locally as ``Dome's Day.''
The new ballpark, with a retractable roof, cost $517 million,
financed mostly by local taxes, making it the most costly sports
center in the country. The edge was taken off the celebration when
the team announced that it was trading its star, Ken Griffey Jr.,
arguably the best all-rounder in baseball, to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   A $250 million rock 'n' roll museum, known as the Experience
Music Project, opened just this summer. Designed by Frank O. Gehry,
it houses 80,000 artifacts inside an aggressively billowing
aluminum and stainless-steel shell decked out in gold, silver, red,
powder blue and iridescent purple. The initial reviews have been
decidedly mixed. The tickets cost too much ($19.95 each), the
complicated electronic gadgets meant to guide the visitor around
too often don't work and as Susan Nielsen, a Seattle Times
columnist, wrote recently, ``The whole inside of the building is
like a guy trying so hard to be hip that the muscles stand out on
his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the building boom rolls on, powered by the city's
cyber-riche. A new public library is planned, designed by no less
than Rem Koolhaas, the celebrated Dutch master; and Terry Farrell,
the British postmodernist, is working on a new aquarium. The Opera
House is soon to be rebuilt, in part with money from the McCaw
family, pioneers of the mobile telephone. Also on the way are an
elaborate new civic center and a grand new football stadium,
financed, like the rock museum, by Paul G. Allen, Gates' partner in
founding Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Old Guard Feels Ruffled
</P>
<P>
   All this activity unsettles the old guard, which is attached to
the city's comfy old Beaux-Arts look, typified by the terra-cotta
walrus heads that decorate the Arctic Building on Third Avenue. A
sleek new hotel, W, prompted the locals to ask, ``It's nice, but is
it really Seattle?'' People have the same doubts about the Venturi
and Gehry buildings. Phyllis Hayes, whose family has deep local
roots, summed up the attitude this way: ``Wonderful things are
happening, but they're happening too fast, and they cost so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell says it builds character. ``I want people's teeth to
chatter,'' he told me over a scotch and water. ``Change has no
constituency, or not a big one, but here of all places it would be
crazy to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things that are happening are not at all wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Employment is down at Boeing, the nation's largest manufacturer
and largest exporter. The e-business slump has the people over at
HomeGrocer.com and Drugstore.com worried, and Microsoft stock, the
foundation of thousands of local fortunes, has taken a dive in
response to the Clinton administration's successful antitrust suit.
With the population of the metropolitan area approaching 2.5
million, growth has slowed, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   But angst is not at all Seattle's style. The city is still
thinking big; the least appealing suite in a new apartment complex
in Kirkland, not far from the Microsoft campus, is currently on the
market for $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle earned a reputation early on for radicalism. Anna Louise
Strong, a charismatic Marxist, sat on the school board, and the
Industrial Workers of the World, a pioneering hard-left union known
as the Wobblies, flourished here. The city was idled in 1919 by the
nation's only general strike. Communists led a maritime strike in
1934.
</P>
<P>
   That feisty spirit may be bubbling back to the surface as the
gap between have and have-not widens again. At least that is one
widespread interpretation of the protests last December at the
World Trade Organization's conference here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Seattle has always been marked by a
certain emotional reticence, perhaps a legacy from its early
Scandinavian settlers. Walt Crowley, a historian who runs a
crackerjack local Web site (historylink.org), talks of this as ``a
city with a split personality, a yin side and a yang side.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of its most noted politicians, both Democrats, both
senators, exemplified the split. Henry M. Jackson, ``the senator
from Boeing,'' concentrated on national security issues;
personally, he was understated, a paragon of probity. Warren G.
Magnuson, a prime mover on civil rights, environmental law and
consumer protection, was much more rambunctious, a man who liked a
drink or two.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee, Coffee Everywhere
</P>
<P>
   The dark, rainy days of winter may have something to do with
Seattle's love of books. The city is notable for its bookstores,
from the encyclopedic Elliott Bay Book Co. to specialists like the
Peter Miller shop, which sells architecture books. The climate has
also contributed to the city's movie mania, satisfied at theaters
like the Harvard Exit and the Egyptian.
</P>
<P>
   I would wager that the same thing is true of Seattle's passion
for coffee, which added words like latte and dopio to the American
language through the unstoppable growth of Starbucks. The name, by
the way, comes from that of the java-loving mate in ``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle must have a thousand cafes of one kind or another _
places to grab a quick cuppa, places like Le Pichet that serve
simple meals, breakfast cafes like Bacco that serve nine-grain
toast and juice bombs (an orange, pear and pineapple blend, for
example, called Pegasus). It has a pair of Thriftway supermarkets
that stage an annual Peach-O-Rama, featuring pallet-loads of
perfect fruit that has reached a prescribed, scientifically
measured level of sweetness. It has shops specializing in
espresso-machine repair.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems in this food paradise. Jon Rowley, who
introduced the ambrosial Copper River salmon from Alaska to the
lower 48, said that the black cod, which he calls ``one of the real
aristocrats of the ocean,'' has all but disappeared from local
waters. You can still see the elegant, silvery salmon swimming up
the fish ladder at Ballard Locks, bound with fixated stares in
their eyes for the fresh water where they spawn and die, but the
seasonal runs are smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the berries from the San Juan Islands remain the sweetest
I know. Sol Amon of the Pure Food Fish Market can still explain the
availability of razor clams, which depends on the tidal cycle. Sur
la Table has enough pots and pans and gadgets to cook a state
dinner. Jerry Traunfeld of the Herbfarm restaurant may know more
about cooking with herbs than anyone anywhere. And where else would
you find a hidden private dining room for four like the one at
Canlis, a treehouse for pampered grown-ups, just next to a towering
hillside pine?
</P>
<P>
   Fare for Inner Lives
</P>
<P>
   Seattle offers ample nourishment for the soul as well as the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Art Museum, whose dramatic main staircase is a
late-20th-century version of the Louvre's, houses a few choice old
masters, including a Paolo Uccello illustrating episodes from the
``Aeneid,'' and rich holdings of African tribal art and Northwest
Coast Native American art. It has a fine Asian collection, housed
in a classic Art Deco building in Volunteer Park.
</P>
<P>
   One day it will have much more. More than $250 million was
reportedly spent on art by area collectors last year, and the
museum hopes to be given part of the splendid Barney A. Ebsworth
collection of modern American art that it has been showing lately.
That collection includes Edward Hopper's melancholy masterpiece
``Chop Suey'' (hung here near David Hockney's chillingly formal
double portrait of Henry Geldzahler and Christopher Scott).
Ebsworth is from St. Louis, his wife from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Symphony is shooting for the top echelon in its new
hall, which is adorned with a pair of arresting white clusters by
Chihuly and other works by Mark di Suvero and Robert Rauschenberg.
Under the accomplished and intense Gerard Schwarz, its music
director since 1985 (and the music director of New York's annual
Mostly Mozart Festival since 1982), it gave a performance last year
of Deems Taylor's neglected opera ``Peter Ibbetson.'' This year it
will play with such guest conductors as Claus Peter Flor and
Richard Hickox and such soloists as Radu Lupu, Maxim Vengerov and
Renee Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   Though somewhat less well known, the Pacific Northwest Ballet,
led by Francia Russell and Kent Stowell, former dancers with the
New York City Ballet, has won acclaim in recent years for its
staging of works by George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is awash in theater of every description. The Intiman
Theater staged ``The Kentucky Cycle'' by Robert Schenkkan in 1991;
the play won a Pulitzer Prize in 1992, before it opened in New
York. The Seattle Repertory Theater has a long-standing
relationship with Wendy Wasserstein dating from the days when it
was run by the director Dan Sullivan. And ACT _ the letters stand
for A Contemporary Theater _ is soon to present a new Philip Glass
opera, ``In the Penal Colony,'' based on a Kafka story, with sets
by John Conklin.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three has a budget exceeding $3 million a year, and
each has more than 10,000 subscribers _ remarkable numbers for a
city this size. Wagner, Environmentally
</P>
<P>
   But opera is easily the city's cultural long suit, thanks to
Glynn Ross, who brought Wagner to the region, and Speight Jenkins,
his successor at the Seattle Opera.
</P>
<P>
   A lean, fervent man, once a New York reporter and critic,
Jenkins has been at the helm here for 17 years. Next year, three
``Ring'' cycles will be presented in a new production directed by
Stephen Wadsworth, with more than a little kibbitzing from Jenkins.
Jane Eaglen, now established as the premier Wagnerian soprano of
her day, will sing Brunnhilde; she has been a Seattle darling since
making her American debut here in ``Norma'' in 1994. In 1998 she
teamed with Ben Heppner in a rapturously received ``Tristan und
Isolde.''
</P>
<P>
   The new $10 million ``Ring'' sold out more than a year in
advance to Wagnerians all over the world. Why Seattle? Earlier
Jenkins efforts were sometimes booed, even pelted with fruit, but
they came to be seen as classics. He pushed the company deep into
the red but lifted it back out again. ``We became the thing in
town,'' he said, ``and then people from elsewhere came here out of
curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, he promised a ``green `Ring,''' and the
``Rheingold,'' which made its bow this season, emphasized Wagner's
preoccupation with the natural world of forests, mountains and
rivers, inhabited by mythic gods and goddesses _ not inappropriate,
given the passionate environmentalism of the Puget Sound audience.
It was all totally unlike Bayreuth's new production, where Valhalla
is depicted as a high rise under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use technology to maximum effect,'' Jenkins vowed,
``but this will be a traditional `Ring,' and it will above all be
an acted `Ring' _ a theater piece. Everyone will act. No more of
this standing around singing.''

<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel
information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   ALEXIS, 1007 First Ave., (206) 624-4844. A graceful, century-old
109-room classic, this is a member of the boutique chain assembled
by the California hotelier Bill Kimpton. The public spaces are
filled with the work of regional artists (including several vibrant
Dale Chihuly glass sculptures), and the bright bedrooms are
decorated with cheerful, traditional fabrics. No view, but you
waken to the sound of sea gulls and foghorns. Terrific Aveda spa.
Double rooms from $230.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS OLYMPIC, 411 University St., (206) 621-1700. Grand
with a capital G: a lobby straight from a Renaissance palace, a
blossom-filled garden court, a shopping arcade where you can buy a
ball gown or an antique candelabrum, and a windowed rooftop pool.
This is a dowager, built in the 1920s, but very well preserved.
Even the smaller rooms have duvets and luxurious bathrooms. Do you
need a notary public, a shoe shine or maybe a car wash? Just ask.
Double rooms from $230.
</P>
<P>
   INN AT THE MARKET, 86 Pine St., (206) 443-3600. Lean,
understated, enlivened with touches of Asia and Provence, this is a
discreetly distinguished little hotel _ especially if you can snag
a room like 514, a suite that looks down on the Pike Place Market
and beyond to Elliott Bay and the peaks of the Olympic Peninsula.
Fax machines, kitchenettes and even orchids in the bedrooms. Betsey
and I wish there were one of these in every city we visit. Double
rooms from $170.
</P>
<P>
   W, 1112 Fourth Ave., (206) 264-6000. Hard-edged, high-tech
decor, soft-edged service from a black-clad staff _ an apt
combination for Seattle. The lobby is small, crowded and noisy, but
the 428 guest rooms are quiet and comfortable, with 250-count
sheets and CD libraries. The restaurant, Earth &AMP; Ocean, is the
latest brainstorm of the mini-mogul Drew Nieporent. But the coveted
silver ``W'' yo-yo's are available only through the catalog. Double
rooms from $239.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAGNE, 86 Pine St., (206) 728-2800. Peter Lewis, a model of
warmth and charm, offers deeply satisfying French food, steering a
course north of bistro banality and south of nouvelle nonsense. One
night recently, my tart of crunchy, slightly sour chard made an
ideal introduction to a dish of unctuous braised pork cheeks.
Betsey's seafood boudin, though lighter, was no less tasty. The
wines, mostly French, are carefully chosen and gently priced.
</P>
<P>
   CANLIS, 2576 Aurora Ave., (206) 283-3313. Fifty years old this
year, a classic room in stone and redwood cantilevered over Lake
Union, Canlis has been revitalized by a new chef, Greg Atkinson. He
has nudged the menu toward seasonal and regional authenticity with
lime-seasoned raw Alaskan scallops and Frog Hollow Farm peaches,
while keeping the succulent steaks and chops that made the house's
name. The service is silky, the wine list the area's best.
</P>
<P>
   DAHLIA LOUNGE, 2001 Fourth Ave., (206) 682-4142. Tom Douglas is
Seattle's premier restaurateur, and this is his premier restaurant.
Japanese lanterns, red walls and music from the 1930s, '40s and
'50s cast a casual glow over the delicious Asian-accented food. Six
little fishy bites (for example, albacore with ponzu sauce) come
nestled in ice; a slab of grilled Alaska king salmon rests on a
chowder of tart sorrel leaves and sweet corn. Coconut cream pie
with fresh coconut for dessert. No wonder they shot a scene for
``Sleepless in Seattle'' here a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   HERBFARM, 195 Northeast Gilman Blvd., Issaquah, (206) 784-2222.
Dinner here is a major production _ nine courses, six wines, five
hours, $150 a head. But it's worth all that, and the half-hour
drive east of downtown, to experience the food of Jerry Traunfeld,
a culinary wizard who flavors duck with lavender and wild
blueberries, slow-roasts salmon in a giant zucchini blossom, and
pairs melon soup with tarragon ice. The results are absolutely
thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   RAY'S BOATHOUSE, 6049 Seaview Ave. N.W., (206) 789-3770. Ray's
seafood is never less than impeccably fresh and soundly cooked, and
on a fine summer's day what could be more enthralling than sitting
on the deck, watching boats cross the sound, with a breeze mussing
your hair? Manila clams steamed with beer, dill and butter, and
sesame-crusted halibut with sticky rice make a dandy lunch, and
there are 177 white wines to choose from. I counted.
</P>
<P>
   SAZERAC, 1101 Fourth Ave., (206) 624-7755. Sick of salmon? Had
it with halibut? Jan Birnbaum, the Louisiana-born owner of
Catahoula in the Napa Valley, has established a lively Seattle
beachhead for the cooking of the Southeast (pork barbecue),
Southwest (crab and rock shrimp enchiladas) and Cajun country
(crawfish beignets). His chicken and andouille gumbo is dense and
dark, full of okra, fire and file. Open all day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   SHIRO, 2401 Second Ave., (206) 443-9844. This is the Plain Jane
among Seattle's top restaurants, a starkly simple little place with
plastic chairs and paper napkins. No matter; the sushi is superb.
We especially liked the shiro roll, made with mackerel, shiso and
ginger, and sea urchin roe (uni), so soft and creamy it barely
clung to the rice. Wasabi is hand ground here.
</P>
<P>
   WILD GINGER, 1401 Third Ave., (206) 623-4450. Another of
Seattle's favorites, Rick Yoder's pan-Asian brasserie moved this
summer into handsome new multimillion-dollar quarters across the
street from Benaroya Hall. It was jammed from the moment the doors
opened. Japanese screens, origami lampshades and rattan chairs set
just the right tone for a wide variety of satays, each served with
a different sauce, and for authentic Thai and Malay curries. The
baby boy choi is to die for.

   Getting By Air There From The New York Area
</P>

 BOSTON SCI'S NEW CHIEF HAS A FREE HAND TO MAKE CHANGES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 14 months since Jim Tobin became chief executive of
Boston Scientific, succeeding founder chairman Peter Nicholas, he
dismissed 1,900 people, closed manufacturing operations in three
states, and watched sales decline while the stock lost two-thirds
of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas's reaction: ``I wished I hired him earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   His confidence in the 56-year-old Tobin stems from a deep trust
the two men have developed in each other as they attempt to turn
Boston Scientific around. For Tobin, that assurance _ and the free
hand he's been given by Nicholas _ is a stark change from the four
years he spent as president of Biogen under chairman Jim Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to CEO, Vincent called Tobin ``the ideal choice'' to lead
Biogen's management team. But Tobin reportedly had some differences
with Vincent, who is widely known for saving Biogen from near
bankruptcy and establishing it as an industry leader. Tobin,
sources said, felt he was being second-guessed by Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   In a December 1998 showdown, the Biogen board of directors sided
with Vincent, prompting Tobin to resign abruptly and go on an
extended skiing vacation.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, Tobin calmly said he did not want to
talk about Vincent, but his demeanor changed quickly when he spoke
about Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Pete is a joy,'' he said. ``Not that we always
agree on everything. We have a pretty productive collaboration. He
is better at some things than I will ever be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 59-year-old Nicholas, turning over control of the
medical-device company he and John Abele founded in 1979 in
Watertown and grew through acquisitions to more than $2.8 billion
last year, with 13,500 employees, has been a deliberate process.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Nicholas told company directors that he wanted
to scale back his day-to-day involvement and urged them to begin
seeking his replacement. There were few candidates inside the
company. Abele left full-time company management in 1990 and
further reduced his workload this January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the management depth,'' Nicholas said. He
focused his executive talent search on large medical products
companies with strong management talent, such as Abbott
Laboratories and Baxter International Inc. Tobin spent 22 years at
Baxter, the huge supplier of hospital products, rising from
financial analyst to chief operating officer before joining Biogen.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tobin bolted from Biogen for the western ski slopes,
Nicholas made his move, reaching him by phone in between downhill
runs for a first interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good discussion and it was clear to me that here was
the guy I was looking for,'' said Nicholas of Tobin. ``He fit my
view as an ideal successor. It was an easy decision to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas, who said he also received a strong recommendation
about Tobin from Vincent, believed that Boston Scientific's growth
through acquisition left it somewhat bloated and inefficient at
turning out products quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And while revenues were reaching record highs last year he was
worried about the company's future, following a four-year
acquistion spree in which Boston Scientific spent $6 billion on at
least a dozen deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was particularly concerned about high manufacturing
costs and Boston Scientific's ability to keep pace with more nimble
competitors in emerging markets such as cardiovascular stents.
These are metal mesh devices used by cardiovascular surgeons in a
procedure known as angioplasty that keeps blood vessels open after
they are cleared of plaque to improve blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the significance of the stent opportunity,''
conceded Nicholas, noting that while Boston Scientific anticipated
that stents would be used in 25 percent of patients with heart
disease, they are now used in upwards of 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Tobin, who was hired in March 1999 but did not begin working
at Boston Scientific until that June, Boston Scientific's problems
fit perfectly with his Baxter skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Tobin has begun to do a lot of the things people thought
he would do,'' said Daniel T. Lemaitre, first vice president at
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., who has followed his career at Baxter since
1983. ``Tobin is very pragmatic and blunt-talking. He knows how to
drive manufacturing costs lower every year.''
</P>
<P>
   That directness also appealed to Nicholas. While Tobin was still
relatively new to biotech, Boston Scientific's challenges boiled
down to becoming more efficient in manufacturing, consolidating
some operations and figuring out how to stem the market-share loss
in cardiovascular stents, the fastest growing part of the stent
market that was the major cause of company's recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival at Boston Scientific's plush executive office
in Natick _ the former Prime Computer Corp. headquarters and once a
Carling beer brewing facility _ Tobin has moved quickly on two
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a corporate reorganization aimed at streamling the
company by eliminating overlapping manufacturing functions and
focusing stent production in Miami and Ireland. Last month the
company announced that 1,900 manufacturing jobs, including 850 in
Watertown _ the community where Nicholas and co-founder John Abele
launched Boston Scientific in 1979 _ would be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging the loss of jobs can be painful for
employees, Tobin didn't flinch from making the cuts. ``At Baxter, I
had 60,000 people and 131 plants and we closed 50 of them and built
five new ones,'' Tobin said. ``So closing three facilities (at
Boston Scientific) is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin says the restructuring will generate savings of $250
million annually by 2003 and boost research and development
spending. Boston Scientific also consolidated its Medi-Tech
division, which produces its vascular surgery and radiology
products division to Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The second and perhaps most intractable problem is Medinol Ltd.,
a company that Boston Scientific helped create in Tel Aviv five
years ago to produce state-of-the-art cardiovascular stents.
Disagreements over timely delivery of the top-selling stents led to
unusally high inventories which Boston Scientific had to be write
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rocky partnership for quite some time,'' said
Tobin. To solve the provlem, Boston Scientific announced last week
that it would acquire acquiring Medinol, its sole supplier of
cardiovascular stents.
</P>
<P>
   Owning Medinol would enable Boston Scientific to become more
competitive with rivals who make their own stents, generating
higher gross profit margins. Tobin maintains a closer working
relationship is needed between the two companies to avoid recent
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Boston Scientific, which does the final assembly
of the stent system by adding a balloon catheter, recalled
thousands of its top-of-the-line Nir stents because of suspected
pinhole problems after the company reported 22 leakages.
</P>
<P>
   Solving the problem and regaining US Food and Drug
Administration's approval took 17 months and set the company's new
product plans back by a year. It also puts Boston Scientific
further behind its leading rivals _ Guidant Corp. of Indianapolis
and Medtronics Incv. of Minneapolis _ and just ahead of Johnson &AMP;
Johnson of New Brunswick, N.J. _ in the $2 billion stent market.
J&AMP;J, the nation's largest medical device company is reportedly
gaining market share against Boston Scientific with its new
cardiovascular stent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Boston Scientific suffered another setback,
when Medinol said it would have to delay its next generation stent
from early 2001 to year to the second half _ a move that chagrined
investors. Boston Scientific stock closed at a 52-week low of
$16.125 Tuesday, rising to $16.25 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a step slow right now,'' declared Tobin confidently.
``That is all that is boils down to.''

 &HT;    REID between the lines
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``Asunder'' isn't a typical black film,
producer-director Tim Reid acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Films aimed at black American audiences tend to be urban crime
dramas, broad comedies or light family dramas. ``Asunder,'' which
stars Blair Underwood, Debbi Morgan and Michael Beach, is a
suspense thriller with slasher-film elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different genre for us,'' Reid said. ``There
isn't really right now a film like it in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asunder'' will premiere in Dayton to benefit the College
Fund/UNCF and Wilberforce University. Reid and his wife, executive
producer Daphne Maxwell Reid, will introduce the film and field
audience questions at its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asunder ``concerns two married couples whose lives are torn
apart when one of the wives dies in a freak accident. Blaming best
friend Michael Hubbs (Beach) for his loss, widower Chance Williams
(Underwood) seduces Hubbs' wife Lauren (Morgan) to exact his
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a director, I attempted to wrap this sort of morality play
in the familiar context of the slasher-film genre as well as the
thriller-film genre,'' Reid said from Los Angeles, likening
``Asunder'' to such films as ``Scream `` and ``Fatal Attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The title is taken from the biblical phrase from Matthew
commonly used in wedding vows, ``What God therefore has joined
together, let no man put asunder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie is about what happens when you disobey that rule,''
Reid said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asunder'' is the first film produced at Reid's Virginia-based
New Millennium Studios. The actor-turned-filmmaker _ best known for
his role as Venus Flytrap on the classic television series ``WKRP
in Cincinnati `` _ founded the studio in 1997 to produce motion
pictures for the under-served black audience, in an attempt to take
such films in new and different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has proved reluctant to follow his vision. After
studio distributors passed on ``Asunder,'' saying they didn't see
an audience for the film, Reid earlier this year founded New
Millennium Releasing to distribute the $2 million feature himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is in the big-movie game,'' Reid said, explaining
that a major releasing company would spend three times the cost of
his film to distribute it. ``The decisions that they make are
solely based on mass appeal _ the number of people that they think
they can get into the theater to see this movie. They don't think
about audiences so much, and especially, in particular, black
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatively few films Hollywood releases for black audiences
are typically aimed at teenagers, leaving middle-class black adults
with little to watch, Reid said. Rarely does the black middle-class
see itself on screen, and then it's only in proven genres such as
the family drama _ epitomized by such films as ``Eve's Bayou'' and
``Soul Food.''
</P>
<P>
   New Millennium Studios is Reid's attempt to produce niche-market
films for that audience. Situated on 60 acres near Richmond, the
full-service studio complex for motion picture, television,
commercial and music video production includes a 14,850-square-foot
soundstage, post-production facilities, music recording studios and
a 15-acre backlot.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was born in Norfolk, Va., and graduated in 1968 from
Norfolk State University with a bachelor's degree. in business and
marketing. He was awarded an honorary doctorate at his alma mater
in 1996 and is in the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope, and it's still a dream at this point, is to be
prolific enough to turn out anywhere from four to six movies a
year,'' Reid said. ``We're building to that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asunder'' will have played on 50 to 75 screens across the
United States before its November home-video release. New
Millennium Releasing has been targeting the film's audience with
limited runs in major cities such as Chicago, Atlanta and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news about our audience for a young independent
distributor is that we can reach 50 to 60 percent of our audience
in 25 cities,'' Reid said. ``Because the concentration of people of
color in America is in primary markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In smaller markets such as Dayton, Reid often gets involved with
the community _ as with the benefit premiere _ to promote his film,
benefiting the cause and himself. ``I can't . . . spend $25,000 on
advertising in a small market,'' he said. ``I just can't afford to
do that at this stage. But I can go in and get involved with the
community, a fund-raiser, get people to come, start a word-of-mouth
campaign, leave the movie for a couple weeks and come away with a
decent earning opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid employed a similar grass-roots marketing strategy for his
1996 feature directorial debut, ``Once Upon a Time . . . When We
Were Colored.''
</P>
<P>
   As a television producer, Reid created the Showtime series
``Linc's,'' as well as the CBS situation comedy ``Frank's Place.''
He appeared as an actor in both series and was most recently seen
in the WB series ``Sister, Sister.'' Reid co-starred with his wife
in the 1989-'90 detective drama, ``Snoops.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his efforts behind the camera, Reid is still associated
with television roles such as ``WKRP''s'' smooth-talking nighttime
DJ Gordon Sims, aka Venus Flytrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, and I would be disappointed if I wasn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid recounts the story of shooting the tail end of a movie
several weeks ago in Ethiopia at a religious site in a remote area
near the country's north border, where the people live mostly in
huts, very few with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing there shooting in this ancient site and a little
kid walked up to me and said, `Sister, Sister.' And it just blew me
away. I was dumbfounded. And I went, `How? Where?' And they said,
`Satellite.' I just started laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television, it has an incredible reach. Like I say, I'd be
kind of silly to go somewhere and not enjoy the experience of
people coming up to me and saying I like your (work). Especially
because of my success in terms of being blessed _ being in the
business for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from actor to filmmaker has been extremely
difficult, he said. ``And yet, I love the process of filmmaking and
television shows. The frustration aspects are many indeed because
of the climate in Hollywood for people of color behind the cameras.
You're constantly in battle on the front lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Linc's'' ran for two seasons to critical acclaim but was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got canceled because I wasn't getting enough white
viewers,'' Reid said, laughing. ``You walk away from that
experience and you go, `What the hell am I doing?' I mean, I'm
doing critically acclaimed work like ``Frank's Place'' _ nine Emmy
nominations _ and I get canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Reid is forging an independent path with New
Millennium Studios and Releasing. His next production, ``Sold My
Soul to Keep,'' is a supernatural thriller starring Underwood, who
also directs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I don't think there's ever been a movie with people of
color quite like this,'' Reid said.

 &HT;    NEW EVIDENCE OF EXPLOSION ON SUB, BRITISH RESCUE TEAM HEADS TO
SITE
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As a British rescue team sailed to assist in the rescue
of a stricken Russian nuclear submarine Thursday new evidence
suggested that a huge explosion sent the vessel to the bottom in a
few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Navy officials are analyzing film taken of the Kursk
that shows massive damage reaching from the front to the conning
tower. The control room where most of the crew works is below the
tower, suggesting many sailors could not escape when the submarine
went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a
flash,'' said Russian Navy Capt. Igor Dygalo.
</P>
<P>
   Jane's Defense Weekly expert Paul Beaver told Reuters that a
NATO official had described to him what happened based on
information gathered with sophisticated reconnaissance equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first explosion sounded like a torpedo or other naval
weapon detonating,'' he said. ``The
</P>
<P>
   most likely location is the forward torpedo compartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaver said the NATO official told him that the first explosion
was followed almost immediately by a second much larger blast
``consistent with further warheads being triggered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk can carry up to 28 torpedoes and anti-submarine
missiles, each with warheads
</P>
<P>
   weighing up to 1,000 pounds. An explosion involving even a few
torpedoes would have caused
</P>
<P>
   catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
   The damage apparently included the submarine's internal escape
capsule located in the
</P>
<P>
   conning tower, rendering it useless, Dygalo said.
</P>
<P>
   With hope dimming for the 118 crewmembers, Russia failed again
Thursday in its frenzied efforts to connect a diving capsule to the
Kursk. One of Russia's most modern subs, the Kursk is slowly
sinking into the sandy bed of the Barents Sea, making the rescue
attempts even more difficult. The weather remained treacherous with
high winds and crashing waves.
</P>
<P>
   The British team, which is equipped with a sophisticated rescue
mini-sub, is not expected to
</P>
<P>
   arrive until Saturday afternoon _ a week after the Kursk sank to
the Arctic seabed. The rescue
</P>
<P>
   mission set sail early Thursday morning from a Norwegian port
for the 900-mile voyage to the
</P>
<P>
   waters some 350 feet above the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long odds of success, the British team, which had
been waiting for days to be asked by the Russians to assist,
expressed optimism. ``There's always a chance,'' said team
commander Alan Hoskins as the team set sail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a second ship with Norwegian deep-sea divers that was
facing delays was expected to arrive early Sunday after Norwegian
officials scrambled to speed up its journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 24-hour delay would not be a good thing in a situation like
this,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Karsten Klepsvik said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Navy has given contradictory estimates of how long
the Kursk's oxygen could last, but some officers say air generators
may have been destroyed when the submarine slammed into the seabed.
Some officials have said oxygen would be depleted as soon as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian Naval Vice Chief of Staff Alexander Pobozhy told
reporters in Brussels Thursday that the boat's oxygen could last
``as long as two to three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that U.S. intelligence officials doubted Russian
claims that the crew survived the explosion. The officials
reportedly told CNN that they have detected no evidence of the
tapping reported by Russian officials or any other signs of life on
the Kursk since it went down Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov described the situation
as ``next to catastrophic'' and many Russian commentators said hope
for rescue had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin, who has been vacationing at a resort
near the Black Sea during the crisis, was criticized sharply
Thursday in the Russian press for delays in responding to the
tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sailors on the Kursk fell silent yesterday,'' wrote the
popular tabloid Komsomolskaya
</P>
<P>
   Pravda in bold red type. ``Why has the president been silent?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on earth did he think it was possible to keep mum five
days, when the entire nation has spent those days consumed by only
one thought _ will they be saved or won't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia, a widely read liberal daily, wrote: ``Together with
the K-141 (Kursk) has sunk people's faith that the state can
protect them from danger. It is the authorities themselves who have
hit the bottom, together with the K-141.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS PRESS GUN-CONTROL ISSUE
 &HT;    720&AMP;add.
 &HT;    EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The push for ``common-sense gun control,'' a
Democratic mantra in Washington, hit the City of Angels this week.
</P>
<P>
   On the podium, on the airwaves, and on political buttons, the
issue of guns and children permeated the party's national
convention, including a prime-time appearance by a parent who lost
a child at last year's Columbine High School shooting in Littleton,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum on the subject Wednesday, Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development Andrew Cuomo spoke with fervor about the need to
regulate guns.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 30,000 homicides, suicides and fatal accidents
attributed to guns each year, Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost unbelievable that our country is letting this
continue ... when it is so unnecessary, so avoidable,'' he said.
While we have safety measures for medicine bottles and garage-door
openers, Cuomo said, ``when it comes to guns, we say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can this be? How can the Congress allow it to continue?''
</P>
<P>
   The forum, sponsored by Handgun Control Inc., a group that
supports gun regulation, highlighted the Democratic hope that the
issue will help Vice President Al Gore in November, especially with
independent voters and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that issue will play very well,'' said Barbara Allen,
Democratic Party chairwoman for North Carolina. ``We've got to have
some gun control. ... Even in North Carolina, we're having too many
children killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Traci Collins, a delegate from New Castle, Colo., said gun
control is ``very important ... especially in Colorado because
we've been facing so much violence recently and it is senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about taking guns away from hunters,'' she
said. ``But when you're trying to bag a deer in order to eat it,
you don't use an AK-47.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins and other Democrats say that when it comes to guns, the
two parties and their presidential candidates are clearly on
opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   The dichotomy is evident in the two party platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform, which took a softer approach to some
controversial issues this year, did not change on guns. It
reiterates a defense of ``the constitutional right to keep and bear
arms'' and argues that self-defense is a basic human right. The
answer to violence, it argues, is stronger enforcement of existing
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform, on the other hand, endorses several gun
control measures, such as child safety or trigger locks and strict
background checks at gun shows _ two provisions included in a
package that has been stuck in the Republican-led Congress for
months.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Raye, a delegate from Colorado Springs, Colo., said the
Democratic position will prove more popular with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Majority of Americans believe that we need to do something
particularly about protecting young children from shooting other
young children. I think you'll find very few people in this country
who are opposed to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Raye, a candidate for the Colorado state House, added that Gore
as president is ``going to take care of that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it. You don't have to wonder about
it. You don't have to guess about it. Al Gore is there.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Democrats repeatedly attacked George W.
Bush's record on guns as well as the National Rifle Association for
lobbying against further regulation. As governor, Bush has
generally sided with the NRA, signing bills that allow people to
carry concealed weapons and prevent municipalities from suing gun
makers.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the attacks, the NRA is running ads in newspapers and
on television this week featuring the group's president Charlton
Heston asking why the Democratic Party ``has chosen to abandon
law-abiding gun owners and support an all-out assault on the right
to keep and bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The firearms industry is also spending money to attack Democrats
who support a series of lawsuits by state and local governments
against gun manufacturers. The National Shooting Sports Foundation,
the industry's leading trade association, is airing TV commercials
during this week's convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being blamed for crime and violence by this
administration and big-city mayors whose greedy lawyers are using
your tax dollars to sue us,'' says the narrator in one of the two
60-second spots, which depict a well-dressed man, presumably a
lawyer, carefully shredding an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, gun control took the spotlight in Congress after
Columbine High School students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
horrified the nation by using high-powered guns to murder 12
students and a teacher before killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy and other highly-publicized school shootings had a
great impact on the public and lawmakers despite the fact that gun
homicides have dropped over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, gun homicides in
the United States dropped from 14,740 in 1995 to 10,976 in 1998.
Homicides committed by teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 also
dropped from 2,692 in 1995 to 1,433 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control proponents argue that the numbers are still
staggering, and that gun violence will only drop significantly when
the number of firearms is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans win at the national level, we're just not
going to have effective gun control,'' Collins said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air amassing over central and eastern Canada will spill
across the Northeast in a series of surges in the next few days. By
late in the weekend, scattered nighttime frost will be possible in
parts of the northern Appalachians and northern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy, cool weather will cover most of the eastern Great Lakes
and interior Northeast Friday. Scattered light rain will fall north
of a low pressure area as it moves east along the Mason-Dixon line.
Farther south, strong thunderstorms will erupt in the warm, humid
air from Virginia to the eastern Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptional heat will persist from Texas to the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
   A broken band of strong thunderstorms will accompany a cool
front as it moves south into the southern Plains and northern Gulf
states. North of the front, cooler and less humid air will cover
the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: BLUE MOON
</P>
<P>
   A milky veil has been dimming the sun from Idaho to the northern
Great Lakes as smoke from wildfires has been drawn east by strong
high-level winds. On rare occasions, the appropriate distribution
of particle sizes in the smoke from fires can cause moonlight to
take on a bluish color. The airborne ash particles act like a
filter, selectively allowing blue light through the smokey pall
aloft. Huge forest fires in western Canada gave a bluish hue to the
sun and moon in the Northeast on Sept. 26, 1950.

   CLUTCHING AT CLICHES
</P>
<P>
   c. Hearst Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   By MARIANNE MEANS
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The drive to the middle of the road by both the
Democratic and Republican conventions has produced such a traffic
jam in the center lane that the parties are robbing each other's
banalities and cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Nothing new here to elevate the basic language of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Is it asking too much to expect our partisan leaders to come up
with fresh ways of saying the same old thing? Both Vice President
Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush insist their campaigns are
about the future, but their talk is straight out of the past. Even
the jokes are stale.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was more fun when the candidates went directly at it,
verbal swords drawn, from the left and the right. This centrist
stuff forces them onto the same yellow line, with variations of
style and emphasis but very little room for inventive spark. In
politics, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery. It is
running out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to them:
</P>
<P>
   Bush says ``I'm a different kind of Republican.'' Swell.
Different than whom? His father and President Reagan? Heaven
forbid. ``I don't think I'm reaching that far back in history,''
Bush says. Eight years is ``far back''? Then ``different'' in what
way? His policies sound like familiar GOP thinking, merely
expressed in a more polite manner than in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   He's distancing himself from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and the harshly partisan Republican Congress that twice closed down
the federal government, tried to impeach President Clinton and
earned a reputation for not doing much. But he can't bring himself
to say so and undercut GOP congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also likes to describe himself as ``different.'' In his
case, we know what he's talking about. It's the Clinton, stupid.
But he can't come right out and say what he means, either, or he
will look disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are substantive differences between the two
candidates: otherwise why would we need an election? On national
policy, Gore and Bush disagree on important topics like taxes,
education, Social Security, health care and military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are papering over these disagreements to
make themselves look more like Democrats and the Democrats are
overdoing the moderate aspects of their programs to make themselves
look conservative, if not exactly Republican. The homogenized
result is like a blended fruit smoothie - you can't tell the
bananas from the cherries. This concoction may go down easy, but
you don't know exactly what you are swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we get the kind of silliness we saw shortly before
the conventions opened. In a rash moment, Gore promised that if he
were elected his administration would represent ``a fresh start'',
a modest attempt to avoid another repetition of the customary claim
to be making a brave ''new beginning.`` Bush professed to be
astonished that Gore would use a phrase that the Republicans had
already been using. ''Unbelievable, isn't it?`` Bush crowed,
holding up a GOP campaign policy statement that included the words
''a fresh start.`` How sad that this is what passes for significant
political dialogue..
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team, of course, practices its own word theft. The GOP
platform pledges to ``leave no child behind.'' in access to
education and economic security. First Lady Hillary Clinton, in her
speech introducing her husband, noted pointedly that for decades
the trademark of the Childrens' Defense Fund, a Democratic-inclined
organization promoting opportunities for disadvantaged children for
which she used to work, was ``leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, President Clinton, the master wordsmith, didn't
get the prize for originality in his valedictory address at the
Democratic convention's opening night either. Touting his
administration's record, Clinton added: ``As that LA detective Joe
Friday used to say, ''just the facts, ma'am.`` The remark drew
laughter from the crowd - just as it had in 1988, when then-Vice
President George Bush, the current GOP nominee's father, used the
same line in his speech accepting that year's GOP presidential
nomination. It clearly doesn't take much to amuse political
convention delegates. Joe Friday was a character played by Jack
Webb in the popular television series ''Dragnet`` which ran from
1952 to 1959 and was revived briefly from 1967 to 1970. It has been
off the air for thirty years.
</P>
<P>
   The basic campaign argument is about ``change'' , whatever that
may mean beyond the fact the current White House incumbent is no
longer on the ballot. Both sides claim that mantle but don't define
it the same way. Voters like the idea of forward motion and
progress but they fear any radical philosophical shift that might
disrupt rather than improve the status quo. So talking about it is
tricky, or as Gore might say, ``risky.'' . The vice president was
mocked by Bush for overusing that word and no ``risks'' were
uttered in the series of surrogate speeches at the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Lieberman didn't go
near ``risky'' , preferring to fall back on all-purpose
``differences.'' As he gracefully put it, the two parties see
issues ``through a different set of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the best pitches for a transition from a
Democratic administration to another Democrat rather than a
Republican was made by Bush's father as he sought to replace Ronald
Reagan in 1988. ``When you have to change horses in mid-stream
doesn't it make sense to switch to one who's going the same way?''
he asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing that the Democrats haven't yet stolen that line. $$$

   UPS-TRACKING _ ATLANTA _ Deep in the fine print of all UPS
shipping contracts, there's an item that allows the company to
charge $3 each time a shipper tracks a package on the company Web
site. The charge is only used for companies that track hundreds of
packages a day and place great demands on the UPS information
network. But critics say it's meant to keep freight bill auditors
from collecting refunds on ``guaranteed'' shipments that arrive
late. This is the Information Age, UPS has figured out a way to

   SHARP-DRIVING _ ATLANTA _ Cross marketing seems to be the way of
this millennium. Or has it been around for a while? Cross marketing
is the practice of one product hitching a ride on the star of
another product's success. How many of you have purchased just one
more Kid's Meal to get a dinosaur from the latest Disney movie? But
fast-food restaurants and movie studios are not the only ones
playing that game. Automakers today are using cross marketing to
target a segment of potential buyers. (Sharp, Atlanta

   Al Gore takes the stage at the Democratic National Convention
tonight to urge Americans to reject Republicans who would take them
``back to the past,'' and to promise prosperity, progress and
positive change if he wins the White House. Gore said he has been
working on his speech for two months, ``rewriting and editing and
tweaking'' the words. ``He was literally the person at the
typewriter on this,'' Tad Devine, a Gore campaign strategist, said
today. He said Gore will both set his issues agenda and talk about
the key decisions that have shaped his life. Gore's campaign
chairman, William Daley, said the speech would be an opportunity
for Gore to address people who think ``that he's just a boring,
stiff, you know, unable-to-speak guy,'' and to come through as a
real person.
</P>
<P>
   WIN ONE FOR THE TIPPER
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Tipper Gore will step into the spotlight to introduce
her husband, and to help voters see the Al Gore she sees. Analysts
say that's just what the Democrats need: Pulling Tipper off the
sidelines and into a more prominent role may help in swaying the
millions of female voters who say they're inclined to back George
W. Bush. Said ex-Democratic chairman Robert Strauss: ``I'd put
Tipper on a campaign train through the South. She has the same kind
of warmth Lady Bird Johnson had. She doesn't offend anyone, she's
warm, and fighting for her husband is something women would find
appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER BATTLE FOR MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain is to begin treatment Saturday for a recurrence
of the most dangerous form of skin cancer. McCain underwent several
tests at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., this morning to
determine the course of treatment. Advisers said McCain didn't know
whether the cancer had spread and was planning a news conference
Friday to talk about his condition. McCain did not take questions
from reporters after the visit, but did say, ``I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   INTO ENEMY TURF
</P>
<P>
   One day after Al Gore officially accepts the presidential
nomination, rival George W. Bush will campaign in Gore's home state
of Tennessee. Bush and Dick Cheney will begin a three-state tour
with a ``Victory 2000'' rally in Bartlett, Tenn., Friday, noting
that the state is crucial in this election. ``Gov. Bush is leading
by 45 points in Texas. And Al Gore is leading by 54 points in his
home as well _ Washington D.C. But here in Tennessee, it's neck and
neck,'' said Tenn. GOP chair Chip Saltsman. Bush and Cheney will
then make their way to Dallas the next day.
</P>
<P>
   WINNING POINTS FOR PERSISTENCE
</P>
<P>
   Protesters returned to the streets today for the last day of the
convention, denouncing big business and promising to greet Al
Gore's acceptance speech with a chorus of shouts, chants and drum
beats outside the convention hall. The first rally began at
Pershing Square, a gathering place for protesters this week, where
about 100 activists criticized Citibank for funding projects that
they said were ruining the environment. The protest, called ``Spank
the Bank,'' moved about two blocks to Citibank Center downtown,
then returned to Pershing Square without incident. ``Boycott
Citigroup, the world's most destructive bank,'' read stickers that
protesters pasted on surfaces downtown.
</P>
<P>
   EVEN THE PROTESTS ARE CHOREOGRAPHED
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart station, an
earlier march had all the earmarks of a serious confrontation:
Hundreds of demonstrators vented at the police, and 38 were
arrested. But it was a carefully orchestrated arrangement, with
protest organizers and police scripting out just what kind of civil
disobedience would bring symbolic arrests without stirring the
crowd to violence. Said Capt. Michael Moore: ``They asked what it
would take to get arrested. We looked up the law and gave them some
ideas. They wanted to lie down in the street, but we told them they
wouldn't get arrested for that.'' Instead, the two sides settled on
a plan for the demonstrators to sit on a sidewalk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   LIEB'S LABOR LOST?
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman met privately with leaders of labor, women and
education organizations today as he renewed efforts to reassure
groups nervous about some of the positions he took before becoming
Al Gore's running mate. Aides said it was ``standard protocol'' for
the vice presidential nominee to reach out to core members of the
Democratic coalition with such meetings. But some blacks, teachers,
unions and others are looking for reassurance that his centrist
views are compatible with theirs. Teill take the podium to dispel
the image of the vice president as wooden.
</P>
<P>
   CHUG-CHUG, CHUG-A-LUG
</P>
<P>
   A four-day, 400-mile riverboat excursion down the Mississippi
River that was to take Al Gore and Joe Lieberman through some
Midwestern campaign stops following the convention has been
scrapped. Gore campaign officials said they are ditching the Mark
Twain riverboat in Moline, Ill., on Sunday and taking buses
instead. The boat couldn't go fast enough to fit all the stops;
it's speed is said to be 10-15 mph. ``The most important thing is
reaching communities and reaching people, and this was the most
effective way of doing that'' Gore spokesman Chris Moody said of
the change.

DOG DAYS SIZZLE FOR THEATER'S OFF-OFFBEAT PUPS

   NEW YORK _ Say what you will about the New York International
Fringe Festival, it is, without a doubt, the only place in the city
you can see a Hungarian adaptation of a Greek epic performed in
(what else?) German.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. For a limited time only, it's ``Die Ungarische
Medea,'' written by none other than Arpad Goncz, who recently
stepped down as president of Hungary. (The Fringe had nothing to do
with his resignation, festival officials say.)
</P>
<P>
   Goncz's play is just one of scores of shows now on the Fringe,
the annual two-week downtown theater festival that revels in all
things dramatic and different.
</P>
<P>
   How different? Well, a quick glance at this year's schedule
includes ``I Am Star Trek,'' a staged biography of Gene
Roddenberry, creator of that television series; ``Frankenclown,''
an evil-clown show promising ``several slayings and raucous
laughter''; and of course the Tiny Ninja Theater, which will
perform ``Macbeth'' using nothing but 100 tiny plastic ninjas,
several miniature aliens and a pair of and Smile dolls. (They play
the Macbeths.)
</P>
<P>
   All in all the Fringe festival, which began on Wednesday and
runs through Aug. 27, will present 180 shows in 20 theaters on the
Lower East Side, in the East Village and nearby. Every day the
Fringe will present almost 80 performances, staged by some 2,000
artists from 12 countries and overseen by a volunteer staff of 400.
</P>
<P>
   Even veterans of the Fringe, now in its fourth year, are a
little awestruck by the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I am absolutely certain there is no way it is
possibly going to happen,'' said John Clancy, the festival's
artistic director, who, as of Sunday, was already chain-smoking and
wearing a two-day-old beard. ``And yet somehow every day it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the scope of the Fringe's schedule, you might think
that every little-known actor, writer and director in the city was
booked. But the Fringe is only one of several theater festivals
running around the city.
</P>
<P>
   They include a newcomer, the Midtown International Theater
Festival, and a recent upstart, the Pure Pop Festival, as well as
two more established ones: the American Living Room, a seven-week
festival of theater, film and puppetry at the Here Theater in the
South Village, and the Blueprint Series at the Ontological Theater
in the East Village, which concentrates on the work of new
experimental playwrights and directors. Two other downtown
festivals, the Summer Camp series at Soho Rep and the Ice Factory
at the Ohio Theater, just finished their annual runs.
</P>
<P>
   With budgets less than the cast-party tabs for most Broadway
shows, these festivals make August the busiest month for the myriad
low-budget, bighearted theaters collectively known as
off-off-Broadway. The timing of course is hardly coincidental;
August is traditionally a slow time for Broadway and off-Broadway,
leaving smaller theaters a prime opportunity to fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``August has become festival season downtown, the one moment
when all the little theaters in town celebrate their vibrant little
community,'' said Aaron Beall, a longtime off-off producer who
founded the Pure Pop festival. ``We were able to find one of the
last slots available on the calendar, the one slot no one else
would touch, and we made it our own.''
</P>
<P>
   All the festivals share common characteristics. First and
foremost is their ticket prices, which are, in short, cheap. None
of the festivals have tickets more expensive than $12, and some
shows are free.
</P>
<P>
   Not that production values are completely threadbare. Despite
off-off-Broadway's ragtag image, many theaters involved in the
festivals are increasingly sophisticated, with air conditioning,
cushioned seats and elaborate technical setups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are emphasizing our location, our convenience and our
safety,'' said John Chatterton, the founder of the Midtown
festival. ``And our A.C.''
</P>
<P>
   And while all of the festivals' founders would claim their own
aesthetics, each festival has at least one show that falls into
this venerable category: the show with the outrageous title.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences of the avant-garde apparently love a goofy title,
which avant-garde artists are apparently plenty willing to provide.
Into this vast phylum fall entries like this year's ``Clowns in the
Vagina,'' another evil-clown show at the Fringe; ``The Hobo Got Too
High,'' a Pure Pop entry about a cocaine addict named Bug
Blowmonkey; and ``I Didn't Ask for Bare-Chested Men Singing
Doo-Wop,'' a Fringe show that is described as a farce and may well
be.
</P>
<P>
   The award for the oddest title, however, goes to the
Neo-Futurists, a Chicago-based comedy troupe playing the Fringe.
The show is ``The Complete Lost Works of Samuel Beckett as Found in
an Envelope (Partially Burned) in a Dustbin in Paris Labeled:
`Never to Be Performed. Never. Ever. Ever. Or I'll Sue. I'll Sue
From the Grave.''' True to form, it has been one of the Fringe's
hottest tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The newest of the bunch is the midtown festival, a monthlong
affair featuring 19 productions at four black-box theaters in the
West 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which began on Aug. 9 and runs through Sept. 3,
was founded by Chatterton, an off-off-Broadway playwright who is
banking _ the festival's $30,000 budget comes mostly out of his
pocket _ on the idea that the theater lovers who go to midtown for
Broadway shows might take a chance on something a little less
polished.
</P>
<P>
   Chatterton, who also publishes a weekly newsletter called the
Off Off Broadway Review, said he started the festival after reading
several articles about the Fringe festival. ``To be honest,'' he
said, ``I thought I could do it better.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, he said, that's because his tastes differ from the
Fringe's. ``I am slightly more middle-of-the-road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the midtown festival has booked productions of
Shakespeare, Shaw and Beckett. But it also includes potential
modern epics like ``Stopless Go-Go Girls at the Troll Hole,'' the
heartwarming story of a group of topless dancers and their loyal,
leather-loving clientele. (``A could-be cult classic,'' reads its
news release. Time will tell.)
</P>
<P>
   And while Chatterton has been trumpeting his theaters' air
conditioning, at one of the festivals' theaters last week those
same units blew a fuse during a performance of Harold Pinter's
``Lover.'' After two false starts and several expletives from the
technical booth, the actors soldiered on under house lights. About
five minutes into the show, the stage lights came back on.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences have made Chatterton somewhat more humble, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a far greater appreciation and respect,'' he said, with
a laugh, ``for what they've been doing at the Fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Chatterton is hardly the first to challenge the Fringe. That
honor would belong to Beall, the proprietor of Todo Con Nada, a
basement theater on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side. Beall
(pronounced bell) was also a Fringe co-founder, but he started the
Pure Pop Festival after he had a falling out with Clancy over the
Fringe festival's direction.
</P>
<P>
   So using the pseudonym Lestar Bang, he founded his own festival,
complete with visions of a 24-hour theater delicatessen, a yearlong
schedule of productions and a vast Internet network of support
services for off-off Broadway companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of that panned out, but this year Beall is back with
another ambitious slate of productions, some 20 shows including a
series of Chekhov shorts, a Richard Foreman play and several
stagings of the horrible horror films of the cult movie director Ed
Wood.
</P>
<P>
   On a shoestring budget, all of Pure Pop's shows are being
presented at either Nada or Beall's newest theater, Show World,
which he carved out of an unseemly corner of the former sex shop
with that name on Eighth Avenue near 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   And while other festivals delegate artistic responsibilities,
more than half the productions at Pure Pop are being directed by
Beall, a shadowy director named Frank Cwiklik (not another
pseudonym, Beall assures) and Ian W. Hill, Beall's protege, a man
so devoted to the theater that he long lived in a large, rat-proof
cage in the basement of Nada.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's rugged living situation notwithstanding, for sheer
perseverance, its still hard to beat the Fringe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year it looked as if the festival might not happen.
The Present Co., the producer of the Fringe, had serious money
troubles that almost caused it to lose the Theatorium, its
5,000-square-foot home and the Fringe headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some very bad days,'' said Elena K. Holy, the
festival's producing director.
</P>
<P>
   Part of those problems came from the growth of the Fringe. In
1997, when it was founded, the budget was $74,000; this year, its
fourth, the figure is $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year's schedule, for example, includes a raft of
nontheatrical programming, including a literary reading series
(FringeInk), a visual art exhibition (FringeArt) and a children's
theater program (FringeJr.).
</P>
<P>
   The main emphasis, however, remains the shows, which as usual
run the gamut. A casual visitor to a theater at, say, 5 p.m. on a
Tuesday might encounter a puppet show (``Doctor Faustus''), a
comedy troupe (``The Chainsaw Boys'') or the obligatory paean to
Elvis (``Viva Los Alamos''). Come back an hour later, and the
theater might be home to an actual play (``Buddy Movie''), a new
musical (``To Sirloin With Love: A Meat Opera'') or even an
old-fashioned revival (George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber's 1936
backstage comedy ``Stage Door'').
</P>
<P>
   Most of these shows are performed a few times, then disappear
without a trace. Some, however, have proved to have lives beyond
the Fringe, including last year's ``Never Swim Alone,'' currently
in a commercial run at the SoHo Playhouse, and the 1999 gag musical
``Urinetown,'' which is gearing up for its own off-Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   The Fringe has also begun to pick up some higher-profile uptown
partners, including the Drama League and the Ensemble Studio
Theater, both of which are producing several short plays at the
festival. It also received technical support from off-Broadway
companies like the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the Vineyard Theater
and the American Place Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change, however, is that for the first time
the New York International Fringe Festival is actually living up to
its name.
</P>
<P>
   ``International,'' Clancy explains, ``used to mean a couple of
guys from Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, there are 30 international shows _ ``coming
over actual seas,'' he said _ giving the schedule a multilingual
feel. International entries include ``Ha! Hamlet,'' a two-person
version from Switzerland; ``Girobira,'' a performance art troupe
from Bilbao, Spain; and something titled ``Synchronized Swimming:
The Dry Version,'' also from Switzerland, proving the outrageous
name theory transcends international borders.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say there is also another new element to this year's
festival: calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like senior year in high school,'' Clancy said. ``We
know how to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Risks
</P>
<P>
   Even as crews scurried around Fringe headquarters the other day,
Clancy and Holy seemed unconcerned about any potential logistic
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell if this is calm or exhaustion,'' Holy said. ``But
it feels OK''
</P>
<P>
   But what of the art? Many of the companies are performing
together for the first time. And more experienced troupes are
trying out new material. Are the organizers concerned that some
things may be, well, just plain bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``I view it as a place for established artists to take risks,''
Clancy said, ``and emerging artists to work in a professional
environment for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Holy thought for a moment, and added: ``And fun. The Fringe
should be fun.'' &QL;

A SHEEP, YES, TAKES A COCKEYED VIEW OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Though the hero of ``Sheep in the Big City'' is a sheep named
Sheep, there is nothing generic about this sly, mordant new series,
which will have a preview on the Cartoon Network at 9 Friday night.
(It will begin for real in November.) The show's model is
unmistakably ``Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' with its hilariously
puffed-up storytelling voice, several cliff-hanging episodes in
each half-hour installment, puns and most of all a style of humor
that is silly enough to appeal to children and satiric enough for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sheep in the Big City'' has its own look and feel. The
brightly colored characters have faces that are sometimes as askew
as those in a cubist portrait, a reflection of the show's cockeyed
yet astute view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The first brief episode is not the most engaging. The mute yet
perfectly communicating Sheep is abducted from his home at Farmer
Brown's by an evil military group that needs him as ammunition for
its secret weapon. Things pick up instantly when Sheep escapes in
the city and has to evade the villainous General Specific and his
cohorts, General Dentistry and General Interest. Farmer Brown, a
man who has had way too much therapy, arrives and walks the city
street calling out in a singsong voice: ``Shee-eep! Where are you?
I need closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sheep is doing just fine, getting money from an ATM.
Don't ask how he earns it (innocently) or why Farmer Brown thinks
Sheep has become a cross-dresser; those are big-city surprises.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Sheep will make it in the city and go on
to fresh adventures. The preview ends, after all, with him tossing
his fleece in the air, evoking the hat toss at the end of ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and signaling a happy future for this
series.

 &HT;    STRIKES RARE IN HIGH-TECH ECONOMY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was a phone strike?
</P>
<P>
   Even though 87,000 operators and technicians at Verizon, the
nation's largest local phone company, walked off their jobs nearly
two weeks ago, dial tones kept droning and folks kept talking into
cell phones even in Verizon's service area throughout the busy
northeast corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A satellited, digitalized, Internetted, high-tech economy has
wrought changes in collective bargaining, labor experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   When miners strike, coal shipments stop. When auto workers
strike, no cars are made. But other than falling behind in repairs
and new installations, highly automated Verizon continued to
provide service after contract talks stalled on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   A Verizon spokesman said late Thursday that talks were moving
feverishly toward a midnight deadline set by the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the smaller to two unions
representing Verizon employees. The IBEW said that without an
agreement or meaningful progress by that time, its representatives
would walk out of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Hopeful' is exactly the right word,'' said Verizon spokesman
Jim Smith. ``An awful lot of time is being spent collecting
absolute demands and requirements and batting them back and forth
with this deadline in mind. We can't have anybody leave the table.
That is the only place this is ever going to get settled. They've
escalated the process in hopes that they can bring this thing
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikes do seem to be less effective in high-tech industries,
said Don Parsons, an economics professor at George Washington
University. ``If you look at it as a game between labor and
management, it gives a tremendous advantage to the employer'' if
basic operations can continue indefinitely during a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   In these negotiations, striking workers must miss a lot of
paychecks before the impact of their sacrifice is felt, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has existed for some time in telecommunications,
said William Dickens, a senior fellow in economics at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities have generally had an easier time maintaining
service. The system pretty well runs itself,'' said Dickens. ``If
you had operators connecting calls, it would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   If production or service continues during a strike, the striking
workers ar tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Verizon is in a competitive market, Blackwell said
any reductions in service will send customers to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, unions don't exist to strike. That's just a
tactic'' to achieve broader goals, he said. The fact that there are
fewer strikes reflects that workers ``don't do it unless its
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions are trying to organize high-tech workers. Blackwell
pointed to a recent strike by Boeing engineers as a successful
example of labor moving into a new sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a new constituency,'' said Marcus
Courtney, co-founder of WashTech _ the Washington Alliance of
Technology Workers _ which is seeking to organize technical
writers, web site developers and other high-tech employees in
Washington state. He said the fledgling union has 250 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the very beginning so the whole notion of a
strike is not what's oss a part of the information age than they
were in an industrial economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were only 17 work stoppages involving 1,000 or
more workers _ the fewest in six decades, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics. That compares to 34 in 1998, 412 in 1969 and
470 in 1952. There have been fewer than 100 such strikes every year
since 1982 while there were more than 200 almost every year between
1947 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing scarcity of strikes is partly due to ``the
declining importance of the industrial armies of the past _ the
hordes of blue collar workers'' in a high-tech economy, said Marvin
Kosters, the director of economic policy studies at the American
Enterprise Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The number of union workers in the private sector has declined
dramatically as the economy changed. And many strongly organized
occupations _ such as school teachers _ are more concentrated in
the public sector and have historically been reluctant to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed from the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. The
strike affects Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, Virginia,
West Virginia, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. A key issue in
the contract talks was mandatory overtime _ which workers want to
cut back and management said is needed in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Verizon is in a competitive market, Blackwell said
any reductions in service will send customers to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, unions don't exist to strike. That's just a
tactic'' to achieve broader goals, he said. The fact that there are
fewer strikes reflects that workers ``don't do it unless its
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions are trying to organize high-tech workers. Blackwell
pointed to a recent strike by Boeing engineers as a successful
example of labor moving into a new sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a new constituency,'' said Marcus
Courtney, co-founder of WashTech _ the Washington Alliance of
Technology Workers _ which is seeking to organize technical
writers, web site developers and other high-tech employees in
Washington state. He said the fledgling union has 250 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the very beginning so the whole notion of a
strike is not what's on our minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sorts of highly skilled workers that his group is
seeking to organize are vital to continued operations of even
automated industries. If large numbers of these workers united,
Courtney said, a work stoppage could shut down a company's
high-tech services.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _'' And, in the category of most convincing
portrayal of a diverse and inclusive political party at a national
convention, the winner is ... Well, of course the winner is the
Democratic Party. They own this Convention in Philadelphia was,
``We're inclusive,'' the sledgehammer rejoinder at the Democratic
National Convention here was that when it comes to racial and
ethnic diversity, ``We're the real deal.'' But the contest that
counts, to be decided in November, is not a matter of whether the
Republicans can outdo the Democrats on diversity. They cannot.
Rather, it is whether the GOP can sufficiently burnish its image on
matters of race to keep pace with a changing America. It is an
America that is changing subtly in the warmer tones of tolerance
the electorate appears to desire, and unsubtly in the changing
complexion of a nation whose once-overwhelming whiteness diminishes
year by year. The Republican Party remains far whiter at its core
than the nation is, just as the Democratic Party is more
multiracial in its composition than America as a whole will be for
years to come. But the Republicans' anemic record in attracting
brown and black votes has its tactical advantage now. Why? Because
even a small improvement will look like victory and unnerve the
Democrats, who count so heavily on sweeping 90 percent of black
voters and big majorities of Latinos that they have nowhere to go
but down. Better yet for Republicans, if they succeed in upping the
ante on what Democrats need to do to keep black and Latino votes
from straying, they may force Democrats to make the kind of overt
policy commitments on issues of race and class that helped
Republicans win additional white votes in the past. However it
plays out, though, this summer's conventions may mark a signal
moment in American racial politics _ the point at the turn of a new
century when both major parties seemed determined to outdo each
other as celebrants of diversity. ``Demography is destiny,'' said
Frederick Lynch, a government professor at Claremont-McKenna
College. ``As far as being the white party,'' he said of the
Republicans, ``it's not going to get any better.'' ``They have
realized that they at least have to be perceived as inclusive, or
they are going to be irrelevant in the future,'' said Maria
Echaveste, the deputy White House chief of staff. ``The
demographics are telling.'' For decades, Republicans effectively
played off the image of Democrats as the ``minority'' party, the
hapless captive of constituent interest groups. President Clinton
moved his party away from that image. And at the same time,
America's Hispanic and Asian communities soared in size through
immigration and reduced the political burden of the Democrats'
reputation as the party of minorities. Republican strategists
decided they had to re-examine a strategy that depended almost
entirely on white voters. Among those setting the new GOP course is
Karl Rove, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top strategist. In an
interview with The Washington Post in Philadelphia, Rove declared
that the ``Southern Strategy'' _ polarizing the electorate along
racial lines to win white votes _ was dead. The inclusionary tone
of this year's Republican convention was, in fact, first struck in
1996 in San Diego. But as former party chairman Haley Barbour noted
in Philadelphia, this time the message and messenger _ George W.
Bush _ are one. Still, as many news commentators in Philadelphia
noted, this year's convention _ which was chaired by a woman, a
Hispanic and a black _ sometimes verged perilously close to parody.
There were black preachers and church choirs and popular
entertainers. Abel Maldonado, a Hispanic Republican assemblyman
from California, delivered remarks entirely in Spanish. Laura Bush,
the governor's wife, delivered her speech to the convention in
front of a mock classroom set up on the stage and peopled by black
and brown children who, as one convention theme had it, would not
be ``left behind.'' Heavyweight figures like Gen. Colin Powell and
Bush's top national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice _ both of
whom are black _ spoke. But the bench is not deep. J.C. Watts, the
only black Republican member of Congress and one of the
convention's chairs, was on a relentless schedule of preaching,
singing and speaking. ``They had J.C. Watts so spread out you'd
think that he was mayonnaise,'' Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer,
himself one of the chairs of the Democratic convention, told a
breakfast of Louisiana Democrats in Los Angeles. Indeed, the
extraordinary colors of the Philadelphia convention were ridiculed
all week here as a masquerade, a minstrel show, a lie and an
insult. ``If I could just get my administration up here, it would
be as diverse as anything you saw on stage a couple of weeks ago,''
joked President Clinton in his opening-night address to the
convention. ``And it would be real, too _ it would be real,''
delegate Rosemary Brooks-Bitting called out from the New Jersey
delegation. The Republican convention, she said, represented ``an
excellent job of copycatting,'' but she considered it cynical and
insulting. To Elsie Y. Cross, a pioneer in the field of corporate
diversity management, it is all ``very cynical.'' The Republicans
are not changing their policies, their attitudes or their culture,
just their pitch, she said. ``I don't think it fooled very many
people,'' Cross said of the convention in her hometown of
Philadelphia. ``It's all about shrewd marketing,'' said professor
Michael Eric Dyson, a cultural critic and writer at DePaul
University in Chicago, of the Republican effort. ``It speaks to the
need to have multiculturalism in the new millennium.'' But Dyson,
an observer at the Democratic convention, said that while the
Democrats are more skilled at manipulating the symbols of
diversity, he, like Cross, believes they use black and brown faces
in nearly as superficial a fashion. James Pinkerton, a Newsday
columnist who was a White House adviser to Gov. Bush's father when
he was president, said that while the Democrats this week cried
``hypocrisy'' over the Republican embrace of multiracial images,
the Democrats are in his view the greater hypocrites for stifling
any debate on issues like trade, on which Democrats are deeply
divided. While the party line in Los Angeles was that most
Americans saw through the ``phony'' diversity in Philadelphia, not
everyone was discounting that it could have serious consequences.
``The danger is that it will be politically meaningful in an
undeserved way,'' said Christopher Edley Jr., a senior policy
adviser to Gore and Clinton's leading adviser on race. The
Democrats enjoy a profound advantage over the Republicans in having
so many surrogate campaigners with a stake in the election's
outcome. Blacks were 20 percent of the delegates in Los Angeles and
only 4 percent in Philadelphia. A third of all delegates were ``of
color'' here. According to the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, of the Latino elected officials
who identify themselves with a party, 1,577 are Democrats and 134
are Republicans. Of the 19 Hispanics in Congress, 15 are Democrats.
In Congress there are 38 black Democrats and J.C. Watts. In the
state legislatures there are 564 black Democrats and five
Republicans. Asians vote more independently, but most prominent
Asian elected officials are Democrats and the Asian vote is
trending in that direction. All the Asians in Congress are
Democrats. ``I think it's up to the Democrats not to take the
minority vote for granted,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson,
who had aspired to become the first Hispanic on a national ticket
as Gore's runningmate. ``The Republicans are projecting an image of
inclusion,'' Richardson said. ``We have to have a clear message
that theirs is just show and ours is a reality. But in the age of
short attention spans and quick TV soundbites, I have to hand it to
them, they did a good job. They dented us a little bit. We have to
work extra hard.'' (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) ``George W. Bush is for
photo opportunies, Al Gore is for real opportunities,'' Joseph
Andrew, the party's national chair, told the convention's Black
Caucus. Los Angeles was ``the most diverse political convention in
the history of the world,'' Andrew said. California Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante told the Hispanic Caucus that Bush was making himself
out to be like Ricky Martin, but that anyone who thinks his
administration would be good for Latinos is ``living la vida
loca.'' Kathryn ``Cookie'' Manen'to, a black delegate from Chico,
Calif., and a former blues and gospel radio deejay, said she could
tell from watching the Philadelphia convention on TV that, while
the music on stage was OK, the rhythm on the convention floor was
not. ``They were trying to get their boogie down, but, come on
boys, that's not natural for you.'' In remarks before the Asian
Pacific Caucus, Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta, the first
Asian-American ever to serve in the Cabinet, said that while there
are distinguished Asian-American Republicans, they are less
connected to the grass roots. Many Republicans loved the line in
Condoleezza Rice's speech in which she said of the GOP, ``I found a
party that sees me as an individual and not as a member of group.''
But, as respected as Rice and Powell may be, when it comes to
helping persuade other blacks to vote Republican, they command no
troops. Instead, Bush and the Republicans must appeal over the
heads of most black and Hispanic leaders and directly to voters. It
is not a strategy that can win the Hispanic vote, said Raul
Yzaguirre, head of the National Council of La Raza, but it can peel
off enough to make a difference. But Lynch thinks it is a mistake
to underestimate how far a Republican embrace of the diversity
ideal can take the party. Lynch, who examined the diversity
industry in his book ``The Diversity Machine,'' said the Republican
Party, like many other like-motivated corporations that embarked on
diversity campaigns out of ``business necessity,'' may find they
have unleashed forces they ultimately will be unable to control.
``I don't think they realize,'' said Lynch, ``that inclusion means
their party is going to change.''

   LOS ANGELES _'' And, in the category of most convincing
portrayal of a diverse and inclusive political party at a national
convention, the winner is ... Well, of course the winner is the
Democratic Party. They own this Convention in Philadelphia was,
``We're inclusive,'' the sledgehammer rejoinder at the Democratic
National Convention here was that when it comes to racial and
ethnic diversity, ``We're the real deal.'' But the contest that
counts, to be decided in November, is not a matter of whether the
Republicans can outdo the Democrats on diversity. They cannot.
Rather, it is whether the GOP can sufficiently burnish its image on
matters of race to keep pace with a changing America. It is an
America that is changing subtly in the warmer tones of tolerance
the electorate appears to desire, and unsubtly in the changing
complexion of a nation whose once-overwhelming whiteness diminishes
year by year. The Republican Party remains far whiter at its core
than the nation is, just as the Democratic Party is more
multiracial in its composition than America as a whole will be for
years to come. But the Republicans' anemic record in attracting
brown and black votes has its tactical advantage now. Why? Because
even a small improvement will look like victory and unnerve the
Democrats, who count so heavily on sweeping 90 percent of black
voters and big majorities of Latinos that they have nowhere to go
but down. Better yet for Republicans, if they succeed in upping the
ante on what Democrats need to do to keep black and Latino votes
from straying, they may force Democrats to make the kind of overt
policy commitments on issues of race and class that helped
Republicans win additional white votes in the past. However it
plays out, though, this summer's conventions may mark a signal
moment in American racial politics _ the point at the turn of a new
century when both major parties seemed determined to outdo each
other as celebrants of diversity. ``Demography is destiny,'' said
Frederick Lynch, a government professor at Claremont-McKenna
College. ``As far as being the white party,'' he said of the
Republicans, ``it's not going to get any better.'' ``They have
realized that they at least have to be perceived as inclusive, or
they are going to be irrelevant in the future,'' said Maria
Echaveste, the deputy White House chief of staff. ``The
demographics are telling.'' For decades, Republicans effectively
played off the image of Democrats as the ``minority'' party, the
hapless captive of constituent interest groups. President Clinton
moved his party away from that image. And at the same time,
America's Hispanic and Asian communities soared in size through
immigration and reduced the political burden of the Democrats'
reputation as the party of minorities. Republican strategists
decided they had to re-examine a strategy that depended almost
entirely on white voters. Among those setting the new GOP course is
Karl Rove, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top strategist. In an
interview with The Washington Post in Philadelphia, Rove declared
that the ``Southern Strategy'' _ polarizing the electorate along
racial lines to win white votes _ was dead. The inclusionary tone
of this year's Republican convention was, in fact, first struck in
1996 in San Diego. But as former party chairman Haley Barbour noted
in Philadelphia, this time the message and messenger _ George W.
Bush _ are one. Still, as many news commentators in Philadelphia
noted, this year's convention _ which was chaired by a woman, a
Hispanic and a black _ sometimes verged perilously close to parody.
There were black preachers and church choirs and popular
entertainers. Abel Maldonado, a Hispanic Republican assemblyman
from California, delivered remarks entirely in Spanish. Laura Bush,
the governor's wife, delivered her speech to the convention in
front of a mock classroom set up on the stage and peopled by black
and brown children who, as one convention theme had it, would not
be ``left behind.'' Heavyweight figures like Gen. Colin Powell and
Bush's top national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice _ both of
whom are black _ spoke. But the bench is not deep. J.C. Watts, the
only black Republican member of Congress and one of the
convention's chairs, was on a relentless schedule of preaching,
singing and speaking. ``They had J.C. Watts so spread out you'd
think that he was mayonnaise,'' Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer,
himself one of the chairs of the Democratic convention, told a
breakfast of Louisiana Democrats in Los Angeles. Indeed, the
extraordinary colors of the Philadelphia convention were ridiculed
all week here as a masquerade, a minstrel show, a lie and an
insult. ``If I could just get my administration up here, it would
be as diverse as anything you saw on stage a couple of weeks ago,''
joked President Clinton in his opening-night address to the
convention. ``And it would be real, too _ it would be real,''
delegate Rosemary Brooks-Bitting called out from the New Jersey
delegation. The Republican convention, she said, represented ``an
excellent job of copycatting,'' but she considered it cynical and
insulting. To Elsie Y. Cross, a pioneer in the field of corporate
diversity management, it is all ``very cynical.'' The Republicans
are not changing their policies, their attitudes or their culture,
just their pitch, she said. ``I don't think it fooled very many
people,'' Cross said of the convention in her hometown of
Philadelphia. ``It's all about shrewd marketing,'' said professor
Michael Eric Dyson, a cultual critic and writer at DePaul
University in Chicago, of the Republican effort. ``It speaks to the
need to have multiculturalism in the new millennium.'' But Dyson,
an observer at the Democratic convention, said that while the
Democrats are more skilled at manipulating the symbols of
diversity, he, like Cross, believes they use black and brown faces
in nearly as superficial a fashion. James Pinkerton, a Newsday
columnist who was a White House adviser to Gov. Bush's father when
he was president, said that while the Democrats this week cried
``hypocrisy'' over the Republican embrace of multiracial images,
the Democrats are in his view the greater hypocrites for stifling
any debate on issues like trade, on which Democrats are deeply
divided. While the party line in Los Angeles was that most
Americans saw through the ``phony'' diversity in Philadelphia, not
everyone was discounting that it could have serious consequences.
``The danger is that it will be politically meaningful in an
undeserved way,'' said Christopher Edley Jr., a senior policy
adviser to Gore and Clinton's leading adviser on race. The
Democrats enjoy a profound advantage over the Republicans in having
so many surrogate campaigners with a stake in the election's
outcome. Blacks were 20 percent of the delegates in Los Angeles and
only 4 percent in Philadelphia. A third of all delegates were ``of
color'' here. According to the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, of the Latino elected officials
who identify themselves with a party, 1,577 are Democrats and 134
are Republicans. Of the 19 Hispanics in Congress, 15 are Democrats.
In Congress there are 38 black Democrats and J.C. Watts. In the
state legislatures there are 564 black Democrats and five
Republicans. Asians vote more independently, but most prominent
Asian elected officials are Democrats and the Asian vote is
trending in that direction. All the Asians in Congress are
Democrats. ``I think it's up to the Democrats not to take the
minority vote for granted,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson,
who had aspired to become the first Hispanic on a national ticket
as Gore's runningmate. ``The Republicans are projecting an image of
inclusion,'' Richardson said. ``We have to have a clear message
that theirs is just show and ours is a reality. But in the age of
short attention spans and quick TV soundbites, I have to hand it to
them, they did a good job. They dented us a little bit. We have to
work extra hard.'' (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) ``George W. Bush is for
photo opportunies, Al Gore is for real opportunities,'' Joseph
Andrew, the party's national chair, told the convention's Black
Caucus. Los Angeles was ``the most diverse political convention in
the history of the world,'' Andrew said. California Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante told the Hispanic Caucus that Bush was making himself
out to be like Ricky Martin, but that anyone who thinks his
administration would be good for Latinos is ``living la vida
loca.'' Kathryn ``Cookie'' Manen'to, a black delegate from Chico,
Calif., and a former blues and gospel radio deejay, said she could
tell from watching the Philadelphia convention on TV that, while
the music on stage was OK, the rhythm on the convention floor was
not. ``They were trying to get their boogie down, but, come on
boys, that's not natural for you.'' In remarks before the Asian
Pacific Caucus, Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta, the first
Asian-American ever to serve in the Cabinet, said that while there
are distinguished Asian-American Republicans, they are less
connected to the grass roots. Many Republicans loved the line in
Condoleezza Rice's speech in which she said of the GOP, ``I found a

But, as respected as Rice and Powell may be, when it comes to

`THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY': IN THE FLAMBOYANT TRADITION OF
RICHARD PRYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The self-proclaimed Kings of Comedy in Spike Lee's concert film
``The Original Kings of Comedy'' couldn't be more resplendent in
the outfits they wear onstage. Filmed before a live audience on two
nights in February in Charlotte, N.C., Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley,
Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac swagger across the stage,
urban legends in outfits that can best be described as Mack-tastic,
suits that qualify as Players' finery. If there's any real
competition among them, it's in their suits.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the ``Kings'' tour last winter escaped media
scrutiny _ there was the odd condescending magazine piece _ despite
being one of the most profitable stage shows in recent memory,
showing the power and hunger of the African-American audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Until a couple of years ago, the comedians' exposure was limited
mostly to cable television; all the Kings have spent time on HBO's
``Def Comedy Jam,'' or in Hughley's case, BET's ``Comic View'' _
``Def'' gone even more ghetto. Here, their comedy gives audiences
that have never seen anything like it a hilarious window on a new
world.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, the star of ``The Steve Harvey Show'' on the WB network,
starts off the film as M.C. Harvey, who also patrols the perimeter
of the stage on ``It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' unleashing the
Sandman with his hook to snag minimally talented contestants
offstage. He wears a suit with a squared bottom and a single flap
across the bottom. (Later he changes into an off-white shadow
stripe number, as if preparing to star in an all-black version of
``Fantasy Island.'')
</P>
<P>
   With his flat-top fade haircut now trimmed so it's no longer
within range of air-traffic control, Harvey unleashes a shotgun
splatter of profanity. It may shock audiences who know him only
from ``The Steve Harvey Show,'' where he plays Steve Hightower,
rhythm-and-blues star turned teacher. (Perhaps it's because Harvey
and Hightower both dress as if they record for the rhythm-and-blues
label Philadelphia International.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is best at imagery. His upper lip curled so deep in
disgust that it cuts a dimple into his cheek, he begins by riffing
on ``Titanic,'' talking about how the band stayed on to play, a
notion he finds totally unbelievable. ``If Kool and the Gang had
been the band ...'' he says, then starts expertly wrapping the mike
cord around his arm, miming the packing up of stage equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that Harvey would play a former soul music pro on
his series. ``I'm a 1974 brother,'' he notes, referring to what he
considers the pinnacle of black music. In a recent performance with
the O-Jays at the Beacon Theater in New York City, where his love
of his fellow Ohioans and their classic soul lifted him, he almost
levitated as he reveled; when Harvey smiles, he goes into another
world.
</P>
<P>
   He swings into a definition of the differences between rap and
old-school funk, gracefully impersonating the Temptation Walk _
``five dudes and just one mike'' _ to the self-absorbed cacophony
of rap, where everyone has a mike and cannot be understood.
``Rappers make me sick!'' he says with a grimace, to a huge wave of
applause. (That remark has a special meaning for viewers of his
sitcom, where rappers turn up as guest stars.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvey is followed by D.L. Hughley, wearing a tan suit with
peaked lapels that could serve as ailerons. Again, those who know
Hughley from a sitcom _ ``The Hughleys'' in his case _ may blanch
at the banal profanity. They display their chops when they talk
about family, specifically African-American family with roots in
the South, which shows there's still something to the concept of
the monolithic black experience. (Harvey, who grew up in Cleveland,
and Mac, a Chicagoan, sound as if they came right out of the
South.) It's what gives these men a connection with the audience _
Hughley is on a high when talking about family behavior _ and shows
why their tour sold out on the order of the Steve Martin tours of
the 1970s. (A ``Queens of Comedy'' tour is tentatively scheduled
for next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The material on the cohesiveness of the black family is still
new to much of the country. But for those who have grown up living
what these comics talk about, this is a chance to see a part of
their lives exhibited in the mainstream and in the context of a
community of like-minded folks. (Given how quickly these extended
families are disappearing, it also suggests a sense of loss.) What
comes out of these comedians' hearts hits the most powerful chord,
and the audience wants more of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' debt to Richard Pryor's concert films is implicit; if
nothing else, it explains the downtown magnificence of their
apparel. Pryor found the true, idiosyncratic note and made it
universal. And despite what has been written about him as being a
scared, pathetic clown, in his performances the threat of physical
violence hung in the air; a friend once described him as the kind
who would take a gun to a prayer meeting. We may never see another
comedian comment so compellingly on his flamboyant
self-destructiveness, and so, in contrast, the Kings feel safe, not
challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's an energy that comes from their rapport with their
crowd. (And their ease with one another is apparent in backstage
interviews included in the movie.) There is also the connection
that comes from their wardrobes; with more pleats than a Catholic
schoolgirl uniform store, they are an expensively customized
version of what their constituency wears. Lee catches members of
the audience posing for the cameras in their concert wear, grooving
to the '70s music. The show, which played in four cities before
opening in New York and throughout the nation, was recorded on
digital video and transferred to film; it looks fine, but
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The show includes too much of the ``white people do act this
way'' brand of comedy, an idea that was best dismissed on an old
``Simpsons'' episode when a black comedian, standing before a brick
``Night at the Improv''-type wall, did a groan-worthy routine about
the goofy way whites drive and Homer, laughing himself silly,
gasped: ``It's true. We're so lame.'' There is some great material
from this perspective: Hughley notes that black people don't ski or
do other dangerous physical activities because they experience
enough peril just trying to get through the average day. ``Bungee
jumping,'' he says. ``That's too much like hanging.'' And the
remarkably genial Cedric, a light-on-his-feet big man, embellishes
the differences between hope and wish: White people hope that
nothing goes wrong and blacks wish someone would start some
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric simply has more bounce to the ounce than the others, and
his joy at playing to a crowd makes it clear why he's called the
Entertainer. Especially when he does a routine about smoking (``You
can't smoke nowhere on earf,'' he says, marking himself as a
California resident) that concludes with a brilliant physical bit
on a street corner player who makes every smoker's gesture a piece
of ghetto theater. He flies across the stage, scoring with small
points.
</P>
<P>
   Mac, in a taupe suit and chocolate satin shirt and tie, is the
most autobiographical of the group. He turns his comedy on himself,
and with a dignified short Afro replacing his messy perm of the
'90s, he is more in command than ever. He uses short, punchy
attacks to make his point about his feigned lack of interest in sex
_ sometimes shooting a happy wink to the audience _ and he sounds
like a preacher on a roll, using a melodramatic shortness of breath
to punctuate his stand-up. He sums up with a piece on the ubiquity
of a certain swear word, which he describes as ``a noun, a person,
place or thing,'' and then proceeds to give the heft of an
adjective and even transforms it into a split infinitive.
</P>
<P>
   His routine is the best shaped, and in his hands the cussing
isn't tiresome. Using it to make a point, he comes off as King of
Kings.

 &HT;    Chapel renovation brings Rothko's secrets to lightBy Jeanne
Claire van Ryzin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The windowless brick facade demands little attention.
Nestled in a tranquil, green oasis just a short distance from
traffic-choked thoroughfares, the Rothko Chapel offers an
unparalleled integration of modern art and architecture in the
service of spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by sturdy live oak trees and graced by a pool of
water in which Barnett Newman's rusted ``Broken Obelisk'' stands
sentinel, the small octagonal building is an oasis of meditative
stillness.
</P>
<P>
   Inside are 14 monumental paintings by the late abstract
expressionist artist Mark Rothko, which, along with the chapel,
were commissioned in 1964 by the visionary Houston art patrons John
and Dominique de Menil. The seven deep plum and seven ``black''
form paintings seem monochromatic, but their oblique rectangular
forms float against backgrounds of carefully modulated color. They
are at once puzzling and direct and reward those willing to lose
themselves in the infinite space they suggest. This ecumenical
sanctuary dedicated to human rights is a singular place apart _ a
place not to reflect but to clear the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an 18-month, $1.8 million renovation, the Rothko
Chapel is again open. And with the bustle of the opening
festivities now past, never has the synthesis of art and
architecture seemed more serene.
</P>
<P>
   The road to that repose, however, has hardly been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the de Menils hired the venerable architect Philip
Johnson to design the building. But when Johnson's designs were
rejected by Rothko (the two had quite an acrimonious relationship),
Johnson bowed out. Houston architects Howard Barnstone and Eugene
Aubry completed the plans as the painter demanded. Although Rothko
completed the paintings in 1967, the chapel didn't open until 1971,
a year after his suicide.
</P>
<P>
   From the instant the doors opened, problems percolated. The
air-conditioning system never kept pace with the sweltering Gulf
Coast humidity. Rothko's plan for a skylight underestimated the
intensity of the Texas sun and, although a baffle was added to
diffuse the light, the interior remained murky and unevenly lit.
Then a crack appeared in the northwest wall, and it widened almost
enough to see through, the result of foundation problems that had
caused half the chapel to sink nearly 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The unstable interior environment led to the art aging
prematurely. Just a few years after the chapel opened, a mysterious
white film appeared on the black form paintings. Complicating
matters even more, the largest paintings were originally installed
via crane through the skylight and could not be removed for
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, the chief conservator of the
Menil Collection, began a quest to solve the riddle of the white
film. But she had few clues. ``No one was certain how Rothko had
created these paintings. There were maybe a few people privy to the
type of materials the artist used in his new work,'' she said.
After much searching, Mancusi-Ungaro tracked down Rothko's former
assistant Ray Kelly in New York. Kelly agreed to come to Houston to
demonstrate Rothko's painting process.
</P>
<P>
   To make his black form paintings, Rothko daily mixed a new batch
of whole egg, dry pigment, oil paint and dammar resins, which he
then applied in thin coats over rectangular forms sketched in
charcoal. In the Menil's conservation lab, Kelly created small
simulations of the black form paintings, which Mancusi-Ungaro then
subject to harsh conditions in order to prematurely age them. And
once again, the whiting occurred. At first, Mancusi-Ungaro thought
the film was caused by dammar resins. But when she sent a sample to
chemists at Shell Oil labs, they discovered that fatty acids from
the egg yolk had migrated to the surface of the painting, thanks to
Houston's stifling humidity. A solvent to treat the paintings was
developed, and in 1987 the paintings were restored.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, the whiting reappeared. (The solution has
since been reapplied.)
</P>
<P>
   Before her death in December 1997, Dominique de Menil had hired
Houston architect James McReynolds, along with the London
engineering firm Ove Arup &AMP; Associates, to resolve the building's
problems. In January 1999, the chapel closed for restoration. To
shore up the foundation, new concrete foundation piers were sunk to
55 feet _ twice the height of the building. A new climate-control
system was installed, and glass doors were fitted inside the
vestibule to stymie the flow of air from outside. Contractors put a
large door in one wall so the paintings can be easily removed. And
the interior walls were troweled with gray gypsum, which simulates
the raw concrete Rothko intended for the space. Perhaps most
importantly, a new skylight fitted with a smaller baffle diffuses
the sunlight in a softer, more even cast.
</P>
<P>
   Now literally seen in a new light with their surfaces restored,
Rothko's monumental paintings seem not to be the somber,
dispiriting images many understood them to be. Says Mancusi-Ungaro:
``These paintings are not depressing. They are not a prelude to
Rothko's suicide. Instead, they are the culmination of his career _
the ultimate distillation of his ideas. He was leading our
attention away from color and toward the surface of the
paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the new materials and technique he used, Rothko
graduated beyond the brushy surfaces of his earlier work, creating
luminous flat surfaces that suggest infinite depth. And like never
before, that depth resonates with renewed spirit.

<P>
   Jefferson, the Democratic Party's founder, warned Americans
about political leaders who preach about religion.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his clear, strong views on religion's place in politics
into a model law on religious liberty, denouncing ``the impious
presumption of legislators and rulers, being themselves but
fallible and uninspired men ... setting up their own opinions and
modes of thinking as the only true and infallible.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 years later, Jefferson's concerns have special
resonance in a presidential race in which Democrat Al Gore, a
Southern Baptist who often talks about his devout faith, has picked
for his vice presidential running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the
first Jew on a major party's national ticket, who talks intensely
about his own religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who told a gathering of Black Caucus members here
that he is ``a very frustrated preacher,'' invoked God a dozen
times in his first public speech after Gore invited him to join the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing them are Republican Gov. George W. Bush, who calls
Christ his favorite political philosopher and who proclaimed last
June 10 ``Jesus Day'' in Texas, and his vice presidential running
mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. The Republican ticket
is depending heavily on support from the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the ongoing religious arguments over school prayer,
abortion, gay rights and moral values in general, and you have a
mix that is raising concerns among partisans on each side and
independent outside observers.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted in Virginia, Jefferson's statute said, ``No man shall be
compelled to support any religious worship, place or ministry
whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained or burdened in his
body or goods, nor shall suffer on account of his religion,
opinions or belief, but that all men shall be free to profess their
opinions in matters of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all too much for Barry Lynn, executive director of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State and a minister
in the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having an election for president, not selecting a
pastor for a church nor a rabbi for a synagogue,'' Lynn said.
``It's important to get off the religion talk and into talk about
policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn worries that the election may become ``a contest about who
can appear the most pious. That ought to be irrelevant to the
selection of presidential nominees. It sends the signal that Holy
Scripture instead of the Constitution is the basis for making laws,
and that is a very dangerous idea. This is still a democracy, not a
theocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredibly overdone, and Lieberman topped it all,''
said Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the
University of Virginia. ``If the Republicans did what Lieberman
did, I expect the American Civil Liberties Union would be all over
them,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's coming very close to the line of separation of church
and state, if it isn't crossing over it, and it's going to get
worse,'' Sabato said. ``You can see the direction we're moving.''
</P>
<P>
   It could become ``troublesome,'' agreed Thomas Mann, a political
analyst at the Brookings Institution. ``It's not there yet. Some
people are a little uncomfortable how we moved from intense
secularism to a period of intense religiosity. We'll go back
somewhere to a balance,'' Mann predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But given the nature and extent to which religion has been an
advantage to the Republicans, the Democrats are determined to wear
religion on their sleeves right now, but it does not threaten
separation of church and state. They're just self-consciously
engaged in sharing their religious concern on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It's troublesome to Morshed Alam, a Democratic convention
delegate from New York, who is a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``For power, politicians are trying to bring religion into
politics,'' Alam said. ``I think it is divisive and works against
inclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Mattie McGrady, a small-business owner from Troy, Ala.,
agrees. ``I don't think candidates should preach about religion,''
she said. ``America is supposed to be a melting pot, and we all
have a different religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Ismael Ahmed, of Dearborn, Mich., said, ``We are
starting to skate close to the edge'' because of the amount of
religiosity in politics. ``It has the effect of leaving some people
out,'' said Ahmed, who said he doesn't practice any religion
himself. ``We are a mixed society with mixed beliefs, and when
candidates preach you can feel a little outside the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Al From, the influential head of the Democratic Leadership
Council, an organization of centrist Democrats, said Republicans
have sought to ``take advantage'' of religion for political gain,
but he said he is not worried, ``yet,'' about the amount of
religious discussion in this campaign. ``This is a religious
country. It's not surprising that is reflected in politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said
there is too much ``religious pandering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see less of it,'' he said. ``I think there is a
difference between religious pandering and expressing your personal
relationship (with God) and your faith. Americans want to see that.
Letting the American people know about you and what place that
faith plays in your character and the things you believe in, I
think that's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Democratic convention floor, delegates had mixed
feelings. Dale Slaughter, an electrician from Bastrop, Texas,
wearing a beard, boots and a black T-shirt emblazoned ``Motorcycle
Rights Association Legislative Warrior,'' said he is the grandson
of a Baptist preacher and he objected to Bush's Jesus Day
proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wrong,'' Slaughter said. ``I don't think it's right to
push one religion on everybody else. Thomas Jefferson and that
bunch came out with a Constitution and a Bill of Rights that
include the separation of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate James Wall, a United Methodist clergyman from Elmhurst,
Ill., tried to put religion and political life into context.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are motivated, driven by, compelled by some kind of
center,'' Wall said. ``I am compelled by a moral center conformed
by my religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people have other moral centers, other Christian
beliefs, other Jewish beliefs, and so forth. Other people with no
religious moral center may have a moral center driven by philosophy
or some other principle. We all have some kind of motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall said Bush's reliance on Jesus as a political philosopher
was ``legitimate,'' but his proclamation of Jesus Day in Texas ``is
a different matter because what he's doing there is taking a
particular religious orientation and making it a part of the
state's activity. That is crossing the line of church and state
separation.''
</P>
<P>
   But religious discussion in campaigns is not harmful, Wall said.
``I think we ought to have religious feelings come out in the open
so people know where you're coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   According to Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, voters value
spirituality and want candidates to possess religious beliefs. At
both conventions, Luntz conducted focus group studies with swing
voters, recording their responses to the political speeches they
heard from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   These voters reacted sharply to religious rhetoric, Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on context,'' Luntz said. ``If you talked about
Bill Clinton's specific behavior and then you started to preach
about it, independents and Democrats responded very negatively to
that. But if you were talking about standards in general, without
mentioning Bill Clinton, then the reaction was completely positive.
Nuance matters,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Forget nuance _ candidates should keep religious pandering out
of political campaigns, insists Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   To him, the danger in political religiosity is that ``people who
do not feel as strongly or in the same manner as the candidates do
end up feeling like outsiders in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn sees irony that in Iran today people are rejecting
theocracy ``and here in the United States we are emphasizing it
more than ever in modern history.''

NO RULING IN TOYSMART CUSTOMER LIST CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A bankruptcy judge declined Thursday to make a final
decision on the proposed sale of Toysmart.com's controversial
customer database.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Trade Commission settlement would have allowed the
failed Waltham, Mass. Internet retailer to auction off the
information under certain restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Carol Kenner said there was no need to set guidelines
for a sale until Toysmart.com finds a buyer. Come back, she told a
group of attorneys, when there's an offer on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that deciding this in a vacuum _ without a
live, prospective buyer _ is unneccessary,'' Kenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com and the FTC had hoped to clear one roadblock to the
sale of the database. But now, ``we're back to where we started,''
said attorney Harry Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed that the court denied the
debtor's motion to accept the settlement,'' said Dana Rosenfeld,
assistant director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.
``However we believe we will have the opportunity to bring before
the court the need for privacy protections for the consumer list
if, in fact, the creditors are able to find a buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general from 45 states who oppose the settlement
claimed a temporary victory. They said Kenner's ruling prevents
Toysmart.com from selling the database without another court
battle. Litigation and unfavorable publicity also have chilled the
market for the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, the attorneys general have achieved their goal by
preserving the privacy rights of Toysmart's customers,'' said Tom
Reilly, attorney general for Massachusetts, which led the
objections of 43 states and the District of Columbia. New York and
Texas filed separately.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Toysmart.com had gathered names, addresses, and
e-mail addresses from customers, as well as information about their
children and shopping preferences. As a reassurance, it promised
never to share that information.
</P>
<P>
   But the cash-burning Internet business collapsed in May after
majority owner Walt Disney Co. yanked its support. And soon,
Toysmart.com's database of about 250,000 customers went on the
auction block.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the planned sale, the FTC sued
Toysmart.com. The two sides agreed to a settlement last month that
would allow Toysmart.com, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in Boston, to sell the data under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general and privacy advocates have rejected the
settlement, saying Toysmart.com customers should be notified and
given the opportunity to have their information destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Before Toysmart.com gained international notoriety, about five
companies, including Web stores, had stepped forward, said
Christopher Panos, an attorney for Toysmart.com's creditors. At
least one offered to pay more than $50,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there was interest before this hullabaloo,'' Panos
said. ``But they were frightened off.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand is now lackluster. A Disney subsidiary has said it would
pay $50,000 for the list and then have it destroyed, if no suitable
buyer emerges. But that offer received a cool reception.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities and consumer privacy advocates said a sale to
Disney still violates the Internet retailer's privacy policy. And
the bid was too low to please Toysmart.com and its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Disney officials, who were apparently miffed that their offer
was cast aside, have not expressed interest in increasing their
offer, according to sources close to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com isn't the only Internet retailer involved in the
online privacy debate. Following its collapse earlier this year,
British fashion e-tailer Boo.com sold information about 350,000
customers to Fashionmall.com. Lucy.com, Fusion.com, and Toys ``R''
Us have been accused of allowing market researchers access to
consumer data obtained from their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com's case has cast a dark cloud over the Internet
marketplace. Industry observers say investors and suppliers may
become increasingly reluctant to support Web-based businesses if
they believe they cannot recoup some of their losses in bankruptcy
court.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet shoppers say they have become choosier about where
to spend their dollars.

 &HT;    ON EVE OF U.S. VISIT, MEXICO'S FOX HE BACKS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL
WORKERS IN U.S.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox said Thursday
he supports a Democratic bill in the U.S. Congress granting amnesty
to undocumented workers, a proposal that could become a wedge issue
in the U.S. presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is certainly favorable toward the amnesty. . . . I
think it would be a great gesture by the United States. Let's hope
it happens,'' said Fox, who will travel to the United States on
Aug. 24 to meet with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic presidential nominee, to discuss the future of
Mexico's relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fox travels to Dallas, Texas, to meet with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican Party nominee, and Mexican
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that (an amnesty) would document an inevitable
reality that they (undocumented immigrants) are really there. And
in addition, it gives human beings an opportunity for development
without the uncertainty and fear they live in there,'' Fox said in
a meeting with foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office Dec. 1, also described his ambitious plans
for naming a ``northern border czar'' for Mexico to deal with
pollution, crime, migration and other key problems. While in
Ottawa, Canada on Aug. 23 _ then New York City, Washington, D.C.
and Texas _ Fox will also discuss his proposal that Canada and the
United States grant more legal visas to Mexican guestworkers and
eventually open borders to the free transit of workers like the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for a new amnesty for undocumented immigrants
working in the United States since 1986 _ many of whom are Mexicans
_ is backed by Congressional Democrats, who are planning to use it
as wedge issue against Bush and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are both fighting to attract Latino voters, who
have become increasingly numerous in states _ such as Texas _ that
will be key in the November election. So far, Republicans have not
supported the proposal, including Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee. Smith called an
amnesty in 1986 ``disastrous,'' and said it attracted more illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will become the first Mexican president in 71 years not to
belong to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI. A
conservative who has promised to preside over a pluralistic
government, Fox said he has no preference for who he'd like to see
win the U.S. presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the same, the Democratic and Republican parties,'' he
said. Known for his blunt and often spicy language, Fox smiled and
added: ``It's been said that I put my foot in my mouth sometimes.
But this time I'm not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trying to persuade the United States and Canada
to consider long-term changes in migration policy, Fox would also
like to beef up funding for a development bank set up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to stimulate job growth and
development in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better thing could happen to the United States than to
have a Mexico that's successful, a Mexico without poverty, a Mexico
without violence, a Mexico without drug trafficking, a Mexico with
opportunities for work for all, which would stop (illegal)
migration to the United States?'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with governments is we only see things as far as
our administrations,'' Fox said, urging the United States and
Canada to consider long-term planning.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe in 1970, he said, the wage gap between northern Europe
and southern Europe forced hundreds of thousands of illegal
immigrants from the poorer countries to flood into Germany,
England, Holland and other wealthier countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are only legal migrants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union budgeted $35 billion a year to stimulate
development in backwards countries, Fox said, which helped close
the wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was that gap closed? With solidarity, with brotherhood,
which is an element or value that's missing in the North American
Free Trade Agreement,'' Fox said. ``The North American Free Trade
Agreement . . . only has the bottom line, and that's what we have
to get past.''

   MAINZ, Germany _ The most expensive auction in history ended
Thursday, when six companies bid nearly $50 billion for licenses to
offer a new generation of wireless communications in Germany, the
biggest country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The bids exceeded almost all expectations, and far exceeded the
$35.5 billion paid by many of the same companies for similar
``third-generation'' wireless licenses in Britain in April.
</P>
<P>
   The results have already sent a chill through financial markets,
as stock and bond investors fret not only about the billions the
bidders spent on licenses but the additional billions required for
building the new networks in a brutally competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   The results are something of a defeat for Europe's two biggest
wireless players _ Deutsche Telekom AG, the former German telephone
monopoly; and Vodafone Airtouch PLC, which owns Mannesmann
Mobilfunk and is a neck-and-neck rival with Telekom in the German
wireless market.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had been intent on capturing enough licenses to
limit the number of new rivals to just four. Despite pushing up the
bids by nearly $15 billion since Monday morning, they failed to
knock out smaller players and must now face five competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Thursday's successful bidders will pay $15 billion
more than they would have paid if the bidding had stopped last
Friday, and they will have to deal with five rivals rather than
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``For consumers, the result promises the most intense
competition,'' said Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of Germany's
telecommunications regulatory agency and the auction's architect.
``This was the most favorable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The results Thursday, just four months after the British
auction, are only part of a much larger project. All countries
throughout the European Union, and eventually in Central Europe,
are awarding new licenses. Analysts predict the total cost of
licenses across Europe could reach $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which has 82 million people and is by far the biggest
country in Europe, is crucial for all rivals with pan-European
goals. Besides its size, the country is one of the most affluent in
the world, and its residents still use mobile phones less than
those of many neighboring countries. That gives it potentially more
room for growth.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the costs of controlling a continental chessboard are huge.
Beyond the cost of wireless licenses, the big players are spending
enormous sums acquiring existing carriers. Just Thursday, for
example, BT of Britain announced an agreement to pay 6.6 billion
euros for a controlling stake in Viag Interkom, Germany's
fourth-largest wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   That deal comes in the wake of France Telecom's recent purchase
of Orange PLC, which owns Britain's second-largest wireless
network, and Deutsche Telekom's bid to acquire a young U.S.
wireless carrier, Voicestream Communications, for $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of Thursday's winning bidders are intent on owning
pan-European and even global wireless networks. Besides Deutsche
Telekom and Vodafone, they include Mobilcom AG, a fast-growing
German telephone carrier that is backed by France Telecom; Viag
Interkom, now to be owned by BT; a consortium called Group 3G,
backed by Telefonica SA of Spain and Sonera Oy, the Finnish
telephone company; and E-Plus Hutchison, a consortium led by KPN
Mobile of the Netherlands, NTT DoCoMo of Japan and Hutchison
Whampoa of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, these new wireless networks will provide the capacity
and technology to offer far faster and more sophisticated data
services than those now available. Supporters of third-generation
networks talk of high-speed mobile Internet access, scores of
``mobile commerce'' applications and even the ability to receive
streams of video over a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, nobody is yet sure which services will prove
practical and what consumers will be willing to pay for them. But
most analysts say ordinary mobile telephone service will become
steadily cheaper and will no longer provide the booming revenue
that wireless operators have enjoyed during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The big bet is that as mobile telephones become almost
ubiquitous but far less profitable, exotic new data services will
more than make up for the difference.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If you don't believe that the average revenue per month will
double over the next 10 years, then there really isn't any point in
participating in the auctions,'' said Holger Grawe, a
telecommunications analyst at WestLB Panmeure in Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   He, along with many others, is convinced the bet will ultimately
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, investors are increasingly nervous.
Deutsche Telekom's stock has plunged by almost half this year,
mostly in the wake of the British auctions that generated
unexpected high prices. Duncan Warwick-Champion, a
telecommunications analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's in London, said all
the companies in Thursday's auction are poised for possible
downgrades in their credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vulnerable, Warwick-Champion said, is the Dutch
telephone carrier KPN, which has already teamed with BellSouth
Corp. to acquire control of the E-Plus wireless network in Germany.
But Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and BT will also be evaluated
for possible downgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these sorts of auctions are short-sighted and
counterproductive,'' said Eden Zoller, a senior consultant at Ovum,
a telecommunications research firm in London. ``They would all be
much better spending their money on developing new services.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the mammoth cost of wireless licenses in Europe,
investors are also digesting the impact of acquisitions like France
Telecom's purchase of Orange and Deutsche Telekom's plan to acquire
Voicestream. Deutsche Telekom's bid may be blocked by U.S.
regulators, adding to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Eylert, an executive at Deutsche Telekom who is also
chairman of an industry group called the UMTS Forum, said the
enormous license fees could put pressure on operators to build
their networks as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But other executives were clearly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have had it for 30 billion marks less,'' said Peik
von Bestenbostel, a spokesman for Viag Interkom, which had
announced several days ago that it would seek only two rather than
three licenses allowed under the bidding rules.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive, speaking privately, called it ``the worst
possible scenario'' _ high license prices and the maximum number of
competitors at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German government's scheme, 12 licenses were up for
auction but a company had to win two licenses to establish a
service. Theoretically, it was possible for four companies to
emerge with all the licenses, but most experts had predicted that
five companies would prevail _ two with three licenses apiece and
three smaller players with two apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinarily high prices, von Bestenbostel said
his company was ready to plow ahead. ``We think it is an
extraordinary opportunity, and we are ready for a market with six
players,'' he said.

 &HT;    ON EVE OF U.S. VISIT, MEXICO'S FOX HE BACKS AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL
WORKERS IN U.S.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox said Thursday
he supports a Democratic bill in the U.S. Congress granting amnesty
to undocumented workers, a proposal that could become a wedge issue
in the U.S. presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is certainly favorable toward the amnesty. . . . I
think it would be a great gesture by the United States. Let's hope
it happens,'' said Fox, who will travel to the United States on
Aug. 24 to meet with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic presidential nominee, to discuss the future of
Mexico's relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Fox travels to Dallas, Texas, to meet with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican Party nominee, and Mexican
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that (an amnesty) would document an inevitable
reality that they (undocumented immigrants) are really there. And
in addition, it gives human beings an opportunity for development
without the uncertainty and fear they live in there,'' Fox said in
a meeting with foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office Dec. 1, also described his ambitious plans
for naming a ``northern border czar'' for Mexico to deal with
pollution, crime, migration and other key problems. While in
Ottawa, Canada on Aug. 23 _ then New York City, Washington, D.C.
and Texas _ Fox will also discuss his proposal that Canada and the
United States grant more legal visas to Mexican guestworkers and
eventually open borders to the free transit of workers like the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for a new amnesty for undocumented immigrants
working in the United States since 1986 _ many of whom are Mexicans
_ is backed by Congressional Democrats, who are planning to use it
as wedge issue against Bush and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are both fighting to attract Latino voters, who
have become increasingly numerous in states _ such as Texas _ that
will be key in the November election. So far, Republicans have not
supported the proposal, including Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee. Smith called an
amnesty in 1986 ``disastrous,'' and said it attracted more illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will become the first Mexican president in 71 years not to
belong to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI. A
conservative who has promised to preside over a pluralistic
government, Fox said he has no preference for who he'd like to see
win the U.S. presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the same, the Democratic and Republican parties,'' he
said. Known for his blunt and often spicy language, Fox smiled and
added: ``It's been said that I put my foot in my mouth sometimes.
But this time I'm not going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trying to persuade the United States and Canada
to consider long-term changes in migration policy, Fox would also
like to beef up funding for a development bank set up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to stimulate job growth and
development in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better thing could happen to the United States than to
have a Mexico that's successful, a Mexico without poverty, a Mexico
without violence, a Mexico without drug trafficking, a Mexico with
opportunities for work for all, which would stop (illegal)
migration to the United States?'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with governments is we only see things as far as
our administrations,'' Fox said, urging the United States and
Canada to consider long-term planning.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe in 1970, he said, the wage gap between northern Europe
and southern Europe forced hundreds of thousands of illegal
immigrants from the poorer countries to flood into Germany,
England, Holland and other wealthier countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are only legal migrants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union budgeted $35 billion a year to stimulate
development in backwards countries, Fox said, which helped close
the wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was that gap closed? With solidarity, with brotherhood,
which is an element or value that's missing in the North American
Free Trade Agreement,'' Fox said. ``The North American Free Trade
Agreement . . . only has the bottom line, and that's what we have
to get past.''

   LOS ANGELES _'' And, in the category of most convincing
portrayal of a diverse and inclusive political party at a national
convention, the winner is ... Well, of course the winner is the
Democratic Party. They own this Convention in Philadelphia was,
``We're inclusive,'' the sledgehammer rejoinder at the Democratic
National Convention here was that when it comes to racial and
ethnic diversity, ``We're the real deal.'' But the contest that
counts, to be decided in November, is not a matter of whether the
Republicans can outdo the Democrats on diversity. They cannot.
Rather, it is whether the GOP can sufficiently burnish its image on
matters of race to keep pace with a changing America. It is an
America that is changing subtly in the warmer tones of tolerance
the electorate appears to desire, and unsubtly in the changing
complexion of a nation whose once-overwhelming whiteness diminishes
year by year. The Republican Party remains far whiter at its core
than the nation is, just as the Democratic Party is more
multiracial in its composition than America as a whole will be for
years to come. But the Republicans' anemic record in attracting
brown and black votes has its tactical advantage now. Why? Because
even a small improvement will look like victory and unnerve the
Democrats, who count so heavily on sweeping 90 percent of black
voters and big majorities of Latinos that they have nowhere to go
but down. Better yet for Republicans, if they succeed in upping the
ante on what Democrats need to do to keep black and Latino votes
from straying, they may force Democrats to make the kind of overt
policy commitments on issues of race and class that helped
Republicans win additional white votes in the past. However it
plays out, though, this summer's conventions may mark a signal
moment in American racial politics _ the point at the turn of a new
century when both major parties seemed determined to outdo each
other as celebrants of diversity. ``Demography is destiny,'' said
Frederick Lynch, a government professor at Claremont-McKenna
College. ``As far as being the white party,'' he said of the
Republicans, ``it's not going to get any better.'' ``They have
realized that they at least have to be perceived as inclusive, or
they are going to be irrelevant in the future,'' said Maria
Echaveste, the deputy White House chief of staff. ``The
demographics are telling.'' For decades, Republicans effectively
played off the image of Democrats as the ``minority'' party, the
hapless captive of constituent interest groups. President Clinton
moved his party away from that image. And at the same time,
America's Hispanic and Asian communities soared in size through
immigration and reduced the political burden of the Democrats'
reputation as the party of minorities. Republican strategists
decided they had to re-examine a strategy that depended almost
entirely on white voters. Among those setting the new GOP course is
Karl Rove, Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top strategist. In an
interview with The Washington Post in Philadelphia, Rove declared
that the ``Southern Strategy'' _ polarizing the electorate along
racial lines to win white votes _ was dead. The inclusionary tone
of this year's Republican convention was, in fact, first struck in
1996 in San Diego. But as former party chairman Haley Barbour noted
in Philadelphia, this time the message and messenger _ George W.
Bush _ are one. Still, as many news commentators in Philadelphia
noted, this year's convention _ which was chaired by a woman, a
Hispanic and a black _ sometimes verged perilously close to parody.
There were black preachers and church choirs and popular
entertainers. Abel Maldonado, a Hispanic Republican assemblyman
from California, delivered remarks entirely in Spanish. Laura Bush,
the governor's wife, delivered her speech to the convention in
front of a mock classroom set up on the stage and peopled by black
and brown children who, as one convention theme had it, would not
be ``left behind.'' Heavyweight figures like Gen. Colin Powell and
Bush's top national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice _ both of
whom are black _ spoke. But the bench is not deep. J.C. Watts, the
only black Republican member of Congress and one of the
convention's chairs, was on a relentless schedule of preaching,
singing and speaking. ``They had J.C. Watts so spread out you'd
think that he was mayonnaise,'' Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer,
himself one of the chairs of the Democratic convention, told a
breakfast of Louisiana Democrats in Los Angeles. Indeed, the
extraordinary colors of the Philadelphia convention were ridiculed
all week here as a masquerade, a minstrel show, a lie and an
insult. ``If I could just get my administration up here, it would
be as diverse as anything you saw on stage a couple of weeks ago,''
joked President Clinton in his opening-night address to the
convention. ``And it would be real, too _ it would be real,''
delegate Rosemary Brooks-Bitting called out from the New Jersey
delegation. The Republican convention, she said, represented ``an
excellent job of copycatting,'' but she considered it cynical and
insulting. To Elsie Y. Cross, a pioneer in the field of corporate
diversity management, it is all ``very cynical.'' The Republicans
are not changing their policies, their attitudes or their culture,
just their pitch, she said. ``I don't think it fooled very many
people,'' Cross said of the convention in her hometown of
Philadelphia. ``It's all about shrewd marketing,'' said professor
Michael Eric Dyson, a cultural critic and writer at DePaul
University in Chicago, of the Republican effort. ``It speaks to the
need to have multiculturalism in the new millennium.'' But Dyson,
an observer at the Democratic convention, said that while the
Democrats are more skilled at manipulating the symbols of
diversity, he, like Cross, believes they use black and brown faces
in nearly as superficial a fashion. James Pinkerton, a Newsday
columnist who was a White House adviser to Gov. Bush's father when
he was president, said that while the Democrats this week cried
``hypocrisy'' over the Republican embrace of multiracial images,
the Democrats are in his view the greater hypocrites for stifling
any debate on issues like trade, on which Democrats are deeply
divided. While the party line in Los Angeles was that most
Americans saw through the ``phony'' diversity in Philadelphia, not
everyone was discounting that it could have serious consequences.
``The danger is that it will be politically meaningful in an
undeserved way,'' said Christopher Edley Jr., a senior policy
adviser to Gore and Clinton's leading adviser on race. The
Democrats enjoy a profound advantage over the Republicans in having
so many surrogate campaigners with a stake in the election's
outcome. Blacks were 20 percent of the delegates in Los Angeles and
only 4 percent in Philadelphia. A third of all delegates were ``of
color'' here. According to the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials, of the Latino elected officials
who identify themselves with a party, 1,577 are Democrats and 134
are Republicans. Of the 19 Hispanics in Congress, 15 are Democrats.
In Congress there are 38 black Democrats and J.C. Watts. In the
state legislatures there are 564 black Democrats and five
Republicans. Asians vote more independently, but most prominent
Asian elected officials are Democrats and the Asian vote is
trending in that direction. All the Asians in Congress are
Democrats. ``I think it's up to the Democrats not to take the
minority vote for granted,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson,
who had aspired to become the first Hispanic on a national ticket
as Gore's runningmate. ``The Republicans are projecting an image of
inclusion,'' Richardson said. ``We have to have a clear message
that theirs is just show and ours is a reality. But in the age of
short attention spans and quick TV soundbites, I have to hand it to
them, they did a good job. They dented us a little bit. We have to
work extra hard.'' (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) ``George W. Bush is for
photo opportunies, Al Gore is for real opportunities,'' Joseph
Andrew, the party's national chair, told the convention's Black
Caucus. Los Angeles was ``the most diverse political convention in
the history of the world,'' Andrew said. California Lt. Gov. Cruz
Bustamante told the Hispanic Caucus that Bush was making himself
out to be like Ricky Martin, but that anyone who thinks his
administration would be good for Latinos is ``living la vida
loca.'' Kathryn ``Cookie'' Manen'to, a black delegate from Chico,
Calif., and a former blues and gospel radio deejay, said she could
tell from watching the Philadelphia convention on TV that, while
the music on stage was OK, the rhythm on the convention floor was
not. ``They were trying to get their boogie down, but, come on
boys, that's not natural for you.'' In remarks before the Asian
Pacific Caucus, Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta, the first
Asian-American ever to serve in the Cabinet, said that while there
are distinguished Asian-American Republicans, they are less
connected to the grass roots. Many Republicans loved the line in
Condoleezza Rice's speech in which she said of the GOP, ``I found a
party that sees me as an individual and not as a member of group.''
But, as respected as Rice and Powell may be, when it comes to
helping persuade other blacks to vote Republican, they command no
troops. Instead, Bush and the Republicans must appeal over the
heads of most black and Hispanic leaders and directly to voters. It
is not a strategy that can win the Hispanic vote, said Raul
Yzaguirre, head of the National Council of La Raza, but it can peel
off enough to make a difference. But Lynch thinks it is a mistake
to underestimate how far a Republican embrace of the diversity
ideal can take the party. Lynch, who examined the diversity
industry in his book ``The Diversity Machine,'' said the Republican
Party, like many other like-motivated corporations that embarked on
diversity campaigns out of ``business necessity,'' may find they
have unleashed forces they ultimately will be unable to control.
``I don't think they realize,'' said Lynch, ``that inclusion means
their party is going to change.''

   DEM-RDP (Los Angeles) _ Ledeall: Twelve years after his first

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ In frantic efforts against
increasingly hopeless odds to save the crew of the sunken nuclear
submarine Kursk, Russian rescue teams tried and failed through
another stormy night and throughout Thursday to lock onto a rear
escape hatch of the shattered vessel. New reports emerged of
catastrophic damage to the hull, suggesting the ship went down in a
torrent of fire and flooding that may have killed or mortally
wounded everyone aboard. The growing prospect that the crew may be
beyond rescue, making the sinking of the Kursk Russia's worst
peacetime naval disaster, generated a wave of recriminations
through the Russian news media. By Patrick E. Tyler.

   NY-CHARTER-SCHOOL (Undated) _ When Gov. George E. Pataki visited
the newly opened New Covenant charter school in Albany last fall,
he proclaimed it a model of the kind of educational change he was
trying to create. In the months following the visit, however, New
Covenant descended into apparent chaos, with fourth-graders scoring
among the lowest in the state on standardized tests, the for-profit
company overseeing the school resigning and two principals
quitting. How things went so wrong so quickly at New Covenant is a
cautionary tale for entrepreneurs, education reformers and
politicians who are tempted by the vaunted promise of charter
schools. By Edward Wyatt.

   LEE-TRIAL (Albuquerque, N.M.) _ A ruling is expected in the
contentious bail hearing for Wen Ho Lee, a former nuclear weapons
scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, accused of
illegally moving the secret data to an unsecure computer and
portable computer tapes, some of which are missing, with the intent
to harm the United States. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GRAND-JURY (Washington) _ In a development that is not
surprising but is nonetheless ill-timed for Democrats, a new grand
jury has been seated to consider evidence against President Clinton
in the scandal over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The
selection of the grand jury actually took place several weeks ago.
It came out Thursday as government officials disclosed that the
special three-judge panel overseeing the office of Robert Ray, the
independent counsel investigating the president, had determined
that Ray's office should not be shut down. By David Johnston.

ADVERTISING: FIRESTONE'S BIRTHDAY BUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIRE-RECALL) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing, as they say, is everything.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a jubilee year for Firestone. One
hundred years ago, on Aug. 3, 1900, to be exact, Harvey S.
Firestone established the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., and
Firestone was planning to celebrate that fact, in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Press kits went out to the media, point-of-purchase displays to
dealers. A special Web site, www.Firestone100.com, made its debut
in March, full of tales of past Firestone glories, as well as a
catalog of Firestone-related merchandise. And, of course, there was
the inevitable price promotion, offering tires that would normally
sell for more than $40 each at the cut-rate price of four for $100.
One hundred dollars, one hundred years _ get it?
</P>
<P>
   Then it all came crashing down. Firestone tires have been
implicated in 62 deaths and countless injuries. Now Firestone's ad
campaign is revolving around notices in 41 newspapers, detailing
the mechanics of a huge tire recall.
</P>
<P>
   So, is Firestone's 100th-anniversary celebration dead in the
water? Should it be?
</P>
<P>
   A few isolated birthday-themed ads were still cropping up on
local television stations last week, and a few dealers were still
advertising the four-for-$100 promotion in local newspapers.
Whether they were stubbornly supporting Firestone, or whether the
ads had been scheduled too far in advance to pull, was hard to
determine.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this week, Bridgestone/Firestone reacted to questions
about the centennial celebration as though it were an IRS
investigation. It refused to make marketing people available for
interviews, and its public relations people refused to discuss
whether the anniversary celebrations remained anywhere on the
burner, let alone the front or back.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising executives who represent Firestone refused to answer
questions, even if they had nothing to do with the recall. Even
Cullen O'Brien, an account executive with Laughlin/Constable Inc.,
which designed Firestone's 100th anniversary Web page months ago _
and thus could not possibly be accused of insensitivity in terms of
spreading anniversary cheer in light of a massive recall _
responded to a reporter's questions with a terse: ``Call
Bridgestone/Firestone. I will conclude this conversation right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: There is certainly no all-out
anniversary ad blitz. And marketing professors and crisis
management experts are having a lively debate over whether the
company is right to downplay its birthday now.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner stand those who say that anything smacking of
celebration had best be shunned. Susan Fournier, an associate
professor specializing in marketing at the Harvard Business School,
even thinks they should dismantle the Firestone100 Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lighting candles on a cake right now just seems so
opportunistic,'' she said. ``A birthday is a time for saying,
`Aren't you glad we were born.' It's an appreciative event, and a
lot of people just don't appreciate how slow this company has been
to tackle its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is the question of money. ``Every company
has a budget, and Firestone should be devoting all of its
advertising funds to the recall,'' said Gita V. Johar, an associate
professor of marketing at the Columbia Business School. ``They can
always let the dealers bring up the 100-year heritage in
conversations with customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, others say, they can bring it up later. ``Right now,
Firestone's customers are worried about safety, not discounts or
history,'' said Sanjay Dhar, a professor of marketing at the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. ``Let
Firestone spend its money on road safety campaigns, and celebrate
its 101st anniversary next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But face it _ a 101st anniversary simply does not have the
cachet of a centennial. And other marketing experts say the company
should still play the birthday for all it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to forget price promotions, or anything that looks
like they are patting themselves on the back,'' said Gary
Armstrong, a professor of marketing at the University of North
Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School. ``But they should try to
create a campaign that focuses on 100 years of safety, and good
relationships with customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that might be a bit dicey in itself. There's the
little matter of the massive recall of Firestone 500 radial tires
in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   With enough deftness, some say, Firestone could even turn that
into a virtue. ``The 100-year anniversary establishes a tremendous
credibility at a time that they have none,'' said Robert Marston, a
New York public relations consultant who masterminded the
centennial celebration for Procter &AMP; Gamble's Ivory Soap in 1979.
``They should get the CEO out there, apologizing to the public,
tackling the issues of the recall. But a 100th anniversary comes
just once, and they should use it.''
</P>
<P>
   And how, exactly, should they do that? ``They should take the
approach of `Every company with a proud tradition of 100 years of
service will stumble from time to time,''' Marston said. ``They
should say, `Together we surmounted the problems of the Firestone
500 and together we can get through this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even Firestone dealers agree to disagree. ``My job is to find
replacement tires for my customers, and I'm losing sleep over
that,'' said one dealer, who insisted on anonymity. ``Who's going
to think of birthdays at a time like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry M. Bauer, that's who. His dealership, Bauer Built Inc. in
Durand, Wis., has sold Firestone tires since 1945, and a few months
ago he contributed $5,000 to Habitat for Humanity in Firestone's
honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should object to their promoting their company,'' Bauer
said. ``Sure, they've got a problem now, but that's no reason to
back away from 100 years of success.''

sound is too sterile and compressed. ``Godzilla 2000'' is sort of
like a vinyl movie; although it contains computer-generated
effects, it looks pleasingly retro, with obvious miniatures,
occasional glimpses of latex, and awkward dubbing. It has a warmth

the serial-killer subgenre. At its best, it's a horrifically
gorgeous, masterful exploration of the dark recesses of the human
mind, a bold new direction for the horror genre. By TODD CAMP.

ISRAEL PRAISES CHINA'S EVEN STANCE ON MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ Shimon Peres lavishly praised China Thursday as he
finished a two-day visit intended to bolster Israel's ties with
this one-time foe and shore up global support for continued peace
talks.

   ``I feel China is a very friendly country with a very profound

minister who is now Israel's minister for regional cooperation,
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for President Jiang Zemin's call for
patience,'' he added, referring to remarks by the Chinese leader on
Monday, after a meeting with Yasser Arafat, and repeated to Peres
by officials during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   China's call for the Israelis and Palestinians to persist in a
search for peace despite the collapse of the Camp David talks last
month, diplomats here said, was intended to dissuade Arafat from
declaring a Palestinian state on Sept. 13, as he has said he would
do. Such an act would be likely to provoke a strong reaction from
Israel, hurting the chances for peace.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Jakarta, Indonesia, Arafat said he was
reconsidering the timing of declaring statehood after China and
then Indonesia joined a long list of nations urging him to back
off.
</P>
<P>
   Peres on Thursday praised Arafat for his apparent caution,
calling it ``a wise step.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been delighted with China's moderate diplomatic
stance, which in Israeli eyes validates the courting of a country
that until the late 1980s had championed Arab radicals.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Israeli officials said Peres' visit, part of a
quick Asian tour that also included Tokyo and Jakarta, was simply
intended to inform leaders about the status of Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But for Israel, the visit also offered a vital chance to shore
up the budding friendship with China. Relations were jolted last
month when Israel reneged on a $250-million contract to sell
China's military an advanced airborne radar system after protests
by the Clinton administration and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, China has moved past the humiliation and
continues to seek friendly ties. Officials welcomed Peres' offer on
Wednesday to promote new Israeli investment and agricultural aid in
China's underdeveloped hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   And most important, to the quiet satisfaction of Peres and his
colleagues, China took a temperate line on the peace talks in
successive meetings this week with Arafat and Peres, even as it
reaffirmed support for eventual Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since 1992, when China gave Israel formal diplomatic
recognition, Israel has cultivated ties with China, secretly
selling weapons and offering agricultural and other technical aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis see enormous significance in their relations with
China,'' said Michael Yahuda, professor of international relations
at the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, Israel sees friendly ties with this
largest developing country, with its permanent seat on the U.N.
Security Council, as blunting the often hostile stance of much of
the Third World.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past, too, China has been known for selling arms to
archenemies of Israel's, like Iraq and Iran. China has halted most
such sales, but according to U.S. intelligence agencies, it has
continued to provide some missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Peres said he had raised the missile issue with China's foreign
minister and had been assured that China would abide by
international agreements to prevent transfers of long-range missile
technology and nuclear arms. China has provided similar ambiguous
assurances in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at his news conference Thursday, Peres went out of his
way to praise his hosts. ``Israel has much admiration for China,''
he said, calling theirs ``a very special relationship.''

ECONOMIC COMMENTARY: WITH SLOWDOWN ENDING, CAN FED STAY FRIENDLY?

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the summer of our content.
</P>
<P>
   The widely heralded and eagerly welcomed economic slowdown that
arrived this spring has reassured investors. The Nasdaq meltdown
was followed by summer stabilization. Volatility is down, and so
are long-term interest rates. Initial public offerings are again
soaring; four have tripled in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   To Wall Street, all this is wonderful news. The slowdown has
sent Alan Greenspan back to his office, and the consensus is that
he won't raise interest rates again for a long time. Investment
banks are preparing road shows to push a new wave of technology
stocks after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   And the slowdown is vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the past year's Fed tightening was enough to slow the
economy, we wouldn't be seeing a steady upward march in
manufacturing output and capacity utilization, a resumption of
retail sales growth and a bounce in housing,'' says Bob Prince, the
research director of Bridgewater Associates, a money management
firm in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The signs that growth is again on the rise are still limited,
but it increasingly appears that the Fed's efforts to apply the
brakes gently have only slowed the economic engine a bit, and that
the engine's built-in momentum is again accelerating. Prince thinks
the economy is now growing at an annual rate of about 4 percent,
down from last winter but still above the gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The dot-com panic of the spring has gone, and though you won't
see any new offerings that rely on selling something to consumers
through the Internet, investors seem eager to buy companies that
say they are part of the Internet infrastructure. The success of
such stocks has helped to get retail sales moving again in a
continuation of the strong correlation between growth in retail
sales and the rise of the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy resumes its brisk growth, the first stock market
reaction is likely to be positive because strong business helps
corporate profits. But at some point, concerns about inflation will
begin to arise. That will be particularly true if the rest of the
world continues to grow. The overall rate of consumer price
inflation has been held down by cheap imported goods, whose low
prices reflected weak economies overseas. (In other words, if
you're a bull on American stocks, you should be rooting for a new
Japanese recession, or at least a European slowdown.)
</P>
<P>
   Already, the inflation rate on services, which are less prone to
competition from overseas, has been edging up steadily. If that
continues, the Fed is likely to take notice. It won't do anything
at the meeting next week, and it probably won't act on Oct. 3, only
five weeks before the presidential election. But its meeting on
Nov. 15, a week after the vote, could mark the start of a new set
of rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Prince says there have been three big sources of economic
stimulus from 1996 to 1999. The Fed was one, but it was the least
important. The others were the big increase in capital gains in
stocks and the similar increase in such gains from rising house
prices. Some of those capital gains are spent, expanding the
economy for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he thinks, if the Fed wants to slow the economy, it
will have to ``take away some of those capital gains in housing and
stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   To fight inflation, the Fed will have to slow the economy. And
the lesson of 2000 may be that to do that it will have to apply far
more pain than it already has. Next winter may not be as happy as
this summer has been.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The drive to the middle of the road by the
Democrats and Republicans has produced such a traffic jam in the
center lane that the parties are robbing each other's banalities
and cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Is it asking too much to expect our partisan leaders to elevate
the basic language of politics _ to come up with fresh ways of
saying the same old thing? Both Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush insist their campaigns are about the future,
but their talk is straight out of the past. Even the jokes are
stale.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was more fun when the candidates went directly at it,
verbal swords drawn, from the left and the right. This centrist
stuff forces them onto the same yellow line, with variations of
style and emphasis but very little room for inventive spark.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery.
Listen to them:
</P>
<P>
   Bush says ``I'm a different kind of Republican.'' Swell.
Different than whom? His father and President Ronald Reagan? Heaven
forbid. ``I don't think I'm reaching that far back in history,''
Bush says. Eight years is ``far back''? Then ``different'' in what
way? His policies sound like familiar GOP thinking, merely
expressed in a more polite manner than in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   He's distancing himself from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and the harshly partisan Republican Congress that twice closed down
the federal government, tried to impeach President Clinton and
earned a reputation for not doing much. But he can't bring himself
to say so and undercut GOP congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also likes to describe himself as ``different.'' In his
case, we know what he's talking about. It's the Clinton, stupid.
But he can't come right out and say what he means, either, or he
will look disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are substantive differences between the two
candidates. On national policy, Gore and Bush disagree on important
topics like taxes, education, Social Security, health care and
military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are papering over these disagreements to
make themselves look more like Democrats. And the Democrats are
overdoing the moderate aspects of their programs to make themselves
look conservative, if not exactly Republican. The homogenized
result is like a blended fruit smoothie _ you can't tell the
bananas from the cherries. This concoction may go down easy, but
you don't know exactly what you are swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why we get the kind of silliness we saw shortly before
the party conventions opened. In a rash moment, Gore promised that
if he were elected his administration would represent ``a fresh
start,'' a modest attempt to avoid another repetition of the
customary claim to be making a brave ''new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush professed to be astonished that Gore would use a phrase
that the Republicans had already been using. ``Unbelievable, isn't
it?'' Bush crowed, holding up a GOP campaign policy statement that
included the words ''a fresh start.'' How sad that this is what
passes for significant political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team practices its own word theft. The GOP platform
pledges to ``leave no child behind'' in access to education and
economic security. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton noted
pointedly that for decades the trademark of the Children's' Defense
Fund _ a Democratic-leaning organization promoting opportunities
for disadvantaged children _ was ``leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, President Clinton, the master wordsmith, didn't
get the prize for originality in his valedictory address at the
Democratic National Convention's opening night. Touting his
administration's record, Clinton added: ``As that LA detective Joe
Friday used to say, `Just the facts, ma'am.''' The remark drew
laughter from the crowd _ just as it had in 1988, when then-Vice
President George Bush, George W.'s father, used the same line in
his speech accepting that year's GOP presidential nomination. It
clearly doesn't take much to amuse political convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The basic campaign argument is about ``change.'' Both sides
claim that mantle but don't define it the same way. Voters like the
idea of forward motion and progress but they fear any radical
philosophical shift that might disrupt rather than improve the
status quo. So talking about it is tricky, or as Gore might say,
``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was mocked by Bush for overusing that word
and no ``risks'' were uttered in the series of surrogate speeches
at the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate, didn't
go near ``risky,'' preferring to fall back on all-purpose
``differences.'' As he gracefully put it, the two parties see
issues ``through a different set of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the best pitches for a transition from one
Democratic president to another was made by Bush's father as he
sought to replace Ronald Reagan in 1988. ``When you have to change
horses in mid-stream, doesn't it make sense to switch to one who's
going the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing that the Democrats haven't yet stolen that line.

THE SWAGGER AND SWAY OF A GOOD PREQUEL:STEPHEN HUNTER'S FOURTH
NOVEL COVERS HARD-BOILED TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
 SPRINGS KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BILL NORTON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot Springs, by Stephen Hunter (475 pages; Simon &AMP; Schuster;
$25)
</P>
<P>
   After the Japanese surrender in World War II, Earl Swagger
returned to Arkansas, a Medal of Honor around his neck and
survivor's guilt squeezing his heart.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants, he thinks, is to curl up beside his pregnant wife,
blank out the past and make the transition to ``real life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Swagger's fame as a warrior appeals to Fred Becker, an
ambitious prosecutor in Hot Springs who wants to sweep out the
gangsters, the gamblers, the hookers, bootleggers and pushers who
thrive in a city where vice is protected. Once the vice is
squelched, Becker plans to ride the cleanup to a higher political
office.
</P>
<P>
   Swagger takes Becker's lure and joins an ex-FBI agent in
training a squad of aggressive young cops in the craft of staging
raiding parties and of handling a Thompson .45 submachine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The action that follows in Hot Springs is vintage Stephen
Hunter. Spare but precisely drawn. So vivid it plays large in the
theater of the mind. Of the four thrillers Hunter has written
involving members of the Swagger family, this one most resembles
the prose of the hard-boiled crime novelists of the 1930s and the
'40s, the era in which this book takes place.
</P>
<P>
   As Earl Swagger prowls the streets of lush Hot Springs, he is
drenched in memories of his father, a sheriff, a lawman in public
who in private battered and belittled his sons, causing one to
commit suicide. And once a month he drove into Hot Springs,
indulging in the pleasures of the brothels and casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled throughout this novel are real-life celebrities who've
come to play in Hot Springs: Mickey Rooney, Alan Ladd, Bugsy Siegel
(whose Las Vegas would one day supplant Hot Springs) and Siegel's
plaything, Virginia Hill. Hunter even pulls Siegel and Swagger
together in several scenes that add to the rapidly building tension
pacing the novel.
</P>
<P>
   For readers unfamiliar with Hunter, who was born in Kansas City,
they can find even more, and sometimes more tightly drawn, action
in earlier novels that feature Earl's son, Bob Lee Swagger: Point
of Impact, Black Light, Dirty White Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Much like ``The Phantom Menace,'' the ``Star Wars'' film that
came out last year, Hot Springs is a prequel; that is, this story
takes place before the first three novels. Even in this fourth
Swagger episode, Hunter has lost none of his touch.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Springs is an action novel that is almost as hot as the
142-degree water percolating from the Hot Springs mountain.

MICHAEL REYNOLDS' WORK SPEAKS VOLUMES:LATE BIOGRAPHER WAS UP TO THE
TASK OF CAPTURING HEMINGWAY'S TEMPESTUOUS LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 HEMINGWAYBIOGRAPHER KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 STEVE PAUL  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   Editor's note: Ernest Hemingway
biographer Michael Reynolds died last weekend at 63. In July 1999,
Reynolds spoke at Unity Temple on the Plaza to celebrate the
centennial of Hemingway's birth and the release of Reynolds' fifth
and final volume of his biography. The event was co-sponsored by
The Kansas City Star. Senior writer and editor Steve Paul
introduced Reynolds at that event; the following is adapted from
that introduction.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If modern biography began with a book, Boswell's Johnson,
contemporary biography in England and America began with a bang _
the guns of the First World War blowing to pieces so many of the
men and the states and the attitudes and the values of the
Victorian world.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of Paul Murray Kendall, a professor who
wrote a wise little book called The Art of Biography. Kendall was
referring to Lytton Strachey, the British biographer who, to
Kendall, represented the ``triumph of the artist over the
accumulator.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if it isn't more than coincidence that Michael
Reynolds' all-consuming biographical subject also was shaped as an
artist and a human being in that big bang of the First World War.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway towered over 20th-century American life and
literature. To re-create his life in a biography must be one of the
most daunting tasks a scholar could choose to bring upon himself.
</P>
<P>
   And to write a major biography of Ernest Hemingway in the shadow
of Carlos Baker's major biography of Ernest Hemingway would make
the challenge even greater.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard Reynolds speak at a Hemingway conference in early
1999 at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, I was struck by his
admission that now that he had come to the end of Hemingway's life
in a span of five books, he was tempted to go back to the beginning
_ if not to start over then to do some rewriting, because he knows
so much more now than he did back then.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist who dips in and out of subjects as whim or need
arises might find it humbling to consider what Reynolds has done.
He virtually lived with Ernest Hemingway for more than a quarter
century. And as we know _ as each of Hemingway's four wives came to
know _ that is a difficult thing to do. Dawn Powell once jotted in
her diary this impression of a brief visit with Hemingway: `` ...
exhausted by his immense gusto _ someone who gives out more in six
hours than most people do in a lifetime _ leaves you groggy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Reynolds' achievements that he could capture the
energy of Hemingway's life and leave you not groggy but
exhilarated. Reynolds does not lecture or overanalyze. He lets the
life unfold dramatically. He provides context for understanding the
dynamics of Hemingway's life, but he doesn't speculate on motives.
It's perhaps a bit dangerous to say that he stays close to the
bull, but in fact if the bull is Hemingway and all his
complications, then that's exactly what Reynolds does.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' biography divides Hemingway's life into phases. Each
volume stands alone and tells its own story: The Young Hemingway,
The Paris Years, The Homecoming, The 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The last book, The Final Years, covers the period of 1940 to
Hemingway's suicide in 1961. Reynolds details the years of World
War II, when Hemingway chased German U-boats in the waters off Cuba
and then chased some kind of glory on the beach and in the
countryside of France after D-Day. Hemingway thought at the time
that he would die, that his luck had run out. Yet the death spiral
lasted another 15 years, a period when Hemingway's stature as well
as his troubles grew. Most of Hemingway's best-known work was
behind him, yet Reynolds makes the case that these last 15 years
were as creative as any period in Hemingway's writing life.
</P>
<P>
   I was told a story by one of Reynolds' former grad students that
may be indicative of the good fortune he has had with his biography
of Hemingway. It has to do with the time Reynolds visited the
Library of Congress in search of photographs of Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   He spent most of the day coming up empty. Near the end of the
day, a librarian happened to drop by to offer help and when told
what he was looking for, she said he was in the wrong place. She
led him to a basement room where he found a great picture of
Hemingway in Oak Park, Ill., after his return from the war. He
turned to thank the woman, but she was gone. On his way out of the
library, when he stopped to ask about her, no one could identify
the woman. For Reynolds, she was the angel librarian. All great
biographers must hope to have one. For as one old master, Thomas
Carlyle, put it, ``A well-written life is almost as rare as a
well-spent one.''

Recent and noteworthy book releases FICTION
<TEXT>
<P>
   - Out of Nowhere, by Keith Botsford (296 pages; Toby Press;
$15.95). Botsford lives in Boston and shares editing duties of The
Republic of Letters with a fellow named Saul Bellow. In this
collection Botsford shares four strangely satisfying long stories
with readers who won't regret getting to know his seemingly easy,
graceful ways with words and characterization.
</P>
<P>
   - Iron Shoes, by Molly Giles (240 pages; Simon &AMP; Schuster; $22).
Molly Giles is a proven talent of the short story; her collection
Rough Translations was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Now she
tries her hand at the novel form with a story about a woman who
hits age 40 at the same time she crashes into disillusionment,
guilt, marital problems and more. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   - For the Love of Money, by Omar Tyree (413 pages; Simon &AMP;
Schuster; $24). Remember Tracy Ellison, better known as Flyy Girl?
Author Omar Tyree returns to the teen heroine, who of course is no
longer a teen, and follows her adventures and misadventures in a
fast-paced novel that is absolutely packed with dialogue.
NONFICTION
</P>
<P>
   - Nymphomania: A History, by Carol Groneman (238 pages; W.W.
Norton; $24.95). Provocative title for a provocative subject.
Nymphomania has been classified at various times as a disease, a
psychological disorder, a sexual addiction or simply a construct of
patriarchal society bent on keeping the female libido in check.
Groneman looks at how women's sexuality has been defined, co-opted
or distorted, by men but also by women themselves.
</P>
<P>
   - Flophouse: Life on the Bowery, by David Isay and Stacy
Abramson with photographs by Harvey Wang (157 pages; Random House;
$24.95). This is the America that most Americans have forgotten _
or would like to forget. The authors and photographer make it
difficult to ignore the poverty and despair of New York City's the
Bowery. Changes in building codes mean that flophouses soon will be
a thing of the past _ but the poor will always be with us.
</P>
<P>
   - Along Route 66, by Quinta Scott (308 pages; University of
Oklahoma Press; $34.95). I did not travel Route 66 as a child, but
I am barely old enough to remember long trips between St. Louis and
Kansas City along the old U.S. 40, before Interstate 70 was
completed. It was a different world, one that existed before the
dominance of the gasoline and fast-food and motel franchises. The
tiny roadside inns, eateries, taverns and root-beer stands in this
book will be achingly familiar to anyone who ever traveled a
two-laner in those old roads' heyday. And of course Route 66 was to
many folks the greatest road of all, stretching from Chicago, down
through Illinois to St. Louis, on through Missouri to Joplin, into
a tiny corner of Kansas, and onward through Oklahoma, Texas, New
Mexico and Arizona, all the way out to Santa Monica, Calif. This is
no book, but rather a time machine.

&HT;     THE CAMPAIGN OF DUELING CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: This is a SUB for version that moved earlier)  
 &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The drive to the middle of the road by the
Democrats and Republicans has produced such a traffic jam in the
center lane that the parties are robbing each other's banalities
and cliches.
</P>
<P>
   Is it asking too much to expect our partisan leaders to elevate
the basic language of politics _ to come up with fresh ways of
saying the same old thing? Both Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush insist their campaigns are about the future,
but their talk is straight out of the past. Even the jokes are
stale.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was more fun when the candidates went directly at it,
verbal swords drawn, from the left and the right. This centrist
stuff forces them onto the same yellow line, with variations of
style and emphasis but very little room for inventive spark.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery.
Listen to them:
</P>
<P>
   Bush says ``I'm a different kind of Republican.'' Swell.
Different than whom? His father and President Ronald Reagan? Heaven
forbid. ``I don't think I'm reaching that far back in history,''
Bush says. Eight years is ``far back''? Then ``different'' in what
way? His policies sound like familiar GOP thinking, merely
expressed in a more polite manner than in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   He's distancing himself from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and the harshly partisan Republican Congress that twice closed down
the federal government, tried to impeach President Clinton and
earned a reputation for not doing much. But he can't bring himself
to say so and undercut GOP congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also likes to describe himself as ``different.'' In his
case, we know what he's talking about. It's the Clinton, stupid.
But he can't come right out and say what he means, either, or he
will look disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are substantive differences between the two
candidates. On national policy, Gore and Bush disagree on important
topics like taxes, education, Social Security, health care and
military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans are papering over these disagreements to
make themselves look more like Democrats. Andthe Democrats are
overdoing the moderate aspects of their programs to make themselves
look conservative, if not exactly Republican. The homogenized
result is like a blended fruit smoothie _ you can't tell the
bananas from the cherries. This concoction may go down easy, but
you don't know exactly what you are swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   That is why we get the kind of silliness we saw shortly before
the party conventions opened. In a rash moment, Gore promised that
if he were elected his administration would represent ``a fresh
start,'' a modest attempt to avoid another repetition of the
customary claim to be making a brave ''new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush professed to be astonished that Gore would use a phrase
that the Republicans had already been using. ``Unbelievable, isn't
it?'' Bush crowed, holding up a GOP campaign policy statement that
included the words ''a fresh start.'' How sad that this is what
passes for significant political dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team practices its own word theft. The GOP platform
pledges to ``leave no child behind'' in access to education and
economic security. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton noted
pointedly that for decades the trademark of the Children's' Defense
Fund _ a Democratic-leaning organization promoting opportunities
for disadvantaged children _ was ``leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, President Clinton, the master wordsmith, didn't
get the prize for originality in his valedictory address at the
Democratic National Convention's opening night. Touting his
administration's record, Clinton added: ``As that LA detective Joe
Friday used to say, `Just the facts, ma'am.''' The remark drew
laughter from the crowd _ just as it had in 1988, when then-Vice
President George Bush, George W.'s father, used the same line in
his speech accepting that year's GOP presidential nomination. It
clearly doesn't take much to amuse political convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The basic campaign argument is about ``change.'' Both sides
claim that mantle but don't define it the same way. Voters like the
idea of forward motion and progress but they fear any radical
philosophical shift that might disrupt rather than improve the
status quo. So talking about it is tricky, or as Gore might say,
``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was mocked by Bush for overusing that word
and no ``risks'' were uttered in the series of surrogate speeches
at the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate, didn't
go near ``risky,'' preferring to fall back on all-purpose
``differences.'' As he gracefully put it, the two parties see
issues ``through a different set of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the best pitches for a transition from one
Democratic president to another was made by Bush's father as he
sought to replace Ronald Reagan in 1988. ``When you have to change
horses in mid-stream, doesn't it make sense to switch to one who's
going the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing that the Democrats haven't yet stolen that line.

   GORE _ Spot coverage of Al Gore and Joe Lieberman's campaign
trip down the Mississippi River. (Shepard, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY-RECORD _ Cursory looks at Dick Cheney's voting record
reveal a very conservative record on certain social issues. But
examining his full record across a broad spectrum illustrates he
was even more of a voice in the wilderness. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25.

   ADULT-STUDENTS _ WASHINGTON _ Older students are changing higher
education, and it is changing them. This fall, more than 40 percent
of the students at the nation's 2-year and 4-year colleges and
universities will be 25 or older, according to the Education
Department. Most of them work, commute to classes and raise kids.
Why and where they go, and what the impact is. (Mollison, Cox News

   ADULT-SINCLAIR _ DAYTON, Ohio _ On campus or via the internet,
students from near and far flock to Sinclair Community College, the
only two-year college among six cited nationally for ``best
practices'' in serving adult students. Its 21,000 students include
8,000 in their 20s, 3,700 in their 30s and 4,000 older than that.
How Sinclair accomodates their needs. (Jo Smith, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   ADULT-TYPICAL _ Theresa Johnson works. She's 36. She is divorced
and raising two kids. She's an undergraduate at Iowa State
University. In other words, she fits the College Board's composite
criteria for the typical adult college student. Johnson fervently
believes that the pros of attending a university with schedules and
programs heavily weighted toward much younger students still
outweigh the cons. (Mollison, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   GA-EXECUTION _ Alexander Williams was not yet an adult and he
was mentally ill when he kidnapped, raped and murdered a
16-year-old Augusta, Ga., girl. His lawyers argue that the state's
plan to execute him on Thursday violates international common
decency that says it's wrong to execute the mentally ill and
children _ or those who commit crimes before they are adults.
(Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 35. WITH PHOTO (mug of
Williams).

<P>
   MINER-URANIUM _ A Moab, Utah, man might die before he can get
the $100,000 payment he's due from the federal government for his
work in uranium mines during the Cold War. His attorney has been
unable to prod a Senate Committee to break out of budget lockstep,
but there might be a glimmer of hope from another senator. (Grand

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS_ From the tropical coast to the Mayan highlands,
the fever for political change _ through ballots, not bullets _ is
sweeping Mexico's Chiapas state. On Sunday, Aug. 20, the state
famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will elect a new
governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic opposition victory
in last month's presidential election, polls show that change could
be contagious: Even in Indian communities once under tight control
by the ruling party, posters for a Fox ally are up on dirt-floor
homes. An old man wearing a ruling party shirt says he's not so
sure he'll vote for that party now. Chiapans appear to be slightly
favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party member who is now
representing an alliance that includes Fox's conservative National
Action Party and the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party. If
Salazar wins, one of the main reasons for the Zapatistas rising in
protest is eliminated. Mexico's ruling party would be ousted from a
state infamous for its ruling-party corruption and grinding social
inequality. A historic new Fox-Salazar combination would be in
place that could usher in new negotiations with the rebels.

   TWINS _ WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
booksignings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their
semi-regular reunions in White Plains Saturday, it's actually a
pretty familiar story around these parts: The one about strong
family bonds. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   SCHOOL-ADVICE _ With the school year approaching, it's time for
teachers and parents to reopen the lines of communication. To save
everyone time and stress, we asked working teachers and frenzied
moms and dads exactly what advice they would give the other side in
order to make this school year the most productive ever. (Dayton
Daily News) WITH ILLUSTRATION.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-COMPASS _ You may remember a time when you were a kid
and you got a toy compass maybe from the neighborhood candy store
or maybe even from a box of Cracker Jacks. Those cheesy little
devices featured a jiggling needle balanced on a pin, and the
painted end of the needle always pointed north. Unless there was a
magnet nearby or the needle fell off the pin. Today you can carry
around a digital device that does the same thing more reliably. The
Co-Pilot from Precision Navigation Inc. gives you a digital readout
that tells you exactly which way you're headed with an accuracy of
plus or minus 5 degrees. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 12. WITH

are part of a Fall Getaways package of the Southeast Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ABINGTON _ ABINGTON, Va. _ It is an unseasonably cool,
moonless night in this historic Blue Ridge Mountain town, a good
evening for a ghost tour in this old place that seems to have more
than a healthy share. Named Abingdon in honor of Martha
Washington's ancestral home in England, this mountain town is home
to the Barter Theater, the Martha Washington Inn and other
intriguing historic places. (O'Briant, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BLOWROCK _ BLOWING ROCK, N.C. The legend goes that a
Cherokee brave dived off the Blowing Rock to appease his gods and
was caught in an updraft so powerful that he was lifted back to his
sweetheart's arms. I wasn't feeling quite that lucky on my visit to
this popular Blue Ridge Mountains attraction. In fact I hung on to
the flat, upturned rock _ the parapet, it seemed, of a mighty
castle _ for dear life. (Hulbert, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BLUERIDGE _ BLUE RIDGE, Ga. _ There it is, tucked into
the trees just off the road: Our pine-log-sided North Georgia cabin
with a red tin roof. Up the Creek, it's called. Clambering out of
the car and racing to the porch, we hear the soothing sounds of Hot
House Creek. Wooden stairs from the lower deck lead directly to the
chilly waters. (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CASHIERS _ CASHIERS, N.C. _ Visiting the High Hampton Inn
&AMP; Country Club, a 1,400-acre antebellum estate that will fill your
belly three times a day and house you in a rustic cottage free of
certain conveniences. ``Son,'' I told our 12-year-old before we
left, ``this resort where we're staying is going to cost about $350
a night and it won't have a telephone or a television.'' It was
enough to turn his face away from the computer screen. ``You're
kidding, right?'' (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-HENDERSONVILLE _ HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. _ The social
``hour'' at the Waverly Inn was already two hours old when those of
us rocking and sipping wine on the porch decided to move the party
a few blocks down Main Street to the Monday-night street dance.
That's right, a street dance. On a Monday night. That's the kind of
place this is: a small mountain town in the heart of North Carolina
apple country, where hundreds of folks cut a rug (or just watch
from lawn chairs) during the street dances (continuing through
Labor Day). (Thrasher, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-MAGGIEVALLEY _ MAGGIE VALLEY, N.C. _ The Smoky Mountains
look different from the back of a horse. Lovelier. Less familiar.
Maybe it's because this place, the 1,000-acre Cataloochee Ranch, is
so close to paradise you half-expect to enter it through pearly
gates. (Hamilton, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ROOFTOP _ ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ If you're heading here to
look at the fall leaves, one of your best viewing sites might be
from the roof of the Biltmore House. That's right. The roof. The
guided 75-minute Rooftop Tour will take you up amid the turrets and
gargoyles, where you can get a panoramic view of the gardens, the
French Broad River and Mount Pisgah. (O'Briant, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-LITTLE-SWISS _ LITTLE SWITZERLAND, N.C. _ Other places in
the North Carolina mountains are better-known, but none are like
this faux-alpine hideaway nestled at 3,500 feet in the southern
Appalachians. It brims daily with color and tranquillity. In the
fall, especially, Little Switzerland, just off the Blue Ridge
Parkway, is a place many folks come for a long weekend. Many come
to like it so much they plan ahead, booking a week at the
Switzerland Inn or another nearby mountain lodge. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-TOWNSEND _ TOWNSEND, Tenn. _ The campfire is a portable
propane model that looks like something out of the Flintstones. The
moonlit mesa is in truth a screen-printed mural. But the guy in the
black chaps, vest and tall cowboy hat, the fellow spinning cowpoke
tales as tall as a saguaro cactus, stories that roll on like
tumbleweeds,he's got this western thing down. Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for tonight's headliner, cowboy poet
extraordinaire David ``Buffalo Bill'' Nelson. Oh, by the way,
Buffalo, er, David is also your innkeeper. He and wife Jean operate
the western-decorated B&AMP;B Abode and Beyond, here near the entrance
to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. (Pousner, Atlanta

   ABORIGINE-ART _ Thirty years ago, an art professor encouraged a
group of Aborigines in the central desert of Australia to paint on
canvas the symbolic patterns their people had been making in the
red dirt for eons. The dirt patterns evolved into dot paintings, a
popular form of folk art that has become synonymous with Australia
and will figure prominently in the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival. We
look at the field, which has interesting parallels with the artwork
that won praise at the last Olympics: Southern folk art.

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ Who was Deep Throat, the unnamed source who met
Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward in an underground parking
garage at 2 in the morning? Did he even exist? Was he one person or
a composite of two or more? Was he a only a fiction created as a
linchpin for Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book ``All the King's
Men''? Now Leonard Garment, an old Nixon hand who has made Deep
Throat his personal quarry, thinks he knows. ``In Search of Deep
Throat'' (Basic Books, $25) is a lawyerly deduction from plausible
hypotheses but in the end an intuitive guess. ``It is my
conviction,'' Garment writes on page 2, ``that Deep Throat ... was
John Sears.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26

`CELL' DIRECTOR MAKES DEBUT ON THE DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 TARSEM KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   When it comes to making music videos
like REM's ``Losing My Religion'' or award-winning TV commercials,
Tarsem is an acknowledged master.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feature films, though, are something else entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty steep learning curve,'' the India-born Tarsem
(his full name is Tarsem Singh) said in a recent telephone
conversation about his big-screen debut, the psychological thriller
``The Cell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music videos and commercials are about cramming in as much
visual information as you can in a limited amount of time. But
there's no such thing as a perpetual climax. You try to do that for
an hour and a half, and the audience is throwing up after 20
minutes. You need to let a feature film develop on its own terms,
at its own speed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cell'' provided Tarsem with a directing crash course. The
tale of a psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) who is able to meld her
mind with that of a comatose serial killer offered plenty of
opportunities for Tarsem to fashion a surreal dreamscape. But the
rest of the film takes place in the real world, and he found
himself deliberately slowing the pace of those scenes.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he had to learn to handle actors. Not models or
musicians who serve as chess pieces that can be moved around at
will, but actors whose job is to develop believable characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, actors want their moment,'' Tarsem said. ``I got
complaints from the actors if I didn't give them room to perform.
They don't want to be puppets. They want to be people.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wasn't prepared for that. The one thing I'll fight for
in the future is rehearsal time. That's what I really missed.
Basically we had to rehearse on the set. I finally got what I
wanted, but it was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarsem said he views ``The Cell'' _ especially its eye-popping
fantasy sequences _ as a sort of grand opera. ``I adored Francis
Coppola's `Dracula' and made it my model. And of course there's no
such thing as a subtle opera.''
</P>
<P>
   But to make viewers accept the outrageous inner world of a
serial killer, in which the madman envisions himself as a sort of
dark emperor, Tarsem said he had to make the real-world scenes
gritty and believable. And he had to make Vincent D'Onofrio's
murderer about as ghastly a specimen as moviegoers had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make him terrible. Some of the things we did didn't
even get in the American cut. But I knew if I was going in for the
operatic look in the fantasy sequences, I had to make Vincent so
bad up front that when he shows up later in wild, exotic costumes,
people wouldn't laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his first taste of working with a big studio, Tarsem said
that overall it was ``brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not show business, it's business show,'' he said. ``If
you want to make an art-house film, do it with Dad's money. Or make
it low budget, not with $40 million. I pretty much knew what the
studio wanted and worked within their boundaries. They said, `Make
me a dark film.' I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my next film will probably be very small, very intimate.''

THE LIPS HAVE IT:CHOOSE YOUR LIPSTICK, CHOOSE YOUR MOOD, FROM A
VARIETY OF NEW CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
 LIPSTICK KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star   It has always left telltale stains
on shirt collars and, when it's a glistening red, had a sexual
overtone and was the signature of writer Joan Collins. But the
world is changing by the minisecond, and that lipstick on your
dressing table is evolving about as fast.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the Fire and Ice of the '50s, the frosted pinks of the
'60s and the soft creamy natural you've been wearing since you
discovered makeup. The newest pucker-up products are not your
mother's lipsticks.
</P>
<P>
   With literally dozens of new cosmetics products flooding the
market and easy access to most lines via the Internet,
manufacturers are pushing hard to differentiate their products.
Lipsticks and glosses come with flavors as enticing as Ben &AMP; Jerry
ice creams (marshmallow creme?), skin treatment formulations, party
glitter, sun protection, breath fresheners and even mood lifters.
They are often packaged for double duty as lip color, blush and eye
touch-ups.
</P>
<P>
   New products carry promises to stay put from dawn past dusk and
to never bleed onto your chin or feather. Furthermore they are
promoted with celebrity tie-ins: Jennifer Aniston's wedding color
from Cargo here, or Lorac's ``Rene'' color, inspired by Rene Russo,
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is multifunctional. Everybody is looking for more
benefits than just color,'' says Anne Nugent, public relations
spokeswoman for Naturistics, a drugstore line of lip colors that
includes glitter and flavors such as Banana Berry and Melon Tease.
</P>
<P>
   ``People reach for lipsticks serving a lot of different
functions,'' says Michelle Rack, senior artist for the MAC ``Pro
team'' out of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that color doesn't matter. In fact, fall signals a new,
darker, richer opaque palette to go with the shift to dressier luxe
looks that dominated fall fashion runways.
</P>
<P>
   But once you settle on a great flattering shade, you'll have
other options: Lancome's long-lasting, sheer, moisturizing
``weightless'' color, for instance, or Lauder's LipBlush SPF 15,
which boasts moisturizer, conditioning, long-term wear, vitamins
and SPF 15.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the industry was turned on its ear by Lauder's
new Go Pout, a lip color alleged to create the illusion of a puffy,
pouty, starlike mouth without the benefit of collagen or fat
injections.
</P>
<P>
   But the field is broad and diverse. Tony and Tina lipsticks
(www.ibeauty.com) are called Mood Balance, with ingredients such as
lavender and St. John's wort.
</P>
<P>
   Shu Uemura has a pre-color treatment, Lip Fix (www.sephora.com),
with the likes of jojoba oil, chamomile and vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
   Aveda has added peppermint flavor to some lipsticks. The Body
Shop has Lip Scuff, an exfoliator and moisturizing treatment with
avocado, macadamia nut oil and, finally, as a cool-down, spearmint.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging is a big factor in enhancing product image and
customer appeal. Physicians Formula, a mass-market line, is
marketing Lip Spectrum, a compact of four colors with the claim
that you can create 100 different colors by combining.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't pack an extra wallop with special ingredients, a
product can still be sold with the sizzle of celebrity association.
Makeup artist Carol Shaw's line is tying big names to her colors by
saying they are ``inspired by'' such and such actor or model. In
Style magazine has only to mention a makeup in connection with an
actress or model and the product gets the rush.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo (www.sephora.com) recently solicited actress Courteney Cox
Arquette (``Friends'') and a group of Hollywood makeup artists to
provide new star-connected shades. Arquette created an iridescent
berry called cece, said to match a sofa in her home.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup artist Robin Siegel offered Plume, the honey shade
Aniston apparently wore during her recent wedding ceremony. And the
grape-toned Voyage is billed as the favorite of Courtney Love and
Tori Amos. A portion of the proceeds from the group will go to
Children's Miracle Network, an organization that raises funds of
children's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity sells,'' says Paula Begoun, a cosmetics consumer
advocate and author of Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without
Me. It's no accident actresses have become the magazine cover girls
of today, she says, and get big contracts to appear in cosmetics
ads. More than ever before, cosmetics companies are capitalizing on
the name game.
</P>
<P>
   But does it make the lipstick better or more flattering.
Probably not. And neither do many of the other claims, says Begoun,
who says she is conducting ongoing product tests for a book update
due out in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   As for the flavors? Should young people eat the stuff? she
wonders. As for the longevity, she's skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a lipstick that survives a hot dog, a coffee and
doughnut in the morning.'' Only one product, a lip stain from Lip
Inc., holds up _ up to 36 hours, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly lipsticks have come a long way since cosmetics became
acceptable in polite society in the late decades of the 19th
century. Indeed they are even a remarkable far cry from the old
Fire and Ice, which Revlon founder Charles Revson used in 1952 to
give lipstick a new sensuality. Lois Banner, author of the 1983
book American Beauty, writes that Revlon ads for the deep red color
raised the sexuality bar when they paired the product with a model
in a silver dress and scarlet cape and a suggestive questionnaire,
``Are You Made for Fire and Ice?''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    What a difference two weeks and the Democratic Party make.
 &HT;    ``I am honored to speak here as a gay American,'' said Elizabeth
Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay-rights advocacy organization.
 &HT;    Birch made history this week as the first leader of a gay group
to address a national political convention. Standing at the podium
before a prime-time television audience and thousands of delegates
_ including more than 200 who were gay and lesbian _ Birch appealed
to the heart of the nation.
 &HT;    Poised and articulate, she spoke of real family values, of
``healing the fractures _ soothing the wounds _ to making our
American family truly whole.''
 &HT;    The mother of twins, Birch spoke directly and poignantly to
parents who have gay and lesbian children: ``To parents _ some of
whom have left their gay children at the margins of family life and
out of a vision of America _ I say this: I want you to know that
your gay children are gifted and strong. All are heroic in that
they have conquered barriers to their own self-respect.''
 &HT;    Birch's speech was all about breaking down the barriers of
discrimination, dismantling the walls of intolerance and opening
closet doors.
 &HT;    Her prime-time address underscores the vast difference between
our two major political parties on civil rights for gays.
 &HT;    ``On nearly every issue, Al Gore is in agreement with the Human
Rights Campaign,'' Birch said. ``He supports the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, which would ban workplace discrimination
based on sexual orientation. He is an outspoken supporter of the
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.''
 &HT;    While she emphasized Al Gore's and Joe Lieberman's endorsements
of such legislation, the Democratic Party platform could not be any
stronger in articulating an entirely different approach to gay
civil rights than that of the GOP: ``We continue to lead the fight
to end discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age,
ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. We support the full
inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of the nation.''
 &HT;    That statement of principle implies ending workplace
discrimination, enacting hate crimes legislation and lifting the
ban on gays in the military _ even a variety of domestic
partnership benefits.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the language of the GOP platform reinforces the walls
of intolerance, bolsters the politics of separate and unequal and
keeps those closet doors shut: ``We do not believe sexual
preference should be given legal protection or standing in law.''
 &HT;    That unambiguous statement implies support for the Boy Scouts
discriminatory policy toward gays, support for ``Don't Ask, Don't
Tell,'' as well as support for the Defense of Marriage Act, along
with its contempt for gay and lesbian couples, parenting and
adoption.
 &HT;    Two weeks ago in Philadelphia, the closest George W. Bush came
to dismantling barriers was when, during his acceptance speech, he
said: ``When these problems aren't confronted, it builds a wall
within our nation. On the other side of the wall are poverty and
prison, addiction and despair. And my fellow Americans, we must
tear down that wall,'' he said
 &HT;    Yet George W. failed to acknowledge the walls his party and its
policies uphold _ barriers to true compassion for gays and our full
participation and inclusion in the American dream.
 &HT;    Birch had one word for the GOP party platform: ``shameful.'' In
describing George W. and his running mate, Dick Cheney, she said:
``They practice silent apathy in the face of hatred and call it
leadership. They forgo invective but embrace indifference and call
it compassionate conservatism.
 &HT;    ''... Deep within their hearts, they know this to be true, that
not a single gay American seeks special rights or favored
treatment. We seek simple equality _ the equal right to work, raise
a family, serve our country in every way and be free from the
shackles of brutality and hate.''
 &HT;    Several months ago here in Boston, I asked Birch about her
organization's support and enthusiasm for Al Gore.
 &HT;    ``With 5 percent of the electorate nationwide, the gay vote is a
significant slice of the electorate,'' she said. This is especially
true in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania. ``We cannot be complacent, and we must elect Al
Gore,'' she added.
 &HT;    Asked about her wish list for gay Americans under a Gore
presidency and Democratic control of the House of Representatives,
Birch said: ``My dream list is everything short of marriage.''
 &HT;    ``We are such stuff as dreams are made on,'' said Prospero in
William Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' Equal rights for everyone _
including gays _ is the right stuff of a fully inclusive American
dream. It's a dream worth fighting for. It's a dream worth our
Democratic votes on Election Day.

 &HT;    Al Gore's selection of Connecticut Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, an
Orthodox Jew, as his running mate has many non-Jewish Americans
seriously learning about Judaism for the first time. This is a
healthy development for the nation.
 &HT;    For good reasons, the Sabbath, or Shabbat, is of particular
interest to voters. Shabbat _ from sun down on Friday to nightfall
on Saturday _ is the day that observing Jews rest. It is ineffable,
and its importance in Jewish life cannot be overstated. More has
been written about this day than any other subject in Jewish
literature.
 &HT;    Few people realize that it is the only ritual mentioned in the
Ten Commandments.
 &HT;    As a gentile, I do not claim to understand Shabbat. I know a lot
about it, and although I have enjoyed many Shabbat meals in Jewish
homes both in the United States and Israel, I can never experience
its essence. Only the Orthodox can fully grasp the day's true
meaning.
 &HT;    As a side note, I believe that Shabbat in Israel is unique. It
is celebrated there unlike any anywhere else in the world.
 &HT;    The Sabbath is front-page news in this country because of the
restrictions it places on practicing Jews, especially Lieberman.
They do not, among other things, travel by animal or motorized
vehicle, answer telephones, write, handle money, cook, listen to
radio or watch TV, clean house, bathe, switch on lights or start
fires of any kind.
 &HT;    Of course, all bets are off in matters of life and death or when
a personal deal can be made with God.
 &HT;    The observant copes with the harsh rules and inconveniences in
clever ways. For example, the meals are cooked before Friday
sundown and kept warm by special devices, and special monitors
switch lights on and off on cue.
 &HT;    One of the most interesting mechanisms is the Shabbat elevator,
which I experienced with great embarrassment in Jerusalem in 1996,
when I was traveling with a group of fellow American journalists.
As guests of a luxury hotel near the Old City, we received a
complimentary copy of the Jerusalem Post each morning.
 &HT;    On my first Saturday in the country on this trip, I opened my
door and did not find my Post. This news junky marched to his
fourth-floor elevator determined to find out what had happened. I
pressed the ``down'' button and waited for what seemed forever
before a car door opened. By now, eight other people, all Jews, had
gathered. As I entered the car, no one followed. Each person stood
there, grinning at me.
 &HT;    I cannot be the only one going down, I thought, pressing the
``lobby'' button. When nothing happened, I pressed ``close door'' _
repeatedly. Now, everyone was laughing. A few moments later, the
elevator made a whirring sound, one I had never heard before in an
elevator anywhere else. The door closed so slowly that I thought it
was broken. Instead of going down, the car went up ever so slowly
to the fifth floor. The whirring returned as the door opened and
several people got on.
 &HT;    This process, which lasted about 14 minutes, repeated until I
got to the 12th floor, where the car finally reversed direction. On
each floor, people got on, some I had seen on the way up. They were
grinning at me.
 &HT;    At the fourth floor, Menachem Haftez, my group's Israeli guide,
got on. Looking at me and smiling, he said: ``Bill, how long have
you been riding the Shabbat elevator? I told you gentiles to take
the regular one.''
 &HT;    Indeed, he had. I told him that I was going to the front desk to
find out why I did not get a Post, whereupon he said: ``Newspapers
aren't delivered on the Sabbath. You weren't listening, Bill. By
the way, we're leaving for the Dead Sea in 30 minutes.''
 &HT;    Because 99 percent of Israel shuts down during Shabbat (Tel
Aviv, Haifa and Arab areas being exceptions), the life of the
foreign traveler, even seasoned ones, can be a nightmare. When I
was in Jerusalem last year, I mistakenly trusted the word of a busy
desk clerk at the Mecure Hotel in Jerusalem. I had a Saturday noon
appointment with an Ethiopian Jewish family in Lod, a small town
near Tel Aviv. On Friday, the clerk told me that I could park my
car in the hotel garage and drive it out the next morning.
 &HT;    Well, the next morning _ Shabbat _ another clerk said that cars
could not leave the garage because the main gate could not be
opened. Why? Because to open the gate is to work. I protested to no
avail and called an Arab taxi driver who charged me an arm and a
leg.
 &HT;    Leaving the city, my cabbie made a near-fatal mistake. He drove
into Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox community where most of the
streets were blocked with boulders to keep out vehicles during
Shabbat. Several groups of Hassidim _ side-locked, amulet-draped
and clad in black from head to toe _ stood with stones
at-the-ready. My cabbie hit the brakes, put the Mercedes in
reverse, turned around and roared out of harm's way.
 &HT;    ``If they hurt us, the police won't do anything,'' he said.
``Sorry. I was trying to find a shortcut.''
 &HT;    Today, as Joe Lieberman, hailed as a man of morality, runs for
vice president, voters should learn more about his religious
beliefs _ the stuff that is inseparable from his conduct both as a
man and as a politician. Listen to Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein describe
the significance of Shabbat (it defines Lieberman) in his book
``What Christians Should Know About Jews and Judaism'':
 &HT;    ``Through (the Sabbath), we can affirm the centrality of the
family, the home and the synagogue in our lives. In observing the
Shabbat, the Jew bears testimony to the existence of a Supreme
Being, one who loves humankind and is concerned for his welfare.
The Shabbat can give a society searching for its soul the essential
building blocks with which it can become reinvigorated and
transformed into one with a deep moral character, strong spiritual
back bone and profound sense of justice, community and
fellowship.''
 &HT;    As Lieberman will say often before the November election:
Shabbat Shalom.

 By JOE NORTON  
 &HT;    I am the father of two Korean born children: Davis, 3, and
Cassandra, 1. My wife and I adopted these two beautiful children
from Korea when they were each 6 months old.
 &HT;    From the very beginning we hoped to learn everything we could
about Korea. Our goal was to become informed about Korea and its
culture so that we would be able to share this important piece of
our children's lives with them. Our investigation into the culture
also provided us with something to keep us busy as we anxiously
awaited news of our children.
 &HT;    We started our in a very fundamental way. Our first step was to
take our globe and see exactly where Korea is located. The next
steps included obtaining books from local booksellers on Korean
topics. We found travel guides helpful, even though we were not
planning to travel to Korea any time soon. (Our children were both
escorted to the United States and we met them for the first time at
the airport in Boston.) Travel books proved valuable as we learned
specific facts about the country. Aside from the important
geographical information, we also learned about key historical
figures and came to understand Korea's main imports and exports.
 &HT;    What intrigued me the most, as an American, reading about this
culture for the first time was how it seemed to me that everything
that the Korean person did was tied to some tradition. A person's
political opinions, religion, clothing, right on down to the food
he enjoys had a deeper meaning than at first view. Throughout our
reading, one topic that seemed to transcend everything we were
learning about was food. I realized that in Korean tradition, food
means much more than just fulfilling your stomach's cravings.
 &HT;    Each Korean American family and individual that I spoke with
keeps some type of Korean tradition in what they eat. I did not run
into many people preparing jars of cabbage to plant in the ground,
but most people are keeping traditions alive through the simple
basics of beef and chicken bulgogi, rice, bibimbap, soups and other
native foods. In Boston and surrounding towns, there are a number
of Asian markets and a handful of Korean markets that sell
ingredients for the delicious food. Also, Korean restaurants have
sprung up in downtown, in Chinatown and in communities such as
Newton and Burlington.
 &HT;    During our investigation into Korea, my wife and I visited
several of the area restaurants and were hooked on the food
instantly. In my own family, several of the foods mentioned above
are regulars and many extended family and friends look forward to
their visits with the anticipation of a feast for the senses _ the
taste, the aroma, the look _ and, to say the least, some mildly
spicy cuisine! The staples in the Korean person's diet have become
ours. We went from preparing boxed instant rice to purchasing a
rice cooker and buying our rice at an Asian market.
 &HT;    To take our interest in the food a step further, my wife pursued
an additional route. She was able to identify someone who could
teach Americans Korean cooking. Through a local church, she set up
several sessions of weekly cooking instruction from a group of
women who were all too willing to teach others about the food. I
attended a series myself and was struck instantly by the simplicity
of the food itself, while at the same time enjoying the different
spicy flavors. Our instructors spoke with great pride as they told
us of the reasons behind certain dishes. They taught us how to
appreciate the preparation and presentation of the food. This
cooking class remains to this day one of the most requested events
that my wife coordinates.
 &HT;    The added benefit, as any nutritionist will tell you, is that
this food is good for you. The typical meal of a bowl of rice, soup
and side dishes of meat or fish accompanied by vegetables is
certainly a healthy combination, and one that meets the
requirements of recommended daily dietary allowances.
 &HT;    The preparation that one goes through is equally as important as
the food itself. Shopping for the right ingredients is where it
begins. Carefully selecting the vegetables and meats that your
family and friends will enjoy is almost ritualistic, as is the
process of cutting, marinating and cooking.
 &HT;    When attending the cooking class, it becomes clear that while
measuring devices may be useful, they are not necessarily
essential. The Korean cook knows instinctively the amounts and
combinations necessary to bring a meal to life.
 &HT;    My family now makes an effort to use our mealtime to socialize.
We take turns at the table and discuss what we are about to do for
the day or what we have done for the just-concluded day. It has
brought a nice level of communication within our house and has
helped us understand the daily challenges and victories, however
small or large, that each of us has faced. We place particular
importance on listening. Each voice is heard from oldest to
youngest, and we have a lot of fun sharing our experiences and
helping one another all over food.
 &HT;    If you want a starting point for learning Korean culture or a
way to add to what you already know, look into food. There is a
great deal of history behind the food and how it is shared among
family, friends and community.

 By JONATHAN J. HIGUERA  
 &HT;    By Internet standards, Adsmart NetFuerza can be considered an
old-timer. In just a year and a half, the company has seen dramatic
change online and in terms of its own fortunes.
 &HT;    ``When we started, there were very few Latin sites,'' says Lisa
Weinstein, division director of NetFuerza, which specializes in
selling advertising on Hispanic Web sites domestically and abroad.
``We went into the game without much traffic to sell.''
 &HT;    In those early days, the network relied on portals like
ZonaFmanciera, El Nuevo Herald and Latino Link. NetFuerza initially
had just 10 million impressions a month from Latin America.
(Impressions are similar to pages in a newspaper.) Now the company
boasts 50 million impressions a month and is growing at a rate of
30 percent every 30 days.
 &HT;    ``There are many more interesting sites out there,'' Weinstein
says. ``In the last two months, we gained 10 sites. Six months ago
it was hard to target urban teens. Now we're seeing a number of
sites with that audience.''
 &HT;    Founded in September 1998 as a division of 2Can Media, NetFuerza
currently represents 67 clients with Web sites in 16 countries.
While more than half of its clients are U.S.-based, sites based in
Latin America are popping up every day. Televisa recently announced
it will launch a Spanish-language portal later this year. Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm, estimates that online
spending in Latin America topped $194 million last year, with
Brazil accounting for $121 million. Jupiter projects the figure
will grow to $8.3 billion by 2005.
 &HT;    ``Mexico and Argentina are advanced, but Brazil has even more
activity,'' notes Anjanette Lopez, a NetFueriza account executive
in charge of new business development. ``Brazil is a continent of
its own.''
 &HT;    Latin American Internet growth has prompted advertisers to take
notice. While online advertising in Latin America was relatively
soft last year, with about $51 million spent, according to
Forrester Research, another Internet research firm, it's expected
to grow to $1.6 billion by 2004. Worldwide, online ad spending will
grow to $22 billion by 2004, up from $2.8 billion last year.
 &HT;    ``Ad networks have a strong role to play here,'' says Forrester
analyst Jim Nail. ``The Internet is a very fragmented media space.
There are hundreds of thousands of sites. An advertiser can't deal
with it. They need an intermediary to help make those buys
easier.''
 &HT;    Other networks besides NetFuerza are stepping up to meet that
need. DoubleClick recently started a Latin America division, as did
247. But NetFuerza believes it has a head start.
 &HT;    ``We started with very small sites with hardly my impressions,''
Lopez says. ``Many of the people running the sites didn't know what
they were doing.''
 &HT;    While some still don't, the industry is getting more competitive
and savvy, she says. ``Some people know what the Internet user
looks for. They put out a great product and people go to it.''
 &HT;    Sports and finance sites have been popular with NetFuerza
clients, according to Weinstein. But other sites are beginning to
make headway, such as the recently created Todo Bebe.com, which
focuses on family planning and child-rearing. Although NetFuerza
has been bought twice _ last year by Adsmart and earlier this year
by Engage.com _ its client list has steadily grown. Web sites
ranging from Zona Financiera to TodoBebe.com to ElClick.com are all
NetFuerza clients.
 &HT;    ``It allows us to offer more options,'' Lopez says, who has been
with NetFuerza since April 1999. ``We're not eliminating any
products, just combining forces under one umbrella.''
 &HT;    To keep pace with the growth, NetFuerza has added five sales
representatives in U.S. cities and is looking to add more in Latin
America.
 &HT;    ``Finding representatives is difficult,'' Weinstein says. ``We
need bilingual folks who understand the Net.''
 &HT;    While Web site clients pay nothing, the advertisers pay
NetFuerza to handle their Internet campaigns.
 &HT;    ``We do auditing of impressions, provide reports and billing of
claims, turn it around, and send a check for the commission agreed
upon,'' Lopez says. ``It's a turnkey operation.''
 &HT;    Internet advertising costs depend on the type of campaign
launched. The more specific the intended audience, the higher the
price.
 &HT;    ``The Internet is not guaranteed. It moves very fast,'' Lopez.
``You need to be willing to take risks and see what happens.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    What a difference two weeks and the Democratic Party make.
 &HT;    ``I am honored to speak here as a gay American,'' said Elizabeth
Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, the
nation's largest gay-rights advocacy organization.
 &HT;    Birch made history this week as the first leader of a gay group
to address a national political convention. Standing at the podium
before a prime-time television audience and thousands of delegates
_ including more than 200 who were gay and lesbian _ Birch appealed
to the heart of the nation.
 &HT;    Poised and articulate, she spoke of real family values, of
``healing the fractures _ soothing the wounds _ to making our
American family truly whole.''
 &HT;    The mother of twins, Birch spoke directly and poignantly to
parents who have gay and lesbian children: ``To parents _ some of
whom have left their gay children at the margins of family life and
out of a vision of America _ I say this: I want you to know that
your gay children are gifted and strong. All are heroic in that
they have conquered barriers to their own self-respect.''
 &HT;    Birch's speech was all about breaking down the barriers of
discrimination, dismantling the walls of intolerance and opening
closet doors.
 &HT;    Her prime-time address underscores the vast difference between
our two major political parties on civil rights for gays.
 &HT;    ``On nearly every issue, Al Gore is in agreement with the Human
Rights Campaign,'' Birch said. ``He supports the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, which would ban workplace discrimination
based on sexual orientation. He is an outspoken supporter of the
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.''
 &HT;    While she emphasized Al Gore's and Joe Lieberman's endorsements
of such legislation, the Democratic Party platform could not be any
stronger in articulating an entirely different approach to gay
civil rights than that of the GOP: ``We continue to lead the fight
to end discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age,
ethnicity, disability and sexual orientation. We support the full
inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of the nation.''
 &HT;    That statement of principle implies ending workplace
discrimination, enacting hate crimes legislation and lifting the
ban on gays in the military _ even a variety of domestic
partnership benefits.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the language of the GOP platform reinforces the walls
of intolerance, bolsters the politics of separate and unequal and
keeps those closet doors shut: ``We do not believe sexual
preference should be given legal protection or standing in law.''
 &HT;    That unambiguous statement implies support for the Boy Scouts
discriminatory policy toward gays, support for ``Don't Ask, Don't
Tell,'' as well as support for the Defense of Marriage Act, along
with its contempt for gay and lesbian couples, parenting and
adoption.
 &HT;    Two weeks ago in Philadelphia, the closest George W. Bush came
to dismantling barriers was when, during his acceptance speech, he
said: ``When these problems aren't confronted, it builds a wall
within our nation. On the other side of the wall are poverty and
prison, addiction and despair. And my fellow Americans, we must
tear down that wall,'' he said
 &HT;    Yet George W. failed to acknowledge the walls his party and its
policies uphold _ barriers to true compassion for gays and our full
participation and inclusion in the American dream.
 &HT;    Birch had one word for the GOP party platform: ``shameful.'' In
describing George W. and his running mate, Dick Cheney, she said:
``They practice silent apathy in the face of hatred and call it
leadership. They forgo invective but embrace indifference and call
it compassionate conservatism.
 &HT;    ''... Deep within their hearts, they know this to be true, that
not a single gay American seeks special rights or favored
treatment. We seek simple equality _ the equal right to work, raise
a family, serve our country in every way and be free from the
shackles of brutality and hate.''
 &HT;    Several months ago here in Boston, I asked Birch about her
organization's support and enthusiasm for Al Gore.
 &HT;    ``With 5 percent of the electorate nationwide, the gay vote is a
significant slice of the electorate,'' she said. This is especially
true in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania. ``We cannot be complacent, and we must elect Al
Gore,'' she added.
 &HT;    Asked about her wish list for gay Americans under a Gore
presidency and Democratic control of the House of Representatives,
Birch said: ``My dream list is everything short of marriage.''
 &HT;    ``We are such stuff as dreams are made on,'' said Prospero in
William Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' Equal rights for everyone _
including gays _ is the right stuff of a fully inclusive American
dream. It's a dream worth fighting for. It's a dream worth our
Democratic votes on Election Day.

 &HT;    Al Gore's selection of Connecticut Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, an
Orthodox Jew, as his running mate has many non-Jewish Americans
seriously learning about Judaism for the first time. This is a
healthy development for the nation.
 &HT;    For good reasons, the Sabbath, or Shabbat, is of particular
interest to voters. Shabbat _ from sun down on Friday to nightfall
on Saturday _ is the day that observing Jews rest. It is ineffable,
and its importance in Jewish life cannot be overstated. More has
been written about this day than any other subject in Jewish
literature.
 &HT;    Few people realize that it is the only ritual mentioned in the
Ten Commandments.
 &HT;    As a gentile, I do not claim to understand Shabbat. I know a lot
about it, and although I have enjoyed many Shabbat meals in Jewish
homes both in the United States and Israel, I can never experience
its essence. Only the Orthodox can fully grasp the day's true
meaning.
 &HT;    As a side note, I believe that Shabbat in Israel is unique. It
is celebrated there unlike any anywhere else in the world.
 &HT;    The Sabbath is front-page news in this country because of the
restrictions it places on practicing Jews, especially Lieberman.
They do not, among other things, travel by animal or motorized
vehicle, answer telephones, write, handle money, cook, listen to
radio or watch TV, clean house, bathe, switch on lights or start
fires of any kind.
 &HT;    Of course, all bets are off in matters of life and death or when
a personal deal can be made with God.
 &HT;    The observant copes with the harsh rules and inconveniences in
clever ways. For example, the meals are cooked before Friday
sundown and kept warm by special devices, and special monitors
switch lights on and off on cue.
 &HT;    One of the most interesting mechanisms is the Shabbat elevator,
which I experienced with great embarrassment in Jerusalem in 1996,
when I was traveling with a group of fellow American journalists.
As guests of a luxury hotel near the Old City, we received a
complimentary copy of the Jerusalem Post each morning.
 &HT;    On my first Saturday in the country on this trip, I opened my
door and did not find my Post. This news junky marched to his
fourth-floor elevator determined to find out what had happened. I
pressed the ``down'' button and waited for what seemed forever
before a car door opened. By now, eight other people, all Jews, had
gathered. As I entered the car, no one followed. Each person stood
there, grinning at me.
 &HT;    I cannot be the only one going down, I thought, pressing the
``lobby'' button. When nothing happened, I pressed ``close door'' _
repeatedly. Now, everyone was laughing. A few moments later, the
elevator made a whirring sound, one I had never heard before in an
elevator anywhere else. The door closed so slowly that I thought it
was broken. Instead of going down, the car went up ever so slowly
to the fifth floor. The whirring returned as the door opened and
several people got on.
 &HT;    This process, which lasted about 14 minutes, repeated until I
got to the 12th floor, where the car finally reversed direction. On
each floor, people got on, some I had seen on the way up. They were
grinning at me.
 &HT;    At the fourth floor, Menachem Haftez, my group's Israeli guide,
got on. Looking at me and smiling, he said: ``Bill, how long have
you been riding the Shabbat elevator? I told you gentiles to take
the regular one.''
 &HT;    Indeed, he had. I told him that I was going to the front desk to
find out why I did not get a Post, whereupon he said: ``Newspapers
aren't delivered on the Sabbath. You weren't listening, Bill. By
the way, we're leaving for the Dead Sea in 30 minutes.''
 &HT;    Because 99 percent of Israel shuts down during Shabbat (Tel
Aviv, Haifa and Arab areas being exceptions), the life of the
foreign traveler, even seasoned ones, can be a nightmare. When I
was in Jerusalem last year, I mistakenly trusted the word of a busy
desk clerk at the Mecure Hotel in Jerusalem. I had a Saturday noon
appointment with an Ethiopian Jewish family in Lod, a small town
near Tel Aviv. On Friday, the clerk told me that I could park my
car in the hotel garage and drive it out the next morning.
 &HT;    Well, the next morning _ Shabbat _ another clerk said that cars
could not leave the garage because the main gate could not be
opened. Why? Because to open the gate is to work. I protested to no
avail and called an Arab taxi driver who charged me an arm and a
leg.
 &HT;    Leaving the city, my cabbie made a near-fatal mistake. He drove
into Mea Shearim, an ultra-Orthodox community where most of the
streets were blocked with boulders to keep out vehicles during
Shabbat. Several groups of Hassidim _ side-locked, amulet-draped
and clad in black from head to toe _ stood with stones
at-the-ready. My cabbie hit the brakes, put the Mercedes in
reverse, turned around and roared out of harm's way.
 &HT;    ``If they hurt us, the police won't do anything,'' he said.
``Sorry. I was trying to find a shortcut.''
 &HT;    Today, as Joe Lieberman, hailed as a man of morality, runs for
vice president, voters should learn more about his religious
beliefs _ the stuff that is inseparable from his conduct both as a
man and as a politician. Listen to Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein describe
the significance of Shabbat (it defines Lieberman) in his book
``What Christians Should Know About Jews and Judaism'':
 &HT;    ``Through (the Sabbath), we can affirm the centrality of the
family, the home and the synagogue in our lives. In observing the
Shabbat, the Jew bears testimony to the existence of a Supreme
Being, one who loves humankind and is concerned for his welfare.
The Shabbat can give a society searching for its soul the essential
building blocks with which it can become reinvigorated and
transformed into one with a deep moral character, strong spiritual
back bone and profound sense of justice, community and
fellowship.''
 &HT;    As Lieberman will say often before the November election:
Shabbat Shalom.

 By JOE NORTON  
 &HT;    I am the father of two Korean born children: Davis, 3, and
Cassandra, 1. My wife and I adopted these two beautiful children
from Korea when they were each 6 months old.
 &HT;    From the very beginning we hoped to learn everything we could
about Korea. Our goal was to become informed about Korea and its
culture so that we would be able to share this important piece of
our children's lives with them. Our investigation into the culture
also provided us with something to keep us busy as we anxiously
awaited news of our children.
 &HT;    We started our in a very fundamental way. Our first step was to
take our globe and see exactly where Korea is located. The next
steps included obtaining books from local booksellers on Korean
topics. We found travel guides helpful, even though we were not
planning to travel to Korea any time soon. (Our children were both
escorted to the United States and we met them for the first time at
the airport in Boston.) Travel books proved valuable as we learned
specific facts about the country. Aside from the important
geographical information, we also learned about key historical
figures and came to understand Korea's main imports and exports.
 &HT;    What intrigued me the most, as an American, reading about this
culture for the first time was how it seemed to me that everything
that the Korean person did was tied to some tradition. A person's
political opinions, religion, clothing, right on down to the food
he enjoys had a deeper meaning than at first view. Throughout our
reading, one topic that seemed to transcend everything we were
learning about was food. I realized that in Korean tradition, food
means much more than just fulfilling your stomach's cravings.
 &HT;    Each Korean American family and individual that I spoke with
keeps some type of Korean tradition in what they eat. I did not run
into many people preparing jars of cabbage to plant in the ground,
but most people are keeping traditions alive through the simple
basics of beef and chicken bulgogi, rice, bibimbap, soups and other
native foods. In Boston and surrounding towns, there are a number
of Asian markets and a handful of Korean markets that sell
ingredients for the delicious food. Also, Korean restaurants have
sprung up in downtown, in Chinatown and in communities such as
Newton and Burlington.
 &HT;    During our investigation into Korea, my wife and I visited
several of the area restaurants and were hooked on the food
instantly. In my own family, several of the foods mentioned above
are regulars and many extended family and friends look forward to
their visits with the anticipation of a feast for the senses _ the
taste, the aroma, the look _ and, to say the least, some mildly
spicy cuisine! The staples in the Korean person's diet have become
ours. We went from preparing boxed instant rice to purchasing a
rice cooker and buying our rice at an Asian market.
 &HT;    To take our interest in the food a step further, my wife pursued
an additional route. She was able to identify someone who could
teach Americans Korean cooking. Through a local church, she set up
several sessions of weekly cooking instruction from a group of
women who were all too willing to teach others about the food. I
attended a series myself and was struck instantly by the simplicity
of the food itself, while at the same time enjoying the different
spicy flavors. Our instructors spoke with great pride as they told
us of the reasons behind certain dishes. They taught us how to
appreciate the preparation and presentation of the food. This
cooking class remains to this day one of the most requested events
that my wife coordinates.
 &HT;    The added benefit, as any nutritionist will tell you, is that
this food is good for you. The typical meal of a bowl of rice, soup
and side dishes of meat or fish accompanied by vegetables is
certainly a healthy combination, and one that meets the
requirements of recommended daily dietary allowances.
 &HT;    The preparation that one goes through is equally as important as
the food itself. Shopping for the right ingredients is where it
begins. Carefully selecting the vegetables and meats that your
family and friends will enjoy is almost ritualistic, as is the
process of cutting, marinating and cooking.
 &HT;    When attending the cooking class, it becomes clear that while
measuring devices may be useful, they are not necessarily
essential. The Korean cook knows instinctively the amounts and
combinations necessary to bring a meal to life.
 &HT;    My family now makes an effort to use our mealtime to socialize.
We take turns at the table and discuss what we are about to do for
the day or what we have done for the just-concluded day. It has
brought a nice level of communication within our house and has
helped us understand the daily challenges and victories, however
small or large, that each of us has faced. We place particular
importance on listening. Each voice is heard from oldest to
youngest, and we have a lot of fun sharing our experiences and
helping one another all over food.
 &HT;    If you want a starting point for learning Korean culture or a
way to add to what you already know, look into food. There is a
great deal of history behind the food and how it is shared among
family, friends and community.

 By JONATHAN J. HIGUERA  
 &HT;    By Internet standards, Adsmart NetFuerza can be considered an
old-timer. In just a year and a half, the company has seen dramatic
change online and in terms of its own fortunes.
 &HT;    ``When we started, there were very few Latin sites,'' says Lisa
Weinstein, division director of NetFuerza, which specializes in
selling advertising on Hispanic Web sites domestically and abroad.
``We went into the game without much traffic to sell.''
 &HT;    In those early days, the network relied on portals like
ZonaFmanciera, El Nuevo Herald and Latino Link. NetFuerza initially
had just 10 million impressions a month from Latin America.
(Impressions are similar to pages in a newspaper.) Now the company
boasts 50 million impressions a month and is growing at a rate of
30 percent every 30 days.
 &HT;    ``There are many more interesting sites out there,'' Weinstein
says. ``In the last two months, we gained 10 sites. Six months ago
it was hard to target urban teens. Now we're seeing a number of
sites with that audience.''
 &HT;    Founded in September 1998 as a division of 2Can Media, NetFuerza
currently represents 67 clients with Web sites in 16 countries.
While more than half of its clients are U.S.-based, sites based in
Latin America are popping up every day. Televisa recently announced
it will launch a Spanish-language portal later this year. Jupiter
Communications, an Internet research firm, estimates that online
spending in Latin America topped $194 million last year, with
Brazil accounting for $121 million. Jupiter projects the figure
will grow to $8.3 billion by 2005.
 &HT;    ``Mexico and Argentina are advanced, but Brazil has even more
activity,'' notes Anjanette Lopez, a NetFueriza account executive
in charge of new business development. ``Brazil is a continent of
its own.''
 &HT;    Latin American Internet growth has prompted advertisers to take
notice. While online advertising in Latin America was relatively
soft last year, with about $51 million spent, according to
Forrester Research, another Internet research firm, it's expected
to grow to $1.6 billion by 2004. Worldwide, online ad spending will
grow to $22 billion by 2004, up from $2.8 billion last year.
 &HT;    ``Ad networks have a strong role to play here,'' says Forrester
analyst Jim Nail. ``The Internet is a very fragmented media space.
There are hundreds of thousands of sites. An advertiser can't deal
with it. They need an intermediary to help make those buys
easier.''
 &HT;    Other networks besides NetFuerza are stepping up to meet that
need. DoubleClick recently started a Latin America division, as did
247. But NetFuerza believes it has a head start.
 &HT;    ``We started with very small sites with hardly my impressions,''
Lopez says. ``Many of the people running the sites didn't know what
they were doing.''
 &HT;    While some still don't, the industry is getting more competitive
and savvy, she says. ``Some people know what the Internet user
looks for. They put out a great product and people go to it.''
 &HT;    Sports and finance sites have been popular with NetFuerza
clients, according to Weinstein. But other sites are beginning to
make headway, such as the recently created Todo Bebe.com, which
focuses on family planning and child-rearing. Although NetFuerza
has been bought twice _ last year by Adsmart and earlier this year
by Engage.com _ its client list has steadily grown. Web sites
ranging from Zona Financiera to TodoBebe.com to ElClick.com are all
NetFuerza clients.
 &HT;    ``It allows us to offer more options,'' Lopez says, who has been
with NetFuerza since April 1999. ``We're not eliminating any
products, just combining forces under one umbrella.''
 &HT;    To keep pace with the growth, NetFuerza has added five sales
representatives in U.S. cities and is looking to add more in Latin
America.
 &HT;    ``Finding representatives is difficult,'' Weinstein says. ``We
need bilingual folks who understand the Net.''
 &HT;    While Web site clients pay nothing, the advertisers pay
NetFuerza to handle their Internet campaigns.
 &HT;    ``We do auditing of impressions, provide reports and billing of
claims, turn it around, and send a check for the commission agreed
upon,'' Lopez says. ``It's a turnkey operation.''
 &HT;    Internet advertising costs depend on the type of campaign
launched. The more specific the intended audience, the higher the
price.
 &HT;    ``The Internet is not guaranteed. It moves very fast,'' Lopez.
``You need to be willing to take risks and see what happens.''

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Nearly everyone agrees on one thing: The old
woman who sells live ducks and chickens from a makeshift stall does
not belong on Tentmakers Street. The squawking, to say nothing of
the dirty feathers that fly regularly from the alarmed birds,
upsets the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Unsightly poultry is not the only problem when renovating a
1,000-year-old neighborhood packed with crumbling mosques, ancient
bazaars, illegal workshops, crowded apartments and world-famous
monuments in one of the most densely populated cities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done, for example, with the poor family that for
generations has sold falafel from a stand they constructed smack
against a once-beautiful and historic city gate? Or the people who
long ago poured concrete over an ancient well to make a space to
sell souvenirs? Or the little boys dragging wagons full of fabric
for a dollar a day and madly dodging motorbikes carrying families
of four out for a shopping spree?
</P>
<P>
   These are burning questions for the people of Tentmakers Street,
a cramped and dim thoroughfare in the old heart of this old city
where a government preservation project is tearing up the
foundations of the buildings and, for many, a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, back in the old days it was beautiful here,'' said Saad
Ali, a 65-year-old tentmaker who was born a few streets away and
started working in the craft with his father and grandfather when
he was 10 years old. ``You could see the original stones and their
colors and the wooden doors. Now that whole image is destroyed. The
beauty is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali sat cross-legged and barefoot on a worn cushion in a tiny
alcove that has been his family's place of business for as long as
anyone can remember. His eyeglasses are as thick as his calloused
fingers, the cost of countless hours spent bent over his
needlework.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a donkey cart piled high with cartons bumped its
way along the street just past his shoulder. The screeches of the
neighbor woman's chickens joined the honking of speeding
motorcycles and the whine of the machinery in the metalworking shop
a few doors down to produce an ear-splitting noise.
</P>
<P>
   Ali grimaced. ``In the old days, this street was peaceful and
you had the chance to buy and sell,'' he said. ``Now the tourists
have to dig their way in past all these inappropriate businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   For hundreds of years the people on Tentmakers Street made their
living sewing ornate patchwork tapestries _ red, yellow, black and
blue arabesque designs _ for the tents where Egyptians gather for
funerals, weddings and other ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The little street, like traditional Middle East bazaars, was
covered with a wooden canopy to protect the artisans from sun and
rain. Each alcove had a high ceiling with wood beams and an airy
workshop on the second floor. The archways over the entrances were
made of multicolored stones laid in a fan design.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors knew one another for generations, just as in the
stories of Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel laureate who grew up in the
neighborhood and used it as the model for his trilogy ``Children of
the Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, years of grime give the stone the uniform color of
mud. The beamed ceilings have been obliterated with concrete, and
the workshops are rented out to families living 10 to a room.
</P>
<P>
   Most people now buy machine-printed fabrics instead of the
handmade tapestries, so the tentmakers sell their work as
pillowcases and wall hangings for tourists. And with the decline of
the old trade, small manufacturing operations and street vendors
encroached on the remaining artisans of Tentmakers Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government, along with foreign donors, aims to
bring back the look of old Cairo to the crowded and frantically
busy neighborhood around Tentmakers Street, known as Islamic, or
Fatimid, Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   It has an ambitious renovation plan to sandblast away centuries
of dirt from the facades, modernize the leaky sewage system,
reinforce and repair the lofty minarets and mosques, clear the
entrances to the monuments, and group the artisans together by
craft as they were in the 18th- and 19th-century glory days of
Cairo's bazaar life.
</P>
<P>
   Originally the walled imperial capital of the Fatimid dynasty
that ruled Egypt in the early centuries of Islam, the 1
1/2-square-mile neighborhood contains many of the city's most
famous mosques, schools and markets. But most are dilapidated
hulks, threatened by rising underground water and littered with
garbage. And within the confines of Fatimid Cairo, still outlined
in a few places by the remnants of the ramparts and massive stone
gates, at least 365,000 people live, the Ministry of Culture
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration work on many monuments has begun. Parts of
Tentmakers Street have been gutted and some of the dirt cleaned
from the archways of the old shops. There are rumors _ welcomed by
many _ that the government will eventually ban cars and motorbikes
from the area. But many people who live and work in the
neighborhood wonder if they will be preserved along with the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine, renovate the area,'' said Muhammad Tawfik, who sells
cheap shoes from a dingy stand in the shadow of Bab Zuweila, the
westernmost gate to the old Fatimid city. ``But what about the
people who make their living here?''
</P>
<P>
   Tawfik said he had been assured by government officials that his
store can remain, once the gate is refurbished and cleaned. But he
has his doubts. Just across from him, another shoe-seller was told
to clear out during renovations. Then workers uncovered a beautiful
ornate decoration on the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll never be allowed back, now,'' Tawfik said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayman Abdel-Moneim, the Culture Ministry's archaeologist in
charge of the preservation project, said there are no plans to
relocate residents of the neighborhood, although he did want to
move incompatible businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program is to restore the monuments, the housing of the
people, the infrastructure and the ground itself,'' he said.
``People must believe us as the government. They are not going to
be moved out of historic Cairo.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime occupants said they want to believe the
restoration will improve their lot. But sometimes they, too, have
their doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here and clean this up!'' shouted one tentmaker this
week, as workers renovating a building sent a cloud of plaster and
dust from their construction site onto the street in front of his
shop. When the workers studiously ignored his command, he pulled
out a broom from behind a sewing table and set about cleaning up
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ali would like to think that the neighborhood could once again
be a quiet, friendly place, as it is portrayed in the Naguib
Mahfouz books. Not that Ali has read them. ``I don't have to,'' he
said. ``I live them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is reassured by the fact that the government is not
tearing down the old buildings in Tentmakers Street, but only
fixing them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they destroyed them, I'm sure it would only be a matter of
time before they'd move me out of here and tell me I had to go live
somewhere in a new part of Cairo,'' he said. ``If that happened,
they would be tearing me from my own heritage.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Peering out from a large ad in Monday's Washington
Post is Texan Liz Carpenter. In white print over the dark robe
Carpenter is wearing are the words, ``It's the Supreme Court,
Stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   That takeoff on James Carville's ``It's the economy, stupid!''
slogan during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign is an
underlying chant here at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president will likely nominate two or three Supreme
Court Justices,'' declared the ad, paid for by NARAL, the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ``Enough to
overturn Roe v. Wade and end legal abortion. George W. Bush says
his model justices are Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Are they
yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Thomas have both voted to overturn the 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision that established a woman's right to choose whether to
have an abortion. Texas state law now tracks that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want equality,'' Carpenter said after a rousing speech to
the Texas delegation here. ``And we want the right to make our
choices about the privacy of our own bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, third-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House and
chair of the Texas delegation here, said the issue is very
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the issues where there's a clear distinction
between the two parties,'' Frost said. ``The Democratic party
clearly stands for a woman's right to choose on the issue of
abortion. The Republican party clearly does not _ in fact, has very
anti-choice language in their platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform states it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to live
which cannot be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform says:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it is a fundamental constitutional liberty
that individual Americans, not government, can best take
responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal
decisions regarding reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure no one misses the difference, NARAL has been handing
out sacks of brochures to delegates here about the issue _
including one with an unflattering picture of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   That brochure features a 1994 quote from Bush: ``I will do
everything in my power to restrict abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, the chief push Bush made on the abortion front was
requiring notification of a parent of a minor girl before an
abortion can be performed. That was passed by the Texas Legislature
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has disagreed with the Republican Party's stance _
like his father, he would allow abortions in cases of rape, incest,
or where the mother's life is in danger, rather than ban all
abortions _ the nominee said he thought the Republican platform
should not be altered.
</P>
<P>
   And during the primary season earlier this year, Bush said that
the Roe v. Wade decision ``was a reach (and) overstepped the
constitutional bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Aug. 17 acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia, Bush said he would sign legislation
making late-term abortions illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life, the
life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young and the
life of the unborn,'' Bush said then.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, repeatedly voted during his
10-year congressional career for a constitutional amendment to
outlaw abortions.
</P>
<P>
   While the Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore, is now
completely pro-choice, Gore opposed federal spending for abortion
early in his career in Congress. He switched in the mid-1980s, when
he began gearing up to run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate, Joe Lieberman, has consistently been
pro-choice during his 12-year tenure as a U.S. senator from
Connecticut.

HBO'S LATEST EPISODE OF PRISON DRAMA REVEALS EVEN MORE THAN USUAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
The HBO prison drama ``Oz'' routinely shows people being stabbed,
punched, raped, sodomized and murdered. Nary an episode goes by
without some frontal male nudity.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Wednesday's episode crossed the line, showing something not
seen on American TV before: a naked man urinating in a bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, with actor Christopher Meloni, left nothing to the
imagination. It was not shot from the rear. It was not masked by
artful editing or a well-positioned set prop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no artificial tubing or anything,'' Tom Fontana, the
show's creator and executive producer, said Thursday. ``When I was
writing the scene, I called Chris and told him what I wanted to do.
He said, `OK, not a problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   The truth about anything, Fontana said, is that it's open to
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like anything in life. Some people would consider it
gratuitous, some people would consider it salacious, and some would
say it's provocative. For me, it's about life. It's about what
people do.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene never came up for discussion with HBO, Fontana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we love them.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS STRESS GOP ABORTION STAND
 &HT;    By DAVE McNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Peering out from a large ad in Monday's Washington
Post is Texan Liz Carpenter. In white print over the dark robe
Carpenter is wearing are the words, ``It's the Supreme Court,
Stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   That takeoff on James Carville's ``It's the economy, stupid!''
slogan during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign is an
underlying chant here at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president will likely nominate two or three Supreme
Court Justices,'' declared the ad, paid for by NARAL, the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ``Enough to
overturn Roe v. Wade and end legal abortion. George W. Bush says
his model justices are Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Are they
yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Thomas have both voted to overturn the 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision that established a woman's right to choose whether to
have an abortion. Texas state law now tracks that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want equality,'' Carpenter said after a rousing speech to
the Texas delegation here. ``And we want the right to make our
choices about the privacy of our own bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, third-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House and
chair of the Texas delegation here, said the issue is very
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the issues where there's a clear distinction
between the two parties,'' Frost said. ``The Democratic party
clearly stands for a woman's right to choose on the issue of
abortion. The Republican party clearly does not _ in fact, has very
anti-choice language in their platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform states it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to live
which cannot be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform says:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it is a fundamental constitutional liberty
that individual Americans, not government, can best take
responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal
decisions regarding reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure no one misses the difference, NARAL has been handing
out sacks of brochures to delegates here about the issue _
including one with an unflattering picture of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   That brochure features a 1994 quote from Bush: ``I will do
everything in my power to restrict abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, the chief push Bush made on the abortion front was
requiring notification of a parent of a minor girl before an
abortion can be performed. That was passed by the Texas Legislature
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has disagreed with the Republican Party's stance _
like his father, he would allow abortions in cases of rape, incest,
or where the mother's life is in danger, rather than ban all
abortions _ the nominee said he thought the Republican platform
should not be altered.
</P>
<P>
   And during the primary season earlier this year, Bush said that
the Roe v. Wade decision ``was a reach (and) t up in the euphoric
anticipation of a heralded class of freshman receivers. The
overwhelming potential of Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas
and Tony Jeffery tends to overshadow the fact that Ellis arrived at
Texas with some pretty impressive credentials of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he received honorable-mention All-USA recognition by
USA Today in 1998 by catching 59 passes for 963 yards and 12
touchdowns in his senior season at Westfield High School in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how he's viewed, Ellis is approaching his second year
at Texas with alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they've forgot me,'' said Ellis, who came out of
spring practice as the Longhorns' starting flanker. ``(Fans) know
we've lost a lot of key players and we need some help. The focus is
on those guys because they're young and new. I hope they work their
butts off and will be good. That's what I want. But I'm ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the combination of a redshirt year and the blue-chip
recruits' arrival might leave Ellis lost in a black hole of at
least some fans' consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a natural tendency because of the fact he
redshirted last year and these freshmen are new,'' Texas offensive
coordinator Greg Davis said. ``But he had a solid spring. He really
did some things that were exciting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis demonstrated a high tolerance for pain by completing
spring training despite a stress fracture in his right shin. By
playing through the pain, he developed into a more reliable
receiver. Whereas he previously had a tendency to follow a
spectacular catch with a frustrating drop, he became consistently
sure-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unusual,'' Davis said. ``So many things go through
your mind (as a freshman): Where am I in this formation? Do I go in
motion? What if we audible? The mind locks 'em down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the game slows down for them. As a freshman it moves so
fast. But (later) it's not moving as fast anymore. When that
happens their natural skills can be evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' skills have been subject to evaluation by his harshest
critic long before he arrived at Texas. Early in his high school
career, the 6-foot, 4-inch Ellis was more interested in hoops, but
he changed directions after a blunt critique from someone with a
basketball background _ his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Patton was a basketball star at Houston Yates High School
and did not see the necessary skills for her son to flourish in the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked basketball more than football, but I told him, `I
think you're better in football,' '' Patton said. ``I told him
football can carry you a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis knows he's a long way from carrying the receiving load by
himself. Split end Montrell Flowers caught 34 passes last season,
while Brandon Healy and Jamel Thompson combined for 15 catches. The
four freshmen receivers also figure to get plenty of passes thrown
their way.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellis has an edge on the newcomers _ at least for now _
because he had a year as an understudy to Kwame Cavil and Ryan
Nunez, last year's top receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The freshmen) will learn how to go hard on every play,''
Ellis said. ``Then you go against the best DBs in the country _ I
think our defensive backs are the best in the nation _ in practice.
They will watch the experienced guys and learn a lot like I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it is I'll go in as a starter, but the other
guys can play my position. We'll all have a chance. We're pretty
much equal. It will be the guys who are consistent and run routes
so good that the DBs can't hold you that will play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis plans to be one of those guys. That will be the first step
toward making this a memorable season for him.

BONE CHIP DASHES MOCEANU'S PLAN TO RETURN TO OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hobbled by a tiny chip of bone jammed in her knee, what
her coach described as a ``wear-and-tear injury,'' Dominique
Moceanu announced Thursday that she has abandoned her dream to
return to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better here than a week from now,'' said Moceanu, America's
adolescent darling leading up to the 1996 Olympic Games. ``I have
to move on with life...life moves on...of course I am really sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, 18, officially called it quits less than 48 hours
before she was to compete in the first phase of the women's
gymnastics Olympic trials here Friday at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   According to her coach, Merry Lee Tracy, Moceanu injured the
knee Tuesday at the Fleet while practicing her floor routine. A
subusequent MRI and a call to the surgeon who operated on her knee
last summer delivered the diagnosis: a displaced bone chip lodged
in the knee. Moceanu, who will have surgery next week in
Cincinnati, has given up any idea of competing in Sydney (i.e. no
petition), and hopes to be back in about six weeks to join a post
Olympic tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to look at my life after this,'' said Moceanu, who
won't decide until January, after the tour, whether to continue
with competitive gymnastics. ``I have to try to get healthy and get
on with life.'' So goes another episode in Moceanu's life, another
chapter in what could be fodder for a Danielle Steele airport
novel. Following Atlanta, she ran away from home, eventually sued
her parents to gain her independence, and had a restraining order
issued against her father -- whom she accused of hoodwinking her
out of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a lot better today than I was last night,'' said
Moceanu, who looked tired, as if she had been crying, during her
afternoon news conference on the third floor of the Fleet. ``I got
all the tears out and called my Mom, and the family and friends
that were going to come and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu will remain here through Sunday night, she said, rooting
on her teammates. She'll meet with doctors Monday in Cincinatti and
undergo the operation as soon as it could be scheduled next week.
Doctors have been told to expect a three-week recovery process,
leaving her about another three weeks to get back into the gym and
shape up for the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've been dealt a big deck of cards,'' said Moceanu.
``I don't know why things do happen, but I know that they happen
for a reason. I've got to have faith and hope that everything will
work out for the best. And no matter how hard life gets sometimes,
you know, I've learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was, at best, a long shot to return to Olympus.
Ultimately six women will be chosen for Sydney, and it will be a
surprise if more than two are '96 returnees. With the likes of
veterans Shannon Miller, Dominique Dawes and Amy Chow, seriously in
the hunt, Moceanu's name had barely surfaced earlier in the week
when Bela Karolyi, her former coach and now head of the women's
squad, handicapped the field.
</P>
<P>
   Come January Moceanu will have to decide whether to tune up for
a shot in the world championships, or make the hardest trip of her
life -- walk away from the sport that four years ago made her a
magazine cover girl.
</P>
<P>
   If it is time to go, Moceanu said she will pursue acting,
modeling and a career in sports broadcasting. She hopes to be in
Sydney next month, if only as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing event and, yeah, I'll be sad watching it,''
she said. ``But I'll be rooting for our team. I have to get used to
it, because from here on out, I will be watching most of these
things.''

www.2600.com to stop offering copies of DeCSS, a program that can
be used to circumvent the anti-piracy features found on DVD movie
disks.
</P>
<P>
   Not only must 2600 stop offering the software directly, Kaplan
ordered 2600 to remove any hyperlinks to other sites that offer
DeCSS. This last command both angered and inspired an attorney for
2600, who says it increases the chances that her client will win on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Gross of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet
civil liberties group, rejects the idea that DeCSS is an illegal
computer program. But she said the even if it is, 2600, has a
constitutional right to tell people how to get it. ``The judge has
essentially carved out a new exception to the First Amendment,''
Gross said. ``You can go on the Internet and find out where you can
buy drugs, and nobody can tell you can't do it.'' Gross said she'll
take this argument to the federal appeals court and the US Supreme
Court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said there's no constitutional protection for linking to
illegal materials. ``If you have criminally obscene material, you
can't link it,'' he said. Valenti, who represents the major
Hollywood studios that filed the suit, considers Kaplan's ruling
airtight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe for one second that the Supreme Court will
even look at this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeCSS was created last year by Norwegian programmers who claim
they were trying to invent a way to play DVD movies on computers
running the Linux operating system, because Linux-compatible DVD
software was not yet available for purchase. But the Motion Picture
Association of America regarded DeCSS as a transparent effort to
crack the encryption built into DVD disks, in order to prevent
illegal copying of movies.
</P>
<P>
   The 2600 site posted a copy of the DeCSS program. The MPAA
demanded that they remove it. 2600 did so, but encouraged
supporters throughout the Internet to post the software on their
own Web sites. Then 2600 published links to these other sites.
Technically, the software was no longer on 2600's own computer, but
in practical terms it was still available at the site.
</P>
<P>
   2600 argued that distribution of the software is an act of free
expression protected by the First Amendment, a view that Kaplan
dismissed in scornful terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer code is not purely expressive, any more than the
assassination of a political figure is purely a political
statement,'' Kaplan said. Both the software and the assassin carry
out particular functions, the judge said, and government has a
legitimate interest in regulating those functions. ``The
Constitution, after all, is a framework for building a just and
democratic society. It is not a suicide pact.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that DeCSS is banned under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. That federal law makes it a crme to circumvent
encryption features aimed at preventing piracy of software, music
or movies. The law allows for certain exceptions, but Kaplan ruled
that DeCSS is covered by none of them.

ABSENT PUTIN TAKING CRITICISM IN SUB DISASTER MISMANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The disaster on the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk has
seriously imperiled, if not already taken, the lives of 116
sailors, and further tarnished the shaky reputation of Russia's
crumbling military.
</P>
<P>
   It may yet claim another victim: President Vladimir Putin's
reputation as a strong, dynamic leader who can turn this former
superpower around after years of chaos and decline.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's image as a man of action has made him popular in a land
weary of the absentee leadership of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
But with all of Russia watching the tragedy unfold in the Arctic
waters of the Barents Sea, Putin has refused to interrupt his
vacation on the warm waters of the Black Sea, and appears not to
have taken charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk sank in the Barents Sea last Saturday, but it was not
until Wednesday that Putin made his first, brief, statement on the
situation. He then ordered the navy to accept help from Britain and
Norway, three days after it was offered. With oxygen on board the
crippled submarine dwindling, the delay could cost lives.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has pulled a Yeltsin. The public has taken notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night the sailors on the Kursk fell silent,'' declared
the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda Thursday, after officials
said they no longer detected signs of life on board. ``Why has the
president been silent?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why on earth did he think it was possible to keep mum for five
days while the entire nation has spent those days consumed by only
one thought _ will they be saved or won't they?,'' the newspaper
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, too, expressed surprise at the low profile of the
president during the Kursk crisis, who since being elected in March
has reigned in the powers of unruly regional governors, snipped the
wings of high-flying business magnates, and pushed through a tax
code that could mark the beginnings of an ambitious economic reform
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Putin's inactivity now may have implications
for how far he will be able to back up with action his ambitious
statements about restore Russia's Cold War-era status as a global
sea power. The crisis also will likely fuel an unruly public
dispute among senior commanders over the distribution of the skimpy
resources Russia's budget is able to committ to defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the first chink in Putin's armor,'' said Alan
Rousso, director of the Moscow office of Carnegie Center. ``You
think he'd have it better than his predecessor, but there has been
no coordination in the rescue effort. Putin's inability to get
control over the armed forces in this crisis is telling.''
</P>
<P>
   In Putin's place, military and civilian officials have offered
conflicting and often false reports about the fate of the
submarine. Stunned, sullen officials have refused to release the
names of the crew, or any other information, to families and loved
ones. In the port of Murmansk, home of the Northern Fleet where the
Kursk was based, officials have held no briefings. Panicked
residents, some of whom fear that a major environmental catastrophe
is underway and the government is covering up, have been told only
that Murmansk is ``prepared for any eventuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the navy's apparently overmatched rescue fleet has
tried repeatedly to latch a modified version of a diving bell on to
an escape hatch of the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Foul weather and strong currents have hampered the efforts. But
no one seems to be rushing to take charge. It was only Thursday
that the naval chief and a senior Cabinet member, Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebanov, flew to the Northern Fleet's base in
Murmansk to assess the situation and decide, as an official
statement put it, ``how to conduct the rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's handling of the submarine incident is likely to
dent Putin's standing with the military, which has been a major
source of his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sailors dying in the Barents Sea couldn't interrupt the
summer leaves of our statesmen,'' the daily Izvestia said in a
clear reference to Putin. ``They are having a picnic on the shore
with a view of the drowning men.''
</P>
<P>
   As a British rescue mission equipped with a deep-sea submersible
Thursday raced against time to reach the Kursk before the air
supply ran out, the military for the first time said heavy damage
to the front of the submarine meant that casualties were
unavoidable. A Navy spokesman, reversing earlier statements that
the sub had gone down under control of the crew, said Thursday that
the Kursk sank rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no official wants to say what many naval experts believe
_ that since the compartments where the sub's commander, officers,
and 60 percent of the crew were destroyed and flooded, it is likely
that they were unable to escape. Thursday, Russia's prime minister,
Mikhail Kasyanov, said only that the situation was ``close to
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   A major disaster, such as the loss of much or all of the crew,
would be an embarrassment for Putin, who has staked a lot of
prestige on reviving the military. The president rarely misses an
opportunity to pose with troops, and in April, dressed in naval
officer's garb, he spent a night on a submerged submarine from the
Northern Fleet where the Kursk was based.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that because Putin's popularity with the
public at large has survived despite setbacks in the war in
Chechnya, it is not about to diminish now.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's image was born in the Chechnya crisis, and he has
managed its perceived setbacks well. And during the deadly bombing
in central Moscow last week, Putin took control, promising to catch
the perpetrators, while pleading not to rush to blame ordrinary
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kursk catastrophy is a different matter altogether,'' said
the newspaper Kommersant, which is owned by Boris Berezovsky, an
erstwhile Kremlin insider who has become increasingly critical of
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can show a `successful' struggle against terrorists, as
experience shows, without producing any detained masterminds of
terrorist acts,'' the paper said. ``But to save a boat without
saving it is something no one can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the government's conduct reminds them of
Soviet-era disasters, such as the explosion at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant in 1986, when officials were more preoccupied
with keeping information under wraps and shifting blame than
helping victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities are covering for themselves, the commanders
are covering up for themselves, and this is a bad sign for
Russia,'' said Moscow defense analyst Alexander Zhilin. ``The
question for the Russian military is when it will start putting the
lives of its people ahead of political considerations.''

   DVD-DECODE (New York) _ A federal judge ruled Thursday that a
Web site operator cannot distribute a computer program used to
crack codes that prevent the piracy of movies. The ruling, a
victory for the motion picture industry, applies only to the Web
site operator, Eric C. Corley, and his company, 2600 Enterprises.
But experts on both sides of the issue agreed that the decision
could have far greater reach as the courts hammer out legal
guidelines that will govern the rules of commerce and free speech
in the digital world. By John Sullivan.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Veerappan, the legendary bandit who has
humbled two Indian state governments with the kidnapping of a
matinee idol, is notorious as an elephant poacher, sandalwood
smuggler and ruthless killer who has eluded hundreds of police
officers devoted for years to nothing but his capture.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is reinventing himself as a romantic, gun-toting champion
of the people.
</P>
<P>
   Defying the expectations of the police, he has not demanded a
huge ransom or an amnesty for his crimes in exchange for the
release of the revered movie star, Rajkumar, 72, whom he has hidden
away in the jungle for the past 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Veerappan's roster of demands read like a political
manifesto for ethnic Tamils and the poor in the south Indian states
of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which have a combined population of
100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Let a statue to the Tamil-language poet Thiruvalluvar be erected
in Kannada-speaking Karnataka, he asserted. Let low-caste families
whose relatives have been murdered be compensated, he decreed. Let
51 of my compatriots and five Tamil militants _ detained for years
without trial under a draconian antiterrorism law _ be released.
All these wishes have been granted.
</P>
<P>
   An official emissary of the two states, a magazine editor, R. R.
Gopal, was venturing Thursday into the immense forest, alive with
elephants, tigers and cobras, that is the habitat of the hard-eyed
outlaw with the handlebar mustache. Gopal is bearing documents that
prove that the states have revoked the detention orders against the
56 people.
</P>
<P>
   As the kidnapping case has dragged on, its fascination for the
public has not flagged. Nor has its potential to terrify state
politicians who fear for their own political hides should any harm
come to Rajkumar, an elderly star with bad knees, who, like his
kidnapper, goes by one name.
</P>
<P>
   Rajkumar himself, in a taped message released in the first week
of his captivity, expressed great sympathy for Veerappan, who _ in
kidnapping him from his farmhouse on the fringes of the jungle on
July 30 _ respectfully called him ``sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever his desire, please fulfill it,'' the actor pleaded,
concluding with a paean to the outlaw: ``He is looking after us
with love and affection. He fully trusts us, and we have confidence
in him.''
</P>
<P>
   To a remarkable extent, the states have heeded the actor's
entreaties, but there has also been outrage at what The Indian
Express called ``the abject surrender'' to Veerappan.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning him by name, President K.R. Narayanan, in a
speech to the nation on Aug. 14, the eve of Indian Independence
Day, declared, ``It is time that civil society and the lawful
government asserted their authority and primacy over the daredevil
heroes of crime and banditry.''
</P>
<P>
   But the case is a delicate one. It presents perils that go
beyond the dire political consequences for the Congress Party,
which governs Karnataka, should harm befall Rajkumar. Officials
fear that Veerappan's demands could inflame old linguistic and
cultural antagonisms between the Tamil-speaking minority and the
Kannada-speaking majority in Karnataka, for whom the
Kannada-speaking actor, Rajkumar, is a mythic figure of regional
pride.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is a history of anti-Tamil violence in Karnataka's
capital, Bangalore. In 1991, 17 Tamils were killed in riots and
hundreds of buildings destroyed after a court gave more irrigation
water from the Cauvery River to Tamil Nadu than Karnataka wanted to
share.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan has again raised these sensitive claims, demanding
that Tamil Nadu receive a larger share of the Cauvery water, that
the victims of the riots be compensated and that Tamil be given the
status of an official language in Karnataka.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan himself is an enigma. The police say he is a cunning,
inhuman criminal who strangled his infant daughter, murdered his
cousins because they were rival poachers and killed dozens of
policemen.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996 Veerappan told his version of the story to Gopal _
now the official emissary _ in nine hours of videotape whose
dialogue has been transcribed and published in Tamil. M.S.S.
Pandian, a fellow at the Madras Institute of Development Studies,
summarized it and translated portions into English in an essay in
the Economic and Political Weekly of Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan describes in detail his kidnappings and killings, but
he depicts them as righteous efforts to avenge outrages committed
by the police as they pursued him.
</P>
<P>
   He says they raped, tortured and stole from the forest people
who protected him, and preyed on the desperately poor, extorting
money from those who depended on illegally hunting elephants and
cutting sandalwood for their survival.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking policeman who spent years chasing Veerappan,
who refused to allow his name to be used, acknowledged in an
interview that the police had committed terrible abuses over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his narration, the outlaw described himself as having been
born to a peasant family that could not afford to educate him. He
went to work at a young age, he said, grazing cattle. He became a
hunter, too, and that led to life as an elephant poacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We target and shoot at the forehead of the elephant,'' he
said. ``It slumps to death without even knowing that life is
departing. Good death. To feed on its carcass birds come. 8.4
million living beings like birds and ants would eat it. Of all
charity, feeding is the greatest.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The question now on the minds of the police and Rajkumar's fans
is what Veerappan will do with his captive. The risk of violence in
Bangalore, the capital of Karnataka, would be great if Rajkumar
were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   His kidnapping has already stirred his devout following to rage.
They took to the streets, throwing rocks, setting fires and
shutting down Bangalore _ one of Asia's most dynamic, modern
cities, with a population of about 5 million _ for two full days.
Schools and colleges were closed for two weeks and reopened only
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gopal, the Tamil journalist who is the government emissary to
Veerappan, said in a diary of the case in Outlook magazine that he
agreed to take on the job after the chief minister of Tamil Nadu
told him that the safety of hundreds of thousands of Tamils in
Karnataka was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Gopal, who had negotiated the release of an earlier group of
Veerappan's hostages, described his first foray into the jungle,
from Aug. 7 to 9, as beginning in a tribal hut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late evening, as darkness envelops the forests, Veerappan's
men lead me and my team,'' he wrote. ``We begin walking. It seems
like an endless journey. Finally, we halt for the night. It is
uncomfortable. Insect bites make my skin itch perpetually. I can't
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finally reached Veerappan the next day, he said, he
found him a changed man _ indeed the police describe a man worn out
from a life on the run, suffering from asthma and a bad stomach.
``Gone is his swagger and gay abandon,'' Gopal wrote. ``He is more
serious and stiff.'' This new man also speaks ``as if he is the
sole representative of the Tamils.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rajkumar, on his 10th day of captivity, seemed to the
magazine editor to have ``fallen in love with life in the jungle.''
He spoke in fluent Tamil of its lush natural beauty, of his long
chats with his abductors and of his close association with Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard about the Stockholm syndrome,'' Gopal wrote
dryly, referring to the development of a bond between hostages and
kidnappers. ``Probably this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds of talks with the outlaw, Gopal headed back to
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as he heads back into the depths of jungle, India waits
for the next chapter of the saga.

METAL STRIP THAT DAMAGED TIRE WAS NOT PART OF CONCORDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story is not bylined) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French minister of transportation said Thursday that
a metal strip that punctured a tire on the Concorde that crashed
north of Paris on July 25, killing 113 people, was apparently part
of another aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears it came from another plane,'' the minister,
Jean-Claude Gayssot, told the Europe One radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Gayssot's ministry and at the French Bureau of
Accident Investigations emphasized that the source of the 16-inch
strip of metal had not been definitely identified, but that it was
not part of the Concorde and appeared instead to have fallen onto
the runway from another aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that chunks of rubber from the ruptured
tire tore through the Concorde's wing, producing a fuel leak and
fire that caused both engines on the left side of the plane to shut
down and the aircraft to crash.

MUSLIMS BEGINNING TO MAKE THEIR PRESENCE FELT IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats had a right to boast about their natural
diversity at their 43rd convention here this week, and they did it
every chance they got.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker pointed out that the party has long been
made up of, and continues to welcome, all people, regardless of
color, gender, religion or sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   But while all the talk about inclusion was being shouted from
the podium at the Staples Center, one minority group was quietly
making history simply by its unprecedented presence here.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Muslim- and Arab-Americans were part of the convention
for the first time, leaders say, and this was just the beginning.
There were five Muslims in the Texas delegation, three delegates
and two alternates.
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas breakfast yesterday morning, Zafar Tahir of Houston
became the first Muslim to offer the opening prayer for the state
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Syed A. Ahsani, an alternate from Arlington, said many Muslims
identify with the Democratic Party because it does have a history
of inclusion and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   A former ambassador of Pakistan and chairman of the American
Muslim-Arab Political Coalition for the Southwest Region, Ahsani
said people of the Islamic faith are becoming better organized and
are beginning to participate more in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 million Muslims reside in the United States, he said,
and Islam is the fastest growing religion in the country.

backing _ the backing of Muslims,'' said delegate Selma Tameez of
Houston. ``The last 10 years we've come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Mustafa Iqbal Tameez, who is active in the Harris
County Democratic Party, said that, based on the number of
delegates at this convention and the growing number of Muslims in
the country, it won't be long before ``Muslims will have the swing
vote'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that almost 80 percent of the Muslims are
concentrated in such key electoral states as New York, Texas,
California, Michigan, Illinois and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who understand that, and those who are truly visionary,
will begin to reach out and include Muslim-Americans,'' Mustafa
Tameez said.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Al Gore's running mate being Jewish, all the
Muslim delegates I talked to said Sen. Joe Lieberman's faith wasn't
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no concerns about Lieberman,'' Ahsani said. ``We
appreciate his stand on moral issues because we share the same
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Tameez said, ``The appointment of Joseph Lieberman in
one way opens the door to all religious minorities . . . We are
wanting to see if the administration will keep that door open.''
</P>
<P>
   If Muslims don't have a problem with Gore and Lierberman, they
do have concerns about something President Clinton said recently
when he announced that the administration was reviewing its
position on whether the U.S. Embassy in Israel should be moved from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's speech here Monday night the American
Muslim Council organized a letter-writing campaign among Muslim
delegates in which they reaffirmed their support for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket and for Hillary Clinton's New York campaign
for the U.S. Senate. But they urged the president ``to suspend the
review of moving our embassy into what is regarded under
international law as occupied territory.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gore still behind in the polls, Democrats can't afford to
make too many of their friends unhappy.

HOPES OF SAVING SUBMARINE CREW DIM AS RESCUE EFFORTS CONTINUE TO
FAIL  
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 5th graf to give full ID for the defense minister, Marshal
Igor Sergeyev. An expanded an updated version of this story will

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In frantic efforts made against increasingly hopeless
odds to save the crew of the crippled nuclear-powered submarine
Kursk, Russian rescue teams failed again Thursday to lock onto a
rear escape hatch of the shattered vessel. As they worked, new
reports emerged of catastrophic damage to the hull, suggesting that
the ship went down in a torrent of fire and flooding that may have
killed or mortally wounded everyone on board.
</P>
<P>
   With no signs of life for two days from any of the 118 sailors
and officers, Russia's top navy commanders met with Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebvanov at Severodmorsk, headquarters of the
Northern Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were to discuss whether to continue the so-far
fruitless attempts to land a rescue vessel on the Kursk's rear deck
or whether to use other methods to raise and begin salvaging the
vessel, whose two nuclear reactors pose a threat to Arctic
fisheries. The submarine sank last weekend during naval maneuvers
in the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The grim damage assessments were made after viewing hours of
underwater video of the Kursk's shattered bow section, cracked deck
plates, shredded foredeck and battered conning tower. And stark
differences between Moscow and Washington were emerging over the
fundamental cause of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, said he had
``irrefutable data'' pointing to a collision. But senior U.S.
defense and intelligence officials said the Kursk had suffered
powerful internal explosions. No scenario yet bridged the two
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov called the situation ``next to
catastrophic,'' as engineers and admirals studied whether giant
pontoons could be fitted to the rear of the Kursk to bring its rear
escape hatch nearer to the surface where divers might open it.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past night, there were no changes for better or
worse,'' Kasyanov told a meeting of senior government officials in
Moscow. He added that ``we want to hope that there are chances''
remaining to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   In Murmansk, where Russian naval officials mobilized the
hospital ship Svir to treat sailors who might be freed by rescuers,
a sense of gloom set in. Some families said they had all but lost
hope.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the whole crew may be lost, making the sinking
of the Kursk Russia's worst peacetime naval disaster, generated a
wave of recriminations through the Russian news media.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism was aimed at the military, but also at the
Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who remained on vacation at
the Black Sea resort of Sochi and planned to meet with leaders of
former Soviet republics on Friday, the day when navy officials were
expected to acknowledge that the crew no longer had breathable air.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian media also questioned why the military and Putin had
failed to disclose to the nation that a tragedy had occurred on
Saturday, when the first reports of underwater explosions rattled
Western intelligence sensors in the region. The government
acknowledged the accident only on Monday, saying the mishap had
occurred on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sailors on the Kursk fell silent yesterday,'' the
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda stated Thursday in large red type.
``Why has the president been silent? Why on earth did he think it
was possible to keep mum for five days, when the entire nation has
spent those days consumed with only one thought _ will they be
saved or won't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia said the catastrophe had ``sunk the people's faith'' in
government. ``It is the authorities themselves who have hit
bottom,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater video taken over several days and analyzed at navy
headquarters Thursday confirmed massive structural damage to the
forward compartments of the ship, including the bridge section
under the conning tower where Capt. Gennadi Lyachin, 45, and a
number of senior officers of the Northern Fleet would have been
stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a
flash,'' said a navy spokesman, Igor Dygalo.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest mystery that remains is what triggered the
disaster as the 14,000-ton vessel steamed through the Barents Sea
at a depth that longtime Russian naval officers regarded as
dangerously shallow for the Kursk to operate in, given its length
of 490 feet and height of more than 100 feet from the bottom of the
keel to the top of its conning tower and periscope masts. A simple
failure of a torpedo tube or of the steering mechanism could pull
its nose down and send it crashing into the bottom, Western and
Russian naval experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev's remarks Thursday injected a new mystery into the sea
tragedy. U.S. defense and intelligence officials said Wednesday
that they detected the sound of two underwater explosions, one much
larger than the other, near the Kursk's location on Saturday
morning. The U.S. officials cast doubt on any speculation that the
submarine was involved in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   But Sergeyev, in remarks to the Interfax news agency, asserted
Thursday that ``The scenario in which the Kursk submarine suffered
from a collision with another object is now the main one _
irrefutable data are already available.'' He did not elaborate on
that evidence and whether it arose exclusively from an examination
of the hull or from interrogation of naval officers aboard other
Russian ships operating with the Kursk at the time of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Eduard Baltin, former commander of Russian submarine forces in
the Pacific, said Thursday that the Kursk was operating in a sea
lane frequently used by cargo vessels traveling between the ports
of Murmansk and Dikson, a remote port east of Murmansk on the Kara
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only realistic version is the sub collided with a
cargo vessel,'' Baltin said, writing in Thursday's Komsomolskaya
Pravda, ``because it is in this area where there is a recommended
course for civil navigation between Murmansk and Dikson.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a similar collision, with less catastrophic results for
the submarine, occurred in the same area about 15 years ago.

PROTESTERS PROTEST, BUT WHO'S LISTENING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - While the anarchists slept, Jeff Norman was on the
stage in the protest pen informing an empty parking lot of his
magical powers to calm people through the aroma emanating from his
forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Norman reported that he has had these uncommon faculties ever
since he put his hand in a microwave oven a few years ago. The
problem, he conceded, is that for best results his forehead should
be about two inches away from the agitated target, who must then
inhale the aforesaid aroma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't please me to tell you this, but some people seem to
be nauseated by it,'' he said with sadness. ``They recoil in
horror. I guess it's too intimate. It's too bad because they miss
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's other idea for peace at seven a.m. involved skipping _
the thing Judy Garland did a lot of in ``The Wizard of Oz.''
``People need to skip here,'' he maintained. ``I've never seen
anyone riot at a skipping festival and I've never seen anyone skip
at a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument there.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the early protest shift. Speakers Corner in London's
Hyde Park it is not. While the protest stage schedule runs from 7
a.m. to 9 p.m. every day of the convention, the hard-core
contrarians don't arrive in force until late afternoon, which just
happens to dovetail with the start of the network television
convention coverage. Before then, we're pretty much dealing with a
parallel universe.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place full of arresting oratory from people like
Norman or the woman earlier in the week who railed about the dark
forces that tap into our brainwaves to control us. The figures on
the edge of this tableau are memorable as well. There was the tick
lady, whose costume reminded us of the the perils of Lyme disease,
the mysterious woman in the silver Spandex, and the guy running for
president dressed as the Addams Family's Uncle Fester.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, who can forget Citizens Against Breast-Feeding?
</P>
<P>
   ``This primitive ritual has been and continues to be a violation
of babies' civil rights!'' reads the outfit's manifesto. ``This
reprehensible behavior teaches children illicit sex, subsequently
manifesting addiction to promiscuity, homosexuality and cybersex.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That bad.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about lactation; Jeff Norman is talking world peace.
It is worth noting that while his aroma therapy is a show-stopper,
its benefits are limited by the fact that he only has one forehead.
As a result, he focuses on the skipping stratagem. ``I can't be
everywhere at once,'' he reasoned. ``So skipping has a more
far-reaching effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The early shift has been as full of holes as it has been of
passion. There are no-shows every morning, reports Lisa Turvey,
Officer-in-Charge of the Special Events Planning Department of the
L.A. police, who is the de facto booking agent for the protesters.
An extra hour's sleep apparently trumps the limelight after a heavy
night of protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Like the maitre d' at Le Cirque, Turvey has maintained a waiting
list of speaker wannabe's to tap when someone bails on their time
slot. She began on Monday with 11 on the list and as of Thursday
morning had accommodated all but three of them.
</P>
<P>
   Turvey reported smooth sailing in the pen despite the scary
video footage of Monday night's mayhem. ``Everybody has been
wonderful,'' she said. ``No one as gone over their time.'' Some
thanks goes to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, whose office
donated a large wall clock that hangs on a pole near the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the drop-outs snowballed as the week wore on, and they
reached critical mass Thursday when the entire morning lineup after
Norman took a powder. Chalk it up to convention fatigue. The
no-shows included A Schmoo For You slated for 8 a.m. (it's anyone's
guess on who or what that is), PSCHOD, another mystery guest, at
9:20, followed by the United Children Fund and the Alliance For
Democracy. CRAP TV bailed twice earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The morning slide ended with the appearance at noon of Mark
Selzer from the Libertarian Party, who merrily complained about
drug enforcement policies. His audience numbered in the tens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seem to be more police here than there are people,'' he
conceded. But like all true believers, he thought the experience
was swell. ``It's good for me to get up and learn how to speak,''
he beamed.
</P>
<P>
   Selzer was equally relaxed about the complete absence of his
supporters. ``My activists are all burned out,'' he reported. ``Or
else they couldn't find parking.''

JUDGE SETS ASIDE RESTRICTIONS ON SALE OF TOY RETAILER'S DATABASE  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday set aside a Federal
Trade Commission plan limiting the ability of an online toy
retailer to sell its customer database as part of its liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Toysmart.com, reached a settlement with the
commission last month meant to address concerns over the sale of
data that had been collected with the promise of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Carol Kenner, said Thursday that in the absence
of a buyer, the commission's action was premature. ``I believe that
deciding this in a vacuum, without a real-live bidder here, is
unnecessary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She took the action ``without prejudice,'' meaning that the
trade commission and others are welcome to renew their concerns and
objections once a bid and specific terms have been put forward for
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The function of any court is to resolve actual conflicts,''
the judge added, noting that complaints about potential abuse of
the information were based on hypothetical concerns rather than
specific details.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Rosenfeld, assistant director of the trade commission's
Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the company was disappointed by
the ruling, but noted that the judge had not rejected the basic
premise of the commission's position.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com had pledged not to sell its customer information to
third parties, but its bankruptcy prompted concerns that the data
would be sold as part of its assets. The trade commission voted 3-2
last month in favor of a settlement restricting the sale of the
database. Under those terms, the buyer would have to be in a
family-related commerce market, purchase the entire Web site and
agree not to resell the data without permission from the customers
who submitted it.
</P>
<P>
   Some commission members, state attorneys general and privacy
advocates opposed the settlement, saying it did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Toysmart.com and its creditors withdrew the
company's Web site and customer list last month after rejecting two
offers, including one bid of $50,000 from a subsidiary of the Walt
Disney Co., the majority owner of Toysmart.com, which pledged to
destroy the list.
</P>
<P>
   The creditors contended in court Thursday that the commission's
terms unduly constrained efforts to find a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the resolution will be crafted around the buyer,''
said Christopher Panos, a lawyer for the creditors, who urged the
judge not to approve the trade commission's plan. He said the
company ``cannot do anything with this asset without giving notice
to the FTC and the approval of Bankruptcy Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the company's other assets since its shutdown in May
have yielded more than $5 million, more than initially expected,
said Harry Murphy, a bankruptcy lawyer for Toysmart.com. He blamed
adverse publicity from the company's June attempt to market its
customer lists for the shortage of bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted to walk into a lawsuit,'' he said. ``Now we're
back where we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenner gave no deadline for Toysmart.com to find a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Other bankrupt dot-com companies have sold their customer data,
though Craftshop.com, a now-defunct arts and crafts retailer, also
withdrew its list from sale last month. The presence of information
about minors among the 250,000 customers in Toysmart's database
make its case unique, legal observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the buyer, Toysmart.com customers need to be
advised that details like children's names, ages and toy
preferences might be transferred, argued Pamela Kogut, a
Massachusetts assistant attorney general. Given Toysmart's specific
promise not to share that data with any third parties, customers
should be allowed to choose whether to remain on the list, she
said.

ONLINE CONVENTIONS DON'T LIVE UP TO THE HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If any group was hoping for a ``bounce'' from the Democratic and
Republican conventions, it was the scores of political Web sites
that made their online debuts in Los Angeles and Philadelphia with
lots of gizmos and hype.
</P>
<P>
   But while some said the coming of the Internet to the
conventions would be as momentous as the advent of television 52
years ago, the reality has been somewhat less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Technological problems have plagued many Web sites, causing them
to crash or to abandon many promised features. Some Internet sites
found expenses so high and visitors so low at the Republican
convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia that they drastically
scaled back operations at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even traffic to political Web sites with brand names and long
track records was disappointingly low for the Republicans'
gathering, and some critics complained that the level of political
discourse in online chat rooms was lower than expected, too.
Detailed data on Web sites during the Democratic convention will
not be available until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bridge hasn't yet been made between politics and the
Internet,'' said James Carey, a spokesman for PC Data OnLine, which
tracks Web use. ``There's not a lot of traffic to these sites. It
just isn't working yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Visits to political Web sites _ ranging from such mainstream
sites as MSNBC.com and CNN.com to more cutting-edge sites like
Pseudo.com or SpeakOut.com _ actually fell during the Republican
convention. MSNBC.com, for instance, saw a 27 percent drop in its
visitors to 2.4 million during the week of the convention, and
CNN.com saw an 18 percent drop to 1.9 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Newer Web sites like Speakout.com and Voter.com failed to even
pull more than 150,000 visitors during the Republican convention,
according to Media Metrix Inc., a company that tracks this data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first online convention failed to live up to the hype that
preceded it,'' Michael Cornfield, director of the Democracy Online
Project at George Washington University, said about Philadelphia.
``This is not so surprising because the convention was not an
exciting news event.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for low traffic was the product: Despite
claims by many Internet Web sites that they could jazz up
convention coverage with offbeat stories, chat rooms and nifty
camera shots, the online coverage proved to be no more exciting
than that of regular television, which itself was often greeted
with yawns. Some of the promises _ streaming video, instantaneous
polling and ``behind-the-scenes'' footage _ failed to materialize,
or did so in fuzzy and unattractive formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sites couldn't get their act together,'' said Marion
Just, a researcher at the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press,
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. ``Many wanted to
have the fanciest gadgets and gimmicks, and some sites crashed and
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo.com, which bought a sky box at both conventions, cut its
convention staff in half after the Republican convention, and did
not bring its 360-degree camera to Los Angeles after the camera
produced only small, grainy online pictures, in the opinion of some
viewers, and those came at high costs.
</P>
<P>
   The two political parties failed, as well, to live up to their
promises of plugged-in conventions. The Dems.2000 Web site promised
to have online chats with convention speakers immediately after
their presentations. That did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a live chat, anyone signing on with questions was
given an automated response thanking them for participating in the
``online event,'' saying the party was ``doing its best'' to answer
them and to continue participating in Democratic events online.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican's highly touted dot-com delegate Web site,
which promised ``exclusive'' on-line access to top Republican
officials, also failed to deliver. A promised live chat room never
came about, information given to dot-com delegates was dated and
generic and online polls asked questions not related to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the features lived up to the hype,'' said Chris
Hunter, an analyst with NetElection.Org. ``Chat rooms were vapid
and off-topic. It was all very disappointing. I think lots of the
dot.coms weren't there to promote democracy, but to get another
round of venture capital.''

 &HT;    ROAD OUT OF CONVENTION A STEEPER ONE FOR GORE
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After President Clinton accepted the Democratic
nomination in New York City in 1992, he and Vice President Al Gore
hopped on buses and blazed a trail west, hoping to generate
excitement about their insurgent campaign against President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Gore will wake up at dawn in La Crosse, Wis., and
begin a four-day riverboat cruise down the Mississippi River with
his running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   With bucolic images of the great Mississippi and small-town
America as their stage, Gore and Lieberman will be trying to
re-create the same excitement that catapulted Clinton to the White
House in 1992. But the political dynamics of the 2000 campaign are
far different for Gore and Lieberman than they were for Clinton and
Gore eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the outsiders seeking to scale the castle gates, Gore
and Lieberman are the incumbents seeking to persuade voters that
they offer a fresh start even though they have both belong to the
official Washington establishment.
</P>
<P>
   They also face the daunting task of linking themselves with
Clinton's record, but not his character, which Americans generally
hold in low esteem.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain Gore and Lieberman will encounter is also much
different than it was eight years ago. In 1992, the Midwest was
reeling from a three-year economic recession. Clinton's pledge to
restore the economy and put people back to work mined a rich vein
of voter resentment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Midwest is once again the battleground for the
presidential election. But the region, like most of the rest of the
country, is enjoying record low unemployment, and Gore and
Lieberman will find it more difficult to generate enthusiasm among
voters who are more content than they were eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the states that Clinton and Gore narrowly carried last
time are at risk for the Democrats,'' said Emory University
political scientist Merle Black. Those states include Wisconsin,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Missouri _ all states in which
Gore will campaign heavily between now and Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will contest four states in the South _ North Carolina,
Georgia, Arkansas and Florida _ and also will have to maintain a
strong presence in his home state of Tennessee. Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush, who will campaign in
Tennessee today, intends to make a strong push for the state, which
has a Republican governor and two Republican U.S. senators.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond geography, Gore also will pursue a strategy that seeks to
offer voters a better sense of who he is as a person. So far, Gore
hasn't managed to connect with the voters in the same way that
Clinton did, particularly among suburban women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters have to see him as a reasonable and sympathetic human
being,'' said Black. ``Part of his problem is that voters don't see
him that way. He has this almost robotic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's convention was heavily scripted by the Gore campaign
to overcome such perceptions. All three people who put Gore's name
into nomination stressed his character and integrity. And all three
are people who knew Gore intimately: actor Tommy Lee Jones, a
college friend; Lois Deberry, a Tenmessage has the potential to
draw votes away from Gore in Northwestern states that Clinton and
Gore carried in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nader takes away votes from Gore in those places, and forces
him to spend time and money in places that he should by rights
win,'' said Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   One big unknown as the campaign moves into the critical last few
months is how Gore will respond now that he, and not Clinton, is
the party's standard-bearer. Gore aides portray the vice president
as eager to have finally become the party's nominee and get on with
the final leg of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not worrying about expectations,'' said Carter Eskew, a
senior Gore aide. ``He's worrying about going out and laying out
his ideas, his story and where he wants to take the country. And I
think he'll let the chips fall where they do after that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ By the time the final convention gavel fell, after
days of spreading their version of the ``truth'' about their
governor, Texas delegates had talked themselves into what seems
like the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Lord's help and a lot of good effort we damned well
may win'' Texas for Democratic nominee Al Gore, former state
Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle told cheering delegates at their
Thursday meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate Slagle may be dreaming. And most Democrats here
acknowledged that beating George W. Bush in his back yard is out of
the question. Nevertheless, the Texas delegates headed home today
convinced they had met their goal of serving as eyewitnesses
spinning their view of the Bush record.
</P>
<P>
   State Chair Molly Beth Malcolm was up as early as 4:30 a.m. on
some days to begin making the rounds. Texas Democratic leaders were
popular guests at other delegations' breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's closing convention session, delegates honored
about 30 members of the ``Texas Truth Squad,'' Democrats who have
traveled around the nation to criticize Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As proud Texans we are here to tell you briefly the truth
about things down in Texas,'' state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos told
the convention, detailing the legislative record on teacher pay
hikes, children's health insurance and hate crime measures. ``We
know the truth because we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those joining Barrientos on the podium were state Reps.
Dawnna Dukes and Glen Maxey, as well as Texas AFL-CIO President Joe
Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   With the convention over, the question now is whether the
message of Bush-as-abject-failure will take. Texas chic _ all the
rage in Philadelphia two weeks ago during the Republican National
Convention _ was decidedly out of style this week on the coast
where trends are born.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, all things Texan and Bush were cool, hinting at
the possibility that a Bush win might make Texas trendier than it
has been since Urban Cowboy days.
</P>
<P>
   Out here _ due in part to the Texans' efforts _ it was a
different story. Texas and Bush took it on the chin at the souvenir
stands, from the podium and when the states lined up to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a shot at his home state, Rep. Martin Frost, chairman of the
state delegation, on Thursday said the GOP ticket _ heavy on Texans
_ typifies what's wrong with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an opportunity to demonstrate their diversity in the
ticket they chose,'' Frost said of the Republicans. ``They picked
two white guys from Texas for their ticket. We demonstrated
diversity in our ticket by picking the first Jewish-American to be
vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush running mate Dick Cheney is a former Wyoming congressman
who most recently lived and worked in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Austin, the Texas GOP summed up the Democratic National
Convention as ``Texas under siege'' featuring ``slash-and-burn,
Texas-bashing rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas Democrats are really proud to be Texans they will
join Republican leaders in defending the Lone Star State,'' said
Texas GOP Chair Susan Weddington.
</P>
<P>
   Austin delegate Liz Carpenter, about as Texan _ and Democratic_
as they come, joined in the verbal assault on Bush. In a Thursday
speech to the delegation, Carpenter, 79, poked fun at her long
years in politics by linking herself to another George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew George Washington. He was my friend. And you, Governor
Bush, are no George Washington,'' she said. ``After all, George
Washington never told a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of rhetoric found kindred spirits among those who make
a buck off political conventions. Button sellers offered wares with
messages such as ``Read my lips _ no new Texans,'' ``I refuse to
vote for a son of a Bush,'' ``My dog never met a Bush he didn't
like'' and ``W was born with a silver spoon up his nose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas delegates' attempts to denigrate their governor got a
boost from others during the roll-call vote that nominated the
Democratic ticket. Alaska's delegation chairwoman Cindy Spanyers
told the convention that her state ``is more than twice the size of
Texas, but with a Democratic governor 10 times as smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Chairman Tim Knaus noted that his state is the former
home of Neil Bush, ``George W's brother, who fled our state after
plundering the hard-earned savings of working families in the
savings and loan scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   For Texas, long synonymous with exaggeration, the highs and lows
will be taken in stride. The true state of the state is somewhere
between the polluted mess it sounded like out here and the miracle
portrayed in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Democratic convention moved to its logical and
anticipated conclusion, the Texas delegation declared itself
successful enough to dare to dream outside the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep the Texas House and tak Texas.''

catastrophic damage to the hull, suggesting the ship went down in a
torrent of fire and flooding that may have killed or mortally
wounded everyone aboard. The growing prospect that the crew may be

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS STRESS GOP ABORTION STAND
 &HT;    EDS: Fixes transmission garble
 &HT;    By DAVE McNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Peering out from a large ad in Monday's Washington
Post is Texan Liz Carpenter. In white print over the dark robe
Carpenter is wearing are the words, ``It's the Supreme Court,
Stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   That takeoff on James Carville's ``It's the economy, stupid!''
slogan during Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign is an
underlying chant here at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president will likely nominate two or three Supreme
Court Justices,'' declared the ad, paid for by NARAL, the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. ``Enough to
overturn Roe v. Wade and end legal abortion. George W. Bush says
his model justices are Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Are they
yours?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Thomas have both voted to overturn the 1973 Roe v.
Wade decision that established a woman's right to choose whether to
have an abortion. Texas state law now tracks that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want equality,'' Carpenter said after a rousing speech to
the Texas delegation here. ``And we want the right to make our
choices about the privacy of our own bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Frost, third-ranking Democrat in the U.S. House and
chair of the Texas delegation here, said the issue is very
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the issues where there's a clear distinction
between the two parties,'' Frost said. ``The Democratic party
clearly stands for a woman's right to choose on the issue of
abortion. The Republican party clearly does not _ in fact, has very
anti-choice language in their platform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform states it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The unborn child has a fundamental individual right to live
which cannot be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform says:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it is a fundamental constitutional liberty
that individual Americans, not government, can best take
responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal
decisions regarding reproduction.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure no one misses the difference, NARAL has been handing
out sacks of brochures to delegates here about the issue _
including one with an unflattering picture of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, the Republican nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   That brochure features a 1994 quote from Bush: ``I will do
everything in my power to restrict abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, the chief push Bush made on the abortion front was
requiring notification of a parent of a minor girl before an
abortion can be performed. That was passed by the Texas Legislature
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has disagreed with the Republican Party's stance _
like his father, he would allow abortions in cases of rape, incest,
or where the mother's life is in danger, rather than ban all
abortions _ the nominee said he thought the Republican platform
should not be altered.
</P>
<P>
   And during the primary season earlier this year, Bush said that

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ALICE AND MARTIN,' starring Juliette Binoche and Alexis Loret.
Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes). Techine's sprawling,
emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a
little. It takes time to figure out the relationships between the
characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like
so many of Techine's movies, ``Alice and Martin'' repays the
effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the
troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a
brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and
sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting
domestic alliances. Binoche and Loret are superb in the title roles
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PSYCHO,' starring Christian Bale. Directed by Mary
Harron (R, 104 minutes). Harron's sleekly brilliant screen
adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' notorious 1991 novel pares away
most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal
butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire,
comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Bale
as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-'80s Wall Street
hotshot who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe
Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo
performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's
message about a soulless, surface-obsessed society still applies
(Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN IN NEW YORK,' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder.
Directed by Joan Chen (PG-13, 105 minutes). In this embarrassing
1940s-style weepie, Gere is a superstar Manhattan chef and ``older
man,'' a la Cary Grant, and Ryder the kooky, doe-eyed 22-year-old
hat designer who reforms him. Oh yes, she happens to be dying of a
rare heart disease and has only a year to live. It isn't the
actors' fault that this oil-and-water mixture of '40s suds (Ryder's
character grows more ethereally beautiful the sicker she gets) and
millennial sexual angst doesn't gel (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `BLESS THE CHILD,' starring Kim Basinger, Rufus Sewell and Jimmy
Smits. Directed by Chuck Russell (R, 115 minutes). A runny
supernatural soap opera _ the first thriller of the ``Touched by an
Angel'' era _ that tries for the elegant calm of ``The Sixth
Sense'' but fails. It is too often overcome by its flamboyantly
cheesy reflexes. Basinger is the protector aunt of a child (the
gifted Holliston Coleman) whose heavenly powers make her the target
of an evil cult leader (Sewell, chewing his English accent as if it
were sunflower seeds). He means to kill her before Easter; you may
feel the need to leave long before then. ``Bless the Child'' seems
derivative of so many other movies that you're surprised it doesn't
have to credit its sources the way hip-hop artists do when they
sample songs. With Smits as an FBI agent and Ian Holm as a priest
who does a laughable steal from ``The Usual Suspects'' (Elvis
Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer
Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Lozano), a sensitive young
boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries
of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the
proudly republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `CECIL B. DeMENTED,' starring Melanie Griffith, Stephen Dorff,
Ricki Lake and Patricia Hearst. Written and directed by John Waters
(R, 88 minutes). Waters' newest comedy portrays the ultimate cult
director (Dorff) as a punk madman, part Charles Manson, part Andy
Warhol, leading a band of freaky ``cinema terrorists'' in blows
against the Hollywood empire. When they kidnap a spoiled star
(Griffith) and force her, Symbionese Liberation Army-style, to
commit terrorist acts that become their movie-in-progress, she
gleefully takes to her new role. The targets range from Pauly Shore
to ``Patch Adams'' to ``Forrest Gump.'' Although smart and funny,
the movie lacks the maniacal edge of Waters' most memorable work
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally the film shows that the hens can save
themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a
big deal of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CHUCK AND BUCK,' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed
by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Arteta's funny,
creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who
inhabits the mental world of a pre-adolescent boy. As played by
White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive,
an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles
his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend
Charlie (Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed
careerist. Arteta's visual sense, White's insightful script and
strong supporting performances from Weitz and his brother, Paul, as
well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this
one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some
time. ``Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of
lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore,
magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to
see this year (Scott).

<P>
   `DISNEY'S ``THE KID,''' starring Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin,
Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon
Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's
modest live-action comedies of old, Willis plays a smarmy image
consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self
(Breslin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By
rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with
therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not
bad, thanks to strong performances from Willis, Tomlin and Smart,
and to Audrey Wells' surprisingly clever script (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy
Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former
wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of
tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a
veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires,
squandered relationships with children and, despite it all,
indomitable optimism. ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a
little more analysis of its subject. Instead, it joyfully wallows
in the backdraft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick
to forgive Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she
has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the
televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a
case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note
than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Levine,
Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and
Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial
version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and
classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the
original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring
Mickey Mouse). Despite the science fiction title and the Imax-size
screen on which it is shown, ``Fantasia/2000'' is more
backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to
the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and
the finale (set to Stravinsky's ``Firebird'' Suite), in which a
cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating,
destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity
introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   `HOLLOW MAN,' starring Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue. Directed
by Paul Verhoeven (R, 114 minutes). Verhoeven's sluggish new
special-effects thriller takes a tantalizing premise _ the
corrupting effects of invisibility _ and drowns it in horror-movie
hack work. Bacon plays an egomaniacal scientist who injects himself
with a serum that disrupts his ``quantum synchronization with the
visible universe.'' You can guess the rest. He ends up pursuing his
colleagues (including his ex-girlfriend, played by Shue) through a
labyrinthine underground laboratory, looking, thanks to
computer-generated imagery, like a plasticine anatomical model on a
rampage (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `LOSER,' starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear.
Directed by Amy Heckerling (PG-13, 93 minutes). Admirers of
Heckerling's movies _ notably ``Clueless'' and ``Fast Times at
Ridgmont High'' _ may be disappointed by her latest effort, a
romantic comedy about two college students who overcome the
snobbery and cruelty of their surroundings to find true love. The
script could have used a few more drafts and a less perfunctory
climax, but Heckerling's characteristic wit and intelligence are
still in evidence. Fine performances by Biggs as the title
character, Suvari as the girl of his dreams and Kinnear as a sleazy
literature professor help make ``Loser'' more enjoyable than most
recent youth-targeted date movies (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS,' starring Eddie Murphy and
Janet Jackson. Directed by Peter Segal (PG-13, 105 minutes). In
this sequel, Murphy again displays enough agility to show that he
deserves to be taken seriously. Parts of the film, a variation on
the Jekyll and Hyde story, are tremendously funny. Every single
scene in which Murphy, hidden away under millions of dollars' worth
of transformative makeup, plays all the members of the Klump family
_ all of them together in some scenes _ will knock the blues right
out of you. But some of the cheap laughs to which the picture
stoops will give you the blues. This makes ``Nutty Professor II''
half a movie at best. The broad humor at times derails Murphy's
performances, but the film provides a vehicle for him to display
his reach (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PATRIOT,' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by
Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic
that, at more than 2 1/2 hours, seems to take place in real time.
The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film
will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of
prequel to Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as a gentle
farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits,
using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to those of
terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket.
The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors
playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feelings
about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PERFECT STORM,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane.
Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but
monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in
this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book)
of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the storm of the century''
off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the ship's glowering,
enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the appealing
lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The
early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's
life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie
becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Holden).

   `THE REPLACEMENTS,' starring Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman.
Directed by Howard Deutch (PG-13, 105 minutes). This negligible
jock comedy, about a group of misfit macho clowns who suit up for
pro football during a players' strike, just wants to be loved: Is
that so wrong? This rehashed and desperate picture stars Reeves as
the honorable, stoic fill-in quarterback (he glides through).
Hackman musters his requisite command as the honorable, stoic
fill-in coach in a wardrobe from the Tom Landry Collection,
mouthing dialogue from ``Hoosiers'' and old United Airlines
commercials. The unvaried rag-tag scab players include a pair of
violent bodyguard brothers (Faison Love and Michael Taliferro), a
violent cop (Jon Favreau) and a violent felon on loan to the league
(Michael Jace). Brooke Langton is the cheerleader who resolves not
to date players and dates Reeves anyway. It's a peculiarity from
union town L.A.: A film that celebrates anti-union activity
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SAVING GRACE,' starring Brenda Blethyn and Craig Ferguson.
Directed by Nigel Cole (R, 93 minutes). This innocuous piece of
comic Anglophilia features the usual cast of lovable British
eccentrics plopped down in a picturesque seaside spot, in this case
a Cornish village. Blethyn is Grace, a widow whose husband
committed suicide, leaving her $450,000 in debt and in danger of
losing her lovely stone house. She and her resourceful gardener
(Ferguson, who also wrote the screenplay) convert her greenhouse
into a marijuana farm, and the resulting high jinks resemble a twee
hybrid of ``The Full Monty'' and the lesser works of Cheech and
Chong (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SCARY MOVIE,' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon
Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Wayans'
latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ``Scream''
movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy.
``Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male
genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There
are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty
laughter, but Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies
_ like the wildly popular ``Scream'' series _ that already parody
themselves (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `SPACE COWBOYS,' starring Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and James Garner. Directed by Eastwood. The
second half of Eastwood's new movie is a pleasant reworking of the
standard trouble-in-space movie, with Eastwood himself leading a
heroic team of astronauts that also includes Jones, Sutherland and
Garner. But the first half, which consists of the comic,
tough-old-guy interplay between these four sublime actors, is a
boisterous, easygoing tribute to manhood and maturity. Sutherland
and Jones are in especially fine form, as are Marcia Gay Harden,
playing a NASA engineer, and James Cromwell as (once again) the
villainous bureaucrat who tries to deny the old-timers their shot
at celestial glory (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE TAO OF STEVE,' starring Donal Logue and Greer Goodman.
Directed by Jenniphr Goodman (R, 87 minutes). The ``Steve'' in the
title refers to the spiritual embodiment of cool as exemplified by
Steve McQueen, Steve McGarrett (``Hawaii Five-0'') and Steve Austin
(``The Six Million Dollar Man''), a goal to which the blobby and
amiable Dex aspires. In this light-as-a-marshmallow romantic
comedy, Dex (Logue) has lined up quotes from Heidegger, Thomas
Aquinas and ``Don Giovanni'' to rationalize his aimless
pleasure-seeking in this rather aimless movie. Logue's performance
as a nice-guy player _ his weight doesn't keep him from scoring
with the ladies _ makes the movie glide. Dex has a cherub's glee
over what he gets away with. The movie becomes a lot less
interesting when it rolls around to the inevitable quest for a
steady relationship with a girl (Goodman) whose feelings were
trampled in Dex's compulsive fox-hunting. ``Tao'' can't redeem the
moves to its predictable end, but its protagonist has a great time
getting there (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT LIES BENEATH,' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Zemeckis'
film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire
(Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her
daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still
recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts
showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Ford), is a
driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as
implausibly chilling as any ``X-Files'' episode. By the last 10
minutes, your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WIND WILL CARRY US,' starring Behzad Dourani. Directed by
Abbas Kiarostami (not rated, 118 minutes). The latest film by this
Iranian director, widely considered one of the greatest living
filmmakers, is oblique, evocative and visually stunning.
Kiarostami's views of hillsides, valleys and gnarled, solitary
trees seem almost otherworldly in their clarity and depth, and his
story, about a morose engineer who has come to a remote Kurdish
village on an enigmatic mission, is as simple and mysterious as a
folk tale. This is one of those rare movies that completely absorb
your attention _ and demand your concentration _ while you're
watching, and that stay in your thoughts, growing richer and more
powerful, for a long time afterward (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `X-MEN,' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman,
Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed
by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of
Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of
levels: For one, the acting duel between Stewart (as the mutant
telepath Professor X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the
mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism).
As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other, you get
the feeling that you really are watching members of another species
in action. And Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational
Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all
wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He
lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications.
Otherwise, the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it
should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously
than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that
devotion (Mitchell).

SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THEY HAVE FOUND ORIGIN OF SKIN CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill., N.J.)   (Previously skedded as SCI-SKIN-CANCER)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's not like discovering a new bone in the human body.
But researchers now believe they have found the source of the new
skin cells that replace those shed in every day's wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Those source, or stem, cells turn out to be hiding in the roots
of the hair.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, if confirmed, could lead to a better understanding
of how the skin heals as well as to insights into basal cell
carcinoma, a common skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hair follicles, small pockets in the skin from which the hair
shaft sprouts, occur in varying density throughout the human skin,
except in the palms, soles, foreskin and labia. Even in bald
scalps, hair follicles are present and healthy but just arrested in
midcycle.
</P>
<P>
   A small bulge on the side of the follicle, just below the skin
surface, houses stem cells that migrate down to the follicle root
and repopulate the hair-making cells. Researchers report in
Friday's issue of Cell the surprising finding that the bulge is
also home to the stem cells for the skin.
</P>
<P>
   These epidermal stem cells migrate upward from the bulge and
into the surrounding skin, the researchers say. Given the general
spacing of hair follicles in human skin, a stem cell need only
migrate 3 millimeters, or one tenth of an inch, to cover half the
distance to the neighboring follicle.
</P>
<P>
   The senior authors of the study are Dr. Tung-Tien Sun of the New
York University School of Medicine and Dr. Robert M. Lavker of the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The two
dermatologists have been working together in search of the skin's
and other stem cells for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their experiment tracking the exodus of the stem cells from the
follicle bulge was done in mice, but human follicles also have a
bulge and it seems likely this is also a source of skin cells in
people too, said Dr. Elaine Fuchs, a skin biologist at the
University of Chicago. But there might be other sources of stem
cells in human skin, she said, particularly in the regions that
have no hair follicles.
</P>
<P>
   She described the work as a ``very important finding'' because
it nailed down the localization of the skin's stem cell compartment
and also showed the stem cells in the bulge are pluripotent,
meaning they can develop either into hair cells or skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the body's cells have assumed their final, mature form,
and if they divide at all will produce two identical daughter
cells. Stem cells, when they divide, produce daughter cells which
can either remain as stem cells or develop into mature cells of the
relevant type. This means the population of stem cells is
continually replenished, acting as permanent reservoir for
replacing damaged tissue cells.
</P>
<P>
   Recent discoveries about the stem cells in other tissues are
suggesting the cells are remarkably versatile and that, with the
right signals, one kind of stem cell can be converted to another.
If stem cells should become an important way of helping to repair
the body's tissues, as many biologists are hoping, the bulge of a
patient's hair follicles will be a particularly convenient source.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurt S. Stenn, director of the skin biology research
laboratory of Johnson &AMP; Johnson in Skillman, N.J., said the new
study was convincing and would advance any application of stem
cells for healing the skin since the source of the cells was now
known.
</P>
<P>
   Lavker said that he and Sun have not yet formally proved that a
single cell can make either hair or skin, but he believes that if
the cells in the bulge receive a signal to generate skin cells they
will migrate up and into the skin; if the cue is to generate hair,
they will migrate down into the base of the follicle. The relevant
cues have not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding suggests that any form of hair removal that
damages the hair follicles could impair the long-term health of the
skin by depriving the area of its stem cells. Stenn said that
electrolysis, for example, destroys the follicles. But he and other
dermatologists did not know why the skin generally seems to escape
damage in these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lavker believes his work may help explain basal cell carcinoma,
a skin cancer caused by ultra-violet light. The light cannot reach
the stem cells in their deep-set bulge but it can derange the stem
cell's descendants as they migrate closer to the surface. It is
these light-damaged cells, that have considerable proliferative
capacity, that initiate the cancer, Lavker believes.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists do not yet understand the widely varying qualities
and distribution of human hair. There is an evolutionary advantage
in having no follicles on the palms or soles, Stenn suggested,
because grip is improved by having no hair there. But how nature
arranges for this outcome is not yet known. Lavker believes that
the copious sweat glands found in the palms and soles are probably
the site of these region's stem cells.

VERIZON, UNION SAY PROGRESS MADE IN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon Communications and one of its two striking unions
reported making substantial progress Thursday, saying they would
likely continue to negotiate until an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, officials from the Communications Workers of
America, the larger of two unions that struck the company Aug. 6,
said members of its bargaining committee would leave the talks if a
tentative agreement was not reached by midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, CWA spokeswoman Candice Johnson said Thursday the two
sides had not reached an impasse and would now likely continue the
talks. But labor leaders from the CWA's north bargaining committee,
which represents former NYNEX Co. employees, maintained they would
abide by the pledge to quit talking if no agreement were reached by
the midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some progress over the last 24 hours and talks
are continuing,'' said Johnson. ``We are going to keep at it. We
want to reach a settlement. Officials will keep talking and they
will try to resolve the issue,'' she added. ``There will not be a
complete walkout. Top officials will continue to talk. But the
bargaining committee members are frustrated and have said that if
there is no substantial movement they will go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to move the talks toward a resolution, the 13,000-member
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers submitted a new
proposal outlining new job security language. Details concerning
the proposal were not available.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides have worked out some of their differences
some issues remain, including the unions' demand for more job
protection and security. Labor leaders said they are concerned that
work in the Eastern region will be moved to call centers in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rabe, vice president of communications at Verizon, said the
company would find new jobs for workers who do not wish to
relocate. ``We do not force people to move across the country,'' he
said. ``The ability to move work refers to being able to shift
calls from centers where there is less demand to those that have
greater demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe seemed hopeful the negotiators were nearing a resolution.
``Sometimes it is helpful to have a deadline,'' he said. ``It gets
people focused.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, the company services about 25 million residential
clients and businesses from Maine to Virginia, some of whom have
experienced disruptions in service. The number of repair requests
increased to 100,000 this week, up from 80,000 last week, and
people in need of new phone lines have been asked to wait until the
strike ends.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether one union could reach an agreement before the
other, Rabe said he was not sure whether one labor group was
further ahead and would agree to a settlement this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the unions had reported progress in reaching an
agreement on the unions' request for permission to organize
wireless workers through a card check neutrality plan, one segment
of the IBEW has said it has not yet resolved the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spillane, a spokesman for the IBEW, told the wire services
Thursday the union is concerned that some wireless workers in New
Jersey would not be covered by the card check neutrality agreement.
Card check allows unions to avoid time-consuming elections that can
be challenged by employers.
</P>
<P>
   While talks continued Thursday, managers from Verizon
Communications testified before a panel of judges at Suffolk
Superior Court in Boston that they had been harassed by strikers
while on their way to work.
</P>
<P>
   The managers said strikers had called them names, hurled sexual
slurs, and threatened to kill them. The company is seeking an
injunction to bar strikers from blocking company doors and exits
and prevent harassment.

 &HT;    UPS is criticized for tracking charge for Web inquiries
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This may be the Information Age, but United Parcel
Service Corp. has found a way to limit access to Internet data that
can cost it money.
</P>
<P>
   The company began guaranteeing delivery times for its ground
shipments in 1998 and promises full refunds for packages that
arrive late. UPS even invites customers to track their shipments on
the company's Web site for free.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch in the fine print of UPS shipping contracts.
</P>
<P>
   UPS reserves the right to charge $3 for each Web inquiry if
customers or their agents track too many packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS makes promises and then tries as hard as possible not to
keep them,'' said Mark Taylor, founder a ShippingRefunds.com, a
Michigan firm that audits freight bills. ``The right thing for UPS
to do would be to honor its commitments. Instead, it throws every
conceivable roadblock at anyone who tries to make them keep their
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said UPS uses the threat of charges for Web inquiries to
keep customers from obtaining the refunds.
</P>
<P>
   ``UPS bullies shippers and tries to intimidate them,'' he said.
``UPS regards people like me as 'value extractors.' But if UPS
wants to put me out of business, all it has to do is honor its
guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS, the world's largest transportation firm, handles 13.2
million shipments a day, and the vast majority of them get to their
destinations on time. Still, Taylor estimates about 5 percent of
all guaranteed shipments arrive late, and about $2 billion a year
in refunds go unclaimed throughout the package delivery industry.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Black, a UPS spokesman, said customers can track as many
packages as they want free of charge, but professional auditors
like Taylor can't. UPS has spent billions of dollars in recent
years expanding its information technology infrastructure to
provide package tracking and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors like Taylor would bombard UPS computers with
information requests, and real UPS customers would get stuck with
the bill, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These computer networks are expensive, and it takes time,
talent and money to build and operate them,'' Black said. ``We
aren't in the business of bearing those kinds of expenses to
accommodate non-customers. It would be totally unfair to saddle our
customers with huge additional expenses for computer capacity that
they don't need.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said UPS customers are notified of delivery problems, and
UPS works hard to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We build a level of trust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UPS's 1998 rate book notified customers that the company could
assess the shipper ``a $3 charge per package-tracking request
initiated by or at the request of the shipper.'' The company said
it would not charge customers for their first 200 tracking requests
each month or up to 20 percent of their shipments.
</P>
<P>
   UPS would not say if it has ever imposed the $3 charge for Web
tracking.
</P>
<P>
   UPS rival FedEx Corp., which also offers online package
tracking, said it has never charged for Web inquiries and doesn't
intend to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of our customers to track their packages is an
integral part of the service we offer,'' said Sally Davenport, a
FedEx spokeswoman at the company's Memphis headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine FedEx ever charging a separate fee for package
tracking. It's never even been contemplated,'' she said.

WHY LIEBERMAN CALLS HIMSELF `OBSERVANT' RATHER THAN `ORTHODOX' 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By watching Sen. Joseph Lieberman very carefully, Americans may
receive a lesson in both the rituals and realities of living as an
Orthodox Jew in America.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman attends an Orthodox synagogue, but outside of temple,
he rarely wears a yarmulke on his head. He eats Kosher food and
keeps the Sabbath, but unlike many strictly Orthodox men, he shakes
hands with women. If he could not shake hands, how could he
campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman refers to himself as an ``observant Jew,'' and not
Orthodox. It is an intentional distinction that his staff laments
has been overlooked in all the coverage, including that in The New
York Times, devoted to the first Jew to be nominated by one of the
major two parties for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He refers to himself as observant, as opposed to Orthodox,
because he doesn't follow the strict Orthodox code and doesn't want
to offend the Orthodox, and his wife feels the same way,'' said a
Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's aides said they could not make him available for an
interview during the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hesitation to embrace the label, Lieberman is by
practice, heritage and synagogue membership best described as a
modern Orthodox Jew. Orthodox Jews attempt to live according to
halacha, the vast body of Jewish law, and so practice a stricter
form of observance than those who belong to the other Jewish
denominations _ Conservative, the next most traditional, followed
by Reform and Reconstructionist. For every prohibition in the
halacha, however, there are exceptions argued over by generations
of rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's own form of observance makes clear that Orthodox
Judaism is itself a continuum that ranges from lenient to stringent
interpretation of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a denominational difference, it's individuals who are
different,'' said Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva
University, an Orthodox institution. ``Some individuals within
Orthodoxy are more strict than others. But there is a certain
amount of wriggle room in Jewish law. There is a degree of
flexibility, but the basic commitment must be to the integrity of
the law itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the prohibition on shaking women's hands,
one of many ways in which the Orthodox separate the sexes. The
original reasoning was that contact between the sexes should not
arouse erotic impulses, rabbis say. Today, in a concession to an
era when men and women are far less segregated, some Orthodox
Jewish men will shake a woman's hand only if she extends hers
first. Some men will extend their hands first, and some will not
shake a woman's hand under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   While the Orthodox world is varied and complex, there are two
basic distinctions. The ultra-Orthodox, or haredim (meaning ``those
who tremble'' before God), have traditionally kept an arm's length
from secular society. They include the Hasidic Jews who replanted
their Eastern European communities in America, retaining such
visible signs of their separateness as their black hats and side
curls.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Orthodoxy, by contrast, tries to integrate the observance
of Jewish law with participation in contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern means we see it as a religious imperative to engage the
modern world, the secular world,'' said Rabbi Barry Freundel of
Kesher Israel, the temple where Lieberman worships in Washington,
``and to take that which is of value in that world and make it part
of our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was raised in a religiously integrated neighborhood in
Stamford, Conn. At home, his family kept Kosher and observed the
Sabbath. As a high school student, he stayed home from the prom,
which fell on the Sabbath, even though he had been voted prom king.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Orthodox Jews, Lieberman attended public schools,
and not an exclusively Jewish ``Day School.'' He studied the tenets
of his faith at Sunday school, at afternoon Hebrew School, and on
his own. Lieberman left Jewish observance for a time, and returned
when he became a parent. He has sent his children to Jewish day
schools.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lieberman's most basic religious rituals are intimate
acts. He prays three times a day. At morning prayer, he lays on
tefillin, said Freundel, the small leather boxes that contain four
biblical passages written on parchment, binding the boxes to his
arm and forehead with leather straps.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Hadassah, keep Kosher, adhering to the Jewish
dietary laws. They do not mix milk products and meat, and keep
separate sets of dishes for each. When he is traveling, aides say,
he eats tuna fish sandwiches, or fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Lieberman keeps the Fourth Commandment to
observe the Sabbath as a day of rest and delight in God's creation,
from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. Observant Jews are
supposed to refrain from writing, using electricity, driving, and
talking on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, with the help of his two rabbis, Freundel and Rabbi
Al Feldman in New Haven, Conn., has derived a way to reconcile the
requirements of Jewish law with his responsibilities as an elected
official. Jewish law teaches that one may break the Sabbath if the
matter involves ``concern for human life.'' Lieberman and his
rabbis have interpreted that by drawing a line between governing
and campaigning. To cast a Senate vote or take crucial action on
public policy, Lieberman may break the Sabbath. To campaign, he
will not.
</P>
<P>
   In the crucial weeks before Election Day, Lieberman has said, he
will not campaign on the six days that coincide with the busy
Jewish holiday season. Lieberman will instead be in synagogue for
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, which falls on Sept. 30 and
Oct. 1, and Yom Kippur, on Oct. 9. The first two days of the Jewish
harvest festival, Sukkot, are on Oct. 14 and 15, and Simchat Torah
falls on Oct. 22. The general election is on Nov. 7.

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in with the pride that many Orthodox Jews have voiced in
Lieberman, there has been some whispering about a few of his and
his wife's omissions. For instance, Hadassah Lieberman does not
routinely cover her head with a hat, scarf or wig, standard
practice for the married, traditional Orthodox woman who is
supposed to dress modestly.
</P>
<P>
   In going bare-headed outside of the temple, Lieberman is not
violating Jewish law. But in the last few decades, some Orthodox
Jews have come to regard wearing a yarmulke, or kippah, in public
as a sign of ethnic pride and identity. Lieberman has decided not
to, said Freundel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never wanted to be the Jewish senator,'' Freundel said.
``He has wanted to be the senator who happened to be Jewish, and
wearing the kippah would change the perspective. If you met someone
wearing a kippah, the Jewishness is immediately on the table. That
is not how he wanted to be known.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as Lieberman stepped out of Kesher Israel
synagogue in Georgetown after services, a Secret Service agent
reached up and grabbed the yarmulke off the senator's head,
Freundel said.``Safety issues'' are another factor, he said. With
the yarmulke, the senator is a ``visible target.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Orthodox leaders said they regard Lieberman as a
worthy representative of Orthodox Judaism, and understand the
compromises he has made.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Avi Shafran, director of public affairs for Agudath Israel
of America, said, ``He's running for vice president, not chief
rabbi. Therefore, there might be some things we would consider not
thought out from a religious perspective, but we're not here to
critique his religious life.''

ART REVIEW: PICKING OUT DISTINCTIVE VOICES IN A PLURALISTIC
CHORUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLLAND COTTER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The one-off showcase titled ``Greater New York: New
Art in New York Now'' at PS 1 last spring received a lot of
attention. But the fact is, similar institutional group exhibitions
of up-and-coming artists have long been an annual feature in the
city's art season.
</P>
<P>
   Three are on view now, at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Bronx
Museum of the Arts and El Museo del Barrio. The museums themselves
are still seen as fringe venues, but that's not their whole story.
Yes, they're alternative spaces, and two of them are ethnically
specific, so you'll find things there you might not find elsewhere.
But they're also integral players in the big picture of American
art, and their shows feed the larger pool of talent from which
mainstream stars emerge.
</P>
<P>
   That pool is growing wider all the time. Art isn't just
pluralistic these days; it's pulverized. There seems to be one of
everything, even when a lot of things feel sort of alike. Old
distinctions between art, craft, design and architecture have
dissolved. Obsessive hand-crafting and digital technology are
equally ubiquitous. Shape-shifting of the most casual kind is the
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The identity consciousness that drove art in the 1990s has
soaked in; its tincture comes through no matter what else is going
on. Personal roles on which artists once had to be firm _
ethnicity, gender _ they can now play with, layering them,
customizing them, taking them off, putting them back on. As for
styles, there's room for whatever, from the confrontational to the
seriously inconsequential, and all of it is out there, as the
summer shows demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Studio Museum in Harlem
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Studio: Artists in Residence'' is the smallest of the
annuals, with just three participants. Now in its 32nd year, it is
also the oldest, and its family tree includes distinguished alumni
like David Hammons, Kerry James Marshall, Alison Saar and Nari
Ward. The residents are given studio space for a year on the
premises, in a large scuffed-up room divided into thirds by
partition walls. In the past, the summer residency show was
installed in roughly the same tripartite format. But the curator of
the 2000 edition, Thelma Golden, has mixed things together, letting
the work interact the way the artists themselves presumably did
while they shared quarters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea. Individual voices are distinct, but they
amplify common themes. Nicole Awai, from Trinidad, is a figurative
painter with an unprettified technique and a metaphorical bent.
Colonialism and how it shaped the West Indies is her subject, built
up through overlaid images of tropical birds, wallpaper patterns,
antique prints and illustrations from the British-published
schoolbooks with which she grew up. Background and foreground in
her paintings keep shifting, which is a good way to think about
history.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Boddie, from Nevis in the eastern Caribbean, takes the
notion of cultural influence along other routes, back to Africa via
his childhood home. In a hushed blend of photography, paint, ink
and collage, he joins portraits of his family, pressed tropical
leaves, and near-abstract views of moving water to simulate psychic
time travel, with images alternately fading out and coming into
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Biggers tackles cultural convergence with a wry, urban
energy, stirring art, politics and world religions together with
hip-hop culture. The Black Panthers, Dr. Dre and strange science
join forces in his sculpture titled ``The Chronicle,'' a giant Afro
pick with a raised fist for a handle and slides of ethnological
objects projected onto its surface. ``Mandala of the B-Bodhisattva
I'' is a Carl Andre-style floor piece assembled from brightly
colored institutional linoleum tiles silkscreened with
break-dancing versions of the Hindu god Shiva, Lord of the Dance.
</P>
<P>
   This mandala got some use as a dance floor during the ``Battle
of the Boroughs,'' a break-dance competition held in the Bronx this
summer. And a larger example appears in a collaboration between
Biggers and the artist David Ellis, who has used Duchampian
roto-relief patterns as break-dance pads. It includes a pocket-size
video of dancers in action, their acrobatic moves echoing the
circular designs on the tile floor. The video is framed by black
and white tiles with speckled patterns that evoke a night sky
filled with stars. At this point, Biggers, who received a master's
degree from the Art Institute of Chicago last year, is trying out
many ideas and formats, which is fine. He clearly has strength in
reserve, and the times are on his side. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bronx Museum of the Arts
</P>
<P>
   The Artist in the Marketplace program, now in its 20th year at
the Bronx Museum, is also a residency, but a short one (12 weeks)
for 36 participants. It is based on a seminar-style curriculum,
with dealers, critics, and museum curators advising on the ins and
outs of building a career. As a departing gift, the artists are
given a group show, organized this year by Lydia Yee and Edwin
Ramoran.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen artists are about two dozen too many for the
allotted basement gallery. (All the upstairs spaces are occupied by
a historical survey of past graduates of the program.) With room
for only one or two entries a person, everyone gets the benefit of
the doubt, critically speaking, though some work does manage to
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Figurative paintings and drawings can be self-contained enough
to survive such circumstances, and Amy Cutler's dream scenarios and
Reet Das' crisp black ink silhouettes of Hindu divinities hold the
wall. So do Richard Pasquarelli's abstract ``self-portraits'' made
of jigsaw puzzle shapes painted over photographs of the suburban
house where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thyzel's ``Corporate Sculptures,'' made of office
construction materials and self-illuminated with light bulbs, have
potential, but they need to be punched up a bit, twisted somehow.
``Daemons,'' by Bruce Brosnan, on the other hand, looks witty as
is, with its lump-shaped cutout forms standing out from the wall
and repeated as painted ``shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Jacobs' peephole installation about vermin and
pesticides is ingenious. And a Web site about race, class and
consumption by Tana Hargest, still under construction, looks
promising, with its promotion of a derma-patch drug called
Privitrol, which allows a user ``to discover the benefits of
privilege-free living.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a trend to be isolated, it might be a light-touch
brand of text-based conceptualism involving charts, diagrams and
lists, often with personal meanings. Contributions by Marcus
Bjernerup, Sara Eichner, Daniel Seiple and Anton Sinkewich all
fall, in different ways, into this category, with Beth Campbell
being exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Campell is represented here, as she was in ``Greater New York,''
by an elaborate hand-annotated graphite flowchart titled ``My
Potential Future Based on Present Circumstances.'' In it she
details all the possible outcomes of certain personal and
professional choices, real and fictional, plotting them out as a
kind of wildly branching nervous system of hopes, fears, and
self-recriminations. Although Campbell was producing such drawings
before her Bronx residency, their fever-chart records of modest
triumphs and high anxieties are tailor-made for an
artist-in-the-marketplace occasion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   El Museo del Barrio
</P>
<P>
   ``The S-Files/The Selected Files'' is the baby among the summer
annuals; this is its second year. No residency is involved, but the
museum has always had a policy of reviewing slides sent in by
Latino artists born in the United States and Latin American artists
based in New York City. From recent submissions, the curators,
Deborah Cullen and Yasmin Ramirez, have culled work by 27 artists _
several of them past participants in the Bronx and Studio Museum
residencies _ and made a lively show.
</P>
<P>
   It has no overriding theme, and certain political and religious
images automatically tagged as Latino are absent, or at least
played down. The result isn't exactly a post-identity gathering,
but on the whole it does take an oblique, submerged approach to
social issues, exploring them by way of forms and materials.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it's true, a Latino connection is right up front.
Domingo Nuno's elegant computer-manipulated ink-jet prints combine
watery patterns with racy love scenes from Spanish-language
fotonovelas, and Miguel Trelles' serigraphs have a skeletal Taino
shaman eying Jennifer Lopez and an Ingres odalisque.
</P>
<P>
   One might trace a Latin American baroque sensibility in Paul
Henry Ramirez's decorative abstractions, or in Fernanda Brunet's
draftsmanly clouds of volcanic smoke, but other readings are
equally valid. And while the show's many fabric-based pieces may
have distant roots in a tradition of textile industry labor, work
by H.A. Rodriguez-Mora, Juana Valdes, and Alejandro Diaz (whose
``Breakfast Tacos at Tiffany's'' is a standout) is interesting for
its intelligent and expressive riffs on Minimalism and Pop.
</P>
<P>
   In general, as Cullen and Ramirez argue in the show's slender
catalog, there is evidence that the hard ideological lines of the
1990's are growing more supple and elastic and weaving together in
new ways to refresh abiding concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-altered photographs of Manuel Acevedo, a former Studio
Museum artist in residence and a participant in ``Greater New
York,'' are at once poetic conceptual fantasies and realizable
proposals for revivifying desolate urban landscapes. And a mural
drawing in the show by the artist who goes by the name
Vargas-Suarez Universal similarly unites divergent impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching across a wall, it resembles a statistical graph or an
EKG readout. But its contours, drawn in a solution of alcohol and
blood (the artist's), trace the outlines of two pieces in El
Museo's permanent collection by the influential Conceptualist
Rafael Montanez-Ortiz, who was among the museum's founders 30 years
ago and its first director.
</P>
<P>
   The mural is a complex homage by a young artist with a complex
story. Born in 1972 in Mexico City, Vargas-Suarez Universal majored
in astronomy and art history at the University of Texas. Last year
he was in the Bronx Museum's Art in the Marketplace program; this
year he was enrolled in a medical course at Mount Sinai hospital,
studying, among other things, blood analysis. His installations
incorporate architectural references, collaborative sound pieces,
scientific data pulled from the Internet and site-specific wall
drawings in various media, including ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his colleagues, he is operating both deep inside
and way outside familiar, clearly marked categories. And the same
may be said of the ``alternative'' museums that, by giving artists
like him a platform, play such a seminal role in New York art.
</P>

   The quotable Richard Karn on matters of home improvement:
</P>
<P>
   On tiles: ``Don't ever put fake tile next to real tile. Don't
ever make that comparison because there's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   On finding a contractor: ``If you have friends who did something
reasonably on time and for what the bid was, start there. When you
get something bid out, you're going to see somebody who bids it at
$1,000 and you're going to see somebody who bids it at $10,000, and
the guy who bids $1,000 is not necessarily the guy to go with
because he's not going to tell you about all the little things that
are going to pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   On what you're up against: ``The person who owned the house
before you or the person who owned it before the person you bought
it from _ nobody plays by the rules. Nobody built it right. So you
end up having to do it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   On the marriage/remodeling partnership: ``You could be married
one year to 15 years and all of a sudden you're remodeling, and you
go, `Yeah, well I think we should do this.' 'Really? I thought you
would say we should do this.' 'No, I don't like that.' 'Well I do.'
All of a sudden, everybody has a very different sense of style deep
inside that doesn't really get pulled out until you're feathering
your nest.''

THE ACCIDENTAL HANDYMAN
</HEADLINE>
  Richard Karn no professional, but he played one on TV 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: With sidebar, `Tools of the Trade') 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Karn is sitting in a Studio City coffee shop talking
about the house he recently bought in Big Bear _ and the summer
legacy he hopes the house will start for his 7-year-old son,
Cooper. And he's telling me the place is a 3/4-acre lot with a big
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   The place is ``perfectly fine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And I do not, for one second, believe him.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this is not an easy person to doubt. Karn is, after
all, the man who spent eight years playing steady Al Borland on
``Home Improvement,'' the nice guy handyman's handyman, the guy who
would pull back and urge caution whenever Tim ``The Tool Man''
Taylor (a k a series star Tim Allen) would concoct some
hair-brained scheme to rip out another wall or amp up an already
lethal electric chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Karn is the guy whose friendly, bearded face has launched a
thousand real-life endorsements, from wares at Orchard Supply
Hardware to beard trimmers, rechargeable battery recycling and the
Internet Tool Box. The man once scored the second highest Q rating
_ which measures a performer's recognizability and likability
quotient _ of any actor on primetime TV (Allen was No. 1). My God,
if you can't trust Richard ``Al Borland'' Karn, whom can you trust?
</P>
<P>
   ``That character is him, in many ways,'' says Ralph Millard,
executive vice president of the Rechargeable Battery Recycling
Corporation, for which Karn is a spokesperson. ``He comes across as
very genuine in his speech and his actions, and he's got a certain
believability of character.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, when Richard Karn tells you his newly purchased house
is ``pretty much fine,'' you sense the man is itching _ if not to
pull out his own tool box _ then certainly to find the home's blue
prints, make a few well-placed calls and get busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My inner idea of a summer cabin is more like a log cabin,''
says Karn, 44. ``So now, I'm thinking like I did in my book when my
dad said, `Why replace the windows? They're perfectly fine.' I'm
figuring, `Why replace the house? It's perfectly fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an Al Borland way of thinking. Richard Karn, on the
other hand, might have a different approach when it comes to
improving a homestead.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``House Broken: How I Remodeled My Home for Just
Under Three Times the Original Bid'' (Harper Collins; $23), trusty,
affable Richard Karn puts a seriocomic ``Money Pit''-like spin on
the full-scale overhaul he and his wife did to their Studio City
home in 1996. It's as close as one will get to a blurring of the
lines between Karn and his ``Al-ter'' ego: the actor who plays a
handyman remodeling his house _ with the help of professionals _
and then writing a book about the experience.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle native, Karn's an actor first, last and always. He
worked in professional theater before a couple of breaks landed him
the ``Home Improvement'' gig. But his tool-savvy signature role
isn't entirely fabricated. If Karn comes across as being more than
a little bit handy, you might say there's spackle in his DNA.
Karn's father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all
carpenters. He never gave family trade serious consideration.
(``That was something my dad did. I didn't seem to excel at it,''
he says.) And while tool proficiency wasn't a prerequisite for
landing the role of Al Borland, Karn admits that ``I know how to
play these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers apparently thought so as well. Focus group studies
would always reveal Al Borland as being the kind of guy you could
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be getting these calls from all sorts of people. I
think there was a sense that Al knew what he was doing, and that he
was good at it,'' Karn says. ``The home improvement industry is
huge. If you've ever been to the hardware show in Chicago, it's
like there are so many millions of dollars going into that
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   When tackling his own house, Karn was anything but hands-off. He
didn't exactly hammer in nails or pour cement, but he and his wife,
Tudi Roche, knew exactly what they wanted. When the project grew
from simply redoing two rooms to performing nearly $300,000 worth
of remodeling, it was Karn _ still playing cautious Al as a day job
_ who OK'd the change orders and wrote the checks. Each experience,
he later discovered, became a chapter in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come back with stories,'' Karn says. ``Tim was going
through the same thing. (``Home Improvement'' co-star Patricia
Richardson) was going through the same thing as well. They were all
building their own homes or remodeling, especially after the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Tim is who he is, his stories are a lot funnier. Maybe
it's just the way he tells it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that could be Karn or Al Borland talking. Both are
unfailingly modest.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the author isn't giving himself enough credit.
``House Broken,'' co-written with George Mair, is both funny and
wise. In addition to the anecdotes _ a few of which make Karn look
a little bit foolish _ there's good advice to homeowners both on
home buying and remodeling: what the language means, the mistakes
you'll make and the ones you might avoid. The book is also laced
with anecdotes about historic building goofs (plumbing problems in
the Pentagon, why that tower in Pisa leans).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Karn's beautiful house came with a price. In the
course of their odyssey, the Karns did everything from stripping
their roof and replacing gas lines to rebuilding a wine rack and
replacing kitchen cabinet knob handles. After a year and a half of
work and 101 change orders, they ended up with a home that, one
suspects is better than ``perfectly fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And it all began with windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first domino, just going `dink,''' Karn says. ``You've
got 78 styles of windows, and you're going, `Well, I should just
change those out.' So once that fatal decision is made, while the
windows are out the contractor says, `Well, you're going to see the
patchwork.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So the stucco comes off and instead of putting the fake tile,
we can shoal up the walls, make it stronger, and use real tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it just kept going. One thing leads to the next.
There would be a dark wall. Now all of a sudden the curtains don't
match the throw rug.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Karn is slightly shorter than he appears on TV. His
beard, which he shaved for an upcoming episode of the American
Movie Classics' ``The Lot,'' is back and, no, he's not wearing the
Al Borland signature flannel shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Lot,'' the shorn Karn takes on a Fargo-esque accent to
play a representative from the Legion of Decency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really interesting thing hiring him,'' says show
executive producer Rick Mitz. ``I only know him one way _ he's the
straight man on 'Home Improvement' and the guy who sells tools on
commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   But that changed, Mitz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him _ and I'm sure it drives him crazy _ `Hey,
you're really funny,''' Mitz says. ``I think he gets pigeon-holed
into the best friend roles. But he really is funny.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been two years since ``Home Improvement'' called it quits
and four years since he completed his real-life ``misadventures in
home improvement.'' In addition to appearing in a TV movie ``The
Pooch &AMP; the Pauper,'' Karn has traveled, worked on his golf game
and appeared at a couple of charity events. A spokesman for the
Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation, Karn helped
rehabilitate a house for Habitat for Humanity last April in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after ``Home Improvement'' ended, Karn had the
opportunity to appear in a Broadway play, but the process of
uprooting his family for a temporary move back east wasn't in the
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Television seems to present a more friendly work schedule to a
man who claims to be fully in the family mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't have this overall plan of how to move my
career. It just kind of happens.'' Karn says. ``On stage, it's
going to take you every night of the week. And you know, we're just
starting (reading) `Harry Potter.' That's my evening theater right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the Karn family handyman legacy seem to be in any
danger of dying out. After a visit to the Wild Wild West stunt show
at Universal Studios, young Cooper Karn has decided that, like his
father, he too wants to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's putting on a stunt show in the back yard, and he's cast
all the kids in his class,'' Karn says. ``So we're needing to build
breakaway walls and all sorts of things that he's outlined and
blue-printed.'' &QL;

 &HT;    DOT seeks data on airline delays
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With hopes of easing the massive airline delays and
cancellations that have plagued travelers this summer,
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater is summoning the industry's
top executives and labor leaders to Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms, air traffic control delays and labor disruptions
at Chicago-based United Airlines, the nation's largest airline,
have caused the number of delays and cancellations to surge this
summer, as planes teem with more travelers than ever before.
Singling out United as the industry's worst culprit, Slater made
his remarks Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines Chairman and Chief Executive Leo Mullin will
attend the meeting with Slater on Monday, a spokesman for
Atlanta-based Delta said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that the DOT is looking at the issues, and we're
hoping for a productive meeting,'' said spokesman John Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines will handle more than 670 million passengers this year,
and the number will jump to 1 billion over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While the DOT is limited in what it can do to improve service,
Slater hopes to get the industry talking about cancellations and
delays before the issue spins out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're straining the system right now with 650 million, 670
million, what do you do to ensure that the system can handle 1
billion?,'' Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT calls the airlines together from time to time to discuss
industry issues, but this is the first meeting this year to discuss
on- time performance and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   United is in the middle of contract talks with its mechanics and
pilots unions. Some members of the pilots union have refused to
work overtime, disrupting schedules. In May only 56.6 percent of
the airline's flights arrived within 15 minutes of the scheduled
time, according to DOT statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Delta has fared well in service rankings this year, reporting
comparatively good baggage and consumer complaint statistics to the
DOT. For the first six months of the year, Delta reported 4.34
mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers, second-best in the
industry. It also had the second-lowest rate of consumer complaints
to the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT has not released flight delay statistics for June or the
first six months of the year because it is changing the computer
host that produces the data. Slightly more than 80 percent of
Delta's flights arrived on time in May, the best rate among major
carriers for that month.

   WASHINGTON _ Millions of older college students are changing
higher education, even as it changes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say 'college student' and most people think of an 18- or
19-year-old. That's because we have a cultural tradition in which
that marks the transition time from adolescence to adulthood,''
said Ken Foster of the University of Utah, who has written four
books on adult learners.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the average age of college students now is over 26, and
they take just over seven years to complete their education.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, 42 percent of the students in the nation's colleges
and universities will be 25 or older, according to the Education
Department. That's up from 28 percent in 1980, before so many
working women began to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges compete vigorously to attract those 6.4 million older
college students, who are in the vanguard of more than 70 million
adults their age who will take some sort of job-related or personal
development class, seminar or workshop in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the deepest reason they enroll is a hunger for
learning,'' said Janice Gordon-Kelter of Houston, dean of special
programs at the University of St. Thomas, which offers a well-known
degree completion program for adults who have earned at least two
years of credits elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other big reason is, they've been laid off or seen others
promoted ahead of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a degree at any age can pay off monetarily. Among adults
25 or older, a woman with a bachelor degree typically earns $12,141
more annually than a woman with a high school diploma. Among men,
the increase is $15,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come in, they're often less secure because they've
been out of school for awhile,'' said Susan Robinson of Washington,
D.C., who heads the center for adult learning at the American
Council on Education. ``But they are actually more likely to become
stellar students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they bring with them is a wealth of on-the-job, family
and community experience, maturity, perhaps the financial support
of their employer, and certainly an appreciation of the value of an
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Hamby(cq), who directs a degree completion program at
Abilene Christian University for 170 adults up to 72 years old,
said, ``We waste education on 18-year-olds, which I know because I
was once 18 myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He said older students ``absorb new information and theories
like sponges, but they'll challenge the socks off you if you don't
bring the theory down to a practical application at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger students often like the way the older ones bring life
experiences into class discussions,'' said Gabe DeGabriele of Grand
Junction, Colo., president of the Association for Non-Traditional
Students in Higher Education. Still, he said, some complain that
adults ``ruin the curve'' by acing tests or ``ask too many
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition for older students has forced many institutions
to re-evaluate traditions, including the five-course semester, dorm
rooms, long registration lines, ostentatious partying, and
all-night cramming for tests that require regurgitation of lecture
notes.
</P>
<P>
   To attract adults, some emphasize credit for life experiences
and flexible credit transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Others offer ``stop-out'' policies that retain potential
dropouts by letting a student whose course is interrupted by a
family emergency resume the course when it is offered again.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Denver's Women's College helps find cheap,
clean, safe hotel rooms for women from rural Colorado who take
weekend courses on its campus in Denver. It also offers them math
brush-up clinics, computer labs, a writing facility and a drop-in
center where they can chat with each other and the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Most colleges have decided that it would be too costly to
sponsor a day care center. But many offer parents a list of
respected providers or sponsor special children's events. In
Brunswick, Ga., for example, student activity fees at Coastal
Georgia Community College help pay for free family movies and for a
Saturday cookout at which a magician or other entertainer keeps
children occupied on campus while their parents use the library.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet helps some adults tuck lessons into niches in their
hectic days of balancing family, work and study. Pat Kapper, a vice
president at the profitable Career Education Corporation, which
offers degrees in 15 states, said, ``Older students also happen to
be disciplined learners (with) self-motivation, which makes them
perfect candidates for on-line or other distance-education
courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Even computer-phobic adults can schedule courses to suit
themselves, now that the University of Maryland offers some courses
by voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non-traditional students tend to view things more from a
consumer standpoint, and their biggest concern is the impact on
their family in finances and time,'' DeGabriele said at Mesa State
College, where he counsels transfer students. ``The idea that a
professor would try to have his only office hours at an
inconvenient time, or that a bookstore or finance office wouldn't
be open on evenings or weekends can bug them.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Students re-entering college didn't always act like consumers,
according to Barbara Denison, associate dean for graduate and
continuing education at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa.
Many used to see themselves as dropouts who ``waited to be assured
that they were still capable students who had now matured and could
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she said, many act more like someone who is deciding
whether to hire the college to educate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, potential adult learners 'shop' their work experiences,
prior credits earned and anything else around to several schools,
trying to negotiate for the maximum allowable in transfer credits
and in experiential credits,'' Denison said. ``We are expected to
respond to requests for schedules tailor-made to one individual
student's needs (and) to eliminate any instructor whom students
don't feel is teaching what they want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   As director of the office of adult learning services in the New
York headquarters of the nonprofit College Board, Carol
Aslanian(cq) advises colleges to adjust to the reality that adult
students ``are savvy consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They shop around for exactly the course they want, they look
for a nearby classroom with easy in-and-out parking, and they are
relentless and persistent once they start to take a course,''
Aslanian said. ``Most want to learn stuff, not just pile up
credits, and they want to apply what they learn as fast as they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Their impatience is understandable, said DeGabriele. They are
paying their own way and have ``a shorter remaining work-life''
than a 25-year-old in which to repay loans and earn more income
from their investment in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, convenience and lower cost are prime reasons why about
55 percent of adult students go to community colleges, which today
have campuses within less than an hour's drive of the vast majority
of U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults are the most diverse students in higher education,''
said George Boggs, president of Palomar College, who will leave the
nine-campus California institution this fall to become president of
the American Association of Community Colleges in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an economic development and workforce training
mission, which benefits adults who want to change career
directions, recover from a downsizing or get a promotion,'' Boggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he explained, ``We also have students who take a course at
a community college while attending a university, or come to us
during their university's summer break. Some others already have
earned their degree, but come back to learn the latest computer
software application or learn a foreign language in preparation for
a trip.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the needs of those students, Palomar supplements its
traditional fall and spring semesters with ``fast-track eight-week
sessions, late-start and self-paced courses, on-line courses, TV
college, weekend college, and four-, six-, and eight-week summer
sessions.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At National University, the third largest private university in
California, a one-course-a-month format is a major draw for its
all-adult student body. About 31 percent are minorities and 59
percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students go to our facilities in the evening from 5:30 to 10
two nights a week for one month, concentrating on one course at a
time,'' said Thomas McCalla, vice president for student affairs at
National's main campus in San Diego. Each evening consists of four
hours of classes and a half-hour break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they work in a supermarket or a law office, this is a
way to get fast results, especially for those who are working
full-time,'' McCalla said. Technology consultants and musicians
with occasional out-of-town jobs are among those who like the idea
of taking a course or two between jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Monique La Chappa, 35, who graduated from National in July, said
she worked full-time when she started 42 months ago. But she
switched to a half-time job after she fell asleep on a freeway and
ran into a roadside reflector on the 60-mile drive from San Diego
to her home on the reservation of the Campo Band of Kumeyaay(cq)
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 27 and taking four courses at a time at a community
college, I ended up dropping out, partly because I was overwhelmed
by all the homework, driving to and from the rez, day care hassles,
and no money,'' she said. ``But when I was taking just one course
at a time at National, a course was over before I was sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her degree in business administration with a double
minor in human resources and finance ``has made my life better and
it's going to make my people's life better.'' But, she added, ``In
fairness, you'd better warn anyone who is thinking of doing this
that I also put 118,000 miles on my Toyota Tercel, and I'm $35,000
in debt.''

JEWISH COMMUNITIES TAKING ROOT IN RURAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Idaho, Utah, Ore., Fla., S.C., N.H, Wash., N.C., Mass.,
Conn.)  (Eds: This story was previously skedded on some budgets as
WOODSTOCK-SYNAGOGUE.) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, Vt. _ Route 4, a rural highway that twists across
Vermont's midsection, passes the sort of roadside signs one would
expect in northern New England. Maple syrup, they advertise.
Cheddar cheese. Bed and breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   And then outside a 150-year-old farmhouse is the sign adorned
with a Star of David, announcing the presence of Congregation Shir
Shalom.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected? Perhaps, but also very much a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Jews haven't realized the extent to which Jews have moved
to the country,'' said Stuart M. Matlins, founder of the synagogue
along with his wife, Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   Matlins, a New York native, management consultant and, more
recently, a publisher, said that every-other-Friday services this
summer had been drawing 50 to 60 people. On the High Holy Days last
year, he added, 200 came to services.
</P>
<P>
   America's Jewish population, about 6 million, has changed little
in total number in recent years, but it is not immune from the
restless impulses that make the United States a transient society.
</P>
<P>
   In disparate places, Jewish communities are growing _ and as
they do, new synagogues are appearing in towns from Woodstock in
the Green Mountains to Ketchum, Idaho, and Park City, Utah, in the
Rockies, where such institutions have been rare, if they existed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening, said Samuel C. Heilman, professor of Jewish
studies and sociology at City University of New York, is part of a
trend, ``a radiating Jewish community,'' he calls it, whose members
have been moving from once-solidly Jewish neighborhoods to the
suburbs and, for some, to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is Jews who are so much a part of America
now,'' Heilman said, ``they no longer feel constrained to live
among Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 edition of the American Jewish Yearbook, published by
the American Jewish Committee, shows that Jewish populations have
been growing in such widely scattered locales as Portland, Ore.;
Tampa, Fla.; Charleston, S.C.; and Portsmouth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish population is also increasing in Vermont. By the
yearbook's count, about 5,700 Jews live there _ only 1 percent of
the state's population but double the number of Jews there two
decades ago. Congregation Shir Shalom, also known as the Woodstock
Area Jewish Community, belongs to Judaism's liberal Reform
movement. The newer, small-town synagogues tend to be non-Orthodox,
partly because the challenges of living an Orthodox lifestyle _
requiring kosher food and walking to services _ are difficult in
places where Jewish resources are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock synagogue began a dozen years ago with services in
Matlins' office, at the company he founded, Jewish Lights
Publishing. The company publishes books on Jewish spirituality and
life, and, through a sister imprint, on topics related to religious
experience more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the congregation grew, with new residents
(mainly young families and retirees), along with people who had
weekend homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to live in a rural area and have a Jewish life,''
said Matlins, 60, who serves on the board of Hebrew Union College,
which trains men and women as Reform rabbis, cantors and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the group reached a sufficiently critical mass to
buy the farmhouse, both for its services and its Hebrew school.
Local Protestant, Roman Catholic and Unitarian-Universalist clergy
attended the dedication. The congregation also affiliated with the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Reform movement's
synagogue organization.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, another small-town temple, in Great
Barrington, Mass., joined the union. Lately, officials say, such
additions to the ranks are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're emerging in very interesting areas,'' said Rabbi
Daniel Freelander, the union's director of program, citing
synagogues in places like Bainbridge Island, Wash.; Hickory, N.C.;
and Keene, N.H.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many, like the one in Woodstock, are too small to afford a
full-time rabbi and rely on student rabbis who come once or twice a
month. They also depend on volunteers to keep them running.
</P>
<P>
   In Woodstock, that category includes Bob and Muriel Steinberg,
who retired from their jobs in West Hartford, Conn., four years
ago. After they began attending the synagogue as full-time Vermont
residents, Steinberg said, ``It just hit me, there was something to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, he said, ``has the people skills, I have the
organizational skills.'' They now serve as its co-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue's roadside sign helps attract people, Steinberg
said. One day last summer, her husband was standing outside when
two young women pulled up and asked about services. He invited them
to attend that evening, which they did. ``As it turned out,''
Steinberg said, ``one was from Brazil, one was from Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the sanctuary exudes a feeling of intimacy, befitting a
space that once served as a living room. Three Shaker-style
benches, arranged on a wooden floor, face an ark whose hand-carved
cover depicts the tree of life. ``We can get 50 to 60 people in
here,'' Matlins said. Upstairs, what had been bedrooms have been
turned into classrooms and meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby stands an old barn, built of rough-hewn logs. The
congregation is mulling whether to convert it to a new sanctuary to
accommodate more people.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the sanctuary, with Mount Tom as his backdrop, Matlins
was moved to reflect on Judaism's traditions in light of the
faith's earliest history. In such a place as Woodstock, he said, an
event like the festival of Tabernacles _ in which Jews set up
sukkahs, or booths, as reminders of the Israelites' sojourn in the
wilderness _ has a resonance lacking in more urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism,'' he said, ``was a religion of people who did not
live in cities.''

 &HT;    Georgia Power appoints diversity exec
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Power Co. has named a vice president for
diversity action, three weeks after three employees sued the
utility claiming racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Davis will fill the new position and will continue to serve
as the utility's senior vice president for corporate relations. He
will report directly to David Ratcliffe, chief executive of Georgia
Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good that the company is finally admitting it has
problems,'' said Steven J. Rossenwasser, an attorney for the
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But internal changes without external oversight aren't good
enough. The company can't be trusted to change itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Georgia Power, the state's largest utility,
and Southern Co., its parent, claims the company systematically
discriminates against African-American workers. About 1,800 of
Georgia Power's 8,700 workers are African-American, and lawyers for
the plaintiffs are seeking class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed July 27 in Fulton County Superior Court by
three Georgia Power employees, and four more workers have joined
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Power reacted quickly after the suit was filed.
Ratcliffe promised employees ``swift and effective action'' against
racial discrimination and named Juanita Baranco, one Georgia
Power's three African-American board members, to co-chair a
diversity council with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Davis will help find where our diversity problems are,''
John Sell, a Georgia Power spokesman, said Thursday. ``Once the
problems are identified, we'll devise solutions to identify them.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis joined Georgia Power in 1972 after earning a bachelor's
degree from Claflin College in South Carolina and a master's degree
from Georgia Tech. He serves on numerous volunteer boards and
received the Atlanta Urban League's 1999 community service award.
</P>
<P>
   Rossenwasser, a lawyer at Bondurant, Mixson &AMP; Elmore, the firm
representing the Georgia Power employees, said Thursday the changes
announced so far are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Rossenwasser, whose firm also represents employees who sued
Coca-Cola for racial discrimination, said Georgia Power's actions
``fail to address compensation'' he believes current and former
employees are owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company can't ignore the fact it owes African-Americans
for past discrimination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Georgia companies including Coca-Cola, Home Depot and
Waffle House face racial discrimination claims.

   LOS ANGELES _ A convention reporter's notebook:
</P>
<P>
   Who says there's no place for religion in politics? Speaking to
the
</P>
<P>
   non-partisan American Jewish Committee, Rep. Rush Holt, a
freshman Democratic from New Jersey, said: ``without being too
partisan here, let me just say vote for the ticket that has the
Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking Joe Lieberman as the Democratic vice-presidential
</P>
<P>
   candidate is a healthy sign, according to Zafar Tahir, one of
three
</P>
<P>
   Muslim delegates to the Democratic National Convention from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tahir, a native of Pakistan who now lives in Houston, prayed at
the Texas delegation breakfast Thursday ``that this party of true
diversity can move together.''
</P>
<P>
   While some may think Muslims would not favor a Jew as vice
president because of tensions between the two religions in the
Middle East, Tahir said picking someone from a minority religion in
the United States is positive for Muslims because they also are in
the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio state Sen. Rhine McLin, provided an unusual description of
</P>
<P>
   herself when she spoke to the Ohio delegation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a quadruple minority,'' said McLin: female, Democrat,
woman of color and mortician.''
</P>
<P>
   McLin, one person in the audience shouted, is ``the last to let
you down.''
</P>
<P>
   No podium, no TelePrompTer, no problem. At least that's the way
Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia described it Thursday after his speech
the night before honoring veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Cleland, a triple amputee after a grenade blast in Vietnam,
wheeled onto the state with Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, a fellow
Vietnam vet, only to see that the podium and the teleprompters had
disappeared to make way for a filmed tribute.
</P>
<P>
   The setup ``left the city in a dangerous position _ me and Bob
Kerrey unleashed,'' Cleland joked. ``It was left to me to ad-lib
for only 40 million people.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a TelePrompTer 60 feet away under the media riser
flickered to life after the film clip, prompting Cleland to give
thanks that his staff picked ``the largest type font in the
universe'' for his speech.
</P>
<P>
   The gift shop at the downtown Marriott Hotel received a shipment
of new Beanie Babies this week, including the star-spangled ``Lefty
2000'' the donkey and ``Righty 2000'' the elephant. Lefty sold out
almost immediately. Righty lasted well into the next day.

UAL DOWNGRADES PROFIT FORECAST, CITING FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, lowered its
third-quarter earnings estimate Thursday, citing the thousands of
canceled flights that have come amid a dispute with its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also announced several initiatives to placate its
disgruntled passengers, including frequent-flier bonuses and
elimination of certain service fees.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Goodwin, UAL's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement that the company expected third-quarter earnings to be
lower than the range of $2.60 to $3.20 a share announced on July
19, when it reported its second-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although booking patterns remained strong through early August
despite poor operating performance, booking levels have since
fallen on the adverse publicity surrounding the cancellations that
occurred in early August,'' Goodwin said. ``While our operating
performance has improved somewhat, the reduced booking levels
continue, and as a result, revenues are not as strong as we had
previously anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Harris, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, reduced his
third-quarter earnings estimate to $2.10 from $2.95, and his
fourth-quarter estimate to $1 from $1.35.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Buttrick, an analyst with PaineWebber, expects that United's
labor and operational problems will have a $250 million impact on
its third-quarter pretax profit. He lowered his third-quarter
estimate to $1.90 from $2.60, and his fourth-quarter estimate to 95
cents from $1.10.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the recent publicity, everyone who flies knows United
isn't a good choice,'' he said. ``Although operations have improved
in recent days, as a practical matter, the damage has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   But Buttrick said he did not expect that the airline's current
labor problems would permanently alienate passengers. ```The
airline business is fundamentally a network business,'' he said. ``
People choose United for its network, and that's not changed.''
</P>
<P>
   United's management and its pilots' union have been negotiating
a new contract since December 1998. With few signs of progress
seen, the pilots have been declining to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a shortage of pilots, as well as weather and air
traffic control problems, United said it completed only 90 percent
of its scheduled flights during the first two weeks of this month.
</P>
<P>
   United management and its pilots continued their discussions
this week after talks were recessed last Friday. Kathie White, a
spokeswoman for the union, said that although agreement had been
reached in some areas, ``the major issues remaining are big.'' She
said these included wages, benefits, working conditions and job
security.
</P>
<P>
   United declined to comment on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus frequent-flier mileage will be given to United's top
travelers. Frequent-flier program participants who fly between
25,000 and 50,000 miles a year will receive an additional 25
percent bonus for flights taken between May 1 and Dec. 31, while
those who fly more than that will receive an additional 100 percent
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   United also is waiving its regular $75 service fee for
passengers who change plans if their outbound flight is affected by
a delay or cancellation; passengers must travel before Sept. 30 and
return within seven days of their original return flight.
Passengers flying before Sept. 30 who choose to postpone their
travel may also do so without penalty; new travel must be completed
by March 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   AMR's American Airlines, United's archrival, said it was
evaluating United's bonus mileage offer, which was reported
Thursday in The Wall Street Journal. &QL;

BIOGEN TO DISTRIBUTE IRISH FIRM'S DRUG FOR MS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Biogen Inc., looking to strengthen its franchise of drugs to
treat multiple sclerosis as well as expand into new disease areas,
said Thursday it has licensed Antegren from Elan Corp. of Dublin,
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed although
James C. Mullen, Biogen's chief executive told the Wall Street
Journal that the drug could generate at least $1 billion in annual
sales for multiple sclerosis. Biogen's current multiple sclerosis
drug is Avonex, an injectable medication that last year had
revenues of $619 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen said Antegren may be marketed to multiple sclerosis
patients who have not had satisfactory results with currently
available drugs, including Avonex. He said Antegren also has
``blockbuster potential in a variety of diseases,'' and could be
used in combination with Avonex to help a broader range of multiple
sclerosis patients.
</P>
<P>
   Elan is nearing the completion of a Phase II clinical trials of
Antegren in multiple sclerosis patients and has conducted separate
trials for Crohn's disease, the chronic inflammation of the
intestinal disease and a third illnesss, ulcerative colitis. For
Biogen, gaining a promising drug like Antegrin in later-stage
testing may ease Wall Street's concern that the company was too
dependent on Avonex with few signs of another major drug reaching
the market soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street knew Biogen was looking to get a late-stage drug,
but they wanted to something that could reach the market in the
next 18 months to two years, but Antegrin won't hit the market
until 2004,'' said Anthony C. Butler, biotechnology analyst for
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Biogen hastily withdrew a Antova, a drug it hoped
would be used to treat hemophilia, lupus, kidney transplant
rejection and three other maladies, after some patients taking the
experimental medication developed blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's next big hope after Avonex is Amevive, a
psoriasis treatment, which has shown impressive clinical trial
results in about two years Mullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, investor initial reaction was muted as the stock
closed at $70.25, up 25 cents.

IN FAILURES AT ALBANY CHARTER SCHOOL, A CAUTIONARY TALE EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Gov. George E. Pataki of New York visited the newly opened
New Covenant charter school in Albany last September, he lavished
it with praise, proclaiming it a model of the kind of educational
change he intended when he pushed a charter school bill through the
state Legislature nine months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after Pataki's visit, however, New Covenant
descended into apparent chaos. Its fourth-graders scored among the
lowest in the state on standardized English tests; the
profit-making company overseeing the school's academic program
resigned; two principals came and went, as did one-fourth of the
school's 500 students.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Dare, founder of the school and president of the local
Urban League chapter, whom Pataki hailed during his visit as ``a
visionary,'' quit the New Covenant board after two state inquiries
accused him and the school of multiple violations of state
education law, including misappropriation of tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with three weeks to go before the start of the new school
year, state regulators have theatened to revoke the school's
charter, and it is uncertain if New Covenant will open again.
</P>
<P>
   How things went so wrong so quickly at New Covenant is a
cautionary tale for entrepreneurs and education reformers who are
tempted by the promise of charter schools, which have been hailed
around the country as one of the most promising solutions to the
problems plaguing public education, particularly in poor, minority
school districts in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 2,069 charter schools operate with public money but
are free of the control of local school districts. They are often
championed by conservatives and liberals alike, who see them as a
competitive alternative to troubled public schools because of their
ability to experiment with teaching methods and to hire nonunion
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   That such a spectacular failure could occur practically in
Pataki's back yard, at a school in which he took a close interest,
speaks of the difficulties _ in oversight, administration and
academic achievement _ that face even the most trailblazing schools
and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics contend, however, that New Covenant's failures were
not simply a result of bad luck but rather a direct result of an
unnecessary rush last year by Pataki, a vocal champion of charter
schools, and his political appointees to open schools without time
for adequate planning and training. New Covenant received its
initial approval a mere three months before it opened.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, 79 charter schools, or about 4 percent of
the charter schools started in the last nine years, have already
shut their doors, though many others seem to have established a
successful foothold, including two New York City charter schools
that opened at the same time as New Covenant: the Sisulu Children's
Academy and the John A. Reisenbach school, both in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Pataki, said the state's
review process for new charter schools, including New Covenant, was
very thorough. And while no one expected things to go as wrong as
they did at New Covenant, she said, ``the governor does not believe
this particular situation is a reflection on the future of charter
schools,'' which he believes is ``quite positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dare could not be reached for comment. But Ward DeWitt,
co-chairman of New Covenant's board, said he was confident that New
Covenant would open in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the board asked state authorities to allow Edison
Schools of Manhattan, the country's largest profit-making operator
of public schools, to replace Advantage Schools, a Boston-based
education company, as manager of New Covenant's academic programs
in the coming year. Edison has hired Eleanor Bartlett, a member of
the state's Board of Regents, as principal of the school, and
Bartlett resigned from the Regents post to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   But before the school can open, charter school regulators at the
State University of New York, the state Education Department and
the Board of Regents must once again hastily review Edison's
proposed academic program, in even less time than last year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Edison and the newly reconstituted school
board will be able to correct the faults detailed by two regulatory
panels, which issued their independent reports within a week of
each other in late July and early August. A team of observers from
the Education Department, which visited New Covenant near the end
of the school year, found ``serious violations of law and of the
school's charter,'' its report said, including inadequate academic
programs, building code violations and missing and unaccounted for
students. The report said the school's facilities ``appeared to be
very run-down'' and overcrowded, with some classes being conducted
in hallways, where carpets were mended with duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   A separate review by the State University of New York, which
granted the school its charter, found many of the same problems, as
well as a lack of financial controls and conflicts of interest
among school board members, many of whom were also affiliated with
the Urban League and some of whom were relatives of Dare's. One
board member was his aunt and another was his stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pataki, speaking last week on an Albany radio program, said
he had ``reservations'' about the school's ability to reopen next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest victims of New Covenant's problems are the 360
children who made it through the school's first year. Most have
said they intend to re-enroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school really was the result of a grass-roots effort that
was pushed by the community,'' DeWitt said. ``People here were
looking for a bona fide choice to move their children's education
along. With that kind of momentum, it would have been hard to tell
them to wait for a more deliberate process.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, there were signs that the approval process
was being rushed and that problems were on the horizon. In June
1999, shortly after the SUNY trustees approved a September opening
for New Covenant and the two charter schools in New York City,
questions were raised about whether the trustees had given adequate
legal notice and a chance for public comments by the Albany City
School District. Because charter schools draw their funding from
local school districts, those districts are entitled by law to have
a voice in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY trustees voted again in July 1999 to approve the
school, but the next month the Board of Regents raised objections,
questioning whether the school's temporary facilities in a group of
trailers were adequate and expressing concern that the school would
draw too much money out of the Albany public schools. Because of
political compromises that forged the charter school law, the
Regents cannot prevent a SUNY-approved school from opening, but
they have do have advisory powers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Wilson, the chief executive of Advantage Schools, said
inadequate facilities were among the primary problems with the
school. ``We knew our program couldn't successfully operate in that
building,'' Wilson said. In its application, the school's sponsors,
including Dare, said a permanent site would be ready in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the Urban League was having financial
difficulties that were beginning to weigh on New Covenant's
operations. The school leased its temporary space from a
profit-making subsidiary of the Urban League known as the Commons,
and last year, the Commons also was in financial trouble. It had
made a $2 million unsecured loan to a financial company for which
it was constructing an office building, but in December, that
company collapsed. At the same time, an Albany construction company
that had performed work on the trailers being used by the school
was demanding payment.
</P>
<P>
   According to an inquiry conducted for the SUNY trustees by
Richard J. Bartlett, a lawyer in Glens Falls, N.Y., in December
Dare forwarded state education dollars that were supposed to be
paid to Advantage to the construction company on behalf of the
Commons, an act that Bartlett said violated Dare's fiduciary duty
to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett wrote in his report that while Dare's actions did not
``rise to the level of criminal conduct,'' Dare should either
resign from the school's board or be removed. Early this month,
Dare resigned, although he told the Times Union of Albany that the
move was not related to Bartlett's report.
</P>
<P>
   Following Dare's resignation, several other directors also
resigned, and the school's board has been substantially
reconstituted.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Washburn, co-chairman of the board, said Pataki's office
expressed interest in New Covenant and Advantage throughout the
last school year. Top Advantage officials and Dare had first talked
about establishing the charter school after being introduced by
Lisa O'Brien, an Advantage executive who previously worked as a
midlevel aide in the Pataki administration. In an interview,
O'Brien said her work for the Pataki administration was
coincidental to Advantage's selection as the operator of the
school.
</P>
<P>
   If the SUNY trustees act on New Covenant's charter amendment in
the next three weeks, the Board of Regents can perhaps clear the
way for the school to open late next month.
</P>
<P>
   Edison has pledged more than $3 million toward the construction
of a $10 million building for the school.
</P>
<P>
   Others have expressed less certainty about whether the school
can open in the fall. Among the Education Department's concerns was
the performance of the school's fourth-graders on the standardized
English test. Only 9 percent of New Covenant students met or
exceeded the state standard, among the worst performance by any
school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Sanders, a Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly
Education Committee, said he believed that New Covenant's failures
can be traced back to the accelerated approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Covenant is a case study of how not to do a charter
school,'' Sanders said. ``The failure, in my judgment, was in SUNY
and the governor trying to accelerate the approval process when it
really needed more time. The results speak for themselves.''

VINTAGE CARS OFFER MILEAGE AT AUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (Eds: ``Historics'' in graf 4 is cq; ``saloon'' in grafs 8 and 14

<TEXT>
<P>
   When you are selling 800 vintage, classic and antique sports
cars in one place, you are bound to come across a big party or two.
</P>
<P>
   Nonstop festivities are planned around the car sales in Pebble
Beach, Calif., this weekend, and auction houses, car manufacturers,
restoration shops and car clubs expect at least 20,000 people from
all over the world. The gathering will be as glamorous as (or more
glamorous than) the one at the Democratic National Convention, with
entertainment stars, dot-com billionaires and business tycoons in
attendance. As Bing Crosby once said of his own golf tournament at
Pebble Beach, ``It's going to be a great clambake.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend concludes the Monterey Historics Week, with car
rallies, auctions, the Concours d'Elegance (a display, on the golf
course, of vintage cars, which are judged according to body design,
restoration work and originality), and various races at a track at
nearby Laguna Seca.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Morris, the head of Christie's car department in New York,
said, ``Winning Pebble Beach is undoubtedly the most prestigious
competition in car judging in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Car collecting may be changing. Once many people bought elegant
vintage cars simply to admire them in their garages. They formed
clubs like the Horseless Carriage Club, organized by Los Angeles
car enthusiasts in 1937, to swap gossip and restoration tips about
cars made before 1916. (The club's Web site address is
horseless.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, famous car collectors like Jerry Seinfeld, Jay Leno, Ralph
Lauren, Nicolas Cage and the cellular communications billionaire
Bruce McCaw buy racing cars to drive. ``The vast majority use their
cars on the road on a regular basis,'' said Robert Brooks, the
founder of the England-based Brooks Auctioneers. On Saturday,
Brooks is to conduct his third annual California sale _ 73 vintage,
classic and antique autos _ at the Quail Lodge Resort and Golf Club
in Carmel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are seriously important cars,'' he said. The sale
includes Mary Pickford's 1962 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud II saloon,
Pope Pius XII's 1936 Cadillac V16 Series 90 Ceremonial Town Car by
Fleetwood, and a classic prewar racing car, a 1936 Alfa Romeo 8C
2900A short-chassis Botticella Grand Prix winner, which is being
sold to raise money to preserve the Brazilian rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Botticella is the be-all and end-all of pre-World War II
sporting cars,'' said Paul Clark, managing director of Brooks USA.
Only four short-chassis models were made, all built to race.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's International Motor Cars is conducting its 11th
annual ``Exceptional Motor Cars'' sale on Sunday at the Pebble
Beach Equestrian Center. This sale, which begins at 6 p.m. Pacific
time, will have a live Webcast (www.christies.com), so interested
collectors around the world can participate.
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes the car collection of the late Denver lumber
magnate Robert D. Sutherland, which features several prewar
American and European racing cars and has a sales estimate of $5
million, and 50 classic cars from the collection of Matt and
Barbara Browning of the Browning firearms family.
</P>
<P>
   For the 15th year, the Monterey Sports Car Auction will hold its
sales in Monterey, Calif., at the Doubletree Hotel Friday night and
Saturday. This sale has 135 vintage cars, reasonably priced.
</P>
<P>
   The only great car missing in California is one that will be
sold on Sept. 27 in New York in the William Doyle sale of property
from the estate of James Cagney. The Doyle sale is not a car sale,
but it does include Cagney's elegant 1961 green Bentley S2
four-door saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Cagney, who won an Academy Award for his role in ``Yankee Doodle
Dandy'' in 1942, played a race car driver in the 1932 film ``The
Crowd Roars.'' His Oscar is displayed in the Brooks tent with an
announcement about the September sale.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is making a push to penetrate the antique-car market in
America. He founded Brooks Auctioneers in England in 1989 after
working for 14 years at Christie's in London. The son of a
legendary London auctioneer, Brooks took over Christie's motor car
department in 1977. In 1989, after organizing a Christie's car sale
in Monte Carlo that brought in $33.4 million, he asked to be put on
Christie's international board.
</P>
<P>
   His request was denied, and he left Christie's to start Brooks.
``We are the biggest specialist auctioneers of motor cars in the
world,'' he said. ``Last year we did 33 auctions in nine
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks conducts sales of what he calls ``mechanical
antiquities'' _ that is, motor cars, motorcycles, automobilia,
aeronautica, mechanical toys and watches. Last year he reported car
sales of $46 million. ``We sell 800 to 1,000 cars per year,'' he
said. ``We have 40 percent of the U.K. market. But the U.S. is the
home of motorcar collecting. In America the competition is fierce.
It's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks neither buys nor restores cars. ``At the end of the day,
the owner is selling the car,'' Brooks said. ``We might polish it,
but we don't fix it. And we don't do third-party auctions. We only
act as an agent for people who want to sell their cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's normally doesn't buy cars, either, but in Carmel it
will sell at least one it owns: a 1908 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost
Landaulette made for Lord Dundas of Dundas Castle in Scotland. It
was built to be especially quiet; hence the name Silver Ghost. (And
it was made by C.S. Rolls, Henry Royce and Claude Johnson, a
founder of the Royal Automobile Club.) ``It's one of the earliest
Silver Ghosts ever built, and it's one of the most important of the
early ones,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Car auctions are not like sales of impressionist paintings.
``This is a market that, to a degree, is event- or club-driven,''
Brooks said. ``Many sales are set at racing sites. In Carmel,
everyone shows up for the Monterey Historic Automobile Races, one
of the top races in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a great believer in the importance of sale venues,'' he
added. ``With motorcars, it's London, Gstaad, Geneva, Monte Carlo
and Carmel.'' Brooks' December sale, which is held at the Palace
Hotel in Gstaad, Switzerland, consists entirely of Ferraris. ``The
sale is part of the social season. People are attracted to the
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20,000 expected at the Concours d'Elegance, 2,000 will
attend the sales. Clark said 700 to 1,000 people register to bid in
Brooks' California sale. Of these, at least 150 will bid.
Information: (831) 620-1950.
</P>

IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED, CELEBRATE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a concept for a reality TV show that is sure to knock
'em dead: ``Who Wants to Be a Failure?''
</P>
<P>
   It would work like this: Put a dozen young entrepreneurs on a
perilous island _ say, Manhattan _ and equip them only with
millions of dollars in venture capital. Set up Webcams to watch
their offices around the clock and tell them to start dot-com
companies. Over two years, America gets to witness their trials and
tribulations: The caffeine-fueled all-night brainstorming sessions,
the aching trauma of wooing investors, the bare-knuckled struggle
to make sure each employee gets his own nap area.
</P>
<P>
   The contestant who tanks his company first wins, yes, $1
million, plus a zippy new motorized scooter and a copy of the
play-at-home game.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, failure has come to mean triumph. These days, it seems, the
way to prove that you're a real pioneer is to sink somebody else's
$125 million into a half-baked online venture, attract huge
attention and only then discover that, oops, you're in a little
over your head. Cratering is a sign that you're in the core of the
culture, that you're clicking on the brass mouse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so, of course. Failure used to connote repo
men and leaving town in the dead of night to escape the
disapproving stares of neighbors. Today, it's a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure is the price of being on the bleeding edge, on the
forefront of something you take pride in,'' said Gretchen Rubin,
author of ``Power, Money, Fame, Sex'' (Pocket Books). ``In the
past, you would have never wanted to be branded a failure, but now
it shows you're creative, a risk taker. Entrepreneurship is the
greatest virtue these days _ it's what everybody praises.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it is much easier to rebound from failure in these
boom times than it would be during a recession. Jobtrak.com, which
monitors job postings at colleges, reported that the number of
openings for new college graduates rose by 40.8 percent this year.
So who cares if your job evaporates? Another is always just around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Failure chic has spawned a cottage industry of failurenalia.
Academics are writing books about failing. The VH-1 and E!
Entertainment cable channels have shown programs about it. An
Internet marketing firm called Thehiredguns.com sponsors pink-slip
parties where casualties can get together and ``dot-commiserate.''
</P>
<P>
   How better to capitalize on the trend than with a Web site? A
flock of pages have appeared, from failuremag.com and
dotcomfailures.com (motto: ``Kick 'em when they're down!'') to a
few with unprintable names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose is to take the stigma away from failing,'' said
Nicholas Hall, 30, the chief executive of Startupfailures.com, a
three-month-old online community for people in the throes of
dot-com angst.
</P>
<P>
   Hall ought to know. He ran no fewer than three companies into
the ground before starting his latest site. Rather than sit around
lamenting, he published an inspirational book for peers in need of
a pick-me-up and hit the lecture circuit to share his insights on
going bust. ``What people call failure,'' he said, ``I choose to
call an experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Sewell, chief executive of Despair Inc., which runs
despair.com and sells ``demotivational'' products like ``Failure!''
T-shirts, says young people, especially, are no longer ashamed of
failing. ``It has been properly recognized as a natural and
understandable consequence of taking risks _ in business, in
research, in relationships,'' he said. ``The biggest risks most
often end in the biggest failures. But I think our culture admires
a risk taker who fails more than a coward who never succeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Or better still, a risk taker who fails and then succeeds _ like
Sewell, who followed a ``frustrating and demoralizing'' experience
at an Internet service provider by starting his current venture,
which he said will gross $1 million in online sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are some failure do's and don'ts. First, be sure to
fail big. ``It makes you more important in the world,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But do not remain a failure for long. You must work and rework
your magic to show the world that your last setback was simply the
fault of bad timing, bad forecasts or bad luck, not any flaw in
you.
</P>
<P>
   Above all else, never, ever disappear. Invisibility is a fate
worse than failure _ which is precisely what I won't do once my TV
show does. After the Letterman appearances dwindle and the
magazines stop hailing me as a visionary, I'll pen a motivational
book full of my insights and experiences. I'll call it ``You'll
Never Eat Lunch Online Again.'' I'm sure it will sell in the
millions.

   &QR;  ``History's Lost &AMP; Found'' (8 p.m. on the History Channel) _
Featured: Elvis Presley's letter to President Nixon, offering his
help in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Chris Rock Show'' (Midnight on HBO) _ Rock, who's hotter
these days than a cheap portable hair dryer, is back with his
series that combines stand-up and chat. Tonight's guest: comedian
Bernie Mac.
</P>

   Saturday

<P>
   &QR;  ``The Cindy Margolis Show'' (10 p.m. on WHOT) _ Blonde
bombshell, model, Howard Stern guest and occasional actress,
Margolis allegedly is ``Queen of the Internet'' for her high
download status. Now she launches her own syndicated series, a sort
of talk/gawk show, taped in Miami's South Beach. It will have
music, dancing, games, stand-up comedy, D-list celebrities and a
``Webkini'' contest, where girls come onstage in bikinis and

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Last One Standing: Nebraska.'' (8 p.m. on USA,) _ Twelve
people in a farming community try to win a tractor by standing and
keeping one hand on it until everyone else has dropped out. Kind of
a mini-``Survivor.'' Very mini.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Secret World of Fame and Fortune'' (10 p.m. on the
Learning Channel, 874020) _ Madonna's personal party-planner is
interviewed. This was going to air on cable network E! but was
turned down for being too lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bud Greenspan's Favorite Stories of Olympic Glory'' (10 p.m.
on Showtime, 447204) _ Greenspan is the Ken Burns of the Olympics,
which means he deserves great credit for what he's done as an
exhaustive documentarian, and if you've seen very much of his work,
you sometimes find yourself wishing that someone with a new
approach would come along.
</P>
<P>
   For this run-up to the Sydney Games, Greenspan looks back
instead of forward and retells the stories of gymnast Nadia
Comaneci, decathlete Dan O'Brien, swimmer Duncan Armstrong,
marathoner Abebe Bikila and Greco-
</P>
<P>
   Roman wrestler Alexander Karelin.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Deal
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``High Noon'' (8 p.m. Sunday on TBS)
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance you're unaware, there was another film called
``High Noon,'' a 1952 release with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly that
won four Oscars. Because it's so easy to slam remakes of classics,
I pretended I've never seen the original, which is harder than it
sounds. (The old ``Don't think of a green elephant'' bit.)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skerritt stars as Will Kane, sheriff of a small town in the
Old West who's marrying a Quaker (Susanna Thompson) and promising
to give up his dangerous job. On Kane's wedding day, old nemesis
Frank Miller (Michael Madsen) comes to town on the noon train to
kill Kane. Torn between his vow to his new wife and his code of
honor, Kane decides to stay and fight, but can't get anyone in town
to back him up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple story, almost too short for two hours, so there
are subplots that don't work as well as the main narrative. The
clock keeps ticking (and I kept looking at my watch) until Madsen
arrives toward the end, and oh, is he bad. He just gets off the
train and squints, and that's all he has to do, 'cause he's Michael
Madsen (Mr. Blonde in ``Reservoir Dogs'').
</P>
<P>
   While Skerritt here is of the Kris Kristofferson jaw-clinching
school of acting, Thompson, who plays ex-wife Karen Sammler on
ABC's ``Once and Again,'' is memorably intense. If only this movie
were.
</P>

   GORE-CONVENTION (Los Angeles) _ Stepping into a moment that
could make or break his presidential ambitions, Al Gore took his
case directly to a skeptical America in a speech that was laden
with policy details, partisan jabs and personal asides. Gore's
goal, in what is universally viewed as the most important speech of
his life, is to imprint himself on voters and declare his
independence from President Clinton.

   GORE-ANALYSIS (Los Angeles) _ Over the past half-century,
America's fall presidential campaigns have resembled less a
come-from-behind horse race, and more a hydroplane race in which
one boat stays ahead from starting line to checkered flag. Not
since 1960, when Richard Nixon had a wafer-thin lead over John F.
Kennedy, has a candidate ahead in the polls on Labor Day lost the
November election. Vice President Al Gore has run behind Texas Gov.
George W. Bush in opinion surveys for most of the year. Gore faces
a narrow post-convention window of attention in which to
reintroduce himself before public attention gets diverted to the
Olympics and World Series.

<P>
   FILM-STEAL (Undated) _ Hollywood movies of the '80s and '90s
have tended to be very hard on the student protesters of the '60s,
invariably portraying them as self-indulgent, dope-smoking cowards
who spit on the flag and didn't have the guts to fight in Vietnam.
Robert Greenwald's ``Steal This Movie'' balances this ledger
somewhat with an unashamedly positive look at the rise of the '60s
counterculture in terms of a mostly admiring chronicle of the life
of one of its most notorious figures: Abbie Hoffman.

 &HT;    As bear sightings increase, so do problems
 &HT;    By Marija Vader and Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ It's fitting that a baby bear would make
its debut in town on the same day as Rifle High School's
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rifle High School mascot is the bears.
</P>
<P>
   A hungry baby bear stopped traffic along the bridge leading into
Rifle, as well as along Highway 6 &AMP; 24 Thursday afternoon. The
animal was one of a growing group of bears that is pouring down
into Western Colorado valleys from the high country, were a
late-spring frost and summer drought have killed most of the bear's
normal food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Junction office of the Colorado Division of Wildlife
has received, on average, seven reports of bear sightings per day
for the past several weeks, said district wildlife manager Joe
Gumber. So far this summer his office has tranquilized and
relocated 14 bears. In the Roaring Fork Valley, wildlife officers
have tranquilized and relocated five bears this summer, including a
sow and her two cubs, said Pat Tucker, Glenwood Springs area
wildlife manager for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   In Rifle Thursday, the baby bear swam into the muddy Colorado
River from the north bank, nabbed a fish and headed back to shore
for lunch while about a hundred people lined the highway to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's being boneheads,'' said Rifle Police Chief Daryl
Meisner, trying to shoo people from the scene. ``If they'd quit
being boneheads, the bear would be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   To Meisner's view, the bear was trapped on two sides by adoring
humans and on a third side by the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already stressed from a lack of food in the high
country,'' Meisner said. ``If it's pressed, it will be more
stressed. This isn't a zoo bear. This isn't a zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the main problems right now, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole situation is turning into a real sight-seeing,
people issue,'' Tucker said. ``Obviously it's intriguing, it's
neat, it's an animal you don't get to see all the time, but people
are starting to become the problem with their actions. People
prevent bears from trying to get out of an area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said in the past week there was an incident of a bear up a
tree in Aspen with people underneath it throwing rocks at it, and
of a little girl trying to pet a bear cub at the Grizzly Creek rest
area.
</P>
<P>
   The bears, too, are becoming bolder, wandering into busy Grand
Junction neighborhoods and downtown Glenwood Springs. Thursday
morning residents of IHS Mantey Heights nursing home saw a bear
walking by their windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing at the nursing station when people came running
up and said I had to look outside,'' said Valerie Tabor, a dietary
manager at Mantey Heights. ``I went up the the window and saw a
bear casually walking along, going up to the canal. Yesterday
morning it was in the grassy part right in front of the parking lot
upstairs, looking in the dining room.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said he is concerned that bears will keep coming into the
valleys, and in larger numbers, going into fall because bears start
coming from greater distances to historic fall feeding areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are heavy oak brush acorn areas and we're worried that
those areas may have gotten a freeze earlier this summer or that
the dry weather has prevented the acorns from maturing,'' he said.
``If bears move into historic fall feeding areas and they don't
find anything to eat, they know they've got to find something to
eat because winter time's coming on. That's going to take them into
wider and wider areas, lower and lower into the valleys where
theoretically there's more food, and more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tranquilizing and relocating bears that come into populated
areas and become a nuisance is a last resort, Tucker said. The
Colorado Division of Wildlife currently is focusing on educating
residents of areas where bears are coming into, asking them to seal
up trash, pet food, bird feeders, barbecue grills and other items
whose smell attracts bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time is far better spent getting the problem solved once
and for all by getting people to make an area less attractive to
bears,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   If a bear is caught and relocated, it gets an ear tag and lip
tattoo so wildlife officers will recognize it if it comes back into
populated areas and becomes a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Bears get two strikes, so wildlife officers recently have had to
kill several bears on their second strike. Tuesday wildlife
officers destroyed a bear that originally was caught Saturday in
Palisade and on Tuesday came into Silt and became a nuisance,
Gumber said. Wildlife officers from Glenwood Springs have had to
destroy two bears so far this summer, one that was captured near
Vail and relocated above Ruedi Reservoir and one that was trapped
in Aspen, taken south of New Castle and went into New Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just inundated with bear issues this summer,'' Tucker
said, ``and we're worried that the problems are going to continue
and even intensify.''

 By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Margaret Fuller, manager of profit sharing at 7-Eleven Inc., is
proud that three-quarters of the company's nearly 15,000 eligible
employees now participate in its 401(k) retirement savings plan.
Three years ago, only half had signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The big increase wasn't caused by a surge in the company's
matching contribution or a change in the plan's investment
offerings. All it took was a bow to human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of leaving it up to employees to complete enrollment
forms and return them _ and having many of them procrastinate or
shy away _ 7-Eleven started enrolling employees automatically on
the first anniversary of their hiring; only those who want to opt
out of participation needed to lift a finger.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Dallas, is one of about 50 large
corporations that have begun automatic enrollment in recent years,
as many other employers waited for the federal government to take a
stand on the practice. Last month, however, regulators in two
federal departments gave it a solid go-ahead, and the Internal
Revenue Service announced several rulings clarifying the
automatic-enrollment ground rules for businesses, nonprofit
organizations and school systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman and Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers said they saw automatic enrollment as a
``promising method of encouraging participation by those who
disproportionately have been missing the benefits of a regular,
disciplined approach to retirement saving,'' meaning the many
younger and lower-paid workers who put off saving for retirement
because they feel they cannot spare any of their pay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, experts say, most people cannot afford not to
contribute to the plans. Even if the current Social Security system
is maintained indefinitely, the dwindling of traditional,
defined-benefit pension plans means that few workers can count on a
financially secure retirement without putting aside money of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt Associates, a benefits research firm in Lincolnshire,
Ill., estimates that three-fourths of eligible American workers are
enrolled in 401(k) plans. But that still leaves millions of
Americans without any retirement savings program.
</P>
<P>
   David Wray, president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of
America in Chicago, said he expected the number of companies using
automatic enrollment to double annually for the next five years,
and that more than half of all plans would use the method by 2005.
In addition, the new IRS rulings make it possible to automatically
enroll all workers, not just new hires, in 401(k) plans and their
close cousins, 403(b)'s (for public schools and charities) and
457(b)'s (for state and local government workers).
</P>
<P>
   In automatic enrollment, the initial percentage of pay to be set
aside is left to the employer's discretion. (7-Eleven's plan sets
aside 3 percent of gross pay, a typical rate, and the company
matches employee contributions at 36 cents on the dollar.)
</P>
<P>
   Employers also decide how the money will initially be invested.
According to Mark Iwry, the benefits tax counsel for the Treasury
Department, employers are encouraged to put savings of automatic
enrollees into a balanced fund, rather than a more risky stock fund
or a low-return money market fund. ``The plans are typically very
careful in the investments they select for employees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once enrolled, employees are generally free to select different
rates and investment vehicles according to plan rules.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of 7-Eleven shows that automatic sign-up can go a
long way toward closing the enrollment gap for lower-paid employees
_ an important issue for all participants, because federal rules
sharply restrict benefits for top earners if too few of their
lower-paid co-workers take part.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some critics wonder whether herding uninterested workers
into the plans accomplishes much in the long run. ``The government
is leading the horse to water, but they haven't focused on teaching
them to want to drink,'' said Ric Edelman, an author and financial
planner in Fairfax, Va. He cited Hewitt statistics showing that
fewer than one-third of people who leave jobs with 401(k)'s roll
over the money into individual retirement accounts; the remainder
simply pocket _ and pay taxes on _ the cash payout from the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts worry that automatic enrollees will be too
passive as savers. In a study of one company's workers, the
National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass., found
that most left their starting contribution rates unchanged and
never moved out of the low-yielding money market fund in which the
company put them.
</P>
<P>
   But Leslie Kramerich, an acting assistant labor secretary, said
it was most important that the workers become savers in the first
place. ``Once they get started, then we can tackle whether they're
too conservative or too cautious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting more workers involved in 401(k)'s makes the plans more
effective as morale builders, employers say. Ben Goldstein,
director of strategic human resource planning for Primex
Technologies, an aerospace company in St. Petersburg, Fla., said
that when his company's workers receive their quarterly 401(k)
statements and see the 50 percent matching contribution from the
company, they are more motivated to stay on. ``It's like free
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, before Primex started using automatic enrollment,
about 35 percent of workers took part in the plan; now four-fifths
do, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some workers who are automatically enrolled in 401(k)
plans ought to opt out, because even plans with generous matching
rates are not the best choice for everyone, experts say. Lower-paid
people in their 20s and 30s may be better off putting their limited
resources toward a down payment on a first home or paying off debts
like college loans, said Robert Clark, professor of business and
economics at North Carolina State University. And union officials
say that however advantageous the plans might be, some of their
members genuinely cannot spare the money.
</P>
<P>
   If workers decide to leave automatic-enrollment plans after the
deductions have already begun from their paychecks, they face the
same early-withdrawal penalties that other 401(k) members do: 10
percent of the balance, plus income tax. But Fuller of 7-Eleven
said few workers had complained about being unwittingly swept into
the company's plan. ``When they get the statement at the end of the
quarter,'' she said, ``they're usually very happy.''

SURFER DUDES IN MALIBU SAY GORE'S THEIR MAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ One hour's drive physically and several light
years mentally from the barricaded fortress of the Democratic
National Convention, choppy waves six feet high were pounding the
beach yesterday at the Malibu Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome!'' said the convention's official surf instructor,
Israel ``Izzy'' Paskowitz.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't talking about the surf.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the Democratic Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the beaches, where the only controversy usually involves
the proper strength of sunscreen, Southern California is enthralled
with environmental guru Al Gore and his sidekick, Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Paskowitz pasted a bumper sticker on his surfboard: ``Gore
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a little crud over it,'' said Paskowitz, one of
nine siblings who run the San Clemente, Calif.-based Paskowitz Surf
School. ``Some surfers want us all to be non-partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's time for surfers to do the right thing. It's time to
elect somebody who will do the job well.''
</P>
<P>
   Half American Jew, half Latino _ his mother is from Durango,
Mexico _ Paskowitz is among those Democrats who instantly gained
interest when they heard Lieberman's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not put him in there?'' Paskowitz asked. ``Let's do things
differently from the last 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is so ``stoked'' about the convention that he taught
a surf school for reporters Saturday at Santa Monica Beach. Twelve
showed up, including reporters from MTV, CNN and a German woman who
he said had ``no balance whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Another German reporter is taking home a surfboard. Paskowitz
quoted him: ``I want to surf now and forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The surf crowd only reflects California's love for the
Democrats, but even the beach has a few dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to put surfers in a bloc,'' said Mark Cox, 19, a
confessed Republican voter working at the beach RV park. ``That's
wrong. Some don't care. But a lot of us are very involved in
government.''
</P>
<P>
   His greatest disdain is not directed at the dominant Democrats,
but at the young protesters marching and blocking streets outside
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so embarrassing. They just look for something to yip
about. I'm glad they're not getting much attention.''
</P>
<P>
   One Malibu resident couldn't stop talking about a Democrat who
isn't even a candidate. Laureen Sills, 40, and her children were
thrilled Sunday when President Clinton stopped his limousine to
meet them on his way to a big-money brunch at the home of James
Brolin and Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   The Sills family was watching his motorcade from their front
curb on Zumirez Drive. G.T. Sills, 9, and his sister Hallie, 8, and
brother, Danny, 4, held a hastily painted sign: ``Please Shake Our
Hands, Mr. Prez.''
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade suddenly halted. A Secret Service agent ordered
them, ``Don't move.''
</P>
<P>
   They froze. Then the agent said, ``The president wants to meet
the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shook their hands, thanked them and autographed the
sign. ``We've always been big fans of his, despite his moral
slips,'' Laureen Sills said. ``We think he's been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Al Gore should only follow the wake, she said,
using a Malibu analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a great feeling when you just get on that wave and
ride it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore needs to just get on the wave. He should get on
Clinton's surfboard and ride it.''
</P>
<P>
   That sea will be even rougher than the Malibu Lagoon.

<P>
   The business of straightening teeth has always been a
small-scale, fairly low-tech affair _ a one-on-one interaction
between orthodontist and patient, usually an adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   Colored ``designer'' bands and clear ceramic brackets held in
place by a wire may have supplanted the tortured metal-mouth look,
but this has been a world of incremental change mostly beyond the
reach of computers, Wall Street and the other trappings of the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. It seems a stretch that a classic Silicon Valley
startup could create a role for itself in this highly local
profession, but that is exactly what seems to be happening with
Align Technology, a manufacturer of a clear-plastic alternative to
braces aimed at appearance-conscious adults.
</P>
<P>
   Zia Chishti and Kelsey Wirth, the young co-founders of Align,
which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., got the attention of many
orthodontists with their claim that computers could be used to
design and make a customized series of plastic retainers for each
patient that would gradually move their teeth as prescribed by the
orthodontist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, this is the last thing I ever thought I'd do,''
said Wirth, Align's 30-year-old president, recalling how she hated
her braces in high school. But, she said, Chishti's vision of the
technology seemed to fit her search for an opportunity to ``build a
company and revolutionize an industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike braces advertised as invisible but held in place by a
wire, Align's product is transparent. Instead of visiting the
orthodontist to have braces adjusted, patients would simply switch
to the next retainer in the series every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Align claims that roughly half the nation's 8,500 orthodontists
have already attended a seminar and invested in the equipment
necessary to offer its product, an astonishingly rapid technology
deployment for such a conservative industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, armed with promising early results and backed by venture
capital on a scale that has stunned the industry, Align is
unrolling the most aggressive consumer advertising plan the dental
profession has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be 10 times more than anyone else has ever done,''
said Charles Schultz, general manager of GAC International, a
leading supplier of braces and other orthodontic supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The Align system, marketed under the Invisalign brand, is
already inspiring competitors. For instance, GAC recently began
offering an all-plastic device designed by Dr. Keith Hilliard, a
Florida orthodontist. That device, formed in the orthodontist's
office by drawing a vacuum seal over a model of the mouth, can be
adjusted by the orthodontist to push teeth in a desired direction
using pliers.
</P>
<P>
   Align's ambitious plans are based on research gathered by the
American Association of Orthodontists concluding that although
fewer than 1 percent of American adults have severe orthodontic
problems, more than 100 million adults with lesser dental
irregularities are potential candidates for orthodontics. Only
400,000, or one-half of one percent of adults, get braces each
year, so Align believes there is a huge untapped market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't care about their appearance, and others do
but can't tolerate the burdens of correcting it,'' said Chishti,
Align's 29-year-old chief executive. ``We are going to attack both
groups with marketing, and it will be a huge market-expansion
opportunity for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitors in the $450 million orthodontics supply industry are
hoping so. They are eagerly awaiting the biggest step yet in
Align's marketing program _ a $31 million campaign starting in
September that will be the first effort by an orthodontics products
company to appeal directly to consumers through television.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that many consumers responding to the ads
will instead end up convinced to try more standard treatments. Some
will discover that they have more severe problems than Align is
willing to tackle, and others are likely to balk at the 50 percent
premium over braces that many orthodontists charge for Invisalign.
</P>
<P>
   Invisalign starts with an orthodontist making an imprint of the
patient's teeth in a plastic material that is sent to Align along
with the orthodontist's prescription of how the teeth should be
moved to attain a desired final appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Patients with severe overbites, underbites and other serious
problems are excluded, as are all children because growing jaws and
erupting teeth are too complicated for Align's computer to model.
But if the adult's deformities are mild enough to fall within
Align's specification, Align develops an animated computer program
_ a process that takes three weeks to a month and is handled by
computer technicians in Pakistan _ that can be downloaded over the
Internet and shows how the teeth will move.
</P>
<P>
   Once the treatment plan depicted by the animation is approved by
the patient's orthodontist, the specifications are transmitted to
Align's manufacturing plant in Mexico. The patient gets the first
aligner six weeks after the initial visit. Most treatments require
20 to 60 aligners, which are worn approximately two weeks each. If
the patient is following directions, they are taken off only for
eating and tooth-brushing.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodontists have mixed feelings about Align. Jennifer Salzer,
whose practice is on Park Avenue in New York, is in the fifth month
of wearing the aligners. She and her partners have more than 40
patients using them. ``People who don't get involved are going to
be left behind,'' she told 135 orthodontists and assistants who
attended a one-day course Align offered in New York recently.
</P>
<P>
   The New York audience included plenty of skeptics who said that
Invisalign would make sense for only a small percentage of their
patients, many of whom might fare just as well with a retainer,
which is far cheaper. A treatment that might cost several thousand
dollars with Invisalign might be done for several hundred dollars
with a retainer, they say. Others said that treatment with the
aligners, like all removable dental appliances, is prone to failure
if patients fail to wear them around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Align asserts that orthodontists using Invisalign have increased
profits on the order of 30 percent because, without the need to
adjust braces, they need less ``chair time'' for each patient. But
some said that orthodontists who work mostly with children could
find productivity going down if Invisalign brings in more adults,
because adults always take up more time with questions than
children.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their doubts, orthodontists who delay preparing to
offer Invisalign risk being viewed as behind the times once the
television advertising campaign takes off, said Dr. George W.
Scott, an orthodontist in Middletown, N.J., and former president of
the New Jersey Orthodontists Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here only because I'm afraid,'' he said with a laugh at
the end of the New York meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Many other orthodontists say their biggest fear is that Align's
drive to grow will eventually lead it to offer its system through
general dentists, thus eating into their practices.
</P>
<P>
   Wirth said that Invisalign does nothing to simplify orthodontics
and that the company could not rely on dentists to use it
appropriately.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   New technology has traditionally crept slowly into the market,
with practitioners developing devices they eventually sold to
companies like GAC International; the Ormco subsidiary of Sybron;
or 3M Unitek, a subsidiary of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing.
Some misunderstandings and suspicion seem inevitable given that
Chishti and Wirth come out of the hothouse of Silicon Valley with
no background in dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   The two entrepreneurs met as classmates at the Stanford
University Graduate School of Business. Chishti, a native of
Pakistan who had been a consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co. and a
financial analyst at Morgan Stanley, became intrigued at how his
teeth, which had been straightened by braces, would drift out of
position when he neglected to wear his plastic retainer and how the
retainer moved them back to the proper place.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take much research to learn that orthodontists had
been talking as far back as 1945 about the possibility of using a
sequence of removable plastic appliances instead of braces to move
teeth toward a predetermined end point. Many had used simple
plastic devices fashioned in their offices for minor adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   But no one could figure out how to make wider use of plastic
aligners practical until Chishti and Wirth, a former environmental
consultant and investment banker, set up Align in 1997 to apply
computers to the problem. Not only could computers be used to
design the sequence of aligners, they realized, but stereo
lithography, a computer-driven process widely used by design
engineers in industry for building plastic models layer by layer,
could be the key to inexpensive, automated production.
</P>
<P>
   The first venture capitalists they approached did not share the
vision. Some laughed at the idea of putting money into
unfashionable orthodontic supplies, Wirth recalled. The industry
leaders were equally unimpressed. GAC declined to invest because
Align could not show them any results with patients, Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   But after Joseph S. Lacob, a general partner at Silicon Valley's
most famous venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
became enthusiastic in 1997 just 15 minutes into Chishti's
presentation, doors began to swing open.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently collected $100 million from institutions
and wealthy individuals in its fourth round of financing. It was
managed by Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco-based investment
bank where Wirth worked before heading for Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The company had offers for an additional $100 million to $200
million that it turned away, Wirth said. The next step is likely to
be a public offering, possibly before the end of the year. Some
orthodontists, like Dr. Michael Steinberg, of Millburn, N.J., say
such a step would be encouraging because they want to be sure the
company has the resources to stay in business if they are going to
start many of their patients on treatments that can easily last
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chishti is certainly prepared for a road show. He likes to drive
home the point that the devices are next to invisible by
nonchalantly popping out his current aligner, which invariably has
gone unnoticed until that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets a good reaction,'' he said.

   ATLANTA _ Last month, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said
Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis ``had suffered a lot.''
</P>

 McCAIN UNDERGOES MORE TESTS AND MAY HAVE SURGERY TO TREAT By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale examined Sen.
John McCain on Thursday and recommended that he begin treatment
immediately for the recurrence of a serious form of skin cancer, a
McCain spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Nancy Ives, said the results of tests that he
underwent for three hours were expected to be known on Friday,
after which doctors would consult with McCain and determine a
course of action that would likely include surgery. After leaving
the clinic with his wife, Cindy, McCain told reporters, ``I feel
fine, thanks.'' He took no questions.
</P>
<P>
   Ives said McCain could undergo surgery, if that is required, as
soon as Saturday. She also said doctors at Mayo planned to release
a detailed report on Friday outlining McCain's condition, after
which McCain would probably hold a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The urgency for treatment arose after a routine examination of
McCain at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center outside Washington on
Aug. 2, when doctors found two spots _ one on his left temple, the
other on his left arm _ that were confirmed through a biopsy to be
malignant melanomas. It is the deadliest and most aggressive form
of skin cancer and the least common, but if caught early, it is
highly curable.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was unclear whether the melanomas had spread, the
doctors recommended additional tests, and Thursday, McCain, 63, was
given blood work, a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram, an
echocardiogram, an MRI and a CT scan. The seriousness of skin
cancer is determined by how deep the cancer has grown and whether
it has spread to other organs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who gave up his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination in March, has a history of skin problems and in 1993 had
a melanoma removed from his shoulder. Medical records released by
his campaign said he had routinely had skin lesions or moles
removed, but they were usually the most common and least
threatening type of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While he was speaking at the Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia this month, blotches were evident at his temple. In
the closing moments of his speech, he left an eerie and suggestive
echo. He said: ``I will not see what is over America's horizon. The
years that remain are too few, I trust, but the immortality that
was the inspiration of my youth has, like all the treasures of
youth, quietly slipped away.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ives said the speech, written by Mark Salter, who was a
co-author of McCain's memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' was not
intended to portend ``anything dark about the senator's health,''
only the broad notion that the country's best times are always
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she said, the speech preceded the examination at
the Naval Medical Center, ``so the timing is all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   After the biopsy was taken, McCain returned to Philadelphia for
the final night of the convention, wearing a bandage to protect the
area.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's examination came on the final day of the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, from which both Vice President
Al Gore and his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, wished him well.
Their sentiments echoed many others that aides to McCain said he
had received over the last two days, including those from Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, as well as
scores of friends and other leading Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McCain had toured Western states with Bush
and he had planned to resume campaigning next week. But his
schedule is now uncertain, pending the treatment of his skin
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ives said it was uncertain whether McCain's skin cancer had, in
any way, been caused by the five years he spent in a prison camp
during the Vietnam War. For much of the time, the fair-skinned
McCain was kept outdoors, exposed to many hours of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, fair-skinned people and those who have been sunburned
at young ages are at greater risk to skin cancer, the American
Cancer Society says.
</P>
<P>
   Because he qualifies under both risk groups, McCain, aides said,
has undergone checkups every three months, a vigilance that could
mean his latest problems are treatable.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Dr. Charles McDonald,
past president of the American Cancer Society, said: ``He probably
just has another melanoma. Anybody who's had one, you have to keep
very close eye on them. Nine times out of 10, they're going to
develop another.''

<P>
   Maybe it's not like discovering a new bone in the human body.
But researchers now believe they have found the source of the new
skin cells that replace those shed in every day's wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Those source, or stem, cells turn out to be hiding in the roots
of the hair.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, if confirmed, could lead to a better understanding
of how the skin heals as well as to insights into basal cell
carcinoma, a common skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hair follicles, small pockets in the skin from which the hair
shaft sprouts, occur in varying density throughout the human skin,
except in the palms, soles, foreskin and labia. Even in bald
scalps, hair follicles are present and healthy but just arrested in
midcycle.
</P>
<P>
   A small bulge on the side of the follicle, just below the skin
surface, houses stem cells that migrate down to the follicle root
and repopulate the hair-making cells. Researchers report in
Friday's issue of Cell the surprising finding that the bulge is
also home to the stem cells for the skin.
</P>
<P>
   These epidermal stem cells migrate upward from the bulge and
into the surrounding skin, the researchers say. Given the general
spacing of hair follicles in human skin, a stem cell need only
migrate 3 millimeters, or one tenth of an inch, to cover half the
distance to the neighboring follicle.
</P>
<P>
   The senior authors of the study are Dr. Tung-Tien Sun of the New
York University School of Medicine and Dr. Robert M. Lavker of the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The two
dermatologists have been working together in search of the skin's
and other stem cells for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their experiment tracking the exodus of the stem cells from the
follicle bulge was done in mice, but human follicles also have a
bulge and it seems likely this is also a source of skin cells in
people too, said Dr. Elaine Fuchs, a skin biologist at the
University of Chicago. But there might be other sources of stem
cells in human skin, she said, particularly in the regions that
have no hair follicles.
</P>
<P>
   She described the work as a ``very important finding'' because
it nailed down the localization of the skin's stem cell compartment
and also showed the stem cells in the bulge are pluripotent,
meaning they can develop either into hair cells or skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the body's cells have assumed their final, mature form,
and if they divide at all will produce two identical daughter
cells. Stem cells, when they divide, produce daughter cells which
can either remain as stem cells or develop into mature cells of the
relevant type. This means the population of stem cells is
continually replenished, acting as permanent reservoir for
replacing damaged tissue cells.
</P>
<P>
   Recent discoveries about the stem cells in other tissues are
suggesting the cells are remarkably versatile and that, with the
right signals, one kind of stem cell can be converted to another.
If stem cells should become an important way of helping to repair
the body's tissues, as many biologists are hoping, the bulge of a
patient's hair follicles will be a particularly convenient source.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurt S. Stenn, director of the skin biology research
laboratory of Johnson &AMP; Johnson in Skillman, N.J., said the new
study was convincing and would advance any application of stem
cells for healing the skin since the source of the cells was now
known.
</P>
<P>
   Lavker said that he and Sun have not yet formally proved that a
single cell can make either hair or skin, but he believes that if
the cells in the bulge receive a signal to generate skin cells they
will migrate up and into the skin; if the cue is to generate hair,
they will migrate down into the base of the follicle. The relevant
cues have not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding suggests that any form of hair removal that
damages the hair follicles could impair the long-term health of the
skin by depriving the area of its stem cells. Stenn said that
electrolysis, for example, destroys the follicles. But he and other
dermatologists did not know why the skin generally seems to escape
damage in these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lavker believes his work may help explain basal cell carcinoma,
a skin cancer caused by ultra-violet light. The light cannot reach
the stem cells in their deep-set bulge but it can derange the stem
cell's descendants as they migrate closer to the surface. It is
these light-damaged cells, that have considerable proliferative
capacity, that initiate the cancer, Lavker believes.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists do not yet understand the widely varying qualities
and distribution of human hair. There is an evolutionary advantage
in having no follicles on the palms or soles, Stenn suggested,
because grip is improved by having no hair there. But how nature
arranges for this outcome is not yet known. Lavker believes that
the copious sweat glands found in the palms and soles are probably
the site of these region's stem cells.

 &HT;    You'll leave your heart in Pac Bell Park
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the Braves play their first game tonight at
Pacific Bell Park against the San Francisco Giants, they'll be
hitting on the dock of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   They'll find a stadium where tape-measure home runs called
``Splash Hits'' land in the water just beyond right field. The
homers land in an inlet named Willie McCovey Cove for the former
first baseman, not far from Lefty O'Doul Bridge, named for another
San Francisco baseball institution.
</P>
<P>
   They'll find a scene where Portuguese water dogs, in the name of
charity, race a flotilla of nautical spectators for the floating
souvenirs. The idea was the brainchild of Don Novello, the Bay-area
comedian better known as Father Guido Sarducci on ``Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PLACE TO BE
</P>
<P>
   They'll find a hangout atmosphere where fans on the street are
invited to watch _ for free _ through screened portals in right
field. Every three innings, Giants employees rotate crowds, which
they call ``the knothole gang,'' an old-time reference to kids
sneaking a peek through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   What the Braves won't find at Pac Bell are the elements that
made visits to the old Candlestick Park such a novel hardship _
canyons of empty seats, pockets of hardy fans dressed like Sherpas,
wind conditions out of ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   In its inaugural season, Pac Bell Park has turned funky,
activist, radical old San Francisco into something completely
unexpected: a baseball town. The Giants have become as tough a
ticket as the opera.
</P>
<P>
   The team sold 29,800 season tickets this year _ 20,000 more than
last year. With the exception of 500 bleacher seats put on sale
every game day, the season is sold out. Season attendance this year
will surpass 3.3 million, a significant jump from last year when
the franchise drew 2 million for only the third time in its
history. ``We've found that this can be a great baseball town with
the right facility,'' Giants CEO Larry Baer says. Pac Bell has
endowed major-league baseball in San Francisco with social status.
It is located within walking distance of downtown, technically in
China Basin, but part of trendy South of Market (SOMA), a reviving
neighborhood of upstart dot-coms, world-class museums and flashy
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A HINT OF TURNER FIELD
</P>
<P>
   ``The park has turned the town on,'' says Ronn Owens, morning
talk-show host on KGO-AM. ``There's a lot more of the
quiche-and-wine crowd. Everybody seems to be in a good mood. At the
Stick, you could always see fights in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will tell you that the games have become social
events, and it's true,'' says William Nolan, 48, a fan from
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In California style, fans will find an international food court
offering sushi, calamari and burritos along with the pricey basics:
cheeseburger and fries, $9.50.
</P>
<P>
   If not for its bayside setting and glorious views of the marina,
the Bay Bridge and Treasure Island, Pac Bell might remind fans of
Turner Field. It has the same updated amenities inside, the Main
Street feel, the brickwork, the industrial-girder look.
</P>
<P>
   Braves fans also will relate to the 9-foot-tall bronze statue of
a legendary home-run hitter on the main plaza _ not Hank Aaron, but
Willie Mays. The giant Coke bottle above left field should feel
familiar, too. It is a tilted 80-foot framework for four giant
slides inside, part of a family entertainment area, Coca-Cola Fan
Lot, which also sports a miniature replica of Pac Bell where kids
can run the bases and watch themselves on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   As with all the new baseball stadiums, Pac Bell's amusement-park
features were designed to turn baseball field into entertainment
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized going in that if we built a park only for the
people who memorize batting averages and ERAs, we'd draw a million
people per season,'' Baer says. ``But because we're privately
funded, we have to draw 3 million. To do that we had to create an
experience in fans' minds.''
</P>
<P>
   `THE BIG PHONE?'
</P>
<P>
   Probably the best news for Giants fans is that their team is a
contender. The newly involved hometown crowds seem more rabid, too;
they have been cultivating the throw-back-the-homer tradition of
Cubs fans. ``It's awesome playing in front of a full house,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker says. ``This ballpark has meant a lot to
the game in San Francisco and a lot to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's pick for best Pac Bell feature?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the weather,'' he says. ``The wind's a factor; it's
just not the factor it was at Candlestick. It doesn't swirl like it
did there.'' The only thing Giants fans haven't hit upon is one of
those nicknames _ like ``The Ted'' for Turner Field, or ``The
Jake'' for Jacobs Field in Cleveland. The closest thing offered so
far has come from a local writer, in reference to the stadium's
naming-rights owner: ``The Big Phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the most accurate description of the park may be
``the best.'' As the Houston Chronicle recently put it, ``The Great
Ballpark Building Battle is over. San Francisco won.''

FRANCE SEES BRITISH PLOT IN VASECTOMY OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French have just banned British pork and are still
not letting in British beef. And the talk here now is of a sly
reprisal: a campaign to sterilize French men.
</P>
<P>
   A British group promoting birth control is offering vasectomies
to French men, and it even offered a free one to the first man who
signed up. The campaign invites French men to cross the Channel to
Britain, on the theory that the Napoleonic Code, dating back to the
early 19th century, prohibits vasectomy, as a form of
self-mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   The British group, known as Marie Stopes International, named
for a pioneering British champion of birth control, tried to place
advertisements in French newspapers, which refused them, and in the
Paris subway, which also turned them away. The subway authority
evidently concluded that the ads would offend Catholics, since the
church teaches that vasectomies are an improper method of birth
control.
</P>
<P>
   So Marie Stopes posted the proposal on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Bernard Schnakenbourg became a national celebrity. He
traveled to London earlier this month from his home near Paris with
his companion and their 2-year old daughter for a vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Schnakenbourg, 47, who works at a national center for
scientific research, announced to astonished French reporters: ``I
feel great. It's like coming out of the dentist with a local
anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in France was a mix of wonder and outrage. ``The
appeal from London to sterilize the French,'' read the headline in
the leftist daily Liberation. But the paper went on to note that
while 6 percent of French women of child bearing age have been
sterilized, usually by tubal ligature, fewer than 1 percent of
French men have undergone a vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   That compared with 16 percent in Britain, the country with the
highest incidence; 11 percent in the Netherlands; and 8 percent in
Belgium, according to U.N. statistics. The United Nations lists the
number performed in France as ``nil or negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   The figure appears remarkable in a country that has been a
leader in other respects in contraceptive issues, though mostly
regarding women.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In January, for instance, France started to distribute
morning-after contraceptive pills to schoolgirls as young as 12,
though since then the issue has fought its way through the courts.
And last year the government allowed pharmacists to start selling
ordinary birth control pills over the counter without a
prescription, making France the only European country to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, sterilization, including vasectomy, has slumbered in
a gray zone of dubious legality, one that appears to accommodate
the apprehensions of French males.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For officials of the French Ministry of Health, the offer by
Marie Stopes appeared to befit a nation of shopkeepers.
Dismissively, a spokesman declined to comment, characterizing it
merely as ``essentially, a commercial undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Julie Douglas, marketing director at Marie Stopes,
denied that the offer, which charges the French the equivalent of
$300 for the vasectomy, essentially to cover costs, was intended to
make money. ``We don't expect big numbers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an organization, our mission is to spread the word about
contraception,'' she said, adding that the publicity surrounding
Schnakenbourg's decision had ``raised the debate in France.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization's Web site (www.mariestopes.org.uk) displays
the poster rejected by the Paris subway system. It shows Napoleon,
right hand tucked typically into his jacket, though the hand is
positioned lower than usual. Douglas described it as a ``cheeky
ad.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts agree that French law relegates sterilization to
a dubious zone. Last year the law, which bans any ``assault on the
integrity of the human body except in case of therapeutic
necessity,'' was changed to replace the word ``therapeutic'' with
``medical.'' That was to allow doctors greater leeway in deciding
when sterilization is permissible.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephane Dropy, chief urologist at the Bicetre hospital east
of Paris, said resistance by French males to vasectomy was ``partly
cultural,'' given French reliance on other forms of contraception.
Despite the revision in the text of the law, he acknowledged ``its
interpretation remains subjective.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Schnakenbourg, at his news conference, could not
refrain from a swipe at his countrymen's contraceptive habits.
French men would accept vasectomy, he said, if the alternative
meant going on the pill. ``I don't think men would accept
swallowing something every day for 30 years,'' he said.

 &HT;    Rivalry nonexistent for Graziani, Kanell
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tony Graziani might be playing the best football of
his life, but these days are not his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani is trying to beat out Danny Kanell for the right to
back up quarterback Chris Chandler for the Falcons (3-0). Coach Dan
Reeves has suggested that the loser in this competition will be
cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the Graziani-Kanell relationship is not the rivalry fans
might picture when thinking about two men competing for the same
job in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani and Kanell eat together, joke together, play golf
together.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, two days after Kanell supplanted him as the backup
only to suffer a knee injury in a start at Tennessee, the two were
at the mall. Kanell was on crutches, and Graziani was helping him
around.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight, Graziani, 26, will try to move ahead of his friend,
who is a month older. Graziani is expected to play the second half
against the 2-0 Chargers. He has a passer rating of 135.1; Kanell's
rating is 106.4.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough to say which one aches more inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try not to think about it, at least on the field,''
said Graziani, a seventh-round draft choice of the Falcons in 1997.
``Obviously, off the field, you think about it a little because you
have to make plans and so forth. It's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani's first three NFL seasons went from Titanic to train
wreck to fender bender. His passer ratings were 3.7, 42.4 and 64.2.
A rating of about 70 is average.
</P>
<P>
   But he became a world traveler, played with Barcelona in NFL
Europe in the spring, logged a lot of time and threw more passes
than in three seasons in the NFL. He grew as a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to take what the defense gives me,'' he said. ``I
was always confident. Now, I'm more prepared for what I'm going to
see. It's not that I was shocked before, but now I'm more
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks coach Jerry Rhome knows that Reeves favors keeping
strong-armed rookie free-agent Doug Johnson as a developmental
project for the No. 3 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to be able to keep all four. That's coach Reeves'
decision,'' Rhome said. ``You just got to look at them, and look
into the future, if they're even. They're both intelligent. Tony's
a little more mobile, but Danny's more experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani appreciates the kind words. What he would really
appreciate is a job, but not at Kanell's expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, and I think it's going to make us better
players,'' he said. `'Like Danny said last week, maybe we'll force
them to keep all four of us. If not, I'll be sad to see one of us
go.''

NEW GRAND JURY TO HEAR EVIDENCE IN LEWINSKY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel investigating President
Clinton's relationship with a White House intern has empaneled a
new grand jury to hear evidence in the case, government officials
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, convened the panel last
month as part of his publicly announced intention to consider
whether Clinton should be charged with criminal wrongdoing in the
case, once he leaves office, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was no indication that the decision to empanel the grand jury
was based on any fresh evidence in the case. Nor did it indicate
that prosecutors were preparing to seek an indictment anytime soon,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted angrily to the grand jury disclosure,
coming as it did just hours before Vice President Al Gore was to
accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven,'' said Jake
Siewert, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although the grand jury was empaneled on July 11, its existence
became widely known on Thursday, following related action on
Wednesday night by a three-judge appellate panel, which oversees
the independent counsel and authorized Ray's work for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans outside Washington also responded with
astonishment _ and some alarm _ at the news.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, mindful that the 1998 impeachment of Clinton had
likely contributed to their loss of seats in the House, expressed
reluctance to see any re-emergence of the Clinton scandal story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing is terrible,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, a
Republican moderate from Connecticut. ``I wish he hadn't done this
in a political season. It needs to be done when it can be
considered on its own merits and doesn't color other matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, the fiercely partisan former senior adviser to
Clinton, said the news from Ray's office was ``brazenly political''
and predicted that it would cause a backlash against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take my hat off to their gall,'' said Emanuel, now an
investment banker in Chicago. ``But my gut tells me the American
people, in their great wisdom, will once again recognize the
political nature of this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster, said that the development
hurts Gore because it once again reminds the American people of his
close eight-year relationship to Clinton, even as the vice
president is trying to establish an independent identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Clinton is in the public limelight, the worse it is
for Gore. That's a given,'' Teeter said. ``Gore is never going to
escape the fact that he's Clinton's vice president. That is the
most widely known and most important thing about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, declined to speculate on the political impact of Ray's
action. But a spokesman for the governor said the development would
be viewed by the public as a reminder of the caustic climate in
Washington during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are sick and tired of investigation and
scandal,'' said Ray Sullivan, the Bush spokesman. ``The best way to
change that and change the tone in Washington is to change
administrations in the White House. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney
aim to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest grand jury's work begins more than two-and-a-half
years after Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr, first initiated his
inquiry into Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, then a
White House intern, and more than a year-and-a-half after the
president was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the independent counsel statute expired in June 1999,
Ray remains in office because the investigation began before the
law lapsed, assailed by both political parties as an unwieldy
investigative bludgeon that failed in its intended purpose to
remove politics from corruption cases against high-level
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews earlier this year, Ray, who took over from Starr
last October, said that he had completed the investigation into
whether presidential aides engaged in wrongdoing in connection with
the firing of employees at the White House travel office and with
another matter, the collecting of hundreds FBI personnel files by
White House employees. Ray decided against bringing charges in
either case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray said that two matters remained open in an investigation
that had already spent $47 million when he took over. One was
whether the White House improperly kept e-mails from congressional
and Justice Department investigators looking into a variety of
allegations involving presidential aides.
</P>
<P>
   But the other far more incendiary issue was whether Clinton
could be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice when he
denied having a relationship with Lewinsky when he was deposed in
the Paula Jones sex harassment civil case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case has already found that Clinton testified
falsely and fined him for civil contempt of court. The disciplinary
committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has also moved to revoke
Clinton's law license.
</P>
<P>
   In empaneling the grand jury, Ray will seek to determine whether
Clinton's testimony in the Jones case was sufficiently misleading
to warrant bringing criminal charges against the president once he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office would not comment on the decision to convene the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court panel that re-authorized Ray to continue his
work for another year, decided that termination was ``not currently
appropriate.'' Under the law, the panel must decide annually
whether to discontinue investigations of independent counsels like
Ray, who were named before the law expired.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, one of the three judges, Richard D. Cudahy, a
Democratic appointee to the bench, said the ``endless
investigation'' should be shut down when Starr stepped down. The
two other judges, appointed under Republican administrations, Peter
T. Fay and David B. Sentelle, ruled the office should continue. On
Wednesday, the decision to keep the inquiry open was unanimous.

STUDY FINDS LESS CHANCE OF AN EARTHQUAKE AT NOTORIOUS FAULT

<TEXT>
<P>
   The earthquake fault considered most likely to bring destruction
to the San Francisco Bay area may actually be incapable of
generating a large earthquake on its own, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   New measurements taken from space and from deep within the earth
suggest that a 12-mile northern segment of the fault, the Hayward
Fault, which runs north from Berkeley to the southern edge of San
Pablo Bay, is in constant motion, creeping steadily along its
entire width and depth. This process relieves stresses along the
fault and prevents large earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   But this discovery does not mean that communities along the
fault segment are safe from earthquakes, said Roland Buergmann, a
geophysicist at the University of California at Berkeley who
described the finding in Friday's issue of the journal Science. He
said there were plenty of places nearby or across San Francisco Bay
that could give rise to an earthquake powerful enough to damage
buildings in the northern Hayward Fault area. The Hayward Fault is
part of the San Andreas Fault system, which runs through California
near the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't advise anyone to unbolt their water heaters or cancel
their earthquake insurance,'' said Robert Simpson, a geophysicist
at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who is
familiar with the new research.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said the new research was notable not simply because of
its conclusions but also because it provides one of the first uses
of satellites to study the San Andreas Fault as a whole, above and
below ground.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, scientists using surface-based instruments could
not discern tectonic forces at work below the surface, said Wayne
Thatcher, a physicist at the Geological Survey. But Buergmann and
his colleagues used a satellite-based technique called
interferometric synthetic aperture radar, which can monitor
deformities on the earth's surface over a broad region and detect
rising bulges or falling depressions in the earth's crust, signs of
tectonic activity below.
</P>
<P>
   When pressure is building in a section of a fault, Thatcher
said, it will warp the surface in a characteristic way that reveals
the location and depth of the sections. When these locked areas,
called asperities, accumulate a critical amount of strain, they
break apart, resulting in an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said researchers used to track only five or six major
faults in the Bay area. ``Now we are looking at 17 to 18 segments
that stretch over a much wider area'' and have come to realize that
they are dynamically interconnected in a deep subterranean maze, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buergmann and his colleagues also studied a series of tiny
earthquakes, so small that they could not be felt by people, along
the northern segment of the Hayward Fault. These small quakes have
identical signatures on a seismograph, he said, which suggest that
the same asperity is breaking apart again and again. Measurements
of these microearthquakes help scientists estimate how fast the
fault is slipping at its deepest levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hayward Fault is one of the first fractures in the Bay area
to be studied with these new tools, Simpson said. The fault is
notorious because, when combined with a fracture to the north
called the Rodgers Creek Fault, the 100-mile system is estimated to
have a 33 percent chance chance of generating a severe earthquake
within the next 30 years, an estimate scientists said remains in
force even if the northern segment of the Hayward Fault is
creeping.
</P>
<P>
   The southern end of the Hayward Fault, from Fremont to Berkeley,
appears to be creeping near the surface and accumulating strain
deeper underground, Buergmann said. Its last earthquake occurred in
1868 and, until the cataclysmic San Andreas earthquake in 1906,
Hayward was called ``the big one.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also evidence that the northern Hayward segment
ruptured in 1836, but that has since been proved erroneous, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that the Hayward Fault is creeping are obvious, Simpson
said. Sidewalks are constantly being torn apart and there is a
fracture running down the middle of the University of California's
football stadium in Berkeley. But the questions were, how much is
it creeping and to what depth?
</P>
<P>
   Buergmann used satellite and microearthquake data collected over
the last decade to calculate a relationship between the deformation
measured at the surface and the slippage through its entire depth.
The mathematical model that best fit the data, he said, indicates
that this portion of the fault is creeping at a rate of about
one-fifth of an inch a year all the way down to where rocks get
sticky and soft. There is no big asperity to cause a big
earthquake. Underlying rocks in the area may be softer and more
crumbly than rocks in other parts of the Bay area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another experiment, researchers at the Geological Survey dug
trenches at a golf course on the northern Hayward segment and found
that the surface damage from 1836 was probably caused by a
neighboring fault and not from an epicenter beneath Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream we have is to use these methods to learn how fast
each fault segment is moving,'' Buergmann said, ``where are they
slipping and where are they locked. We'd like to make models of
real-time movies of all the faults in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, no one living near the San Andreas Fault should
let his guard down, Simpson said. Some of the worst damage caused
by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred 50 miles north in the
San Francisco marina district and in Oakland across the San
Francisco Bay.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interesting fund-raising effort, author Elizabeth Haydon
has donated the royalties from her latest fantasy novel,
``Prophecy,'' to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   And to help raise interest in the just-published book, an array
of celebrities _ including Danny DeVito, Fran Drescher, Scott Wolf
and Dolly Parton _ are reading snippets from it each day online at
www.dailymysteryguest.com.
</P>
<P>
   Haydon, her editor James Minz of publisher Tor Books and others
will also take part in an online chat Aug. 24 at Barnes &AMP; Noble's
Web site, www.bn.com/chat. During the chat, Haydon plans to reveal
the winner of a songwriting contest, the Firbolg Composer
Interactive Songwriting Competition; the winning song is for one of
the characters in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Readings of the book, a sequel to 1999's ``Rhapsody,'' will
continue through the end of August. &QL; 
---Air of familiarity &QL; 
It's a long way from being Pokemon, but you have to give Bandai and
its collaborators on ``Digimon'' credit for trying to knock off (in
so many ways) the multi-billion-dollar Nintendo videogame/trading
card/merchandising/animation juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is the Labor Day Digimon Weekend event at Universal
Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2 and 3, children will be able to play the Digimon
trading card game in the Digi-Battle Game Zone and can get a
special Goldramon game card that will be available only at the
event. Children can also get their pictures taken with eight of the
Digimon TV show's characters at Universal's Parisian Courtyard. A
separate ``Munch Lunch'' with some of the characters will be
available at Universal's Castle Theater (cost is $12 for adults, $9
for children).
</P>

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Many commentators have noted the impact the
coming election will have on the direction of the Supreme Court.
But a compelling issue for the federal courts is being overlooked.
With the next president expected to appoint more than 20 federal
appellate judges and close to 100 federal district court judges,
the candidates and their parties should articulate the extent of
their commitment to diversity on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   After the political conventions, voters might be confused about
which party truly stands for diversity and pluralism, but the
position of the parties on this issue is clear from their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The 35th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act on
Aug. 6 came just a day after the first anniversary of a
less-publicized event, the nomination of James Wynn Jr. to the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Wynn, currently serving on the
North Carolina Court of Appeals, is the second of three
African-Americans whom President Clinton has nominated to the 4th
Circuit. No African-American has ever served on this court even
though the states that make up the 4th Circuit have the largest
population of African-Americans of any appellate circuit in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first two attempts to desegregate the 4th Circuit were
blocked by Sen. Jesse Helms, using review powers accorded to
senators over nominees from their own states. Helms has argued that
the 4th Circuit is operating efficiently at its current size.
Rather than support the nomination of qualified African-Americans,
he is content to leave the 15-member court with four vacancies and
no representation from North Carolina. Two of these vacancies have
been declared judicial emergencies; one seat has been vacant for 10
years, longer than any seat in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Clinton tried to circumvent the Helms obstacle by
nominating Roger Gregory to fill the seat that has been vacant for
10 years. Gregory, an African-American from Virginia, has received
the bipartisan endorsement of both his home-state senators. Still,
the Republican-led Judiciary Committee has not acted to give him a
hearing, the first step in the confirmation process.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to reconcile this opposition to integrating the
federal bench with the image of inclusiveness projected from the
Republican Convention. George W. Bush recently stated that the
Senate has an obligation to act promptly on judicial nominations
and that he would expect action on his within 60 days. The record
of the Republican-controlled Senate makes a mockery of this
standard.
</P>
<P>
   President Harry Truman began the process of desegregating the
federal judiciary in 1949, by nominating William H. Hastie, but by
1976 only four African-Americans had been appointed to the federal
appellate courts. President Jimmy Carter made dramatic strides
during his four years in office, appointing nine African-Americans
to these courts. When he left office, however, the tide reversed.
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush made only three
African-American circuit court appointments during their combined
12 years in office _ a lower ratio of black appointments to courts
of appeals than F.W. de Klerk had in his tenure as the last
apartheid leader of South Africa, as Judge A. Leon Higginbotham
noted at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brought new conviction to the task, nominating 13
African-Americans thus far, but he is still making up lost ground.
Only last month did the representation of African-Americans on the
federal appellate courts reach the same level as in 1980. The
struggle for integration of the federal courts has essentially
stood still for the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the judicial nominees who have waited longest for
confirmation since Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 are
women or minorities. The striking disparity in the speed of
confirmations suggests that these nominees are being more closely
scrutinized because of stereotypical assumptions that their
positions on legal issues are tied to their race or sex.
</P>
<P>
   Those African-Americans who have been given a chance to serve on
the federal bench cannot be characterized as having followed a
judicial agenda defined by their race. Far from being interested
only in issues of civil rights, African-American judges have
written crucial decisions in areas as wide-ranging as criminal
justice, maritime law and intellectual property. African-Americans
who have served on the federal bench have proved to be not
ideological extremists, but respected jurists. Clinton's nominees,
the most diverse group for any president, have the highest ratings
from the American Bar Association in 40 years. The goal of
diversity clearly does not entail a sacrifice in quality.
</P>
<P>
   Helms stated last year that the people of North Carolina don't
care who sits on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. ``It matters
only to politicians and newspaper editors,'' he claimed. But people
do care who sits on the federal bench, and they should. Increasing
the representation of women and minorities serves to ensure that
the judicial system reflects the broad perspectives of society.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the immense contribution that Justice Thurgood
Marshall made in this regard, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
explained, ``At oral arguments and conference meetings, in opinions
and dissents, Justice Marshall imparted not only his legal acumen
but also his life experiences, pushing and prodding us to respond
not only to the persuasiveness of legal argument but also to the
power of moral truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginbotham, who served with distinction on a federal appellate
court in Pennsylvania, explained that diversity reinforces the
legitimacy of the courts. ``Pluralism is a sine qua non in building
a court that is both substantively excellent and respected by the
general population,'' he said. ``Judicial homogeneity, by contrast,
is more often than not a deterrent to, rather than a promoter of,
equal justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nomination of Roger Gregory from Virginia, the
Republican-controlled Senate now has the chance to demonstrate a
commitment to equality in judicial confirmations. It should seize
this opportunity as soon as possible.

NORTH KOREAN SPIES MAINTAIN LOYALTY YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   SEOUL _ Wizened but unbowed, Shin In Young and his seven elderly
housemates, all former North Korean secret agents, have emerged
blinking into the sunlight of a world that has changed dramatically
since they were imprisoned decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were among thousands of agents who infiltrated South Korea
on missions from the North's communist government in the 1950s and
'60s. Captured and jailed for fomenting revolution by the south's
former rightist dictatorships, they endured water torture, being
hung from the rafters, and beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Many died in prison or changed sides to win their freedom. But
about 100 survived and clung to their allegiance to the North,
remaining in prison until Kim Dae Jung, himself a former political
prisoner, was inaugurated president of South Korea in 1998 and
began granting amnesties.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, these men have lived humbly in church-supported
group homes in Seoul, working as garbagemen to supplement the
charity they receive, offering free acupuncture to the poor, a
skill they learned in prison when they had to secretly treat
themselves, and pining for home.
</P>
<P>
   They have awkwardly acclimated to smog and computers, to
dyed-hair youth culture and MTV. But one thing they cannot accept
is the political system that they vowed to overturn years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When they were first released they found themselves free men
trapped in South Korea, barred from returning home across the
world's last Cold War battle front. Now, thanks to the least
publicized and perhaps most delicate provision of the unprecedented
June summit between the leaders of South Korea and North Korea, the
``unconverted long-term prisoners'' will be allowed to go home next
month, and two-thirds say they are going.
</P>
<P>
   Televised images of this week's 200 tearful and agonizingly
short cross-border family reunions have tantalized the men in this
sunny two-story house in a working-class neighborhood. The
fleeting, desperate embraces between mothers and long-lost
children, between wives and missing husbands, will be by Saturday a
heartbreaking memory. But in a few short weeks, these men will be
permanently reunited with their surviving loved ones and with the
world's last unreconstructed Stalinist state, the fiercely
``self-reliant'' North Korea for which they sacrificed their
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   As young nationalists who had just cast off the yoke of Japanese
colonialism, they joined the North to fight for a united Korea,
free from domination by the post-war superpowers. ``All the
progressive people went up North to help the government reunify,''
said Shin, 71. ``All the conservative people stayed here and blamed
communism for their failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoon Yong Gi, 74, jailed 39 years for his activities, resents
the label ``spy.'' He calls himself a patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spy is someone hired by other governments for money. I came
from the North to liberate my country and help it unify itself,''
he declared. ``I was working for my own people. . . And my ideology
hasn't changed a bit. I still believe the South Korean government
is dependent on the U.S. and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, these tough old men refuse to discuss their
``missions,'' revealing only that they were sent to ``create
rebellion among university students and the public,'' glean
information from southern officials, and promote reunification.
</P>
<P>
   These days, they have little opportunity for such activities.
They spend their time preparing herbal medicines, treating
patients, collecting trash, and reading North Korean papers on the
Internet. But if their involvement in promoting unification has
diminished, their commitment to that ideal has not.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the South's obvious prosperity, nor news of the North's
backwards economy, clouds their idealism. Capitalism violates human
rights, they say, since some people are rich and others poor. The
North's economic troubles would disappear, these men believe, if
the U.S. lifted its longstanding economic blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Shin's small room is decorated with things he may not have
access to in the North _ a late-model TV, a computer, a variety of
books and newspapers, and some choice kitsch, including a fake
bronze rococo bust of a kissing couple. But these, he says, are
unneccesary trappings that he won't mind leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
   For all the warm treatment from human rights groups and Catholic
Church volunteers, and the simple comfort of their lives, these men
are outsiders in this society, contrarians whose politics
stigmatized their relatives in the South when they were caught.
</P>
<P>
   These men believe that in the North they will find dignity, a
hero's welcome, and a community of like-minded souls. They are for
ideology first, family second.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I need is my own country, which I have been dreaming to go
back to all these years,'' Shin said. He is dying of bone marrow
cancer, and he believes his medical care in the North will be
better than the free treatment he has received in Seoul. ``I
believe they will take care of my health there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the long dreamed-for return and reunion with the wife and
three children he hasn't seen in 33 years will come at a bitter
price. His 92-year-old mother, five sisters, and brother live in
the South, and going home means bidding them goodbye forever. Shin
is lobbying the Seoul government to let him take his mother to the
North so she fulfill ``her last wish'' to meet her daughter-in-law
and three grandchilden.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea announced Wednesday it would welcome the
ex-prisoners' southern relatives to come live with them, but the
South has not said whether it will allow such an unprecedented
cross-over.
</P>
<P>
   Even the decision to let the prisoners go back has raised
hackles here; many say President Kim should have insisted on a
trade for the estimated 400 southern POWs believed to be laboring
in camps since the 1950s, plus any political prisoners or spies
from the South. The Pyongyang government denies there are any.
</P>
<P>
   Shin believes that his wife is alive and passed the years ``with
dignity,'' knowing that her husband did ``something for the whole
nation, not just for our small family. I told her when I left that
this division of Korea happened in our generation, so our
generation must sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   But three men living in the house have decided not to return
next month, either because they married since their release or
never had families in the North. But they insist that they will
still be fighting quietly for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came all the way down here to work for reunification, and it
hasn't happened yet, so how can I go back?'' said an indignant Ahn
Hak Seop, 70. ``My relatives here treat me like a bloody communist.
My nephew came to me when I got out of prison and said, `You look
just like my father, but you're a bloody Red.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'd have a better life in North Korea, and that people
would welcome me there. But I need to stay here to prove that I
have stood by my ideals all these years,'' said Ahn, who rises
daily at 4 a.m. to collect trash for $200 a month. He spends
afternoons making herbal medicine for patients and studying
Northern leader Kim Jong Il's reunification theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show these brainwashed South Korean people that
we're the same people, that we're even more diligent, more honest.
I want to show people here a moral way to live.''

 &HT;    DULL CONVENTION? NOT IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK
 &HT;    By JILL VEJNOSKA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ TV talk is all the rage here, just as it was in
Philadelphia a few weeks ago. All anyone wants to know is why the
major broadcast networks aren't providing more convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Not interesting enough, say the TV types.
</P>
<P>
   That's not true. You just have to know where to look. Here are a
few scenes from the Week That Was at the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   A motorcade pulled up to the Staples Center shortly before noon
on Thursday, escorted by a plethora of California Highway Patrol
officers riding motorcycles and displaying none of the friendliness
of Ponch and John on ``Chips.'' The reason became apparent when one
of the officers in the rear guard spilled the name of their
celebrity passenger:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. Not ``Mrs. Gore,'' not ``the vice president's
wife.'' Just ``Tipper,'' who's married to ``Al.'' As in ``Al and
Joe,'' which is all it says on the best-selling button at Jim
Bayne's table outside the convention (Better even than the ``Please
don't shoot me, I'm not a protester'' button).
</P>
<P>
   Forget becoming the First Family. The Gores are rapidly becoming
the nation's First Name Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched their family grow up,'' explained California
delegate Arlie Ricasa, watching inside the Staples Center as Tip--,
er, Mrs. Gore, ran through a sound check on the podium for her
Thursday night speech. ``It's very hard to call them by their last
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Mrs. Gore, electronic signs in the arena where the Lakers
play read ``Tipper Rocks!''; in front of her, some 30 photographers
_ professional and otherwise _ stood on chairs in the Tennessee
delegation's section and snapped photos. A longtime professional
photographer, Mrs. Gore pulled out her camera and began snapping
right back.
</P>
<P>
   Then she moved toward the back of the podium, where she spent
some 10 minutes being interviewed by NBC's Maria Shriver. Watching
from the press gallery of seats above the podium was 11-year-old
Chaille Stovall, who's making a film about the political
conventions and filing short reports for the cable channel HBO
Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gore!'' Chaille screamed and across several rows, his
equally pint-sized camera man and sound man scrambling along behind
him. ``Mrs. Gore! Will you do an interview?!''
</P>
<P>
   As an aide pulled the waving second lady off the podium, Shriver
headed towards Chaille. Would she do instead, Shriver wondered?
</P>
<P>
   Chaille scrambled through a notebook for questions he'd prepared
for just such a moment. Shriver, a mother of four, soothingly asked
him questions about himself, and, seeing how he'd spelled her name
in his notebook _ ``Schreiber'' _ gently set him straight.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Chaille began questioning her about the role of young
people in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 5, I passed out bumper stickers for my uncle who
was running for president. His name was John Kennedy,'' Shriver
told him, just before reaching over unobtrusively and straightening
up his microphone.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes, Chaille finally asked a seemingly
unscripted question. Did Shriver bring her children to the
convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter came to the Republican convention and my two kids
came here the other night,'' Shriver said, before expressing common
lament of nearly everyone here, Kennedys or otherwise. ``None are
coming tonight. I don't have any passes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, an event sponsored by four Jewish organizations that
was to feature speeches by President Clinton and first lady and New
York Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton began running long.
The president apparently was running behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To fill some of the time, two groups that had been providing
separate musical entertainment merged their repertoires. The result
of mixing mariachi with Eastern European ``Klezmer'' music was a
not unpleasant feeling of being at a bar mitzvah in Mexican
restaurant. They called it the ``Klezmer Mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing they didn't call on one of three cabinet officers in
attendance, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. Two nights later, at
a party at the home of Shriver and her husband, actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Richardson joined Shriver's uncle, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts,er ``Roll Call.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of discordant notes, the police and the
aforementioned protesters have been in an increasing state of
standoff all week. Many of the protesters refuse to give their
names _ ``I can't, I'm an anarchist,'' one young man with a
bandanna covering half his face explained Wednesday evening _ and
often claim, as one also did Wednesday, that their concerns are
``too complicated'' to be articulated.
</P>
<P>
   But you didn't have to be a young anarchist to find yourself
caught up in protests this week _ or to experience conflicted
emotions over how both sides have handled themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Aaron Cogan and Kelly Calvey left nearby Laguna
Hills to attend a rally for vice president Al Gore at the Burbank
Airport. Next they headed downtown to sight-see at the Staples
Center; around 6 p.m., they stood near the heart of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm staying to make sure it stays peaceful,'' said Cogan, 36,
who felt it was his duty as a citizen. ``If nothing else, you've
got to have the space to speak your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As police tried to clear the area, some protesters heckled
Calvey, who wore a Gore T-shirt. She defended their first amendment
right to protest anything _ including her choice of presidential
candidate. But as more and more of the protesters departed, Calvey
was somewhat downcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed that they didn't stand their ground
longer,'' said Calvey, 35, who works in employment recruiting.
Then, as police announced anyone who didn't move along would be
subject to arrest, she and Cogan fretted over whether to stay and
risk arrest themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the decision was taken out of their hands. With most of
the protesters gone, the duo moved out along with police.
</P>
<P>
   The police have had other things to do here, of course. Around
11 p.m. on Monday, a suspected carjacker led to police on a
prolonged high-speed chase near the Los Angeles Airport. The chase
was broadcast live on the local Fox affiliate, whose anchorman at
one point somberly informed viewers there was ``no connection''
between the chase and the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the convention got a mention on TV.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The teachers' unions have apparently forgiven Sen.
Joseph Lieberman for his past support of school vouchers. But his
deviation from the National Education Association party line goes
much deeper than vouchers _ a record that will undoubtedly become
clearer as the campaign moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But let's start with vouchers, an issue Lieberman said he was
just flirting with. He has supported at least seven bills to
promote school choice since 1992. The first was an amendment
offered by Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, authorizing $30
million to help low-income parents send their children to schools
of their choice. Another was an amendment offered last summer by
Sen. John McCain for a $5.4 billion, three-year pilot program
offering one million children $2,000 vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   During the floor debate on one such initiative, Lieberman made
his position clear. ``The true choice here is between preserving
the status quo at all costs, which is slamming a door in the face
of the parents and children who want to do better, and doing what
is necessary to put those children first,'' he said. ``In other
words, asking whether the status quo of the public education
orthodoxy, which is letting down so many children, is so important
that we are willing to sacrifice the hopes and aspirations of
thousands of children for the sake of a process, not for the sake
of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider also Lieberman's efforts to overhaul the federal role
in education. He used this year's reauthorization of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act to mobilize support among fellow New
Democrats for structural changes in the federal role in education.
His frustration was understandable. The law's Title I program has
consumed more than $120 billion since its creation in 1965 in a
largely failed effort to close the achievement gap between rich and
poor students. The law, initially only 32 pages long and focused on
five programs, has ballooned to more than 1,000 pages and more than
50 programs.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and another New Democrat, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana,
introduced a measure that would have streamlined the more than 50
federal programs into five performance-based block grants. Each
would have focused on specific objectives, like improving teacher
quality and expanding parents' choice of public schools. The
Lieberman-Bayh program also included financial rewards for states
that raised student achievement, and sanctions for those that
failed.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a simple concept, but it was the first time
Democrats had offered such a fundamental overhaul of a federal
education program _ one that would shift the attention away from
preserving programs to boosting academic achievement, especially
among poor students. The plan also included a drastic increase in
the budget for education, something that would appeal to
traditional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the education establishment would have none of it. The
National Education Association urged senators not to vote for the
bill, and Sen. Ted Kennedy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate
Education Committee, swatted it aside. Nor was Vice President Al
Gore publicly responsive, though Lieberman's office reportedly sent
his proposal to Gore's campaign staff, according to a National
Journal article in October 1999. The bill went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman may get another chance. Since the education law
was not reauthorized this year, the next administration will have
the opportunity to reconsider his plan. The only wrinkle: The
presidential candidate who supports the Lieberman approach is
George W. Bush.

  Remake can't stand up to sentimental original 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sun., Aug. 20.) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner must imagine himself similar to Will Kane, the
protagonist of ``High Noon'' _ a lone, decent man battling on
despite the indifference of his countrymen: contemporary audiences
with blase attitudes toward Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   Turner alone seems to be producing for his cable stations TNT
and TBS what they called, back in the day, ``oaters.'' The results
are obvious labors of love _ in this remake for TBS of Fred
Zinnemann's beloved 1952 Gary Cooper-Grace Kelly melodrama,
cinematographer Robert McLachlan polishes Rick Roberts' handsome
production design, not to mention some spectacular vistas, to a
gorgeous sheen.
</P>
<P>
   But here the genre's cliches show their aching joints
pronouncedly (some considered the original even upon its release to
be a bit on the sentimental side), which works decidedly against
its overall effectiveness. In his book ``The Hollywood Western,''
historian William K. Everson declared Henry King's less celebrated
but far grittier 1950 effort ``The Gunslinger,'' which operated on
many similar levels to Zinneman's more popular work, to be the
superior of the two films.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Noon'' 2K stars stolid Tom Skerritt as Kane, who
discovers, seconds after marrying Quaker pacifist Amy (``Once and
Again's'' Susanna Thompson), that a killer who has sworn revenge
against him has been dubiously released from prison and is lusting
for blood on the next train to Kane's sleepy town of Hadleyville.
</P>
<P>
   Amy, naturally, thinks Kane should get while the getting is good
_ ``I don't see anything but death and destruction coming out of
this,'' she opines. The townspeople agree: The town judge (Matthew
Walker) grimly tells Will, ``You could be on your way to your
wedding bed instead of your grave.'' Will, of course, is too
willful a manly man to drop his guns and badge.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, his efforts to form a posse to battle his foe are
singularly disastrous _ as much as everyone has valued his
contribution to the community, no one wants to muss his hair or
endanger risk his life to fight for right. In 1952, this commented
archly on the encroaching American values of apathy and passing the
buck; today, it simply seems depressingly de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   A key scene _ Kane confronting the town gentry in the church,
only to be rebuffed in a genteel and gutless fashion _ should be
the film's highlight, but instead, no thanks to nonsupple scripting
and the supporting cast's oblivious obviousness, it feels flat and
schematic.
</P>
<P>
   Skerritt plays his role with a stoicism that borders on dull
fatalism, as if he's collapsed Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages
of death down to the final signpost _ acceptance. Despite the fact
that director Rod Hardy apes Zinnemann's conceit of letting the
action play out in real time, Skerritt's turn understates the
menace too much _ he's obviously working off the knowledge of too
many crass hero-against-the-odds movies. If he's channeling the
sublime cool of Clint Eastwood (who also cribbed from ``High
Noon,'' to greater effect, in ``The Outlaw Josie Wales''), he's
also draining the film of its urgency.
</P>
<P>
   The final showdown is nonetheless effective, though Michael
Madsen, playing too handily off his icily homicidal cinematic
persona, is still woefully underused as Kane's would-be killer.
Thompson, too, could have been given a better stage _ her
performance seems to end as soon as she's done burning her gaze
into Will at their wedding _ as could Maria Conchita Alonso, who
plays Kane's embittered former lover. TBS's ``High Noon'' may seek
to reinvent the cliches of the Western, but ultimately, it only
rehashes them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Too many people are accusing the oil and gas industry
of greed, blaming oil companies for both the runup in the price of
gasoline, which has moderated since last spring, and for more
recent rises in home heating and energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the American oil industry is not the instigator of
higher prices. In the case of oil, producing nations including
those of the Middle East decided last spring to cut production to
force prices up, since some were having trouble meeting their
debts. Natural gas prices rose because of reduced supply as
American and Canadian companies, hurt by previously low prices, cut
back on drilling. As for gasoline prices, they had been depressed
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with American oil companies finally making a
profit? A year ago, pitting oil against the rest of American
industry in a contest of earnings was like putting a weekend duffer
against Tiger Woods. Indeed, for two decades, it has been a rarity
for analysts to recommend oil stocks as a top pick for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Now oil prices have increased by 100 percent since last year. In
the first quarter of 1999, crude oil was $11.50 a barrel; now oil
producers receive $30 a barrel. Virtually all of this additional
price per barrel can go to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost of producing the oil is between $7 and $12 per
barrel, which it is for the majority of oil companies, any amount
they receive above that figure is potential profit. When they get
$30 a barrel, close to $20 of this might become pretax operating
income. But this does not mean that in the long term, oil
companies' bottom lines are being fattened inordinately.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of 1999, most oil companies had only a small
net income. Many, with high costs or debt, had net losses. From
1977 through 1999, net income in the oil industry was equal to only
9.7 percent of net investment, as opposed to 11.5 percent for all
of American industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take a more recent snapshot. From 1994 through 1998, oil company
profits averaged 7.2 percent, or about half of the 14.2 percent
average for all the companies on the Standard &AMP; Poor's list of 500
industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was little better in the first quarter of this year,
when oil companies' profit margin was 5.9 percent, compared with
7.3 percent for all industries. And in some lucky businesses _
banks, publishing, broadcasting and electronics _ profits were 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of 2000, however, as the rising price of
crude oil had its effect, most oil companies had large profit
increases over the same months a year earlier. Exxon Mobil, Chevron
and BP Amoco all reported profit increases of well over 100
percent. But these and all oil companies had a long way to come
from what was, for them, starvation a year ago. And rises like this
won't continue.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts of the oil industry expect that over the next couple of
years, profits should level out on a plateau compatible with
earnings for the rest of the companies in the S&AMP;P 500. But it will
be the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that will
really determine what happens, because OPEC has considerable power
over the price of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, as current sources of oil run dry, energy
companies will have to spend increasing amounts drilling and
developing in deeper and more hazardous regions. They will also
have to commit huge sums to develop synthetics and find new sources
of natural gas. Of course, all of this will make it more difficult
for oil companies to maintain a healthy bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the future bodes well for oil and gas companies,
compared with their dismal recent past. And it is high time for
them to enjoy good returns along with most other American
industries.

   LOS ANGELES _ And what, you may ask, have we learned from the
Democratic convention?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it appears the Kennedy magic has fizzled. Ted Kennedy, one
of the few surviving politicians to whom the word ``bellowing'' is
relevant, has become a commodity best reserved for off-screen
appearances. Seeing Caroline was nice, but the next-generation gene
pool seems to be getting shallow.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats did not feel compelled to
keep their congressional delegation locked up. In fact, if you are
represented by a Democratic member of the House who was not on
television sometime during this week's activities, he or she either
has a very safe district or a party scheduled for the Playboy
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the convention was all about Al Gore, and
a lot like a birthday party being thrown by an anxious family for a
kid who isn't particularly popular. The parents keep inserting
themselves into the action, joshing nervously and trying to create
the impression that all the fun is emanating from the rather
lumpish guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
   This was a convention in which the presidential nominating
speech focused on a story about how, at Harvard, Gore once roasted
a turkey in the dorm fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched `Star Trek' when maybe we should have been
studying,'' Tommy Lee Jones assured the nation. The actor, who was
Gore's roommate at Harvard, was part of a cast of thousands who
marched onstage to hammer home the idea that the vice president is
actually the life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The curse of Al Gore's life is that he appears insincere, even
when his heart is totally in it. We keep trying to find reasons for
this in his upbringing, or his ambition, but perhaps the bottom
line is that what we've got here is a perfectly OK person who's
been cursed by fate with a phony-looking smile and a tin ear that
flattens out his speech.
</P>
<P>
   His vice-presidential candidate, on the other hand, is blessed
with a voice that sounds imposing even when he's saying nothing
whatsoever. Lieberman's address was beyond bland, if you read it,
except for the spots where he fell into line for the benefit of the
party's left wing. (Scan the text, and it would read
yawn-yawn-pander-pander.) But he was so happy to be there, and the
convention was so happy to be nominating him, that the mood of the
moment buoyed everything.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the convention also saw a 13-minute video about
Gore's lighter side that was directed by Spike Jonze, of ``Being
John Malkovich'' fame. Try to catch it if you get a chance _ this
may be your only opportunity to see the candidate body-surfing,
showing off the gas masks the security guys make him carry in the
car, and cheerfully pointing out a nude self-portrait of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   It does make Gore seem like a guy who's fun to be around, but
you can't help noticing the amount of heavy lifting Tipper and the
girls have to do to get him there. The vice president is good at
playing the straight man, protesting mildly while his children make
fun of the way he overmanages the family TV viewing. (When a video
is on, Gore apparently stops the action whenever anybody leaves the
room, and rewinds back to the FBI warning when the lost sheep
returns.) However, the real message you get is that it might be
amusing to hang out with Karenna.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore does have a sense of humor, but it's very dry.
This year the Democratic ticket is carrying around a whole lot of
wit that's on the arid side. If the American public ever puts out a
call for irony, these guys are ready.
</P>
<P>
   The public's Gore-aversion may be nothing more than a sense that
the current team in the White House is like a TV series that's run
its course. Even ``M-A-S-H'' got canceled eventually. ``Home
Improvement'' ran out of steam after eight years, and the people on
that were a lot easier to have around than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of the last four days was to prepare the
American mind for the spinoff, to make people realize that Bill
Clinton may be ``Happy Days'' in its final season, but Al Gore is
the first episode of ``Joanie Loves Chachie.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not exactly.

SCIENTISTS ADVANCE IN QUEST TO MAKE ELECTRONICS TINIER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chemists at the University of California at Los Angeles are
reporting another advance in the effort to produce electronic
circuitry on a molecular scale.
</P>
<P>
   In an article being published Friday in the journal Science, the
UCLA team says it has succeeded in using a molecule to create an
electronic switch that can be reconfigured _ that is, it can be
turned on and off, and on again _ like a transistor.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research had produced molecular switches that could
change their state only once _ on to off, or vice versa _ or could
operate only for a limited time or at very low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The latest achievement is a significant step toward building a
new generation of memory devices and computers that are far more
powerful and consume less power than today's microelectronic
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The advance is part of a quest for electronic circuits that are
perhaps one-thousandth the size of today's transistors, which are
made lithographically, by etching circuits on silicon with light.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, arrays of billions of circuits would
self-assemble by means of chemical reactions, which would make
individual circuits far less costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely excited about this,'' said James Ellenbogen, a
scientist for the Mitre Corp., a government-financed research
organization, and an expert in the developing field of molecular
electronics. ``It takes your breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of molecular-electronics efforts are going on around the
country, including projects at major computer manufacturers like
IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola. And earlier this year, the
Clinton administration undertook an ambitious program to spend
almost $500 million a year on research in the area, known as
nanotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the UCLA group, working with computer architects
and chemists at Hewlett-Packard, reported that it had developed a
nonreversible switch based on a molecule known as rotaxane.
</P>
<P>
   The university chemists, led by James Heath and J. Fraser
Stoddart, then began searching for a new class of molecule that
could switch back and forth _ or on and off _ from one state to
another when a small voltage was applied.
</P>
<P>
   They found what they were looking for in catenanes, a type of
organic molecule composed of two interlocking rings, Heath said.
The group has benefited from the work of Stoddart, who over several
decades has developed an international reputation for creating
unique molecules with unusual properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last fall we began looking at what Fraser had on his shelf,''
Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   The catenanes consist of two tiny mechanically interlocked rings
created from atoms linked in a circle. The group discovered that
one ring can be stimulated to move between two different states _
for instance, from one angle to another _ with respect to the other
ring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was particularly intrigued by the molecules because
they can be stimulated by either electricity or light, suggesting
the possibility of optical computing machines as well as electronic
ones, he said. Moreover, the resulting switches can operate at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   A major challenge is to figure out how to address the individual
molecular switches, Ellenbogen said. So far, the research of the
UCLA. scientists and of a similar group of researchers at Yale and
Rice universities has created molecules that can be switched on and
off only in unison.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale-Rice team and a group at Harvard also reported creating
reversible molecular switches within the last year, but they
operated under more limited conditions.

WOODSTOCK-SYNAGOGUE.) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, Vt. _ Route 4, a rural highway that twists across
Vermont's midsection, passes the sort of roadside signs one would
expect in northern New England. Maple syrup, they advertise.
Cheddar cheese. Bed and breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   And then outside a 150-year-old farmhouse is the sign adorned
with a Star of David, announcing the presence of Congregation Shir
Shalom.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected? Perhaps, but also very much a sign of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Jews haven't realized the extent to which Jews have moved
to the country,'' said Stuart M. Matlins, founder of the synagogue
along with his wife, Antoinette.
</P>
<P>
   Matlins, a New York native, management consultant and, more
recently, a publisher, said that every-other-Friday services this
summer had been drawing 50 to 60 people. On the High Holy Days last
year, he added, 200 came to services.
</P>
<P>
   America's Jewish population, about 6 million, has changed little
in total number in recent years, but it is not immune from the
restless impulses that make the United States a transient society.
</P>
<P>
   In disparate places, Jewish communities are growing _ and as
they do, new synagogues are appearing in towns from Woodstock in
the Green Mountains to Ketchum, Idaho, and Park City, Utah, in the
Rockies, where such institutions have been rare, if they existed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening, said Samuel C. Heilman, professor of Jewish
studies and sociology at City University of New York, is part of a
trend, ``a radiating Jewish community,'' he calls it, whose members
have been moving from once-solidly Jewish neighborhoods to the
suburbs and, for some, to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have here is Jews who are so much a part of America
now,'' Heilman said, ``they no longer feel constrained to live
among Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 edition of the American Jewish Yearbook, published by
the American Jewish Committee, shows that Jewish populations have
been growing in such widely scattered locales as Portland, Ore.;
Tampa, Fla.; Charleston, S.C.; and Portsmouth, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish population is also increasing in Vermont. By the
yearbook's count, about 5,700 Jews live there _ only 1 percent of
the state's population but double the number of Jews there two
decades ago. Congregation Shir Shalom, also known as the Woodstock
Area Jewish Community, belongs to Judaism's liberal Reform
movement. The newer, small-town synagogues tend to be non-Orthodox,
partly because the challenges of living an Orthodox lifestyle _
requiring kosher food and walking to services _ are difficult in
places where Jewish resources are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock synagogue began a dozen years ago with services in
Matlins' office, at the company he founded, Jewish Lights
Publishing. The company publishes books on Jewish spirituality and
life, and, through a sister imprint, on topics related to religious
experience more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the congregation grew, with new residents
(mainly young families and retirees), along with people who had
weekend homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to live in a rural area and have a Jewish life,''
said Matlins, 60, who serves on the board of Hebrew Union College,
which trains men and women as Reform rabbis, cantors and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, the group reached a sufficiently critical mass to
buy the farmhouse, both for its services and its Hebrew school.
Local Protestant, Roman Catholic and Unitarian-Universalist clergy
attended the dedication. The congregation also affiliated with the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Reform movement's
synagogue organization.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, another small-town temple, in Great
Barrington, Mass., joined the union. Lately, officials say, such
additions to the ranks are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're emerging in very interesting areas,'' said Rabbi
Daniel Freelander, the union's director of program, citing
synagogues in places like Bainbridge Island, Wash.; Hickory, N.C.;
and Keene, N.H.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many, like the one in Woodstock, are too small to afford a
full-time rabbi and rely on student rabbis who come once or twice a
month. They also depend on volunteers to keep them running.
</P>
<P>
   In Woodstock, that category includes Bob and Muriel Steinberg,
who retired from their jobs in West Hartford, Conn., four years
ago. After they began attending the synagogue as full-time Vermont
residents, Steinberg said, ``It just hit me, there was something to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, he said, ``has the people skills, I have the
organizational skills.'' They now serve as its co-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue's roadside sign helps attract people, Steinberg
said. One day last summer, her husband was standing outside when
two young women pulled up and asked about services. He invited them
to attend that evening, which they did. ``As it turned out,''
Steinberg said, ``one was from Brazil, one was from Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the sanctuary exudes a feeling of intimacy, befitting a
space that once served as a living room. Three Shaker-style
benches, arranged on a wooden floor, face an ark whose hand-carved
cover depicts the tree of life. ``We can get 50 to 60 people in
here,'' Matlins said. Upstairs, what had been bedrooms have been
turned into classrooms and meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby stands an old barn, built of rough-hewn logs. The
congregation is mulling whether to convert it to a new sanctuary to
accommodate more people.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the sanctuary, with Mount Tom as his backdrop, Matlins
was moved to reflect on Judaism's traditions in light of the
faith's earliest history. In such a place as Woodstock, he said, an
event like the festival of Tabernacles _ in which Jews set up
sukkahs, or booths, as reminders of the Israelites' sojourn in the
wilderness _ has a resonance lacking in more urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism,'' he said, ``was a religion of people who did not
live in cities.''

MEXICAN-U.S. TALKS ON SUGAR TRADE BREAK DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FINEREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A protracted dispute over sugar trade between
Mexico and the United States escalated Thursday when the Mexicans
rejected a U.S. proposal and requested a special arbitration
hearing under a provision of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. side, clearly angered about a breakdown in talks,
called the Mexican request inappropriate. The American Sugar
Alliance, a coalition of U.S. sugar producers, said it was shocked
and disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials argue that NAFTA Allows them to export up to
575,000 tons a year of their excess sugar to the United States
beginning Oct. 1. The United States maintains that NAFTA allows for
only 110,000 to 120,000 tons. Neither side seems prepared to back
down on its interpretation of the regulations governing sugar trade
under NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Frazier, a U.S. trade representative negotiator for
agriculture, expressed surprise at the Mexican action. ``I didn't
think it would come to this,'' Frazier said. ``I thought we would
keep the negotiations going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials rejected the latest U.S. proposal after
meeting with Mexican sugar industry representatives. ``We decided
that the proposal on the table does not satisfy Mexico's needs, and
for that reason we have decided to take the issue to a NAFTA
panel,'' said Mexico's deputy trade minister, Luis de la Calle.
</P>
<P>
   Producers north of the border say that submitting to Mexico's
demands and allowing more sugar into the U.S. market would be a
serious blow to their business. They argue that sugar prices are
already depressed and that the additional Mexican sugar will only
make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teaspoonful more of sugar in this country would decimate the
United States industry,'' said Charlie Melancon, president of the
American Sugar Cane League in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican producers counter that one of the main reasons they have
so much excess sugar is that the United States is exporting
increasingly large volumes of corn syrup to Mexico _ a practice
that Mexico says is hurting the Mexican sugar industry. Indeed,
many of Mexico's largest sugar companies are near bankruptcy,
partly as a result of a deluge of corn-syrup imports over the last
decade.

   MANCHEVSKI-FILM (Stavica, Macedonia) _ Hemmed in by Kosovo to
the north, Greece to the south, Albania to the west and Bulgaria to
the east, and lacking any outlet to the sea, Macedonia swelters in
the sun. It is late July, a few miles from the Greek border;
nothing moves; tobacco crops wilt in the fields. Behind a Byzantine
church, men, their shirts caked in blood, are draped on the bald
mountainside. Shots ring out. Milcho Manchevski, the Macedonian
director of the acclaimed, Oscar-nominated film, ``Before the

   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-FILM (Undated) _ ``The whole world is watching!''
was chanted during the Republican Convention this month. Many of
those chanting had not yet been born in 1968, when that cry first
sounded on the streets of Chicago, as the police clubbed protesters
in town for the tumultuous Democratic convention. The scene was yet
another tribute to the enduring power of the '60s in the national
imagination. So is ``Steal This Movie,'' which opens Aug. 18,
Robert Greenwald's biographical movie about Abbie Hoffman,
charismatic exemplar of '60s cultural radicalism, a defendant in
the conspiracy trial of the Chicago Seven, the leaders of the
Chicago protest, and the author of ``Steal This Book,'' among other

   JANSSEN-FILM (Undated) _ Famke Janssen, like a rollercoaster,
tall and steeply curved, is having herself a thrill ride of a

Professor X, Janssen was part of the team that not only arrested
the vengeful Magneto's quest for world domination in ``X-Men'' but
has also raked in a superheroic $144 million at the box office in

   SHAKESPEARE-BERKSHIRES (Lenox, Mass.) _ In ``Henry V,''
Shakespeare asked the patrons to use their imaginations and
``Suppose within the girdle of these walls/Are now confin'd two
mighty monarchies.'' Tina Packer, the ebullient director of
Shakespeare &AMP; Company, is making an equally audacious request of
her audiences here in Western Massachusetts: to envision an exact
replica of an Elizabethan playhouse nestled among the rolling
Berkshire hills at the company's new home. Soon, after its wrangles
over use of the nearby Edith Wharton estate _ Shakespeare &AMP; Company
will be ensconced on 63 acres in Lenox, near Tanglewood. Given
Packer's drive and the plans already in motion, a replica of the
Rose Theater, which once stood in London in Shakespeare's time, is
likely to be the core of what Packer hopes will be a major center
for Shakespearean performance, teaching and scholarship in this
country. By Iris Fanger.

   OKAMOTO-ART-MUSEUM (Tokyo) _ On the Japanese art scene, the
baburu (economic bubble) burst long ago. Today, the friends and
contacts a Western visitor encounters here are sure to recollect,
with incredulity and undisguised embarrassment, the heady days of
the 1980s, when Japanese corporations spent tens of millions of
dollars on Impressionist paintings at overseas auctions, and when
new museums seemed to pop up every month. Nevertheless, against a
backdrop of lingering art-world doldrums, the Taro Okamoto Museum
opened late last year in Kawasaki, not far to the southwest of

positioning themselves as guardians of what George W. Bush, in his

   MESSIAEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ This is very much Messiaen's year _
as most years now tend to be. Barely was there time to draw breath
after the Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from

four big pieces in quick succession. And now comes a thoroughly

HORNADAY TO STAY WITH EARNHARDT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; NASCAR Busch Grand National Division driver Ron Hornaday Jr. is
close to signing a two-year contract extension with Dale Earnhardt,
Inc., in a deal that would keep him on the Busch circuit until
2002, according to a team source.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, a former Saugus Speedway, Winston West and Craftsman
Truck Series champ, has won two of the last three Busch Series
races and has been a contender for rookie-of-the-year honors. He
trails Kevin Harvick of Bakersfield in the rookie points race.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday is coming off a 15th-place showing in the NASCAR
Winston Cup Global Crossing at the Glen on Sunday. Hornaday was
subbing in for the injured Terry Labonte in the No. 5 Kellogg's
Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Hornaday returns to the Busch Series for his
NAPA Auto Parts team this weekend in Saturday's NAPAONLINE.com 250
at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday won the Kroger 200 at Indianapolis Raceway Park on Aug.
4 and the NAPA Autocare 250 at Pike's Peak International Raceway in
Colorado on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   The DEI team source said Hornaday is expected to sign the
extension mext week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Godde eyes SCORE Off-Road title: After finishing second in
his class in the SCORE Primm 300 on July 29, Ty Godde of Lancaster
has a chance to win the SCORE Lites season title.
</P>
<P>
   With one race to go, Godde is in a dead heat with Jerry Penhall
of Costa Mesa, the two-time reigning champion in the SCORE Lites
class, an unlimited buggy division. A SCORE official said that
updated standings would not be available until Monday but that
Godde and Penhall are most likely tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made up a lot of points,'' said Godde, a graduate of
Paraclete High. ``And considering (Penhall) has been the champ the
last two years, it makes it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Godde, 30, and his driving partner, Jim Greenway of Ojai,
finished two seconds behind the race winner, Tom Ridings of Long
Beach, in the Primm 300 and he considers themselves lucky to have
been that close in the race.
</P>
<P>
   During lap two, Godde's buggy had a flat front tire. After
fixing the flat, Godde ended up flipping the buggy out of a
150-foot ditch during the third lap and rolling before landing
upright and continuing in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from almost wrecking to landing on all four wheels and
finishing the race,'' Godde said.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth and final race on the SCORE series is the Baja 2,000
in October.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kanke, Purlsey so close: M.K. Kanke of Frazier Park and Greg
Pursley of Newhall combined to lead for 114 laps of the NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Series Sandia 125, but it was Auggie Vidovich
of Lakeside who led for the last 11 to win race in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 laps to go in the race, Kanke, who was leading, got
tangled with Matt Crafton of Tulare down the main stretch on the
0.4-mile oval. Kanke spun and lost his lead. Vidovich took over and
held on for his second win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of expected it,'' Vidovich said of the Kanke-Crafton
incident. ``All I did was go high. I thought I was going to get
collected.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanke, a Kennedy High graduate, won the Gatorade Frontrunner
Award for leading the most laps, 73. Pursley led the first 40.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke ended up third, Pursley fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke is now sixth in the Southwest Series standings. Pursley is
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Woodside of Saugus, who is fourth in points, finished 19th
in the Sandia 125. He left in lap 94 with engine trouble. Frank
Maronski Jr. of Quartz Hill, ninth in points, finished eighth.
Keith Spangler of Chatsworth was ninth and Bob Lyon of Agua Dulce
finished 21st.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Southwest Series is Saturday at Colorado
National Speedway in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   __ Winston West returns to Irwindale: The NASCAR Winston West
Series makes its second stop of the season at Irwindale Speedway on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first race on June 24, Bobby Dotter of Charlotte, N.C.,
held off series points leader Brendan Gaughan of Las Vegas for his
second win of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Former Winston West champ Bill Sedgwick of Acton, who is chasing
his first win of the 2000 season, is expected to drive in the
Irwindale Speedway race.

GORE VOWS FIGHT AGAINST COMPLACENCY, SAYS HE'S `NOT SATISFIED' &HT;    (For use by clients of New York Times News Service)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL and
 &HT;    CHARLES J. LEWIS+
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES Al Gore, capping a 24-year career in politics with
the Democratic presidential nomination, tried to steal Republican
George W. Bush's campaign thunder Thursday night by insisting that
the Democratic successors to President Clinton are ``not
satisfied'' with mere prosperity and will now lead the nation ``on
a new journey to the best America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, seeking to stake out a political persona apart from
Clinton, delighted cheering Democratic delegates with his firm
declaration that after almost eight years as Clinton's loyal vice
president, ``I stand here tonight as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee for president used his acceptance speech
to lay out policy proposals and relate personal anecdotes about his
life _ and deliver the campaign message that the nation's wealth
must be expanded to reach all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was eager to build upon the nation's prosperity _
symbolized by expanding federal budget surpluses, the lowest
inflation rate in a generation and 22 million new jobs since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families,'' Gore said. ``And for all
our good times, I am not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, hoping to draw a contrast with Bush's generalizations,
insisted that voters ``deserve to know specifically what a
candidate proposes to do.'' Gore called for tax cuts for working
families, health insurance for all children by 2004, expanded
child-care opportunities, reductions in the estate tax and ending
the so-called ``marriage penalty'' that requires married couples to
pay more federal taxes than they would if they filed separate
returns as single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Gore said, he would be ``fighting for all the
people not just the people of one state or one district; not just
the wealthy or powerful all the people,'' according to excerpts of
his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke as Clinton's legal travails again leaped into the
spotlight, with the disclosure in Washington that special
prosecutor Robert Ray is weighing whether to indict Clinton for
obstruction of justice and perjury in connection with the cover-up
of his sexual dalliance with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ray impaneled a federal grand jury on July 11 to hear evidence
in the episode that led to Clinton's impeachment by the House and
acquittal by the Senate, legal sources told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, trying to stand apart from Clinton, said he wanted America
to ``know me for who I truly am.'' He recounted his biography and
his practice of meeting ordinary people on a regular basis back in
Tennessee when he was in the House and Senate. He vowed to continue
the practice if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was nominated on Wednesday night by his eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, emphasized that he has ``strong
values the love of my family, my faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also tried to co-opt Bush's campaign theme of national
renewal and a restoration of morality, telling his audience that
America ``must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not
enough meaning.'' Just a few miles from the heart of America's
multibillion-dollar entertainment industry in Hollywood, Gore also
promised to ``give more power back to parents'' to protect children
from entertainment that ``glorifies violence and indecency.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president paid homage to Los Angeles, the city where
the American westward migration ended and where John F. Kennedy
declared the New Frontier in his 1960 convention address. ``Let us
set out a new journey to the best America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Harvard-educated son of a U.S. senator, repeatedly
allied himself with ``working families,'' vowing to stand by their
side against ``powerful forces and powerful interests (that) stand
in your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``I want you to know this: I've taken on the
powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll
stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   National polls show Gore trailing Bush by as much as 10
percentage points. But a Harris poll released Wednesday showed Gore
getting a ``bounce'' as the Democratic convention began, enabling
him to edge ahead of Bush for the first time since the GOP
convention two weeks ago. The survey showed Gore leading Bush, 43
percent to 42 percent, with 6 percent favoring Green party
candidate Ralph Nader and 5 percent favoring disputed Reform party
candidate Pat Buchanan. The survey had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the final night of the four-day Democratic National
Convention traced Gore's life from his roots in Carthage, Tenn., as
the son of a U.S. senator to his education at Harvard, his
volunteer Army service in Vietnam and his early career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the 51-year-old wife of the nominee and an
experienced amateur photographer, introduced her husband for his
acceptance speech with a series of photos she has taken over the
years. ``Faith and family are at the center of Al's life,'' Mrs.
Gore said, adding: ``Al has always been there for our family and he
will always be there for yours.''.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore spent nearly two months crafting his address,
the most important political address of his 24 years in national
politics as a member of the House, the Senate and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was literally the person at the typewriter on this,''
explained Tad Devine, a senior Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, the
58-year-old senator from Connecticut, planned a four-day 400-mile
boat trip down the Mississippi River starting Friday. The journey
aboard the Mark Twain river boat would take them past the
battleground states of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky and
Missouri. Bush plans a post-convention raid on Gore's native
Tennessee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Gore's address, the Bush campaign announced in
Austin, Texas, that the second-term Texas governor and GOP running
mate Dick Cheney would seek to negotiate a total of five campaign
debates this fall with Gore and Lieberman. Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes said Bush hoped to stage three debates with Gore and Cheney
hoped to reach agreement on two debates with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's agreement to take part in three debates appeared designed
in part to underscore the Texan's confidence that he has the policy
detail and temperament to match Gore's mastery of the campaign
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane responded to the announcement by
saying Gore ``has been ready to debate for months. Their new-found
readiness to debate shows this campaign is tightening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington, Ray's office neither confirmed nor denied that
the legal deliberations could lead to an indictment of Clinton
after he leaves office on Jan. 20. Ray emphasized in an ABC News'
interview in March when he succeeded special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr that he would determine ``whether crimes have been committed
and whether ... it is appropriate to bring charges'' against the
president after he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert condemned the inopportune
revelation, saying: ``The timing of this leak reeks to high
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of potential federal legal action against a high
ranking official at a sensitive moment in the election year
recalled the indictment of former Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger by special prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh four days before
the 1992 election. Aides to then-President George Bush blamed the
indictment for contributing to the Republican's loss to Clinton
that November.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, a federal judge threw out the one-count
indictment against Weinberger in connection with a six-year inquiry
into Reagan administration arms sales to Iran and the secret
diversion of some of the profits from the sales to provide arms to
anti-Marxist guerrillas battling the regime in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign criticized the disclosure Thursday, with the
Bush spokeswoman saying: ``We think the timing is wrong,'' adding:
``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made on
the day that the vice president is going to accept the Democratic
nomination. This election is not about the past, it's about the
future.''

CINEMAX NOS AYUDA RECORDAR A LA PRINCESA Y SU FABULOSO VESTUARIO
</HEADLINE>
  Con fotografias de algunos de los vestidos de la Princesa Diana 
 Por IVOR DAVIS 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cuando la Princesa Diana se presento en la casa de subastas
Christie de Nueva York, en junio de 1997, el establishment quedo
electrizado. Setenta y nueve de sus trajes de noche y de vestidos
de dia fueron rematadas, a fin de que el dinero fuera destinado a
sus obras favoritas de caridad.
 &HT;    Dos meses mas tarde estaba muerta y los nuevos propietarios de
sus ropas descubrieron que poseian no solo algo bello, sino tambien
algo de significado historico.
 &HT;    Para conmemorar el tercer aniversario de la muerte de Diana en
un accidente automovilistico (ocurrido el 31 de agosto de 1997), el
canal de cable Cinemax propalara el 25 de septiembre un documental
titulado ``Princess Diana's Dresses'' (los vestidos de la Princesa
Diana). En la pelicula se entrevista a las personas que
participaron en la subasta, y sus motivos para comprar las
vestimentas.
 &HT;    Algunas de esas personas simplemente querian poseer algo de una
mujer a la que idolatraban. Y, para ello, estaban preparadas para
pagar hasta 200,000 dolares por vestimentas usadas. Otras las
compraron porque consideraron que eran buenas inversiones, o con el
proposito de recaudar fondos para otras obras de caridad.
 &HT;    Para Graeme Mackenzie, de Gourock, Escocia, la intencion era
ayudar a una organizacion caritativa en particular. Para ello
compro un sensacional vestido de coctel de seda negra por 65,000
dolares.
 &HT;    ``Todo el mundo esta interesado en esa vestimenta,'' dice
Mackenzie. ``Diana la lucio al inaugurar una galeria en Londres la
misma noche en que el Principe Carlos admitio en television que
habia cometido adulterio con Camilla Parker Bowles.''
 &HT;    A su vez, la disenadora Christina Stambolian senala, ``Ella
estuvo dos anos sin vestir esa prenda. Me senti muy decepcionada.
Pero luego adverti que estaba aguardando para lucirla en la ocasion
adecuada. Ella parecia un bello pajaro negro con ese vestido.''
 &HT;    Mackenzie dice que preserva la prenda en una caja de seguridad
de un banco y solo la exhibe cuando realiza recaudacion de fondos
para obras de caridad en Escocia.
 &HT;    En Estados Unidos, Fontaine Minor, esposa de un acaudalado
empresario de Richmond, Virginia, gasto 25,000 dolares _ una ganga,
dice ella _ para adquirir un traje de noche blanco bordado en plata
y oro, que Elizabeth y David Emanuel hicieron expresamente para
Diana. La princesa lucio el traje durante el estreno de una
pelicula de James Bond.
 &HT;    Minor dice que donde va el vestido ``esta siempre acompanado por
un guardaespaldas.''
 &HT;    Para ella, es como ``poseer una pequena parte de la realeza. Y
puedo decir con honestidad que aparte de mi casamiento y de mis
hijos, comprar ese vestido ha sido uno de los acontecimientos mas
emocionantes de mi vida.''
 &HT;    Minor dice que no puede creer ``que ese vestido me pertenezca.
En realidad, pienso que solo un uno por ciento es mio. El resto
todavia atane a la Princesa Diana.''
 &HT;    Tambien esta el famoso traje largo que Diana lucio cuando bailo
en la Casa Blanca con John Travolta. Maureen Rorech, de Tampa,
Florida, lo compro por 200,000 dolares. Tambien adquirio otros 12
de los vestidos de Diana. Con ellos realiza giras por Estados
Unidos, tambien para recaudar fondos destinados a organizaciones de
caridad.
 &HT;    ``Compre esas ropas porque permiten tener una mejor idea de la
evolucion del estilo de la princesa a traves de los anos,'' dice.
 &HT;    En otros casos, los motivos para comprar las ropas de la
princesa han sido comerciales.
 &HT;    Kate McEnroe, presidenta del canal de cable ``Romance
Classics,'' compro tres vestidos para usarlos como promocion en una
gira. En medio de esa gira, Diana murio.
 &HT;    ``Ese mismo dia suspendimos la gira,'' dice McEnroe. ``Mas
adelante la reanudamos, bajo el titulo de `Un legado de amor.'''
 &HT;    Barbara Jordan, duena de una boutique en Boston, dice que uso
parte del dinero obtenido de su divorcio para comprar varios
vestidos de Diana. Eso le sirvio para apuntalar su moral y para su
nuevo negocio.
 &HT;    ``Creo que ambas tenemos mucho en comun,'' dice Jordan. ``Yo
mido 1,80 metros, y Diana 1,78. Las dos hemos tenido dos hijos, y
nuestros matrimonios quedaron destruidos.''
 &HT;    Jordan pago mas de 100,000 dolares por tres de los vestidos de
noche y dice que cuando Diana murio, los exhibio en su negocio.
``El sitio quedo convertido en un santuario,'' senala. ``Personas
de todas partes llegaron al sitio para depositar flores y mensajes
frente a la vitrina.''
 &HT;    Posteriormente, Jordan dono los vestidos a varias organizaciones
de caridad.
 &HT;    Marilyn Hoffman, que se dedica a la cria de caballos en
Virginia, compro un vestido azul con botones de diamante por 30,000
dolares. ``Cuando Diana murio,'' dice, ``mi hija se puso el vestido
para presentar premios en una exhibicion equina. Leimos un tributo
a Diana en el curso del evento y el silencio fue total. Varios
hombres no pudieron reprimir las lagrimas.''
 &HT;    La profesora de Los Angeles Linda Sarna, cuya vivienda esta
repleta de recuerdos de Diana y de miniaturas de sus ropas, junto
todos sus ahorros y los de su hermana Roberta Hurtig para comprar
un vestido de la princesa valuado en 20,000 dolares.
 &HT;    El vestido de estilo clasico y bordado con abalorios fue
conocido como ```el vestido escarlata'' que Diana lucio en un viaje
a Arabia Saudita. Fue hecho para la princesa por Bruce Oldfield, y
es ahora la pieza central de la coleccion de Sarna.
 &HT;    Por cierto, algunas de las ropas de Diana se han convertido casi
en reliquias.
 &HT;    Dice el guionista y director de la pelicula, Christopher Sykes,
``Cada vez que sus ropas son puestas en exhibicion, la gente hace
cola para verlas, para examinarlas, y para preguntarse sobre la
vida y la tragica muerte de la mujer que las lucia.''

 &HT;    Kids must avoid `triangle' of TV, fridge, computer
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Potato chips, popcorn, pudding cups,
chocolate cereals: There are cartloads of snack foods aimed at kids
out there, but it's a heavy load, nutritionists say.
</P>
<P>
   Fat- and sugar-laden snack and fast foods crowd the grocery
aisles. They tempt kids and time-stressed parents alike.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Morgan says her two teenage boys are fairly typical of
today's kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They snack on popcorn, fruit roll-ups and a bowl of cereal,''
she said. ``They do like fresh berries, but with sugar or whipped
cream on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick snacks often put convenience above nutrition. A fruit cup
with a peel-off lid is a lot simpler than washing, peeling and
cutting up fresh fruits. Opening a bag of cookies is easier than
baking a batch of low-fat muffins.
</P>
<P>
   But the unhealthful foods are contributing to what a recent
Newsweek story labels Generation XXL _ kids who tip the scales and
are off the weight charts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet weren't there always chips, and peanut butter and cookies in
the house after school? And haven't kids always snacked?
</P>
<P>
   What's happened, then, to make the normal ``kid food'' a dietary
pitfall?
</P>
<P>
   Foods are only part of a bigger problem, the experts say. TV,
computers and crime are partly to blame, according to doctors who
are watching the next generation develop health problems related to
weight at frighteningly early ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the kids are much less active than before. They get no
exercise; they have TVs and computers and sit inside with them
rather than going outside to play. Crime plays a role, too, making
parents afraid to let their kids go outdoors,'' said Dr. Renato
Dubois, a West Palm Beach pediatric cardiologist. Dubois is seeing
a jump in health problems related to weight gain. Hypertension and
diabetes are typical adult diseases that now affect numerous
children.
</P>
<P>
   Diet and exercise are the focus of those trying to help young
patients.
</P>
<P>
   A Louisiana doctor involved in a 12-year study on overweight
youngsters has developed a weight management program designed
specifically for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stewart Gordon, of Pennington Biomedical Research in Baton
Rouge, works on teaching families food choices and behaviors that
make for a lifetime of health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just hand them a diet and tell them to do this, that
and that. We have them work with a dietitian, and work one-on-one
with them to modify their eating and lifestyle behaviors,'' he
said. ``Sometimes there's an exercise program involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, chief of pediatrics at LSU Health Sciences Center, said
kids are bombarded with candy, pizza, sodas and fries at every
party and outdoors event.
</P>
<P>
   Certain behaviors, including the after-school home ``triangle''
_ the path between the TV, the fridge and the computer _ are traps
that catch kids up in eating mindlessly, he said. ``They sit in
front of the computer or TV, eating _ not even realizing they're
eating, in some cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cites a study that showed that when kids were given
incentives not to watch TV _ even with no change in diets or
mention of weight loss _ kids lost weight automatically.
</P>
<P>
   But giving up TV is tough. Support from parents or peers is
crucial for success. ``We give them goals, and praise them when
they're met,'' Gordon said. Those in the program are taught how to
say no to pizza at a friend's slumber party, or how to make a more
healthful choice when given options. ``For these kids, turning down
a teacher's reward of a candy bar or doing some exercise instead of
watching TV is a big step.
</P>
<P>
   Weight gain in any person is difficult to manage, Gordon said,
but in children, it's tricky on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   Parents especially need to understand the fragile self-esteem of
an overweight child. When parents criticize their weight, Gordon
said, it's easy for kids to feel they don't measure up. ``They feel
unloved,'' he said. ``They can't separate their weight from the
rest of the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Too much focus on weight can lead adolescents, especially girls,
to develop eating disorders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger children, even if slightly overweight, don't need to
worry as much as older children, whose adult weight will be
determined by their weight in preteen and early teen years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see patients from 5 to 19 years old,'' Gordon said. ``It's
the adolescent age where we really focus. If a child is obese at 10
to 13 years old, the chances are 70 to 80 percent they will carry
the obesity over to adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   The elementary school age is the prevention age, he said, but
parents should be aware that putting youngsters on a diet is
dangerous because they're still developing. Younger children always
should be under a doctor's care for weight problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can, however, buy foods that have more nutrition,
avoiding snack foods that tempt too much.
</P>
<P>
   They also can limit the number of hours spent indoors in front
of the TV or computer, and encourage outdoor activity _ maybe even
getting involved themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win situation,'' Gordon said. ``Parents feel
better, too, and are better role models for the kids.''

 &HT;    Food tips for weight conscious kids
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   Tips for feeding kids with weight concerns:
</P>
<P>
   _ Learn about and choose healthful foods for your child. Involve
kids in reading labels as soon as they can read.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eat dinner as a family as often as possible, in a room away
from the TV.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the family the focus of the meal _ not the food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Involve your child in food shopping, meal making and lunch-box
packing. They will eat what they prepare.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never criticize your child about his weight nor punish her for
weight gain. Be supportive, show concern about your child's health,
but show that your love isn't based on their appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set realistic goals for weight loss or control, and reward the
positive steps toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never use food as a punishment or reward. For good deeds, buy
a new book, rent a favorite movie or dismiss a chore instead.
</P>
<P>
   _ The appeal of many unhealthful snacks is their convenience.
Make good food easy to eat: cube low-fat cheeses, keep whole-grain
crackers in easy-open tins and cut up fresh fruits to keep in the
fridge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unplug the TV and computer often. Make physical activity part
of the routine. Make time for walks and bike rides; the whole
family will benefit.

THE RIGHT THING: WHEN THE BOSS IS A STEALTH BOMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20) 
 By JEFFREY SEGLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An anecdote in Kay Hammer's book, ``Workplace Warrior: Insights
and Advice for Winning on the Corporate Battlefield,'' brought me
up short. It seems that Hammer once had a boss who set up a secret
team of employees to develop a project that would replace work she
had been doing. She didn't find out until the stealth project was
presented as a fait accompli at a meeting of her entire division of
80 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' Hammer said in an interview. ``One of the
things I had to ask myself after that public humiliation was why
somebody would have so much animosity toward me that they would
need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer's story struck me, because I had once been involved in a
similar incident from the other side. I was the one asked by the
boss to develop a project in secret that might supersede someone
else's work.
</P>
<P>
   What should an ethical person think when asked to operate behind
a colleague's back?
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is perfectly reasonable for a boss to want to
explore new ideas and find innovative solutions to business
challenges, and to assign the work to whichever employee seems best
suited to the task. And it often makes perfect sense to hold
potentially disruptive experiments close to the vest until it is
clear that they will bear fruit. So keeping some co-workers in the
dark is not automatically unethical. It all depends on what the
boss is up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely, there are ways to negotiate an outcome that partakes
of the boss' desire for confidentiality but engages the support of
the employee,'' said Rushworth Kidder, president of the Institute
for Global Ethics in Camden, Maine ``But that will only happen if
the motive behind the boss' action was up front and straightforward
rather than deceptive or wily. Was the boss trying to get rid of
the employee, but simply lacked the courage to say so?''
</P>
<P>
   In highly politicized workplaces, discussions of such issues are
often avoided on purpose. Instead, innuendo rules under the guise
of ``an obvious necessity for secrecy'' or ``for the sake of the
good cause,'' said Laura Nash, an associate at the Center for the
Study of Values in Public Life at Harvard University. ``When this
is allowed, you create a business culture with upside-down
values,'' she said. ``There is a general sense that honesty about
underhanded tricks is more distasteful than the tricks
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   By insisting on secrecy, Nash said, ``people begin to portray
the deceived person as the enemy _ the dysfunctional one who
deserves to be blindsided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This little mental trick,'' she added, ``covers up their own
participation in the deception.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a sop to cowardice. Unethical bosses resort to this
kind of tactic, said Steven Berglas, a clinical psychologist who
teaches at the Anderson School of Management at UCLA, when they are
afraid to confront subordinates about problems with their work.
Instead, they scheme to achieve their ends indirectly, by pitting
employees against one another, often by quietly disparaging one to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, naturally, tend to put what the boss wants ahead of
the needs of fellow workers. That's what I did when my boss
approached me, though I didn't realize it until I took the plan to
another colleague for confidential feedback. My confidant's
response was unambiguous: The whole thing smacked of unfairness.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he felt free to respond that way because it was me, and
not our boss, who had told him about it. In any event, he
immediately saw ethical implications that I hadn't acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine is a great disinfectant,'' Nash said. ``When such
behavior is opened to scrutiny _ even in a confidential setting _
the stench becomes clear. If you can't develop a product internally
without cannibalizing your own team members, there is either
something wrong with your managing or something wrong with your
morals _ or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said in hindsight that had she been more attuned to the
kind of person the boss was, she might have seen the ploy coming
and gotten out earlier. ``If you think the boss is a total jerk and
he shouldn't be in this position, that's not productive,'' she
said. ``You're not going to fix him or thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Having learned the hard way, Hammer quit to start her own
business, Evolutionary Technologies International of Austin, Texas,
which sells software that helps dissimilar computers communicate
with one another.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped peddling my own secret proposal as soon as my
confidant expressed his discomfort, and the whole thing fizzled
out. But now, after reading Hammer's story, I have to find the
moral courage to call my old deceived colleague and apologize.

 &HT;    LIEBERMAN SPOTLIGHTS HIS JEWISH ROOTS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's one major difference between the
post-convention campaign tour that the newly minted Democratic
ticket will start Friday and the famous bus trip that Al Gore took
with Bill Clinton eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before sundown on Friday, Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, will leave the campaign behind him to
attend to sabbath services at a synagogue in Moline, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an observant Jew, will not resume his campaign
activities until after sundown Saturday, a practice he intends to
follow for the duration of the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While in Los Angeles, Lieberman lost few opportunities to
highlight his Jewish heritage, often noting that he is the first
member of his faith to seek national office on a major party
ticket. In appearances before successive sets of minority groups,
Lieberman invariably said his selection was important because
``once barriers fall for one group, the doors of opportunity open
wider for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go through my daily life I don't think about my
story,'' Lieberman said Thursday. He reflected on what has happened
to him in the 10 days since he joined the ticket in a brief
interview in his downtown hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Lieberman added, ``when you come to a moment like this,
you look back and you want to tell your story. And I must say when
I do it at this stage of my life it makes me even more fervently
grateful to America and more fervently patriotic.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator noted, as he had the night before in his prime-time
speech to the delegates, that both his parents were born poor and
did not attend college.
</P>
<P>
   ``They encouraged me to work hard and get a good education,'' he
said. ``I got it at Yale and that opened doors for me.'' At the
elite university, Lieberman became chairman of the Yale Daily News,
a highly coveted post.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time several decades earlier when very few Jews were
admitted to Yale, and none of them would even think of aspiring to
become editors of the campus newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman likes to stress that all that has now changed, and
that it is still changing for the better. If he and Gore prevail in
November, the opportunities for minority groups to move up the
economic and social ladder will be even greater still, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand when you rise this level that questions get
asked,'' he said, referring to his religious beliefs and how they
might impact public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I haven't been offended at all. ... There have been a few
statements that I think have been uninformed and that have shown
some bias. But from all the delegates here the questions have been
quite reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident that I haven't changed anything about
myself in the last 10 days. Sometimes there's been misinformation
out there. But it's been my nature to be open to new ideas. It's
also my nature to share my thought processes in public as I make up
my mind about issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I shouldn't do this,'' Lieberman mused.

BIDS NEAR $50 BILLION FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LICENSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ The most expensive auction in history ended
Thursday, when six companies bid nearly $50 billion for licenses to
offer a new generation of wireless communications in Germany, the
biggest country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The bids exceeded almost all expectations, and far exceeded the
$35.5 billion paid by many of the same companies for similar
``third-generation'' wireless licenses in Britain in April.
</P>
<P>
   The results have already sent a chill through financial markets,
as stock and bond investors fret not only about the billions the
bidders spent on licenses but the additional billions required for
building the new networks in a brutally competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   The results are something of a defeat for Europe's two biggest
wireless players _ Deutsche Telekom AG, the former German telephone
monopoly; and Vodafone Airtouch PLC, which owns Mannesmann
Mobilfunk and is a neck-and-neck rival with Telekom in the German
wireless market.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had been intent on capturing enough licenses to
limit the number of new rivals. But despite pushing up the bids by
about $15 billion since Monday morning, they failed to knock out
smaller players.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Thursday's successful bidders will pay $15 billion
more than they would have paid if the bidding had stopped last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For consumers, the result promises the most intense
competition,'' said Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of Germany's
telecommunications regulatory agency and the auction's architect.
``This was the most favorable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The results Thursday, just four months after the British
auction, are only part of a much larger project. All countries
throughout the European Union, and eventually in Central Europe,
are awarding new licenses. Analysts predict the total cost of
licenses across Europe could reach $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which has 82 million people and is by far the biggest
country in Europe, is crucial for all rivals with pan-European
goals. Besides its size, the country is one of the most affluent in
the world, and its residents still use mobile phones less than
those of many neighboring countries. That gives it potentially more
room for growth.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the costs of controlling a continental chessboard are huge.
Beyond the cost of wireless licenses, the big players are spending
enormous sums acquiring existing carriers. Just Thursday, for
example, BT of Britain announced an agreement to pay 6.6 billion
euros for a controlling stake in Viag Interkom, Germany's
fourth-largest wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   That deal comes in the wake of France Telecom's recent purchase
of Orange PLC, which owns Britain's second-largest wireless
network, and Deutsche Telekom's bid to acquire a young U.S.
wireless carrier, Voicestream Communications, for $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of Thursday's winning bidders are intent on owning
pan-European and even global wireless networks. Besides Deutsche
Telekom and Vodafone, they include Mobilcom AG, a fast-growing
German telephone carrier that is backed by France Telecom; Viag
Interkom, now to be owned by BT; a consortium called Group 3G,
backed by Telefonica SA of Spain and Sonera Oy, the Finnish
telephone company; and E-Plus Hutchison, a consortium led by KPN
Mobile of the Netherlands, NTT DoCoMo of Japan and Hutchison
Whampoa of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, these new wireless networks will provide the capacity
and technology to offer far faster and more sophisticated data
services than those now available. Supporters of third-generation
networks talk of high-speed mobile Internet access, scores of
``mobile commerce'' applications and even the ability to receive
streams of video over a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, nobody is yet sure which services will prove
practical and what consumers will be willing to pay for them. But
most analysts say ordinary mobile telephone service will become
steadily cheaper and will no longer provide the booming revenue
that wireless operators have enjoyed during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The big bet is that as mobile telephones become almost
ubiquitous but far less profitable, exotic new data services will
more than make up for the difference.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If you don't believe that the average revenue per month will
double over the next 10 years, then there really isn't any point in
participating in the auctions,'' said Holger Grawe, a
telecommunications analyst at WestLB Panmeure in Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
   He, along with many others, is convinced the bet will ultimately
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, investors are increasingly nervous.
Deutsche Telekom's stock has plunged by almost half this year,
mostly in the wake of the British auctions that generated
unexpected high prices. Duncan Warwick-Champion, a
telecommunications analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's in London, said all
the companies in Thursday's auction are poised for possible
downgrades in their credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vulnerable, Warwick-Champion said, is the Dutch
telephone carrier KPN, which has already teamed with BellSouth
Corp. to acquire control of the E-Plus wireless network in Germany.
But Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and BT will also be evaluated
for possible downgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these sorts of auctions are short-sighted and
counterproductive,'' said Eden Zoller, a senior consultant at Ovum,
a telecommunications research firm in London. ``They would all be
much better spending their money on developing new services.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the mammoth cost of wireless licenses in Europe,
investors are also digesting the impact of acquisitions like France
Telecom's purchase of Orange and Deutsche Telekom's plan to acquire
Voicestream. Deutsche Telekom's bid may be blocked by U.S.
regulators, adding to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Eylert, an executive at Deutsche Telekom who is also
chairman of an industry group called the UMTS Forum, said the
enormous license fees could put pressure on operators to build
their networks as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But other executives were clearly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have had it for 30 billion marks less,'' said Peik
von Bestenbostel, a spokesman for Viag Interkom, which had
announced several days ago that it would seek only two rather than
three licenses allowed under the bidding rules.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive, speaking privately, called it ``the worst
possible scenario'' _ high license prices and the maximum number of
competitors at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German government's scheme, 12 licenses were up for
auction but a company had to win two licenses to establish a
service. Theoretically, it was possible for four companies to
emerge with all the licenses, but most experts had predicted that
five companies would prevail _ two with three licenses apiece and
three smaller players with two apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinarily high prices, von Bestenbostel said
his company was ready to plow ahead. ``We think it is an
extraordinary opportunity, and we are ready for a market with six
players,'' he said.

BANKRUPTCIES DEFY GROWTH IN FURNITURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two recent failures by furniture sellers show that the furniture
business is joining the retail clothing business in a much more
competitive arena where poor execution is increasingly fatal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Heilig-Meyers Co., the largest furniture
retailer in the country, with $2.3 billion in annual sales,
announced that it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
and that it would close 302 stores, most in rural areas in the
Southeast and California.
</P>
<P>
   The news came the same day that Living.com, an Internet retailer
with losses but glamorous partners like Starbucks and Amazon.com,
said that it had filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those announcements, the furniture industry is not
moribund. Thanks to a strong economy that is driving home sales and
a Martha Stewart-like national obsession with renovations, sales
have been growing at more than 5 percent a year since 1992 and now
stand at $61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   With consumer spending starting to ease, growth in furniture
sales is expected to slow to 2 percent to 3 percent this year. But
analysts contend the bankruptcies speak more to heightened
competition than to overall weakness in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at Heilig-Meyers is extremely unfortunate,
because it didn't have to be,'' said Jerry Epperson, a furniture
industry analyst and a managing director of Mann, Armistad and
Epperson, an investment banking firm in Richmond, Va. ``The
industry is having the best of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Living.com was the less significant of the two bankruptcy
filings because selling furniture over the Internet is still an
experiment that many feel will not pan out soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for the consumer to touch and feel and sit and judge
comfort cannot be addressed over the Web,'' said Jeff Butler, a
principal at the retail consulting firm of Kurt Salmon Associates.
</P>
<P>
   While Heilig-Meyers faced numerous problems, including a lack of
cash flow caused by an unwieldy string of acquisitions, the
merchant was struggling because it still hewed to the old school of
furniture retailing. Traditionally, furniture stores were more
banks than merchants. That is, they made money not so much by
selling sofas and chairs but by offering credit to low-income
people to buy merchandise and then making a profit on the terms of
the loan. This focus on financing as opposed to product explains
why many older furniture chains were grim places with ugly stock
and dim lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Such operations have been hit hard by credit card companies that
lowered income requirements, allowing even relatively poor
customers to shop wherever they liked, and by a huge increase in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there has been an explosion of rent-to-buy
retailers. Such retailers offer higher prices, but if customers
fail to make a payment for a large-screen TV or recliner, it does
not hurt their credit record _ the companies simply come and
repossess the rental item.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the low- to mid-price category is also undergoing
startling change. Rooms to Go, a chain of furniture stores founded
in 1990 that offers discounts to buyers willing to pay for a
package of merchandise for one room, is already the third-largest
furniture seller in the country, with $720 million in annual sales.
In addition, nonfurniture retailers like Costco, Sam's Club, and
Lowe's sell some furniture, much of it at competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   The competition in the mid- and upper-price range has also
increased with chain stores like Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel,
which sell lifestyle and ambience with their leather club chairs
and pewter picture frames.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer wants to buy in a place that makes them feel good
and comfortable,'' said Gerald Birnbach, chairman of the Rowe Cos.,
which supplies to those chains and others like J.C. Penney and
Jordan's in Massachusetts. ``They are talking about value, but not
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is retarded when it comes to change,'' he added.
``That is why the young aggressive ones are catching the upswing.
The ones doing it the same old way are going dead.''

JUDGE HALTS PROGRAM TO CRACK DVD FILM CODES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Norway)  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Thursday that a
Web site operator cannot distribute a computer program used to
crack codes that prevent the piracy of movies.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, a victory for the motion picture industry, applies
only to the Web site operator, Eric Corley, and his company, 2600
Enterprises. But experts on both sides of the issue agreed that the
decision could have far greater reach as the courts hammer out
legal guidelines that will govern the rules of commerce and free
speech in the digital world.
</P>
<P>
   Like recent decisions concerning the unauthorized transmission
of music over the Internet, the battle over the distribution of
code-breaking programs used to copy digital versatile discs, or
DVDs, has been closely watched by the entertainment industry and
Internet groups.
</P>
<P>
   Motion picture companies argued that they had invested
tremendous amounts of money on the assurance, through
long-recognized copyright laws, that they would have the exclusive
right to sell their movies to the public. Their opponents argued
that new federal laws designed to protect those copyrights were
overly restrictive, both by unreasonably blocking the legitimate
use of digital movies and by illegally infringing on their right to
free speech under the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a detailed analysis, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan tried to weigh
both positions and to measure Congress' 1998 guidelines for
Internet copyright, known as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Kaplan found that Congress had clearly intended to prohibit the
distribution of software used to circumvent copyright protections,
something he said the defendant's Web site did by posting the
code-breaking program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side is entitled to its views,'' Kaplan wrote. ``In our
society, however, clashes of competing interests like this are
resolved by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan found that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which
prohibits the distribution of software designed to circumvent
copyright protections, did not violate Corley's First Amendment
right to free speech, and he prohibited Corley from posting the
program in the future or from establishing Internet links with
other sites that provided copies of the code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, defense lawyers asserted that Kaplan's
analysis was incorrect and said they would appeal. Martin Garbus,
Corley's lawyer, said the decision would have made its way to
higher courts no matter what the outcome because ``this is an issue
that has to be decided by the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Kaplan sits on the district court, which is the trial
court of the federal system, his decision is not binding on other
federal courts and is subject to review by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. But the judge's decision has considerable
persuasive force for other courts both because it is the first time
the law has been tested and because the Manhattan court is among
the more prestigious district courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very important case dealing with how intellectual
material is going to be transmitted over the Web,'' Garbus said
Thursday. ``The Internet, as a free exchange of information, is
crippled by this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the motion picture industry said the case was not
about free speech, but about efforts to circumvent copyright
protections that were established by Congress. ``What we sued the
defendants for was circumventing our protective device,'' said Leon
P. Gold, the lawyer for the movie companies. Gold likened the
code-breaking programs to a key that could be used to break into a
bank vault.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot steal any other person's property, even if it is
copyrighted property,'' he said.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The decoding program at issue in the case is called DeCSS,
because it counters the encryption system known as CSS, for content
scrambling system. It was devised by a Norwegian teen-ager and made
available, among other places, on Corley's New York-based Web site,
2600.com. The movie industry filed suit in January and won a
temporary injunction against Corley. Separate cases are pending in
California and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday's decision is among the first to balance free
speech and copyright protection on the Internet, the courts have
been measuring the tension between the two concepts for well over
100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment protects speech, and the copyright statute
restricts the uses of speech,'' said William W. Fisher, a professor
at Harvard Law School. ``There is a tension between these two.''
</P>
<P>
   A traditional exception to copyright law has been the concept of
``fair use,'' which usually means the excerpting of material for
scholarly, journalistic or artistic purposes. A book review that
quotes from a novel is typically not a violation of copyright law
because it is considered fair use.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress severely restricted the fair-use concept in the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, in part as a recognition that it
is much easier to copy and distribute copyrighted material over the
Internet than by photocopying or videotaping. The defendants tried
to use the fair use concept to defend their distribution of the
code-breaking program, arguing that it could be used by scholars
and others to make legitimate excerpts of movies. But Kaplan denied
that claim, saying that Congress considered this possibility when
it wrote the law and ``clearly faced up to and dealt with this
question.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress listened to arguments about the need to protect
copyrighted works and the counterarguments that the protection
would inhibit people with legitimate needs to excerpt those works,
``and it struck a balance among the competing interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants also argued that computer code, including the
code-breaking programs, is a form of speech and that Congress
cannot lawfully restrict their ability to transmit the code under
the First Amendment. But Kaplan rejected that argument as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer code is not purely expressive,'' he said, ``any more
than the assassination of a political figure is purely a political
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan found that because the restriction of the code-breaking
program was not based on the idea it conveyed, Congress had greater
latitude to establish restrictions. He ruled that the law was
``content neutral'' and ``in furtherance of important governmental
interests that does not unduly restrict expressive activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a more limited section of his opinion, the judge also forbade
Corley from establishing Internet links with other Web sites that
made the code-breaking program available. But Kaplan made it clear
that the links to the sites would be unlawful only if someone could
prove that the person that established the links did so with the
express purpose of transmitting the code-breaking program.
</P>
<P>
   He said the person establishing the link would have to know the
program was on the site, know that the program was illegal, and
establish the link ``for the purpose of disseminating that
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An essential ingredient, as explained above, is a desire to
bring about the dissemination,'' he wrote. ``Hence a strong
requirement of that forbidden purpose is an essential prerequisite
to any liability for linking.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Nutritionists say there's nothing wrong
with sweeteners and that everyone needs a certain amount of fat.
It's when these ingredients make up most of the calories in a whole
diet that they become detrimental.
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes featuring foods that are low in sugars and fats
that you can use for healthful snack alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   FROZEN BANANA PIE
</P>
<P>
   6 very ripe bananas, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup natural or light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 pre-baked pie crust (graham cracker is good)
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 cups fresh berries, or other fruit for a garnish
</P>
<P>
   Put all the ingredients except pie crust and berries into a
blender or food processor. Blend or process until smooth. Pour into
baked pie shell and freeze until solid.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: You can freeze in custard cups if desired and eliminate
the pie shell.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the freezer 15 minutes before serving; garnish with
fresh berries or other fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   This pie is a snap to make and can be a frozen banana custard if
you don't want to put it into a pie shell.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN MUFFINS
</P>
<P>
   2 cups pumpkin puree
</P>
<P>
   3/4 to 1 cup maple syrup (depending on sweetness of pumpkin)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons light olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup walnuts, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350(degrees).
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the pumpkin puree, maple syrup and olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together flour, baking soda, salt and spices; add walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Blend dry ingredients into the wet ones just until mixed; do not
beat.
</P>
<P>
   Divide batter equally into 18 or 24 greased mini-muffin cups.
(If using paper liners, spray with vegetable spray to prevent
sticking).
</P>
<P>
   Bake 25-30 minutes or until muffins spring back at the touch.
</P>
<P>
   Cool slightly before removing muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Make these muffins in mini-muffin tins; they can be portioned
out in smaller amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The ``secret'' healthy ingredient in these cookies is tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell, and no one will know.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are volatile oils in the sesame seeds and almonds,
it's a good idea to keep these cookies in the refrigerator for best
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   SESAME ALMOND COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
</P>
<P>

   Preheat oven to 350(degrees).
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder and salt. Mix
in sesame seeds and chopped almonds.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl, mash the tofu and combine with the olive oil,
brown sugar and almond extract.
</P>
<P>
   Using a rubber spatula, fold wet ingredients into the dry ones.
Roll the mixture into 1-inch balls, flatten between your palms, and
place them on ungreased baking sheets. Bake cookies about 10
minutes or until edges begin to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Lift from sheets with spatula to wire racks for cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Store in airtight tins kept in the refrigerator.

FBI AGENT ADMITS HIS TESTIMONY AGAINST NUCLEAR SCIENTIST WAS
MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ An FBI agent admitted in federal court here
Thursday that he had provided misleading testimony last December
that made a Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear
weapons secrets appear deceptive when he had not been.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is critical because the government has successfully
argued since last December that the scientist, Dr. Wen Ho Lee, be
held without bail in part because his deceptions, along with the
vast amount of nuclear secrets that remain unaccounted for,
suggested he was a major threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding to incarcerate Lee after his indictment in December,
the judge, James A. Parker, had cited Lee's alleged deceptions
among the reasons for denying bail. Lee is in the middle of his
third attempt to be released on bail, and the government is now
acknowledging what amounts to a pattern of misleading testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the first person ever to be accused under the specific
atomic energy statute cited in his 59-count indictment, and a
growing number of Asian-Americans and civil rights proponents have
rallied to his side saying that he was singled out for prosecution
at least in part because of his Chinese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Messemer, an FBI supervisory special agent, had said
under oath last December that when Lee improperly downloaded a
trove of weapons secrets six years ago onto portable computer
tapes, he had lied to a colleague in order to gain access to the
colleague's computer. Messemer had testified that Lee told the
other scientist that he was just going to download a resume, which
was not true.
</P>
<P>
   But since December, Lee's defense lawyers have gained access to
that other scientist's previous grand jury testimony, and it does
not mention that Lee spoke of a resume.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer acknowledged that fact on the stand Thursday, but said
his misleading testimony represented ``an honest mistake,'' and
that it was not intentional. Messemer insisted nevertheless that,
in other areas, Lee had been deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, several other instances in which the
defense appeared to show that the government had misled the judge
in describing Lee's supposed deceptions. Messemer had testified at
the December bail hearing that Lee had not disclosed certain
contacts with Chinese scientists during officially sanctioned,
professional visits to Beijing during the 1980s. But the defense
attorneys have since obtained a report Lee filed after a 1986 trip
in which he listed seven Chinese scientists with whom he spoke
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer also acknowledged that, though Lee clearly disclosed
the contacts, he was never subsequently questioned about them.
Messemer also disclosed that he never consulted Lee's trip report
before testifying in December. He still maintained that Lee had
been deceptive because he had not been open about ``the full nature
and scope'' of his contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that until Lee faced questioning a year
ago, he failed to report a highly suspicious meeting he had with a
Chinese scientist in his hotel room during a 1988 visit. The
government also insists that Lee's downloading of the huge library
of weapons secrets was itself a deliberate act of deception that
took more than 40 hours of computer time and knowingly violated
rules on the handling of sensitive data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   None of the statements in court here Thursday or Wednesday
appeared decisive. The government presented weapons experts who
insisted Lee's downloading was unprecedented and a grave threat to
national security, since the data, in hostile hands, could alter
the global balance of power. The defense offered its own experts
who insisted that most of the information was already public and
that its use to another country was extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   In one tense exchange, Paul Robinson, the president of the
Sandia National Laboratories, said that one of the defense experts,
Harold M. Agnew, a former director of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, had simply not understood the information Lee
downloaded or had not understood the threat posed by Lee's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew fired off an affidavit Thursday in response to that
testimony, saying, ``What Paul said is a bunch of bull,'' and then
refuted parts of Robinson's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In two other areas Thursday, defense lawyers tried to show that
that government witnesses had provided misleading evidence in
December. Messemer had said Lee had failed to disclose
correspondence he conducted with some Chinese scientists, saying
that he had only exchanged Christmas cards. On Thursday, one of
Lee's lawyers, Mark Holscher, produced a transcript of an interview
with Lee and the FBI on March 5, 1999, in which Lee did discuss
correspondence with the Chines scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Messemer had said in December that during the
search of Lee's home, the FBI had discovered letters that Lee had
sent to a number of foreign scientific institutes seeking a job.
The prosecution has said in previous filings that they believe the
principal reason Lee improperly downloaded the nuclear secrets was
to enhance his job prospects with the foreign institutes.
</P>
<P>
   But under questioning, Messemer acknowledged Thursday that the
FBI found some letters but had no evidence they were either mailed
or received by the foreign institutions, which were in countries
like Australia, France, Singapore and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The bail hearing will resume on Friday. Parker has allowed the
examinations and cross-examinations of the witnesses, much of it in
closed sessions because it involved classified information, to
stretch on far longer than is usual at bail hearings.

 &HT;    Jones gets chance to `finish it' in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In nine months Chipper Jones has gone from winning the
NL MVP award to living it as he and the Braves sealed their $120
million deal on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 28, had agreed to a contract extension worth $90 million
over six years, with two option years worth $15 million apiece. It
is both the richest and the longest contract in Braves' history.
The first overall pick of the 1990 draft was 18 when he first
signed with the Braves for a bonus of $275,000. He could be 36 _
and making that kind of money every three games _ before he has any
more big decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate as far as a baseball player goes,
especially for me, having been born in this organization and grown
up in this organization,'' said Jones, whose options will
automatically kick in if he makes either 450 plate appearances or
the All-Star team the previous season. ``Hearing from so many
different players around the league, how lucky I am to be here and
have this opportunity to stay in one place for such a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tremendous feeling for me because I would certainly
love nothing more than to start my career here and finish it
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a career .302 hitter who has scored 100 runs, driven in
100 and homered at least 20 times in four of his five major league
seasons, helped convince the Braves to invest with both his
consistency and his ability to fight back from and play through
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a young man here who has established himself as one of
the real cornerstone players of this franchise,'' Braves general
manager John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones received $8 million of his new contract in a signing
bonus, which means he can go ahead with his childhood plans of
running a ranch with his father. He's got his eye on some land in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of money is really unheard of and it's almost
embarrassing to talk about,'' Jones said. ``It's not where I came
from. I came from middle class. We had to work hard for what we
got. To have this given to me is a little overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his teammates were a little wide-eyed Thursday too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch out for Sammy Sosa, Alex Rodriguez and Andruw Jones when
he comes up,'' Brian Jordan said. ``The price tag has just gone
sky-high.''

A SMALL-TOWN LAWYER TAKES ON BIG TIRE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By JANE TANNER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCALA, Fla. _ When Bruce R. Kaster started suing tire
manufacturers more than a decade ago, he worked alone facing
legions of lawyers hired by corporate conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   Most often he went up against Michelin. Many cases were settled
out of court, but of those that went to trial, Kaster lost more
than he won. By his account, the companies' lawyers heckled him
about the losses in front of his clients and stonewalled requests
for information. He said they expected to wear him down until he
folded and went away.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaster did not go away. Instead, he pursued case after case.
Win or lose, he held onto case documents and stacks of depositions
and trial testimony. Before long, he had crammed hundreds of
thousands of pages into his offices in Ocala, a rural horse farm
community in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he set about schooling himself in tire manufacturing,
watching videos, being tutored by experts and assiduously studying
processes like how rubber adheres to metal. The more often
corporate lawyers erected roadblocks, the more passionately Kaster
tried to knock them down.
</P>
<P>
   To win that war, he collaborated with other trial lawyers,
usually sharing his archives for no fee. This stockpile of data has
helped win cases for him and others. ``These are multinational
corporations,'' Kaster said. ``They thought, `What do I have to
worry about a small-town lawyer?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He does not mind being called a small-town lawyer, but Kaster,
54, prefers the term ``cowboy'' or ``Florida cracker.'' On most
days he works in jeans and cowboy boots. He likes to spend his free
time hunting hogs or tending cattle on a small ranch he owns. Once,
Kaster said, he rode a horse into a bar, had a drink without
dismounting and rode back out.
</P>
<P>
   He needs the recreation to relax between courtroom battles. He
is often on the road, backing up other lawyers rather than arguing
cases himself. Because there is no commercial airline service in
Ocala, he routinely drives an hour and 15 minutes to Orlando to fly
to cities throughout the United States. (He drives a Ford Explorer,
but replaced the Firestone tires with Pirellis and replaced the
factory-installed shock absorbers with a heavy-duty alternative.)
</P>
<P>
   Kaster works as a consultant, preparing expert witnesses for
trial or sitting as co-counsel. He and others in the tightly knit
group of lawyers who go after tire makers exchange information.
``When we need something, we call him,'' says Randy James, a Kansas
City, Kan., lawyer with 18 years of experience with defective-tire
cases.
</P>
<P>
   A defense lawyer who has gone up against Kaster says his
warehouse of documents and in-depth knowledge of tires makes Kaster
a threat to manufacturers, not his courtroom finesse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are worried he's got something that will hurt them,''
said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He's a
great librarian, not necessarily a field marshal in the tactics and
strategy of the courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his critics concede that Kaster is tenacious and often
successful in his efforts to uncover details about tire defects.
Over six months in 1998, he made repeated trips to Decatur, Ill.,
seeking evidence about the Bridgestone Corp. factory there. He
knocked on doors and spent hours at a Bob Evans restaurant sipping
coffee with former employees to tease out information about
suspected quality-control problems.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were willing to open up, Kaster said, in part
because he had been a member of the Communications Workers of
America union when he installed telephones while attending Virginia
Tech. The Decatur Bridgestone workers had recently been embroiled
in a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bulldog in discovery,'' said David Steelman, executive
director of the Attorneys Information Exchange Group, a lawyers'
cooperative on automobile and defective-product cases based in
Birmingham, Ala. ``He stays with an issue until he gets the
answers. He starts from ground zero and is relentless until he
finds out what happened to cause the defect.''
</P>
<P>
   Steelman said Kaster had contributed the largest share of
information to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Kaster, who earned a law degree from the University of Florida
after serving as a paratrooper in Vietnam, moved to Ocala in 1975
to work with Buddy McKay. McKay went on to serve as Florida's
lieutenant governor under Lawton Chiles, then lost a bid for
governor against Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Kaster defended companies and insurers against
lawsuits. He switched to plaintiffs' work in the mid-1980s when a
client at a factory he was defending asked him to help out
relatives whose father had been killed in a car accident. Although
he represented major insurers, Kaster took the case because the
Canadian trucking company involved was covered by Lloyd's of
London, which did not present a conflict. The company settled.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Kaster took on his first tire case, suing the
Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. on behalf of a teen-age boy who had been
rendered a paraplegic in an auto accident. Kaster battled with
opposing lawyers over how many similar cases had been filed, and
the company settled during jury deliberations for $2 million. He
has had a few other big successes, including a $5 million verdict
in a Connecticut case, but he says he spends much of his time
providing information without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kaster, in tandem with other lawyers, has four cases on
the dockets, with a fifth set to be filed. All are against
Bridgestone/Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got angry about misleading and false information by the tire
industry,'' Kaster said. ``I've stayed angry.''

 &HT;    Trust transforms Beamer's Hokies
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKSBURG, Va. _ From his office, Frank Beamer can show you
just how far he, and Virginia Tech football, have come. A flick of
a switch and the floor-to-ceiling slatted blinds swivel, then slide
open on tracks to reveal a panoramic view of Lane Stadium. Gazing
out the window, Beamer's no longer the 1999 national coach of the
year but a frightened college freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in the first game here,'' he said. ``Well, not play.
I stood on the sideline.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1965, Beamer was an 18-year-old defensive back
the day the Virginia Tech and Maryland freshmen teams christened
Lane Stadium. Beamer remembers little of the game, not even the
result, much less the final score. The feeling, though, lingers
still. Always will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so down after that game,'' he said. ``I didn't play.
I'll never forget how I felt.''
</P>
<P>
   How all the typical freshman fears flashed through his mind:
Would he ever play here? Had he picked the wrong school? Fast
forward 35 years, to a bright summer's day in southwest Virginia,
and it's clear Beamer made the right decision. So did his alma
mater when it hired him in 1987 and stood by him in the dark days
of '92.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I've really been proud of,'' said Beamer, ``is
there's not many jobs you can go into and change the image of that
job.''
</P>
<P>
   This job's one of them. From the depths of that disastrous 1992
season, when Beamer's sixth Tech team went 2-8-1 and many Hokie
fans screamed for his ouster, Beamer has built one of the premier
programs in the country. Last fall, the Hokies climbed to No. 2 in
the polls after completing the first 11-0 regular season in school
history and setting for a date with top-ranked Florida State in the
Sugar Bowl for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 28-7 in New Orleans, Tech rallied behind
its incomparable freshman quarterback, Michael Vick, to take a
29-28 lead. While FSU won 46-29, Virginia Tech still finished No. 2
in the AP poll and became one of just eight schools to play in
bowls in each of the past seven seasons. The others: FSU, Florida,
Nebraska, Tennessee, Penn State, Michigan and Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   And now, guess who's coming back to Blacksburg? ``ESPN College
GameDay,'' the cable network's pregame show, which will air here
Aug. 27. Despite losing 11 starters (eight from the nation's
stingiest defense, including All-American end and Lombardi and
Nagurski awards winner Corey Moore), Virginia Tech was picked to
host Georgia Tech in the BCA Bowl a week from Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. College football will kick off the 2000 season
here, 40 miles west of Roanoke, in this charming little town whose
full-time 11,000 population is less than half of Tech's
25,000-student body. Here, in Lane Stadium, now enlarged from its
original 40,000 capacity to 55,075, with next year's 12,000-seat
expansion due to push capacity near 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   All because Vick _ the most profane four-letter word to college
defenses everywhere and likely to become the first sophomore to win
the Heisman Trophy _ is back. And because Beamer stayed, rejecting
several coaching overtures after transforming Tech into a national
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanted both ways,'' Beamer said, grinning. ``Wanted
to get the heck out of town, and wanted to keep me around town.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's amazing?'' he asked. ```GameDay' is back here
for the third time in eight games (ESPN televised last year's
Syracuse and Miami games). They say they never come back twice in a
season. That kind of makes a statement. Things have certainly
changed around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Changed for the better-than-anyone-in-the-Big East Hokies,
who've won two outright league titles and one co-championship in
the past five years. Last season, Tech sold out every home game for
the first time. This year, it had more than 35,000 season ticket
applications, nearly double 1998's total. The university has been
richly rewarded for its faith in Beamer in the face of severe
criticism after '92's disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many coaches who would've hung around, if you go
2-8-1 in your fifth or sixth year,'' Beamer said. ``But the
(administration) here could really see we had (laid) the foundation
OK. We just had to hang around and play enough games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies went 9-3 in 1993, won the Independence Bowl and never
looked back. Beamer's compiled a 64-20 record the past seven
seasons, doing it with swift, attacking defenses, remarkable
special teams and a potent offense. In '99, Tech led the nation in
scoring (averaging 41.4 points) behind Vick. Vick passed for 1,840
yards, ran for 585, accounted for 20 touchdowns, led the nation in
passing efficiency (a 180.37 rating) and was third in the Heisman
Trophy voting, matching the highest finish by a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vick has seven other returning offensive starters and Tech
still is ranked from 10th to 12th in most preseason polls. And
Beamer almost has the Hokies where he wants them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal,'' he said, ``would be that in 10 years, if you said
name me the top 10 teams in the country, everybody would say
Virginia Tech.''

LEWIS OF RAVENS FINED $250,000 FOR LYING TO POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League fined Baltimore Ravens linebacker
Ray Lewis $250,000 Thursday for lying to the police about his
involvement in an incident that resulted in the stabbing deaths of
two men outside an Atlanta nightclub after the Super Bowl last
January.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue also said Lewis would be fined
another $250,000 if he violated the terms of his 12-month probation
in Fulton County, Ga. It was there on June 5 that Lewis pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstruction of law enforcement
officers and interference with a law enforcement investigation in
connection with the death of the two men the night of January 31.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Lewis' lawyers and the NFL Players Association,
made public by the NFL Thursday, Tagliabue addressed criticism from
the news media and others that Lewis should have been suspended.
Tagliabue said that since Lewis was wrongly charged with murder, he
had already suffered significant harm to his reputation as well as
financial damage. Therefore, a suspension was not warranted,
Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   A fine, however, was warranted, Tagliabue said, because no NFL
player should lie to the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lewis was not entirely truthful and candid with the police
in his initial interview, and he counseled others that night to say
nothing about what had happened,'' Tagliabue said in the letter.
``This misconduct no doubt fueled a public perception that he had
something to hide. In doing so, he put his own livelihood and
reputation needlessly at risk, and he caused great harm to other
NFL players and to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unlawful obstruction related to a very serious occurrence
_ a double homicide,'' Tagliabue wrote. ``The homicides resulted
from an altercation at which Lewis was clearly present, aspects of
which he observed, and which involved associates or friends whom he
had brought to and from the scene of the incident. In short, the
obstruction here impaired or impeded an investigation of serious
criminal conduct in circumstances that plainly led a wide segment
of the public to view Lewis' conduct very negatively. That negative
perception, in turn, negatively affected other NFL players and the
league itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount is the largest nonsuspension fine levied against a
player by the league office. A person close to Lewis said that
although the Pro Bowl linebacker thought the amount was excessive,
he was uncertain whether to appeal the fine. However, the person
said, the players association may convince Lewis that the fine is
too large and that he needs to appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens officials privately are furious at the amount. They say
Tagliabue made the number so high because he wanted to appease the
public, mainly the news media. They say Lewis has suffered enough
financially, paying more than $1.5 million in legal fees and court
costs.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Lewis and two friends went on trial in Atlanta, charged
with malice murder, felony murder and aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case crumbled, however, and murder charges
against Lewis were dropped in exchange for his plea to obstruction
of justice for lying to the police. As part of the deal, Lewis
testified against the two co-defendants, Reginald Oakley and Joseph
Sweeting, who were later found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis met with Tagliabue earlier this summer, and in the weeks
following the commissioner spoke to a number of people involved
with the case. Tagliabue determined that Lewis should be hit with a
hefty fine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons was Tagliabue's determination to make it
clear to other players, and especially fans, that NFL players
should be held accountable for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an NFL player engages in and admits to misconduct of the
type to which Lewis had pled here,'' Tagliabue wrote, ``the biggest
losers are thousands of other NFL players, present, past and
future. Such admitted misconduct clearly contributes to the
negative stereotyping of NFL players.''
</P>
<P>
   Both league and Ravens officials maintain that Lewis has been a
model citizen since the trial. He spoke to the league's rookies
this off-season and in a passionate speech took responsibility for
deceiving the police, but denied any participation in the murders.
Lewis, as part of a personal conduct policy, has been meeting
regularly with a counselor.
</P>
<P>
   The fine for Lewis comes only months after the NFL refined and
expanded its personal conduct policy. The changes were made in
light of the Lewis case, as well as the case involving Carolina
receiver Rae Carruth, who has been accused of masterminding the
murder last year of his pregnant girlfriend.

   PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SEASON IS LAUNCHED, WITH THE EDGE TO BUSH
</P>
<P>
   By DAN FREEDMAN and MARK HELM
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With 79 days before election day, Vice President
Al Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman confront an electoral map that is
leaning in favor of their Republican opponents, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush and former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   A wide swath of 18 states in the South, West and Midwest are
solidly in the Bush corner, giving him a claim on 167 electoral
votes out of 270 needed to win, according to political analyst
Charles Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other states are leaning to Bush, including Ohio, which
would bring his total to 250 _ 20 short of victory.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has a solid lead in seven states _ including
New York _ for a total of 77 electoral votes. Four other states _
California, Illinois, Tennessee and Minnesota _ are leaning to
Gore. If Gore wins those states, he brings that total up to 174,
according to the Cook analysis.
</P>
<P>
   That means the race is likely to be decided in such traditional
toss-up states as Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan,
Wisconsin and Washington, with a total of 78 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they are not worried _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like our position,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, former chair of
the Democratic National Committee, told reporters late last week.
``We have a very good chance of winning, but the perception is that
we're the underdog, and as everyone knows, America loves an
underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   While national voter polls show Democrats enjoy advantages on
major issues such as education and Social Security, Gore still
suffers the perception of being linked to questionable campaign
finance practices in the 1996 election and President Clinton's
involvement in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And while he battles to capture the critical center, Gore is
fighting a brush-fire war on his left flank against the Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader. The veteran consumer activist could draw
enough votes in critical states such as Wisconsin, Oregon,
Minnesota and California to guarantee a Bush victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nader costs Gore California, the race is over,'' said
George C. Edwards III, director of the Center for Presidential
Studies at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strategists claim that the Nader threat will fade once
liberal voters _ a traditional Democratic bloc _ realize that a
vote for Nader is tantamount to electing Bush. And they are
convinced that in addition to volunteering for duty in Vietnam,
Gore's long record of public service in Congress and the White
House will prove compelling to a public just beginning to focus on
the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story many voters have not heard,''' said Tad Devine,
Gore's senior strategist. ``The vice president's life is almost
like a revelation. Many people don't know where he comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd insisted that voters don't necessarily have to like Gore to
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to convince the American public that this election is
not about whether you want to have a beer with the candidate ...
it's about who can run the country best,'' he said. ``When you
choose a doctor to operate on your wife, you don't worry about
whether you'd want to have a drink with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore shouldn't try to compete with President Clinton or Bush on
affability, Dodd said, but should instead talk specifically about
issues such the environment, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, many Republicans are amused at the Democratic
angst over Gore's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great Democratic myths is that people don't know Al
Gore,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta.
``I disagree with that. People have known him eight years as vice
president and they've concluded they don't like him very much ...
He would need a personality transplant to become more likeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's challenge in the campaign ahead is the mirror image of
Gore's, according to Donald Kettl, political science professor at
the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has to ratchet up his personal appeal, Bush needs to
better articulate his proposals and overcome the fuzzy menu of
ideas rooted in ``compassionate conservatism,'' Kettl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for Bush is how to calibrate his compassionate
side with his conservative side,'' Kettl said, noting the first
helps Bush with moderates and independents while the second draws
in the GOP's true believers. ``It will be a challenge for Bush to
put out enough detail to satisfy the critics and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the best Gore can hope for is that the public
is willing to put aside a year's worth of Jay Leno and David
Letterman jokes and look at the vice president anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harder Gore tries, the more artificial he looks,'' Kettl
said. ``Whether he can create a softer, more likeable personality
is a big `if.'''

WOODS, WITH NO SIGN OF WEAKNESS, SHARES LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The excellence of Tiger Woods has become
expected, particularly at major championships. Was anyone surprised
that Woods opened the PGA Championship with a six-under-par 66? You
could almost hear some of his competitors saying to themselves,
``There he goes again.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the thought of Woods getting off to a slow start. If
Woods is to be denied his third consecutive major championship,
someone at Valhalla Golf Club will have to play superb golf to beat
him. Thursday, on a sultry Kentucky afternoon, Scott Dunlap, who
has never won a PGA Tour event, shot 66 to tie Woods for first
place. Darren Clarke, who defeated Woods this year in the Andersen
Consulting Match Play Championship, was tied for third place at 68,
along with Davis Love III, the 1997 PGA champion.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended at 8:27 p.m. with 18 players still on the
course.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly bunched leader board, which featured many players
under par, gave credence to the theory that it may be harder for
Woods to run away with this major. Many players have the ability to
shoot low scores this weekend. But the big question remained the
same. Will anyone shoot lower than Woods?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has won the last two majors by 23 shots combined,''
noted Dunlap after his round, which included five birdies, one
bogey and a chip-in eagle at No. 2 that jump-started his day. ``His
presence is nothing but discouraging to everyone else in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to do it, he's going to do it. There is no
stopping him. All I can do is come out tomorrow, play another good
round and take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods intends to take another championship and become the first
player to win three consecutive majors since Ben Hogan in 1953.
Woods took advantage of his 9:13 a.m. tee time, playing most of his
round before the afternoon temperature reached 91 degrees, with a
heat index of 100. It was telling that Woods, Dunlap, Clarke and
Love teed off before 10:30 a.m. Those who played in the afternoon
felt as if they were in a sauna with the temperature gauge stuck on
high. Some of the afternoon rounds were painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pre-tournament favorites struggled, including Hal
Sutton (74), Sergio Garcia (74), Vijay Singh (77) and Tom Lehman
(82). But despite the hoopla surrounding Woods as he entered this
tournament, he remained unflappable. Woods was paired with Jack
Nicklaus and Singh, marking the first time that Nicklaus and Woods
had ever been paired together in a competitive round. As expected,
their gallery was the biggest and the most boisterous, yet Woods
played with machinelike efficiency, making seven birdies and just
one bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Want more bad news for the competition? Woods putted well. And
when Woods putts well at majors, he usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you shoot 66 in a major championship, you are going
to be happy,'' said Woods, who said he enjoyed playing with
Nicklaus, who shot a 77. But Woods never lost sight of his goal.
``It was an honor to play with Jack. To be honest, though, when I
am on that first tee, I could care less who I am playing with. I am
trying to put myself in position to win a major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Woods did, and from the moment Woods' name
appeared on the leader board, his opponents knew it meant trouble.
Woods can bunch birdies together at any time, on any golf course,
and you can never tell when a torrid stretch might begin.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, it started at the par-5 7th. Sitting on even par
through six holes, Woods birdied No. 7, No. 8., No. 9 and No. 10 to
reach four under par. At the 597-yard 7th, Woods reached the green
in two shots with a driver and a 7-iron, then two-putted from 30
feet. At No. 8, he made a 12-foot putt. At No. 9, he made another
12-footer. And at the par-5 10th, after missing the green with his
second shot, Woods hit a beautiful chip from behind the green that
stopped 3 feet from the cup, setting up an easy birdie putt. Woods
added another 12-foot birdie putt at No. 12, and he birdied the &QC; 
par-5 finishing hole, hitting his second shot into the green-side
bunker, then blasting out to 3 feet to set up the birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods is accustomed to leading majors, Dunlap, who turned
37 Wednesday, continued his celebration with a superb round. Dunlap
entered the tournament unsure of how he would perform, having not
played since last month's British Open, and still feeling somewhat
drained after fighting a bad cold last week. His best finish this
year is a tie for third at The Players Championship, so Dunlap
realized he was a long shot to keep pace with Woods for three more
days. That didn't mean Dunlap wouldn't try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know I have not won on the PGA Tour yet,'' Dunlap said.
``But you never know when your first one is going to be. Jeff
Sluman's first one was the PGA, so why not mine?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, had different ideas. And as he went to bed with
a share of the lead, it was an unsettling thought for the rest of
the field, thinking about a player who shows no mercy in majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you could slip up a couple of times, have three
very good rounds and one OK round, and still win the
championship,'' said Curtis Strange, who shot a 72. ``Not
anymore.''

 &HT;    Webvan: Delivery or bust
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Webvan may say no tipping required for home delivery,
but it occasionally does some tipping of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, local Webvan officials tipped police to a
suspected credit card scam, and made the home delivery: a police
officer dressed as a Webvan worker.
</P>
<P>
   The sting bagged Tonya N. Walker, 27, who was expecting $357 in
groceries, including a dozen fine steaks. She was arrested
Wednesday night on charges of using a stolen credit card number to
order through the online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was surprised,'' said Detective Gary Lowe. ``Suddenly she
wasn't getting a crate of food anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Webvan opened its metro Atlanta operation in May and has
encountered a few customers trying to use stolen credit cards. In
this case, Webvan became suspicious when the addresses didn't
match. The card belonged to a Newnan, Ga. couple who said they had
never heard of Webvan.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators searched Walker's apartment, they found a
computer she had purchased fraudulently, police said. She also was
charged with forgery, computer forgery and financial card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Webvan customers have been arrested on similar
charges, including one who complained the delivery was late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be the only customers dissatisfied with our
service,'' said company spokesman Mark San Fratello.

NASA SPACE PIONEER ROBERT R. GILRUTH IS DEAD AT 86 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert R. Gilruth, a pivotal figure in America's Cold War-era
race to the moon and the first director of NASA's Johnson Space
Center in Houston, died Thursday in Charlottesville, Va., after a
lengthy illness.
</P>
<P>
   He was 86 and had Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The family planned a private memorial. His ashes were to be
scattered in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Gilruth was a true pioneer in every sense of the word
and the father of human spaceflight,'' said George W.S. Abbey, the
current Johnson Space Center director. ``His vision, energy and
dedication helped define the American space program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His courage to explore the unknown, his insistence of
following strict scientific procedures, and his technical expertise
directly contributed to the ultimate success of the American space
program and the landing of a man on the moon,'' NASA administrator
Dan Goldin said from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   An innovative aeronautical engineer, Gilruth proved an
inspirational though soft spoken leader when in 1958 he was
selected to lead the space task group, a team of 35 experts
assembled by the newly created National Aeronautics and Space
Administration to place an American in space.
</P>
<P>
   By Nov. 1, 1961, Gilruth had resettled the task group, comprised
initially of engineers and other experts from the old Langley
Aeronautical Laboratory of the government's National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics, in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The campus-like spaceflight research facility that was carved
from cattle grazing land in Houston's Clear Lake area was known as
NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center until it was renamed the Lyndon B.
Johnson Space Center in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the task group and the Manned Spacecraft Center,
Gilruth oversaw the nation's first 25 human spaceflights. They
spanned the May 5, 1961, Mercury flight of the late Alan Shepard,
through the Apollo 15 lunar mission of August 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth's tenure was dominated by America's come-from-behind
victory in a race to the moon with the former Soviet Union. The
Soviet's launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, in
1957, spurred the creation of NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human launched
into space, beating Shepard by less than a month. But the triumph
fueled American fears that the country was falling behind its
Communist rival.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth transitioned from NASA's Mercury program to the director
of its Gemini project. Within less than two years, Gemini broke new
ground in orbital maneuvering and the rendezvous of multiple
spacecraft, concepts essential to NASA's strategy for reaching the
moon ahead of the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth's steady demeanor helped to steer NASA back from a
tragic launch pad fire that killed three astronauts in early 1967,
shortly before they were to make the first Earth orbital test
flight of the Apollo capsule.
</P>
<P>
   By Christmas 1968, an Apollo crew was orbiting the moon. On July
20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
stepped onto the lunar surface in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 11's flight satisfied the mandate from President Kennedy,
issued within days of Shepard's 15-minute Mercury flight, that
American astronauts reach the moon and return safely to Earth by
1970.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade at the Manned Spacecraft Center's helm,
Gilruth stepped down on Jan. 17, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on to the agency's Washington headquarters, he served as
NASA's director of personnel development until his retirement in
December 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Gilruth spent four decades with NASA and its
predecessor, NACA. Among his many accomplishments, he was a member
of the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nashwauk, Minn., on Oct. 8, 1913, he earned bachelor's
and master's degrees in aeronautical engineering from the
University of Minnesota. Shortly after graduation in 1936, he began
his career in flight research at Langley.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Gilruth was drawn to research in high speed flight.
Limitations in the sophistication of wind tunnels, then an
essential tool in evaluating the flight characteristics of new
aircraft design, forced Gilruth and his colleagues to innovate.
</P>
<P>
   They did so, first by dropping their models from high altitude
aircraft to achieve supersonic velocities and then by fastening
their prototypes to small rockets.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950's, Gilruth was in charge of Langley's pilotless
aircraft research division, which supported the research of a range
of military and civilian piloted rocket research projects,
including the X-15 and Dyna-Soar. All contributed to the eventual
development of the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he inspired those he worked with,
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilruth's management style developed the best minds in the
space program into the finest organization of its time,'' said
Chris Kraft of Houston, who served as Gilruth's deputy and
Johnson's director of flight operations. Now retired, Kraft
succeeded Gilruth, serving as Johnson's director for nearly 11
years.

LET EXPLOITATION CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, there's plenty of crying in baseball. Just watch any of the
Little League World Series games on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC leading up
to, and including, the championship next week.
</P>
<P>
   But cry as they might, this is just the beginning of a
relationship not so quietly bordering on _ dare we say it _
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next season, there'll be 16 teams in the Little League
World Series instead of eight. There'll be a U.S. Championship game
on Saturday, followed by the World Championship on Sunday. And the
U.S. Regional Championship telecasts, which numbered four on ESPN2
this week, will increase to eight in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   They're adding another field in tiny Williamsport, Pa., to
accommodate this gold rush. And the dough that Little League
suddenly has in its budget to make all this happen? It came, of
course, from the kid-friendly family of Disney sports networks,
which recently extended its contract through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Little League World Series title game was once a
special event on ABC's ``Wide World of Sports,'' it's become a
televis property hotter than an aluminum-bench seat on a Saturday
afternoon in July.
</P>
<P>
   Innocence left this game years ago. Greed has taken over. Using
11- and 12-year-olds, forced to grow up so much quicker these days
whether they're emotionally ready or not, doesn't seem to matter.
</P>
<P>
   And it's so much so that ESPN made other strategic changes in
its summer programming for fun and profit.
</P>
<P>
   You might not notice it, but the X Games are in August for the
first time (the first five were held in June). And a closer
examination of the schedule shows all six of ESPN2's X Games
telecasts and two of ESPN's X Games shows will follow Little League
World Series telecasts. ABC's final day of X Games coverage a week
from Saturday will precede its coverage of the Little League title
game.
</P>
<P>
   Congrats all around to Disney for finding a way to reach its
much-sought kids TV demographic. Cartoons aren't enough,
apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Run all the ads for Disneyland, Disney movies and Disney toys
you can cram into a Little League telecast, too. At this rate, the
Little League World Series will look like the NCAA men's basketball
tournament, sponsored by some dot-com video-game maker and moved to
Orlando, Fla., by the time this year's players finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   __ Local radio buzz: The lineup for the new Fox Sports Radio
Network, scheduled for launch out of the Premiere Radio Network's
new Sherman Oaks studios a week from Monday, includes several Fox
TV personalities, with one promiment exception.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Olbermann's contractual obligations to the WinStar
syndicators, where he does weekday commentaries, prevents him from
doing anything for his primary employer's latest venture.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Jeanne Zelasko, Kevin Frazier, Chris Myers and Steve
Lyons will be co-hosting mid-day shows, with Tony Bruno providing
the morning fare from 5 to 9 a.m. The station won't have
programming from 9 a.m. to noon to continue giving Premiere's
premier man, Jim Rome, his window of smackdom.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel-owned stations KXTA-AM (1150) and XTRA-AM (690)
will use programming from that Fox lineup, but don't expect
anything other than overnights or weekends (where Tom Murray has a
7-to-9 a.m. show on Saturdays). Rumors continue that Clear
Channel-owned KRLA-AM (570), which already runs Angels and Lakers
games, will eventually become the 24-hour all-sports affiliate for
the network.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forward lateral: In Tuesday's edition of The Chicago
Sun-Times, columnist Jay Mariotti wrote of Dennis Miller's second
``Monday Night Football'' exhibition performance:
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) was such a hoot Monday night that I can't wait for the
next Monday night. . . . (Miller) was looking to find a balance
between comedic timing and passable football knowledge. He thrived
in both arenas, firing off an impressive flurry of nuggets and
observations while turning an unwatchable exhibition blowout into a
must-hear howltrack from the start to signoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Miller, who claims to have stopped reading the
newspaper sports section or listening to sports-talk-show critiques
of his work, made a special appearance on Mariotti's One-on-One
Sports show the day that review came out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just staying out of the way,'' Miller said on the show
heard locally on KMPC-AM 1540. ``I'll let America judge. Everyone
has an opinion. . . . It's too pressurized a job to hear people
abuse you on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, cha-cha, it's only been two weeks, all right? Just
decompress, babe. It's not time for you and Teddy Koppel to start
blow-dryin' your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the sooner Al Michaels figures out that he doesn't have
to match you quip for quip, the faster the chemistry project will
progress.
</P>
<P>
   __ Showing his stripes: Probably not a great precedent allowing
Matt Millen, the broadcaster, to pretend to be Matt Millen, the NFL
official, when he not only wears the Foot Locker costume Sunday for
Fox's coverage of the Tampa Bay-New England exhibition but the
camera cap that now goes with the job.
</P>
<P>
   Millen will act as the game's umpire for the entire third
quarter, preparing for this promotional task by spending the last
two months at the NFL's officials' clinic as well as working at
several team's training camps. All in the hope that he captures
some excellent video for the game's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he remembers that he's not allowed to tackle anyone out
there,'' Fox's John Madden said.

WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Speculation about how News Corp's pending $3.5 billion
purchase of Chris-Craft TV stations will affect local sports
coverage. For example, with Fox taking control of both Channel 11
and 13, Dodgers over-the-air coverage could switch from KTLA
Channel 5 when the current contract runs out. The sale probably
won't go down until middle of next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ At last, a new motif in Bristol, Conn. What an ESPN press
release calls a ``multi-purpose, state-of-the-art studio'' _
another Staples Center? _ will debut on the 3 p.m. ``SportsCenter''
and strangely look and act as functionally as the Fox Sports Net's
``National Sports Report'' set. It'll also be used for most all
other ESPN studio shows. Easy on the eyes? Probably not. But the
old ESPN wood-and-nails studio, in use since 1994, was set for the
scrap heap upon its debut, so the change is long overdue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Appearing on so-far, so-great ``The Keith Olbermann Evening
News,'' yammering-without-a-script actor Robert Wuhl surmised why
athletes probably shouldn't be dragged into this current Screen
Actors Guild strike. ``Athletes aren't actors,'' said the creator
and star of the HBO drama ``Arli$$.'' ``If you don't believe me,
just watch my show.'' We tried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ On last week's episode, USA Today media columnist Rudy
Martzke nailed it with a dead-on performance of himself that
included the customary made-for-cable profanity. Have him appear
each week, and there's the best-ever reason to refrain from tuning
in and forcing the substitution of a repeat of ``Taxicab
Confessions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Lookalikes: Tom Kelly on Fox Sports Net's ``Golf the West''
and Ted Knight in ``Caddyshack.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Why are they so uptight at TV Guide? The renown bible of
television listings gave a ``jeer'' to ESPN's ``Baseball Tonight''
because its opening theme sounds too similar to the horn riffs from
Steve Wonder's hit ``Uptight (Everything's Alright).'' Only so many
notes in the solar system. Draw your own misguided conclusions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Don't feel stuck watching ABC's coverage of Arena Bowl XIV on
Sunday morning. KRLA-AM has agreed to carry live the syndicated
broadcast of the Orlando Predators-Nashville Kats clash with Larry
Kahn and Mike Lamb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Sunday's episode of ``Goin' Deep'' on Fox Sports Net includes
a story about the corrupt world of canine Frisbee competition. No,
really.

SPORTS COLUMN: `GOSH, HE HITS THE BALL A LONG WAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ On the tee of the 166-yard eighth hole at
Valhalla, Tiger Woods lofted a 9-iron that stopped about 12 feet
from the cup. Jack Nicklaus then hit a 6-iron. When his ball rolled
up and bumped into Woods' ball, he looked over at Woods and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept turning my club upside down,'' the 60-year-old Golden
Bear said later, with a smile. ``I told him, `Turn yours upside
down so it looks like we are playing the same club.' Gosh, he hits
the ball a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods launched a typical number of 300-yard drives in opening
his quest for consecutive Professional Golfers Association titles
with what Nicklaus called ``the easiest 66'' you would ever see.
But the Golden Bear was most impressed by the reigning 24-year-old
U.S. Open and British Open champion's 9-iron at that eighth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger played a club that would leave him short of the little
hollows in the green,'' he said. ``Rather than taking an 8-iron and
just putting it in there, he aimed it over the bunker, carried the
bunker, but played it short. I thought that was a very intelligent
shot, but I never thought you could do it with a 9-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Jack Nicklaus had never played golf with Tiger
Woods in competition, but before the 1996 Masters, when Woods was
still an amateur, Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer had played a practice
round with him. That's when Nicklaus predicted that Woods would win
as many Masters as the combined total he and Palmer had won,
meaning 10.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has already completed a career Grand Slam of the four
majors at a younger age than Nicklaus did (at 26), but Nicklaus'
total of 18 major pro titles remains a monument to his stature as
history's best golfer. And here they were together in the same
threesome with Vijay Singh, the winner of the Masters this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Nicklaus struggled to a five-over-par 77 before their
huge gallery, his career stature upstaged Woods. Singh, also with a
77, was virtually invisible on the Valhalla course, which Nicklaus
designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an honor playing with Jack,'' Woods said. ``Everybody
was yelling, `Jack, Jack,' and he's waving. I just walked up to my
ball, marked it, then lined up my putt, made it or missed it and
went to the next tee. `Jack, Jack, look over here, Jack.' No one
saw me. It was kind of nice. But you could tell Jack's mind really
wasn't there initially.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those cheers for Nicklaus were the gallery's way of
sending condolences. His 90-year-old mother, Helen, died Wednesday
in Columbus, Ohio, after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother would always say: `I hope I don't pass away this
week. It's such a big week, I don't want to mess up your week. I
want you to play,''' Nicklaus said. ``I had no desire to be here, I
promise you, but I think the PGA of America, Valhalla, the
tournament, my pairing, were all things that were important and
that is what she would have wanted me to do, so that is what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   And after his first up-close-and-personal look at Woods in a
tournament round, Nicklaus had only glowing words for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal control, phenomenal concentration,'' Nicklaus said.
``That was a real treat to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything wild. He hit a couple of off-line shots
that upset him for two seconds, then he focused on what he was
going to do to get back in play. Reminded me a little of what I
used to do; hit a bad shot, get upset with myself, get it over with
and get on with the business at hand. He does that very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus remembered having played with another career Grand Slam
golfer, the late Gene Sarazen, in the first two rounds of the 1971
PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gene was 66, 67,'' he said. ``It was a real privilege
for me to play with him and he had the opportunity to watch me in
the prime of my career. And now I had the opportunity to watch
Tiger in the prime of his career in competition. It was something I
wanted to do. I don't mind the shoe being on the other foot. It was
on the other foot long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, Woods and Singh will be playing together again in
Friday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can shoot a little bit better score,'' the Golden
Bear said. ``I said earlier in the week that Tiger and Vijay were
going to be in a pro-am this week whether they wanted to or not.
The only trouble was, I didn't get enough strokes.'' &QL;

BUSH SAYS HE'LL DEBATE THREE TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Tex. _ Threatening to abandon the debate format set by a
bipartisan commission, George W. Bush agreed Thursday to
participate in three presidential debates this fall, but said he
would consider dozens of alternatives to the officially proposed
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign cast the announcement in historic terms,
saying that because vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney would
also participate in two debates, the campaign was agreeing to ``a
record number'' in modern election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show we are absolutely willing and eager to
debate by agreeing to a number that is more than the norm,'' Bush
communications director Karen Hughes said. In 1992 the presidential
candidates also held three debates, but the vice presidential
contenders have traditionally held only one.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which the campaign settled on Thursday, suggests that
Bush may play hardball with the Commission on Presidential Debates,
the bipartisan organization that has structured the debates since
1988. Although the commission laid out a three-debate schedule
eight months ago _ including one to be held in Boston _ the Bush
campaign said the group would get no special consideration during
negotiations over where and when to debate Al Gore. Bush
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the group will ``have to negotiate
like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, by unilaterally bypassing the official commission, the
Bush campaign appeared eager to set the terms of the debates.
According to Bush one aide, the commission has thus far been
unwilling to negotiate the timing, structure and location of the
debates, including who would be invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their position all along has been very rigid and inflexible,''
said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman. ``That's not to say that if
they're willing to talk it's off the table. Nothing is off the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Bush would be inclined to skip a debate held in
Boston, where a liberal constituency might rally in support of
Gore, Bartlett said: ``Location is in question because we have not
agreed to any of them.'' The Boston debate had been set for Oct. 3,
with two subsequent debates to be held in St. Louis and Wake
Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign jumped on the announcement immediately,
interpreting it as further evidence that Bush is trying to avoid
debating altogether. Mocking Bush's refusal to agree to debate
until now, Gore campaign chairman William Daley said he would
``welcome Governor Bush's newfound interest in debates,'' but
strongly urged Bush to accept the traditional format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our campaign is ready to meet with Governor Bush's campaign
tomorrow,'' Daley said in a statement. ``We believe other debates _
in addition to, not instead of, the debates proposed by the
Commission on Presidential Debates _ would be in the best interest
of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore agreed months ago to the commission's debates, as well as
several others, but would be willing to renegotiate the timing and
location, Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has received offers from 42 different potential sponsors,
ranging from the late-night comedy host David Letterman to the
Dallas Morning News. Campaign manager Joe Allbaugh and Andrew Card,
a Massachusetts native who served as chairman of the Republican
National Convention, are in the process of sifting through the
various offers, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   After the first televised debates in 1960, presidential
candidates did not debate each other again until 1976, and only
began doing so under the systematic organization of the Commission
on Presidential Debates 12 years after that. To narrow the event to
only serious contenders, the bipartisan commission expects
participants to meet three standards: Being constitutionally
eligible to be president; being on enough state ballots to be
mathematically eligible to win office; and having at least 15
percent of support in five nationally recognized polls.
</P>
<P>
   Past controversies over the debate system have focused mainly on
who will participate, as third-party candidates fought for a place
on the panel. This year, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader is
waging a fierce battle to join in, even though he has risen no
higher than 9 percent in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   The format, on the other hand, has in most cases been settled by
the leading candidates and the commission. The commission this year
has proposed several formats, including having one ``town hall''
style debate, and another debate to be moderated by a single
person. In an interview earlier this week, former Democratic
National Committee chairman Paul Kirk, a co-chair of the
commission, said they would be willing to consider a variety of
formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main purpose is for the candidates to have as much
interchange as they can,'' Kirk said. The commission has been
planning this year's debates for more than two years.

FOR THE FAMILIES, ANGER MIXES WITH MOURNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE with SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia _ In this northern port city that lives off the
Russian navy, the mourning has already begun. Few now hold out any
hope for the lives of the 118 men aboard the submarine Kursk, which
has been trapped under the Barents Sea for six days.
</P>
<P>
   With summer drawing to a close here and the air already chilly,
stems of fireweed, a purple flower, brushed gently Thursday against
the cement walls of Repair Factory No. 35, which fixes submarines.
Inside, Vitaly Ryabov, a sailor on a nuclear-powered submarine,
stopped to compare the tragedy with a brief emergency on board his
vessel years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in a hell that you can't imagine,'' said Ryabov, 29,
who is still committed to his career, which was also his father's.
``It's freezing cold down there. You know there's help right above
you, but you are waiting for death. If anyone is left alive, it's
only the strongest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone here has been touched by the catastrophe, in
which the Kursk sank to the bottom of the sea on Saturday. Just
under a million people live in the region, which is still dominated
by the navy bases and closed cities erected by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, they were to be joined by more anxious relatives,
as train No. 140, full of bronzed Russian vacationers returning
from southern resorts, took on a much grimmer load Thursday.
Boarding the Simferopol-Murmansk train Thursday in Kursk were the
families of seven sailors of the city's namesake nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   One relative, Ruslan Kuznetsov, with dark circles under his
eyes, clutched a Russian tabloid featuring a big portrait of his
older brother, 28-year-old Viktor, and an article about how their
mother, just out of the hospital after major surgery, was waiting
anxiously in Kursk for news of her son.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, mothers and brothers were not the only ones
waiting with anguish. Government officials in Murmansk spoke in
quiet tones as they offered little reassurance. The region's
governor, looking drawn, seemed almost to speak of the crew in the
past tense. In an interview to the local Murmansk television
station, he wondered aloud about the failed rescue attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy, a serious tragedy,'' Gov. Yuri Yevdokimov
said. ``The reasons are not known, despite all the investigations
that are still under way. We don't know what has happened inside
the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials looked somber at a news conference, which was
called after a six-hour meeting at the headquarters of the Northern
Fleet, situated in the neighboring town of Severomorsk. That city
and the small town of Vedyaevo, where most of the crew members'
families live, are both secret military sites and are closed to
most journalists.
</P>
<P>
   From shopkeepers to factory workers, virtually everyone stayed
in front of their televisions and radios. Three women, employees at
the Northern Fleet Museum, did not even turn away from an afternoon
television news broadcast to direct visitors to the museum's
entrance. One snapped off the sound when the broadcast finished.
``They've watched every one of today's broadcasts,'' one woman
said, shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   Most condemned Russian officials for not taking action sooner
and for waiting to accept help from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hid it from us for two days,'' said Vyacheslav Kuzmich, a
53-year-old former major in the anti-aircraft forces in the region.
``The most disgusting part is that aid was offered and they
rejected it. Now they're powdering our noses and telling us
stories. These are state criminals. I would hang them all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the train headed to Murmansk, relatives faced a 45-hour
journey into the unknown on a train that is usually used to deliver
them to happy reunions with their seafaring sons.
</P>
<P>
   Most spoke quietly among themselves or stared silently out the
window. Piles of fruit and candy plied on them by the anxious
relatives who saw them off lay untouched on their tables.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the mothers were able to recount sweet memories of
their sons, the fathers were visibly tormented and aggressively
silent. Vladimir Shalopinin, himself a veteran of the fleet, buried
his face in his hands and cursed the navy he once served and to
which his son, 19-year-old Lyosha, so aspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was so careless as to serve in the fleet,'' he said.
``I don't want to talk. Talk to the mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadezhda Shalopinin apologized for her husband. ``He is not so
frightening,'' she said. ``He is just suffering so much over
Lyosha.''
</P>
<P>
   Several bunks down, Valentina Budykina, head of a committee of
mothers of Kursk sailors, described the weird twists and turns in
the minds of parents frantically searching for reassurance that
their sons will survive the dangers of military service. Her
biggest effort until this week was helping mothers whose sons are
serving in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a mother who said, `I'm so happy my son is in Chechnya
and not in the fleet. At least in Chechnya he's on the ground.'''
</P>
<P>
   As word spread throughout the train that these families were
aboard, other passengers expressed their frustrations over the
plight of the men trapped on the Kursk. Alexander Ivanov, a
fisherman on his way back home to Murmansk, said he had no faith in
the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the fleet for three years and feel like I crossed
three years out of my life,'' he said. ``They don't care about
people at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailors are cannon fodder to them,'' he continued. ``I think
half of them may be dead.'' He also condemned President Vladimir
Putin for not cutting short his vacation to deal with the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The train's restaurant car was far enough from the families that
at least a handful of passengers who were eating perhaps did not
know that there was such suffering in their midst. But if they had
looked, reminders were everywhere. The radio was tuned to a station
alternating pop music with news reports on the Kursk and commentary
on the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't accept help from the British,'' said a political
commentator on the radio as diners downed their beers. ``Putin is
in Sochi on vacation. Putin isn't leaving Sochi. The sailors on the
Kursk are prisoners of his pride.''

CSUN DEFENSE SHARP EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So it is too early to praise the Cal State
Northridge defense. But if Thursday's first practice in full pads
is any indication, the Matadors offense can rest a little easier
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker-turned-safety Isaac Gardner had two interceptions in
the morning practice and defensive back Martin Bacon had a
monstrous hit and interception on consecutive plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we did great,'' CSUN coach Jeff Kearin said.
``Early in training camp and early in practice, the defense is
usually ahead of the offense. But clearly, our defense is playing
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Matadors linebacker coach Terrance Johnson has what Kearin
tabbed the most-improved group on the field. Cos Abercrombie _ who
is moving from weak-side to strong-side linebacker _ returns, as
does middle linebacker Lewis Blanton. Pieter Keus, a sophomore who
played on special teams last season, will start at weak-side.
Abercrombie and Blanton had a combined 89 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting having Cos back,'' Johnson said. ``And it's
excellent having Lewis back with Pieter Keus coming in. They're
running around making plays. To me, it's excellent to have a group
of guys who know just what the system is and what we expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The linebacker corps also has depth. True freshman Ben Lorier _
a Westlake High product _ could play this season, along with Donald
Curry, a redshirt freshman, and Jonathan Howard, a junior college
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about the linebacker situation,'' Abercrombie
said. ``There aren't too many linebacker corps anywhere that will
be able to do what we do. I'm dead serious about that. The only
thing that can stop us is ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Former All-American Brennen Swanson, who played strong-side last
season, is assisting Johnson. Swanson has a school-record 31 career
sacks and single-season record 15.
</P>
<P>
   __ Zaragoza to attend CSUN: Former Kennedy quarterback Ruben
Zaragoza plans to take classes at CSUN this year. Zaragoza is a
nonqualifier, so he can't practice or play for the Matadors for one
year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Venner ineligible: Fresno State transfer Ramsey Venner _ who
would've started at defensive end _ has been ruled ineligible by
CSUN, according to Kearin. Venner, who's 6-foot-6, 260 pounds, will
redshirt this season and practice with the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: There are numerous minor injuries but nothing
serious. Johnny Acosta, Ashcon Madjid and Andrew Holt _ all
offensive linemen _ are nursing injuries. Madjid and Holt have
shoulder injuries and Acosta has a back injury. . . . Tight end Rob
Porter sat out Thursday with a pulled groin. . . . Linebacker Chris
Sweeney has contused ribs. . . . Receiver Jason Stone, who sat out
with food poisoning Wednesday, returned to practice Thursday. . . .
All-American punter Ethan Beck has a minor hamstring injury. . . .
Marcus Hardrick is out with a hip flexor.

NEW GRAND JURY INVESTIGATING CLINTON-LEWINSKY SCANDAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Robert Ray has impaneled a
federal grand jury to review President Clinton's efforts to conceal
his affair with Monica Lewinsky, raising howls from Democrats about
a political sneak attack on the day Al Gore accepted the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was sworn in more than a month ago, according to
sources outside the independent counsel's office. The panel is
positioned to help Ray fulfill a promise to announce once Clinton
leaves office whether he can be indicted on charges of perjury or
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who replaced Clinton nemesis Kenneth Starr last October,
has quietly continued the investigation into Clinton's affair with
Lewinsky, which was at the center of the president's impeachment by
the House and subsequent acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert on Thursday issued a
statement saying, ``The timing of the leak of this information
reeks to high heaven. But given their (the independent counsel's
office) track record on this, it is hardly surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   As Vice President Gore was preparing to give perhaps the most
important speech of his political career Thursday evening, his
staff reacted angrily to the reports of the resurrection of
scandals plaguing the administration in which he is top deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is highly suspect,'' said Doug Hattaway, a Gore
spokesman. ``People are sick and tired of the judicial system being
manipulated for political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hattaway added, Gore was not concerned the reports might
mar his acceptance speech. ``We believe the voters are focused on
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore's November opponent, George W. Bush's campaign
spokesman Ray Sullivan said, ``Americans are sick and tired of
investigations and scandals. The best way to change the tone in
Washington is to change the administration in the White House. That
is what Governor Bush intends to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office refused to confirm that a grand jury had been
impaneled, but at the same time denied any link to reports that a
grand jury was meeting, and especially to a leak on the night of
Gore's address.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source of these reports is not within the office of the
independent counsel,'' said Lynda Flippin, spokeswoman for the
independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Flippin added that Ray ``has publicly said this is an open
investigation. He has said he will determine at a later date if the
matters investigated by Mr. Starr are prosecutable.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as this spring Ray said in televised interviews that
he had not ruled out indicting Clinton nor had he decided to issue
an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Ray took over the ongoing Lewinsky probe on Oct. 18, after
Kenneth Starr left the office.
</P>
<P>
   Legal bombshells dropping near important political events are
not new in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Iran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
issued an amended indictment of Caspar Weinberger, President Bush's
defense secretary, on the weekend before the 1992 election. It was
the first indictment in the scandal to make specific references to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political advisers pounced on that and within hours of
the Walsh filing issued a statement headlined: ``New Iran-Contra
Evidence Released By Prosecutor Shows Bush Flatly Lied.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush loyalists claimed the court filing halted his momentum
before the 1992 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But some Clinton advisers and friends think Thursday's leak
could actually end up helping Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no doubt this leak is designed to deprive Al
Gore of his moment tonight, but you know what, I think it will
boomerang,'' said Lanny Davis, a former Clinton administration
official who has remained a friend of the president. Davis said he
believed the leak would be seen as ``a corruption of the legal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, Ray's office has issued statements
noting the hiring of about eight new attorneys and assistants in
his office, indicating that at least some aspects of the Clinton
case had not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has been in Nova Scotia on vacation for several days and was
heading for his home in New Jersey during the critical hours when
the story of the new grand jury broke. He was out of touch even
with his own staff, according to close associates.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a panel of federal judges overseeing the ongoing
independent counsel investigations re-authorized Ray's
investigation for another year. That panel said in a brief
statement that it was ``not currently appropriate'' to end the
investigation begun in 1994 into Clinton's Arkansas business
dealings known as Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Ray had argued to keep the investigation going, citing progress
on a number of lingering issues left over from Starr's far flung
probes.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told Congress in September 1998, when he filed his
impeachment referral with the House, that he believed there was
``substantial and credible'' evidence that the president had
committed perjury, first during a sworn deposition during the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case, and then when he testified via close
circuit television to Starr's original grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was Clinton's claim to Jones' lawyers that he had not
had sexual relations with Lewinsky when he was asked that as part
of Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also alleged Clinton had obstructed justice in his efforts
to cover up the affair with the young White House intern that he
eventually admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, was not immediately available
to comment on the new grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, but was
not convicted of the charges following a Senate trial. Removal from
office would have required approval by two-thirds of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who oversaw
the Jones case, ordered Clinton to pay about $90,000 to the Jones
legal team, finding the president in contempt of court for giving
false testimony about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a former low-level Arkansas state employee, had charged
Clinton with sexual harassment in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   While keeping the Clinton-Lewinsky matter open, Ray has ended
two Clinton administration scandal cases in recent months. Ray said
he would bring no charges in either the leak of classified FBI
files to the White House _ the so-called Filegate _ or in the
firing of White House travel office employees, known as Travelgate.
</P>
<P>
   That brought a sigh of relief and claims of vindication from
supporters of the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Simply empaneling a new grand jury doesn't necessarily point to
further charges in the case, legal experts said. Grand juries
expire, and in order to keep options open, a prosecutor will
request that a new panel be sworn and made familiar with any
evidence already gathered in the case.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Lewinsky investigation said there had been
no recent signs of new evidence-gathering in the case. One option
open to Ray, sources close to the investigation have said, is to
seek a grand jury indictment on virtually the same case Starr gave
to Congress. But any such decision is likely months away, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   A new grand jury probe hanging over him could darken Clinton's
final months in office. But Davis said the president likely
anticipated the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say he is immune from being surprised at the coarse
political moves of the independent counsel,'' said Davis. ``He will
probably simply say to close friends, `I told you so.' ''

ROSTER EXPANSION SHOULD BRING BACK RAMON MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM KALEC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jimy Williams will have the luxury of expanding his
25-man roster to 40 Sept. 1, ending a dilemma similar to the one he
addressed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Aug.
1, is eligible to return. Although he still wore a brace on his
right knee, Martinez said Thursday he was healthy enough to return
to the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem: Williams doesn't have a spot for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you going to take off of here?'' said Williams as he
scanned the Red Sox roster. ``So the best thing, if you can't put
(Martinez) on right now, is keep pitching. (Bret) Saberhagen,
Ramon, (Pete) Schourek, whoever it is. If you don't have a spot for
them right now, then the best thing to do is to keep your arm
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are not pitching, then it doesn't help them or us.
Mainly it doesn't help them.''
</P>
<P>
   So with that in mind, Martinez will join Saberhagen on a
rehabilitation assignment this weekend in Pawtucket against
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Saberhagen will pitch Saturday, Martinez
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the decision but I have to accept (it) because it
is a manager's decision, so I have to go with that,'' Martinez
said. ``But I don't agree with the decision, you know. So I am
ready to pitch, ready to help the team and that is about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez started two games for Pawtucket last season while
rehabbing his right shoulder. He gave up nine earned runs in nine
innings with the PawSox. Martinez was called up when the rosters
were expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Before suffering a right knee contusion on the Sox' West Coast
road trip in early August, Martinez had averaged just under five
innings per start. Tomo Ohka took Martinez's spot in the rotation
and has given Williams no reason to send him back to Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's picthed pretty darn good,'' Williams said of Ohka.
``Hopefully, he'll keep pitching good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of you who follow us understand all the games we have
coming up, so we are going to need starters.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps more importantly, Williams needs healthy starters to
pitch extended innings in the final month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had three innings of simulation the other day so that's 50
pitches, 45-50 pitches,'' Williams said. ``(Ramon) was fine coming
off that out here, so I don't know what exactly is set up for
pitches or innings (in Pawtucket). He'll probably throw 60, 65,
hopefully four or five innings. But you got to play the game, that
dictates everything.''

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S UNSAFE NUCLEAR SUBMARINES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea is
not just a tragedy for the sailors trapped aboard, it is a warning
of the dangers of running a nuclear navy on the cheap _ the way an
impoverished Russia must do everything these days. There is
disagreement between American and Russian experts over whether the
accident was caused by an explosion aboard the submarine or by a
collision with another ship.
</P>
<P>
   But either way, the underlying cause may be more fundamental.
Money is so short that submarines rarely put out to sea. They lack
maintenance and the crews get little training. These problems,
compounded by a longstanding disregard for safety, have caused
accidents in the past and could have been contributing factors in
this one.
</P>
<P>
   These problems have also obstructed rescue efforts. Until five
days after the accident, the Russians were using primitive diving
bells and a mini-sub with batteries that sustained it for only
three hours. Their more advanced rescue sub may not have been ready
for rapid deployment. The Russian government has also shown a
chilling indifference to the sailors' fate. President Vladimir
Putin has continued his Black Sea vacation, and offers of foreign
assistance were rebuffed for days.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy's deficiencies not only endanger its crew, they
pose a risk to the local ocean environment. So far, Norwegian
monitors have detected no radiation leakage from the downed
submarine, the Kursk, but that could change if it breaks apart or
if the reactors have not been completely shut down, as happened in
a 1986 submarine accident despite official reassurances to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   An even greater contamination danger comes from some 120
decommissioned submarines rusting off the coastlines near Murmansk
and Vladivostok. Most were mothballed when Russia simply ran out of
money to operate them. Some of the submarines are no longer
watertight and are in danger of sinking. Radioactive waste is
slowly seeping into the surrounding water and air. Neighboring
Norway is worried about a possible explosion from one of the
reactors, which could contaminate local waters, kill fish and
marine mammals and harm both nations' fishing industries.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Norway are helping Russia to design and
build prototype facilities for storing the spent fuel. But Russia
does not have the money to continue the efforts. One way to get it
would be to expand a program championed by Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., and former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., which pays to dismantle
Russia's nuclear arsenal but does not cover most of the
decommissioned submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The chief responsibility is Russia's, however, and its
performance so far has been troubling. Moscow has blocked U.S. and
Norwegian officials from seeing some of the sites they are trying
to clean up, prosecuted a former naval officer who has written
reports exposing the problem, and slowed progress with internal
battles over financing and demands for taxes on donations. It may
be a long time before Russia has the funds to operate and
decommission its nuclear submarines safely, but it should at least
refrain from compounding the risks.  &QL;

TIPPER GORE INTRODUCES HER HUSBAND AND SHOWS THE FAMILY PHOTOS.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JUDY HOLLAND and SUSANNA MCBEE
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mary Elizabeth ``Tipper'' Gore, a dedicated
advocate for her husband of 30 years, introduced Al Gore as the
Democratic presidential nominee at the party's national convention
Thursday, saying that he ``has always been there for our family and
he will always be there for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that faith and family are at the center of
Al's life,'' she said in prepared remarks, underscoring a key
campaign theme that both Democrats and Republicans are pushing this
year. ``Many of you know Al to be a decisive leader with strong
values, deeply held convictions, and an unwavering commitment to
making the American dream a reality for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Mrs. Gore, who was a photographer for five years in the
1970s at the Nashville Tennessean when Al Gore was an investigative
reporter there, sought in her prime-time speaking slot to give the
nation a more intimate look of their life together by showing
family photographs to convention delegates and the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know, some of you are saying, please, not the family
photo album,'' she said. ``But come along for just a while and see
the man I love in a way you may not have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who celebrates her 52d birthday Saturday, has been at
her husband's side since they dated in high school and has given
speeches and campaigned for him throughout his career. An aide said
Thursday that she will continue to stump for him this fall,
traveling separately to reach as wide an audience as she can.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic image makers say her relaxed and confident demeanor
is a big asset on the hustings. They also say her dedication to her
family and her wholesome All-American looks give her a personal
appeal that can win votes and soften the stiffer image her husband
has projected.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman and an
adviser to presidents of both parties, said earlier this week that
if Gore wants to boost his standing with certain blocs of voters _
southerners generally and women in particular _ he should send his
wife on a campaign train through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss recalled that Lady Bird Johnson, wife of President
Lyndon Johnson, made such a trip in the fall of 1964, stopping in
47 places in four days. Her ``Lady Bird Special'' whistle-stop tour
was credited with helping her husband retain much of the South in
his election battle against Barry Goldwater that year.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Mrs. Gore is ``a very appealing campaigner,' Strauss
added that she also could help Democrats running for Congress in
certain areas of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has said if she becomes first lady, she will continue
her efforts to improve mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration she has sought to remove the
stigma from mental illness. Last year she publicly discussed her
own battle with depression, which she said was triggered when her
son Albert, then six, nearly died after being struck by a car 11
years ago. She also served as President Clinton's top adviser on
mental health and presided over a White House conference on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago Mrs. Gore became an object of scorn among some
elements of the music industry and some civil libertarians when she
crusaded against obscene, sexually explicit rock and rap lyrics. In
pursuing that effort, she joined with Susan Baker, wife of
President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, in founding
the Parents' Music Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort led to five months of Senate hearings, and the
entertainment industry, to stave off federal legislation, agreed to
police itself and put labels on tapes and albums warning of graphic
material.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore also was attacked as a prissy censor on a moral
mission when she wrote a book, ``Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated
Society'' in 1997.'
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Hollywood and many civil libertarians came as
a shock to Tipper Gore, a longtime follower of the Grateful Dead
and a drummer in her high school rock band. She was dismayed to
find that she had become, in the minds of some, the worst enemy of
the pop music industry. She acknowledged in her1996 book, ``Picture
This: A Visual Diary,'' that her campaign ''landed me in hot
water.``
</P>
<P>
   But so far Hollywood has been a rich source of campaign
contributions for Democrats. The entertainment industry has given $
5.9 million to Democrats since January 1999, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, not including events at the Los
Angeles convention, making it the fourth largest donor to the
Democratic Party. Hollywood has doled out$3.7 million to
Republicans during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore has also been an advocate for women's issues and for
helping poor people, particularly the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of her husband before her speech Thursday night, she
told CNN that ``even though he's had a very busy public life and
career... whenever any of us have needed him, he's been there for
us,'' That, she said, shows he will ``be there for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she hoped to be a mother of a politician as well
as the wife of one, she said she wants her children to find out who
they are, what their gifts are ``and to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Convention has been a family affair for the
Gores.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, is a close
adviser to her father. She seconded his nomination Wednesday night,
praising him for balancing his family life with his career and for
once helping her with a dinosaur diorama after a day of hearings on
Capitol Hill. The Gores' other children are Kristin, 23; Sarah, 21,
and Albert III, who is now 17. The Gores also have a one-year-old
grandson, Wyatt Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, was called Tipper by
her mother, an accountant who suffered from depression. Her parents
had a difficult marriage and were divorced when she was four. She
has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in psychology and has
considered the idea of becoming a family therapist _ even if she
becomes first lady.

THINKING AHEAD TO 2004, DEMOCRATS PREEN BEFORE DELEGATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The five dozen delegates from Iowa had just
finished breakfast Thursday when the senator from North Carolina,
dressed in a blue suit and black cowboy boots, strode confidently
into their meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, John Edwards, had come to praise Vice President Al
Gore, but he managed to squeeze in a few words about himself, too.
How the ``struggling farmers'' of Iowa reminded him of the
struggling farmers of North Carolina, for instance. And how, as a
trial lawyer, he once fought an insurance company on behalf of a
boy who had been denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates hooted and cheered for the brief but fiery speech.
And as Edwards turned to the door, the Iowa Democratic chairman,
Rob Tully, pulled him aside, saying, ``I think we'll see a lot of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a not-so-subtle reminder that the presidential primary
season kicks off in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Election Day 2000 is not yet here, but the beauty pageant for
2004 and beyond is already under way, judging from the parade of
prospects who have visited the Iowa delegation this week.
</P>
<P>
   Few people at the Democratic National Convention here will say
that they expect Gore to lose this year _ but plenty are preparing
for the day he departs the national scene. So this year, as in any
other convention year, the party's would-be rising stars are
strutting their wares, meeting the Democratic cognoscenti, raising
some money and laying the groundwork for future campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's politics,'' Tully observed. ``In case the world comes
to an end, and Al Gore and Joe Lieberman aren't elected, there will
be people already working to fill the void.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 47, a first-term senator who gained national attention
when Gore put him on his short list of potential running mates,
logged a schedule this week of someone with plans to make plans for
a national campaign. He gave speeches to the delegations from
Massachusetts, New York and California; made a prime-time
appearance on the convention stage and several appearances on
national talk shows; and gave scores of news media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   He was far from alone. Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and Evan Bayh of Indiana, Govs. Gray Davis
of California and Tom Vilsack of Iowa, and Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the House minority leader, all had busy, high-profile
weeks here. And all are considered potential presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying among the party's noisy factions to promote their
favorites has already begun. Labor leaders talk up Gephardt. Former
Sen. Bill Bradley's supporters want him to give it another go.
Moderates promote Bayh. And liberals say they would love to see
Wellstone, Gephardt or Hillary Rodham Clinton _ who is still
seeking her first elected office, senator from New York _ run for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this ticket goes down, I think progressives are going to be
pretty determined to have a horse in the field next time around,''
said Robert Borosage, co-director of Campaign for America's Future,
a nonprofit group that promotes liberal ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have complained that their roster seems rather
thin. By comparison, the Republicans had a deep pool of well-known,
highly experienced governors who could have been the running mate
for their nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. (That said, Bush
chose a former congressman and defense secretary, Dick Cheney.)
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats note that in 1996, when the Republican Party
seemed in desperate need of new blood, Bush was just midway through
his first term and barely registering on most people's political
radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democrats from Iowa, there are widespread hopes that
Vilsack will emerge, Bushlike, from the pack. An obscure state
senator when he was elected governor in 1998, Vilsack offers what
many Midwestern Democrats think their party needs more of: a
folksy, earnest style coupled with a populist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, 49, put some of those assets on view Thursday when he
spoke before members of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees. After getting bumped down the speakers'
list by more prominent Democrats, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts, Vilsack muttered, ``I'm batting eighth in an
all-star lineup here.''
</P>
<P>
   But he brought the crowd to its feet with a story about how a
union member had given him a $100 campaign contribution out of her
tiny savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man with a great future, mark my words,'' Larry
Scanlon, the union's political director, told the crowd as Vilsack
departed.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, Edwards and Vilsack brushed aside
suggestions that they are thinking ahead to national campaigns. But
they did not exactly close the door to the idea, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to watch all these people maneuvering and
thinking about the future,'' Vilsack said. I'm just going to work
hard, which is what I've always done. I'm a fighter. And if it
works out, something comes up in the future, then we'll go after
it.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Mary Elizabeth ``Tipper'' Gore, a dedicated
advocate for her husband of 30 years, introduced Al Gore as the
Democratic presidential nominee at the party's national convention
Thursday, saying that he ``has always been there for our family and
he will always be there for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that faith and family are at the center of
Al's life,'' she said in prepared remarks, underscoring a key
campaign theme that both Democrats and Republicans are pushing this
year. ``Many of you know Al to be a decisive leader with strong
values, deeply held convictions, and an unwavering commitment to
making the American dream a reality for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Mrs. Gore, who was a photographer for five years in the
1970s at the Nashville Tennessean when Al Gore was an investigative
reporter there, sought in her prime-time speaking slot to give the
nation a more intimate look of their life together by showing
family photographs to convention delegates and the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know, some of you are saying, please, not the family
photo album,'' she said. ``But come along for just a while and see
the man I love in a way you may not have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who celebrates her 52d birthday Saturday, has been at
her husband's side since they dated in high school and has given
speeches and campaigned for him throughout his career. An aide said
Thursday that she will continue to stump for him this fall,
traveling separately to reach as wide an audience as she can.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic image makers say her relaxed and confident demeanor
is a big asset on the hustings. They also say her dedication to her
family and her wholesome All-American looks give her a personal
appeal that can win votes and soften the stiffer image her husband
has projected.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman and an
adviser to presidents of both parties, said earlier this week that
if Gore wants to boost his standing with certain blocs of voters _
southerners generally and women in particular _ he should send his
wife on a campaign train through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss recalled that Lady Bird Johnson, wife of President
Lyndon Johnson, made such a trip in the fall of 1964, stopping in
47 places in four days. Her ``Lady Bird Special'' whistle-stop tour
was credited with helping her husband retain much of the South in
his election battle against Barry Goldwater that year.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Mrs. Gore is ``a very appealing campaigner,' Strauss
added that she also could help Democrats running for Congress in
certain areas of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has said if she becomes first lady, she will continue
her efforts to improve mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration she has sought to remove the
stigma from mental illness. Last year she publicly discussed her
own battle with depression, which she said was triggered when her
son Albert, then six, nearly died after being struck by a car 11
years ago. She also served as President Clinton's top adviser on
mental health and presided over a White House conference on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago Mrs. Gore became an object of scorn among some
elements of the music industry and some civil libertarians when she
crusaded against obscene, sexually explicit rock and rap lyrics. In
pursuing that effort, she joined with Susan Baker, wife of
President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, in founding
the Parents' Music Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort led to five months of Senate hearings, and the
entertainment industry, to stave off federal legislation, agreed to
police itself and put labels on tapes and albums warning of graphic
material.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore also was attacked as a prissy censor on a moral
mission when she wrote a book, ``Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated
Society'' in 1997.'
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Hollywood and many civil libertarians came as
a shock to Tipper Gore, a longtime follower of the Grateful Dead
and a drummer in her high school rock band. She was dismayed to
find that she had become, in the minds of some, the worst enemy of
the pop music industry. She acknowledged in her1996 book, ``Picture
This: A Visual Diary,'' that her campaign ''landed me in hot
water.``
</P>
<P>
   But so far Hollywood has been a rich source of campaign
contributions for Democrats. The entertainment industry has given $
5.9 million to Democrats since January 1999, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, not including events at the Los
Angeles convention, making it the fourth largest donor to the
Democratic Party. Hollywood has doled out$3.7 million to
Republicans during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore has also been an advocate for women's issues and for
helping poor people, particularly the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of her husband before her speech Thursday night, she
told CNN that ``even though he's had a very busy public life and
career... whenever any of us have needed him, he's been there for
us,'' That, she said, shows he will ``be there for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she hoped to be a mother of a politician as well
as the wife of one, she said she wants her children to find out who
they are, what their gifts are ``and to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Convention has been a family affair for the
Gores.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, is a close
adviser to her father. She seconded his nomination Wednesday night,
praising him for balancing his family life with his career and for
once helping her with a dinosaur diorama after a day of hearings on
Capitol Hill. The Gores' other children are Kristin, 23; Sarah, 21,
and Albert III, who is now 17. The Gores also have a one-year-old
grandson, Wyatt Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, was called Tipper by
her mother, an accountant who suffered from depression. Her parents
had a difficult marriage and were divorced when she was four. She
has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in psychology and has
considered the idea of becoming a family therapist _ even if she
becomes first lady.

LEE SENIOR OF IBF IS ACQUITTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In a mixed and complicated verdict Thursday, a
federal jury acquitted the founder of the International Boxing
Federation of major bribery and racketeering charges, but convicted
him on counts of money laundering, tax evasion and interstate
travel to aid in racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Lee Sr., 66, also the former president of the IBF, sat
motionless at the defense table as the verdict in the
four-month-long trial slowly unfolded with the reading by U.S.
District Judge John Bissell of a 12-page verdict sheet detailing
the charges in the original 34-count indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was found not guilty on the racketeering charges that were
the heart of the government's case. But he was found guilty on six
counts and could face a sentence of three years in jail, according
to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also acquitted Robert W. Lee Jr., 38, the son of the
IBF founder, of all nine counts that he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Lee responded to the verdict in a hallway outside the
courtroom. ``My head is bloodied, but it's unbowed,'' he said. Lee
contended, as his lawyer had during the trial, that the prosecution
was racially motivated and aimed at him as an African-American who
headed one of boxing's major rating groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been a Caucasian this would never have happened,''
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Lee called the verdict bittersweet, in that his
father was not also acquitted on all counts. The two men were
accused of demanding and accepting $338,000 in bribes from nearly
two dozen boxers, promoters and managers in exchange for inflated
rankings that qualified fighters for lucrative title bouts.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven men and five women had deliberated for 15 days
over a period of more than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, jurors said that their verdict had pivoted
largely on their understanding of significant legal points in the
judge's instructions to the jury. They also said they had been wary
of the credibility of the government's key witness, Colin Douglas
Beavers, who was for many years the IBF's ratings chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering charges at the heart of the prosecution case
involved a series of alleged violations of the New Jersey
commercial bribery law over the 14 years covered by the case.
Federal racketeering laws permit federal prosecutors to bring
together alleged violations of state and federal laws to try to
show a pattern of illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors said that in many instances they could find no
evidence that bribes allegedly paid to Lee, Beavers and other IBF
officials had been negotiated or paid in New Jersey, as required
under the judge's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Without such proof, said one of the jurors, Aileen Smith,
``there was no pattern, and without a pattern there was no
racketeering.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Brand, the jury foreman, said jurors had been reluctant
to accept uncorroborated testimony from Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers testified that he had received many of the bribes that
the Lees were said to have demanded, and he also said he had shared
those bribes with both Lees and other IBF officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we couldn't trust Beavers alone,'' said Brand,
recalling the defense suggestion that in the absence of audiotapes
and videotapes in which Lee asked for and received bribes directly,
there was the possibility that the scheme had involved Beavers
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said that jurors also thought the elder Lee was not
totally innocent. Asked if she thought he had committed crimes, she
responded, ``Well, we convicted him of something, didn't we?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the history of the IBF figured prominently in
the trial. The organization was created by Lee in 1984 to counter
the influence in boxing of white promoters and of the sport's two
other major sanctioning groups, the World Boxing Association and
the World Boxing Council.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors invoked the IBF's history to contend that Lee had
corrupted boxing under the guise of trying to reform the sport and
achieve racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers depicted the IBF as an embattled,
black-controlled group that was resented by ``multimillionaire
white promoters'' as well as by broadcast and cable operators who
wanted to control the rankings. The defense argued that the Lees
were targets of selective prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Krovatin, the lawyer for Robert Lee Sr., accused the
prosecutors of being ``unwittingly allied with these promoters who
concocted allegations of bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Beavers, the former IBF ratings chairman, was the only witness
who directly linked Lee to the acceptance of payoffs; Lee appeared
not to have personally solicited or collected the alleged bribes
from promoters or fighters. Beavers testified that he had acted on
Lee's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also produced 83 audiotapes and videotapes of
conversations among Beavers, Lee and others. In one videotape, shot
surreptitiously in a Virginia motel room, Beavers is seen removing
a packet of bills that are strapped to his ankle and handing it to
Lee, while the IBF president in turn slides an envelope across a
table to Beavers.

MOCEANU, ONE OF MAGNIFICENT 7 OF U.S. WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS, IS OUT OF
THE TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Only a hint of redness remained in Dominique Moceanu's
brown eyes Thursday as she calmly retraced the emotions she
experienced the night before, when the leftover pixie dust she
hoped to recapture from 1996 officially expired for her.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's comeback was over. Unable to straighten her right knee
during Wednesday's training session because of a bone chip that was
discovered later that evening, the former sprite-sized, 14-year-old
darling of the women's gold medal team in Atlanta was forced to
withdraw from this weekend's U.S. Olympic gymnastic trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better today; I got all the tears out, the calling my mom
and the family and the friends,'' said Moceanu, who will have
surgery on her knee on Monday. ``It's a hard thing to actually
grasp and realize that this is kind of over for now. Maybe I'm not
going to be a two-time Olympian, but I've accomplished a lot in my
career and in my life that I'm very proud of. I wouldn't take
anything back.''
</P>
<P>
   She will always be part of the Magnificent Seven, a member of
the first American women's team to win a gold medal, part of the
surreal scene four years ago that included Bela Karolyi emerging
with Kerri Strug in his arms after her famed vault. Once the team's
news media barnstorming ended, the gold-medal group members went
their own way and Karolyi retired.
</P>
<P>
   But after a timid women's team hit bottom at the 1999 world
championships, Karolyi returned and one by one the old guard
decided to dust off their routines. Soon, five of the seven from
Atlanta were in the fold again. But only a week before Moceanu
withdrew, Jaycie Phelps dropped out with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, on the eve of the women's trial preliminaries at the
Fleet Center, only three of the Magnificent Seven remain: Shannon
Miller, Dominique Dawes and Amy Chow. If all three are to help the
United States defend its team gold, they have to be selected by a
committee under subjective criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results of the nationals and this weekend's trials
will weigh in the decision-making process, they are not binding.
Experience, composure and history will be factors, as well.
</P>
<P>
   While Moceanu needed a solid finish at the trials to assure her
of a spot, her departure might have created an opening. If only by
attrition, the mix of old and new in Sydney, Australia, next month
will be at least 50-50. Unless Miller, Dawes and Chow crumble
during the trials, they have a great chance to make the team,
whether or not they finish in the top six.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, somewhere, will be left out. Elise Ray and Kristen
Maloney finished first and second at the nationals, and a strong
showing at the trials should get them on the team. But what if
Jamie Dantzscher, who was third at the nationals, slips to eighth
at the trials? Is she out?
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to do what you do well, and do it
consistently,'' Dantzscher said. ``I think that's what they're
really looking for. But if Shannon Miller has an off-day, after
everything you know she can do in Olympic competition, what can you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was looking for a chance to prove she belonged again.
For months, she trudged on as some snickered at her weight gain and
wondered if she could uncover her coordination after growing 8
inches between her 14th and 18th birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   After placing eighth at the nationals, she was on her way. On
Tuesday, her spirits were crushed when she first felt her knee give
during a practice session. She had an MRI, but felt relief when it
came back clean.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, she tested her knee again, but the results were
the same. After the Houston doctor who operated on her right knee a
year ago compared her new MRI with the one taken before her
surgery, he noticed the bone chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part for Dominique is that she put so much into this
since January,'' said Moceanu's coach, Mary Lee Tracy. ``It's been
a long haul. In a quick amount of time, she did an incredible job
of training. That's why it's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   It is another traumatic twist in Moceanu's life. Two years after
helping the team win the gold medal, she went through a
much-publicized battle with her parents over control of her
finances. She ran away, then went to court to ask for an order of
protection against her father. Although the family has since
reconciled, the ordeal set back her career. Only in the last year
had she found peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dealt a big deck of cards in my life at such a young
age,'' Moceanu said. ``But I know things happen for a reason.
You've got to have faith no matter how hard life gets sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not necessarily the end of a career. In January, she
will sit down and decide whether to retire. In the past, a female
gymnast's career barely lasted past puberty. But Miller, at age 23,
is proof of a longer life span in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, why not?'' Moceanu said of a possible return. ``You
never know where the future lies.'' &QL;

<P>
   Maybe it is not like discovering a new bone in the human body.
But researchers have learned a new fact about human anatomy that
could prove just as interesting: the hideout of the source cells
that replace those lost every day from wear and tear on the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Those source, or stem, cells turn out to be hiding in the roots
of the hair.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, if confirmed, could lead to a better understanding
of how the skin heals as well as to insights into basal cell
carcinoma, a common skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hair follicles, small pockets in the skin from which the hair
shaft sprouts, occur in varying density throughout the human skin,
except in the palms, soles, foreskin and labia. Even in bald
scalps, hair follicles are present and healthy but just arrested in
midcycle.
</P>
<P>
   A small bulge on the side of the follicle, just below the skin
surface, houses stem cells that migrate down to the follicle root
and repopulate the hair-making cells. Researchers report in
Friday's issue of Cell the surprising finding that the bulge is
also home to the stem cells for the skin.
</P>
<P>
   These epidermal stem cells migrate upward from the bulge and
into the surrounding skin, the researchers say. Given the general
spacing of hair follicles in human skin, a stem cell need only
migrate 3 millimeters, or one tenth of an inch, to cover half the
distance to the neighboring follicle.
</P>
<P>
   The senior authors of the study are Dr. Tung-Tien Sun of the New
York University School of Medicine and Dr. Robert M. Lavker of the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The two
dermatologists have been working together in search of the skin's
and other stem cells for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their experiment tracking the exodus of the stem cells from the
follicle bulge was done in mice, but human follicles also have a
bulge and it seems likely this is also a source of skin cells in
people too, said Dr. Elaine Fuchs, a skin biologist at the
University of Chicago. But there might be other sources of stem
cells in human skin, she said, particularly in the regions that
have no hair follicles.
</P>
<P>
   She described the work as a ``very important finding'' because
it nailed down the localization of the skin's stem cell compartment
and also showed the stem cells in the bulge are pluripotent,
meaning they can develop either into hair cells or skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the body's cells have assumed their final, mature form,
and if they divide at all will produce two identical daughter
cells. Stem cells, when they divide, produce daughter cells which
can either remain as stem cells or develop into mature cells of the
relevant type. This means the population of stem cells is
continually replenished, acting as permanent reservoir for
replacing damaged tissue cells.
</P>
<P>
   Recent discoveries about the stem cells in other tissues are
suggesting the cells are remarkably versatile and that, with the
right signals, one kind of stem cell can be converted to another.
If stem cells should become an important way of helping to repair
the body's tissues, as many biologists are hoping, the bulge of a
patient's hair follicles will be a particularly convenient source.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurt S. Stenn, director of the skin biology research
laboratory of Johnson &AMP; Johnson in Skillman, N.J., said the new
study was convincing and would advance any application of stem
cells for healing the skin since the source of the cells was now
known.
</P>
<P>
   Lavker said that he and Sun have not yet formally proved that a
single cell can make either hair or skin, but he believes that if
the cells in the bulge receive a signal to generate skin cells they
will migrate up and into the skin; if the cue is to generate hair,
they will migrate down into the base of the follicle. The relevant
cues have not yet been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding suggests that any form of hair removal that
damages the hair follicles could impair the long-term health of the
skin by depriving the area of its stem cells. Stenn said that
electrolysis, for example, destroys the follicles. But he and other
dermatologists did not know why the skin generally seems to escape
damage in these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lavker believes his work may help explain basal cell carcinoma,
a skin cancer caused by ultra-violet light. The light cannot reach
the stem cells in their deep-set bulge but it can derange the stem
cell's descendants as they migrate closer to the surface. It is
these light-damaged cells, that have considerable proliferative
capacity, that initiate the cancer, Lavker believes.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists do not yet understand the widely varying qualities
and distribution of human hair. There is an evolutionary advantage
in having no follicles on the palms or soles, Stenn suggested,
because grip is improved by having no hair there. But how nature
arranges for this outcome is not yet known. Lavker believes that
the copious sweat glands found in the palms and soles are probably
the site of these region's stem cells.

GORE DELIVERS POPULIST APPEAL FOR SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Declaring that ``I am not satisfied,'' Al Gore
sought Thursday night to step out of the shadow of President
Clinton as he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination,
proclaiming himself a populist fighter for the working class who
will create a ``better, fairer, more prosperous America.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizing what may be his best chance to transform and energize
his candidacy, Gore reminded a nationwide television audience that
he and Clinton have overseen a booming economy. But Gore said that
is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   It was a speech that at times mirrored Republican nominee George
W. Bush's vow to create ``prosperity with a purpose'' and ``leave
no child behind.'' Gore said he wanted to make sure ``our
prosperity enriches not just the few, but all working families''
and that the powerless ``are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a two-term vice president who also served eight years each
in the US House and Senate, also used the speech to re-introduce
himself to the public. With aides anxious for Gore to overcome his
image as a stiff and plodding speaker, the speech was preceded by a
documentary video that portrayed the vice president as a friendly,
folksy father and family man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering a new time,'' Gore, 52, said, according to
remarks prepared for delivery. ``We're electing a new President.
And I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me
for who I truly am,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 25 years, I've been fighting for people,'' Gore said. ``So
this is not an election between my opponent and me. It's about our
people, our families and our future _ and whether forces standing
in your way will keep you from having a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Gore sought to create a separate identity, he was
once again buffeted by the aftershocks of President Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Just hours
before Gore spoke, word leaked that Independent Counsel Robert Ray
had empanelled a grand jury to hear evidence in the Lewinsky
matter. While Clinton was found not guilty of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' in his impeachment trial, the possibility remains
that he could be indicted on criminal charges that could be brought
after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare display of unity, both the Gore and Bush campaigns
said that leaks about the grand jury were ill-timed, but the story
had more potential to be hurtful to Gore, especially with so much
television coverage focusing on the Lewinsky story on a day when
Gore had hoped to dominate the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   After a winter of primaries, a spring of anticipation and a
summer of message molding, the dueling dialogue between Gore and
Bush over how to spread prosperity now shifts to an 83-day sprint
along the campaign trail. The Bush campaign said it would agree to
three presidential debates, the number proposed by an independent
commission, but the timing of them has not been solidified. The
commission has proposed the first meeting, and possibly most
important, be held in Boston. Bush did not agree to the commission
format, or to any particular debate venue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the son of the late US Senator Albert Gore Sr., and Bush,
the son of former President Bush, face off during a period of
prosperity but with no single issue dominating the race. The
campaign may be affected by two other candidates: Green Party
nominee Ralph Nader, who is attracting some liberals and others in
key states and may hurt Gore; and the Reform Party candidate,
either Patrick Buchanan or John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   With both Gore and Bush seeking to appeal to the broad middle of
the American electorate _ where the election likely will be decided
_ the two conventions have focused on similar themes. Both men have
said that the boom times have left too many people behind, that the
federal government must do more to help improve schools, and that
Social Security should be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   But the two disagree on many details, most notably on the size
of a tax cut, and Gore seized on that difference to portray himself
as a populist while asserting that Bush is beholden to the rich and
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say it plainly,'' Gore said. ``I will not go along with
a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else and
wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So often, powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your
way, and the odds seemed stacked against you -- even as you do
what's right for you and your family,'' Gore said. ``How and what
we do for all of you _ the people who pay the taxes, bear the
burdens, and live the American dream _ that is the standard by
which we should be judged.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for all of our good times, I am not satisfied,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, the convention veered between a
nomination and a humanization of Gore. On Wednesday, Karenna Gore
Schiff introduced her father by describing how he helped her when
she was little to butter her toast and with her science project, a
dinosaur diorama. Thursday night, Gore's wife, Tipper, an
accomplished photographer, said she wanted to introduce her husband
through pictures she has taken of their 30 years together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I know, some of you are saying, please, not the family
photo album,'' Tipper Gore said. ``But, come along for just a
little while and see the man I love in a way you may not have seen
him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech was preceded by a series of tributes from his
friends, including his brother-in-law, Frank Hunger;
Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist David Halberstam, who worked with
Gore at the Nashville Tennessean; and Jim Frush, who guided Gore up
Mount Rainier last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the introductions complete, Gore then delivered what was
widely described as the most important speech of his career, with
the Battleground/Voter.com poll showing him about nine points
behind Bush. Even many Democrats are skeptical about Gore's
prospects. A CNN/Gallup poll taken earlier this month showed that
50 percent of Democrats think that Bush will win, while 44 percent
thought Gore would be victorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes couldn't be higher for him,'' said Mark Baldassare,
survey director of the Public Policy Institute of California, a
non-partisan think tank. ``A lot will be determined right after
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldassare and others cautioned that not until early next week
will the polls provide an accurate read on Gore's performance, as
well as on the success of the convention in shaping public opinion
about Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait a few days for all the news to filter through
television and newspapers and through people's own personal
conversations after they see the speech tonight and read about it
and talk about it with others,'' said Baldassare.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of
Communication, said one reason Gore's speech is so important is
because the media has declared it to be, given persistent polling
that shows Gore lagging in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the polling data are totally unreliable,'' said
Jamieson. ``But the press says, he's behind, what does he have to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson suspects that the overall message of the convention has
been muddled, with too many ideas being transmitted each day by too
many speakers. That put even more importance on Gore's performance
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems this convention is having is that it has a
lot of themes that has not yet been knit together into one sense of
the Democratic agenda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has argued for months that the vice president
would pull ahead in the horse race polls once he has selected his
running mate and basked in attention to his convention, much the
way then Vice President George Bush pulled ahead of Massachusetts
Governor Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't come out of the convention ahead and stay ahead
for awhile, then they've lost another one of their arguments,''
said one Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone viewed Gore's performance as do or die.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's an important speech and that's all it is,''
said Ron Kaufman, the former White House political director to
President Bush. ``The election will not be won or lost (tonight)''

SKAKEL TO BE TRIED IN MOXLEY MURDER, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a quarter-century of innuendo and speculation about
culpability and cover-up, the Martha Moxley murder case is headed
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a juvenile court judge ruled in Stamford, Conn., that
sufficient evidence exists to try Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel
Kennedy, for the 1975 killing of his teenage neighbor in exclusive
Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   However, Judge Maureen Dennis said the decision on whether to
try Skakel, 39, as a juvenile or an adult will await an
investigation by a juvenile probation officer. Skakel was 15 when
Moxley was discovered bludgeoned and stabbed to death on her
family's estate.
</P>
<P>
   State Inspector Frank Garr, the lead investigator in the case,
said Thursday that prosecutors are pleased. ``I think we presented
enough evidence to warrant this decision,'' Garr said. ``There's
certainly evidence to show that probable cause exists, that this
crime was committed by this person.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's attorney, Michael ``Mickey'' Sherman, said he is
confident that his client will be exonerated in either juvenile or
adult court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neither shocking nor terribly disturbing,'' Sherman said.
``I've always said and will continue to say we will get a fair
trial and an acquittal, whether it be from a juvenile court judge
or a jury.''
</P>
<P>
   If Skakel is tried as an adult, he could be sentenced to life in
prison. But if he is tried as a juvenile, legal observers have
said, he might be convicted but face no prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation ordered by Dennis, Garr said, probably will
look at whether the state's juvenile facilities are adequate to
hold Skakel. The review also will examine Skakel's family life,
schooling, and mental and physical health.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Jonathan C. Benedict said he views the
investigation as a formality. ``We are confident that she will be
transferring the case to the adult court, and that we will
eventually be presenting the matter to a jury of Mr. Skakel's
peers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, the chief prosecutor in Fairfield County, has said
that no Connecticut juvenile institution ``has the ability to deal
in any way with a 39- or 40-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Connecticut law in 1975, juveniles convicted of murder
were held in a juvenile facility and then freed when they became
adults. Today, juveniles can be tried for murder in adult court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to try Skakel followed a three-day probable-cause
hearing in June, when two ex-classmates said he confessed in the
late 1970s to Moxley's slaying. At the hearing, Benedict also
presented evidence that placed Skakel at the crime scene on the
night of Moxley's death.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sherman produced witnesses from the Elan School in
Poland Spring, Maine, a facility for troubled adolescents, who
testified that Skakel never confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley is believed to have been killed shortly after visiting
the Skakel home on the night of Oct. 30, 1975, and spending time
with Michael, his 17-year-old brother, Thomas, and other teenage
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Police long focused their attention on Thomas Skakel, whose
family stopped cooperating with authorities within weeks of the
killing. Greenwich police never filed charges, even though a broken
golf club used in the slaying was traced to the Skakel home.
</P>
<P>
   The Skakel family, however, has been dogged by speculation for
25 years. The alleged association was fueled by a fictional account
of the murder by novelist Dominick Dunne and a true-crime analysis
by Mark Fuhrman that named Michael Skakel as the likely culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Fuhrman's book was published, a single-judge grand
jury was convened in 1998 to reexamine the case. Skakel, of Hobe
Sound, Fla., was indicted in January and surrendered to police.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said Dennis's finding of reasonable cause Thursday is
more compelling than the grand jury's earlier finding that probable
cause existed to arrest Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis ``ruled after an evidentiary hearing after defense
counsel had the opportunity to confront some of the state's
witnesses,'' Benedict said. ``We didn't show all our evidence. . .
. She was satisfied that there was cause to proceed.''

HAMPTON'S INJURY MARS A PERFECT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robin Ventura detected the grimace when Mike Hampton
hit a grounder in the third inning. The next indication was
Hampton's trot to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura approached Hampton during his warmup pitches the next
inning. ``I know you want two more innings but if you keep pitching
and really hurt yourself, the next two months aren't going to be
too good,'' Ventura told him.
</P>
<P>
   Things are going too well for the Mets to let an ill-timed
injury interrupt their streak. When a recurrence of pain from an
old football injury knocked out Hampton, Turk Wendell provided four
strong innings in relief. Four homers completed a 13-2 victory over
the Rockies as the Mets finished a 6-2 home stand. They moved two
and one-half games behind the idle first-place Braves in the
National League East and four and one-half games ahead of Arizona
in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Precautionary X-rays revealed a pre-existing stress fracture in
Hampton's right ribs, an injury he believes he suffered as a senior
in 1989 playing football for Crystal River High School in
Homosassa, Fla. Hampton, who took a helmet to the ribs while
carrying the ball, had the ribs wrapped at halftime and started the
second half. He left after one play, but proudly recalled playing
the next week.
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism was missing Thursday, when Hampton admitted
feeling worried and was not sure if he could make his next start on
Tuesday. Manager Bobby Valentine said Hampton was questionable but
did not think he would need to go on the disabled list. Pat
Mahomes, who started the first game in Tuesday's doubleheader,
would most likely be the substitute.
</P>
<P>
   The rib had not bothered Hampton since high school until he
began feeling discomfort in his previous four or five starts. The
pain resurfaced on the groundout. He lasted six pitches into the
fourth inning before Ventura approached him. Soon, the trainer Fred
Hina and the pitching coach Dave Wallace followed, and then
Valentine came out. With a 5-0 lead, Hampton's competitive side
battled his logical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could get through it,'' Hampton said. ``I was kind
of stubborn. I just wanted to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The training staff said Hampton could not aggravate the injury
by playing through it, meaning his status hinges on his pain
tolerance. Hampton, who has a 2.44 earned run average in his last
19 starts, can feel the pain taking a deep breath and throwing a
four-seam fastball. He said it hurts the most when he swings a bat,
and the proud hitter, who is batting .293, vowed to be a cautious
swinger. He said the injury would need eight weeks to completely
heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have that kind of time,'' he said. ``The team needs
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell had just arrived in the bullpen when he was stunned to
learn he would pitch. Hampton was not the only one recalling his
teens. In his longest outing in three years, Wendell felt like a
starting pitcher in high school. He was unusually prepared. John
Franco joked that he was on vacation because he had not pitched
since Monday. Wendell, third in the major leagues in appearances
with 62, had thrown only six and one-third innings since reliever
Rick White's arrival July 29.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell (5-4) allowed two runs, one earned, and struck out a
career-high six. He was as reckless as ever, even with a thin
bullpen behind him. Mahomes, who is usually the long man, was still
unavailable after throwing six and two-thirds innings Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell doesn't consider such trivialities during games. He
didn't when he dove past second base to avoid a tag in the fifth
inning, trying to take an extra base after a misplay on his first
hit since 1996. He was out, but blamed himself for not hustling out
of the batter's box. At least Wendell's monstrous 37{-inch,
35-ounce bat finally produced his first hit as a Met.
</P>
<P>
   And Wendell did not think twice when he dove after a loose ball
in foul territory in the seventh, flipping over to make an errant
throw off the baserunner at third that allowed a run to score for
the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't live life or do things because I'm afraid to get
hurt,'' said Wendell, who added that he has never been approached
by a Mets coach about his aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell held the early lead and the Mets piled on Masato Yoshii,
a former teammate who was jettisoned to Colorado in January to dump
salary. The thin air has not been kind to Yoshii and neither have
the Mets. Yoshii pounded a water cooler with two fists after
allowing six runs in three and two-thirds against them in April.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton applied a forearm shiver to a cooler in the same series
after an equally ineffective outing.
</P>
<P>
   When Yoshii (5-13) constantly fell behind in the count Thursday,
hitters laid off his trademark forkball, rendering him helpless. He
allowed nine runs in five innings. Todd Zeile hit his 200th career
home run in the fifth inning and Benny Agbayani followed with his
10th homer of the season, giving the Mets seven players with
double-digit homers for the first time in 10 years. Robin Ventura
and Mike Bordick later hit home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell's outing only continued the bullpen's recent dominance.
The offense added a new wrinkle. The 13 runs were the most since
the Mets scored 14 against the Rockies in Denver in April, and it
was the most runs scored at sea level since they scored 15 at home
against the Cubs on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing good baseball,'' Valentine said. ``We've
had to play good baseball to win games and we have been winning.
But a team has to know it can win many different ways.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With growing evidence of catastrophic damage to the
hull of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, Russian officials said
on Thursday that ``irrefutable data'' pointed to a collision. They
said the object or ship that collided with the Kursk has not been
identified yet.
</P>
<P>
   Any vessel that could cause the sort of damage described by the
Russian officials would itself have suffered enormous damage, and
no such vessel has been reported.
</P>
<P>
   One school of speculation is that the Kursk collided with a
Russian cargo ship. Adm. Eduard Baltin, a senior commander of
submarine forces in the Pacific under the Soviet Union, said
Thursday in an interview that the Kursk was operating in a sea lane
frequently used by cargo vessel traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the only realistic version is the sub collided with a
cargo vessel,'' he said, ``because it is in this area where there
is a recommended course for civil navigation.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military and intelligence officials have been dubious that
a collision occurred.
</P>
<P>
   They deny that U.S. submarines that were reportedly monitoring
the exercises in which the Kursk was taking part were involved in
the disaster. Instead, they note that U.S. vessels reported hearing
massive explosions underwater, which they said were distinct from a
collision.
</P>
<P>
   Russian rescue teams made several more unsuccessful efforts on
Thursday to try to lock onto a rear escape hatch of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there have been no signs of life for two days now
from the 118 sailors and officers who went down with the mammoth
submarine last weekend during naval training exercises in the
Barents Sea, navy commanders met for eight hours with Deputy Prime
Minister Ilya Klebanov at Severomorsk, headquarters of the Northern
Fleet, and decided to continue the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They said they would continue studying a plan to raise the
vessel with pontoons and begin salvaging operations to recover two
nuclear reactors that pose a long-term threat to the fisheries of
the Arctic seas. After several days of stormy weather, sea
conditions improved on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, said the
evidence pointed to a collision of the Kursk and an unknown vessel;
he did not elaborate on the nature of such evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians originally suggested that the cause of the accident
was a collision, with another submarine or an old mine, then said
it seemed likely that a torpedo had exploded aboard the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of a collision was evidently based at least in part on
an underwater video that showed the Kursk's shattered bow section,
cracked deck plates, shredded foredeck and battered conning tower.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Thursday night, Klebanov, who is heading the
investigation into the disaster, told a news conference in Murmansk
that it appeared the Kursk sank after a collision with ``some
external object of very large tonnage,'' which delivered ``an
extremely strong dynamic blow'' to the bow and forward section of
the ship, where a ``terrible hole'' was opened, causing forward
compartments to flood.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was operating at a depth of 60 feet at the time, and
may have been on an upward incline with its periscope extended in
preparation to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Though Russian officials have asserted that two U.S. submarines
were operating in seas adjoining the exercise area, no allegation
has been made that a U.S. vessel was involved in the collision. The
area also straddles shipping lanes for cargo vessel traffic between
Murmansk and the polar port of Dikson in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov called the situation
``next to catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past night, there were no changes for better or
worse,'' Kasyanov told a meeting of senior government officials in
Moscow. However, he added, ``We want to hope that there are
chances'' remaining ``to rescue the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing prospect that the crew may be beyond rescue, making
the sinking of the Kursk Russia's worst peacetime naval disaster,
generated a wave of recriminations through the Russian news media,
much of it aimed at the military, but also at the new president,
Vladimir Putin, who remained on vacation at the Black Sea resort of
Sochi.
</P>
<P>
   He went forward on Thursday with plans to meet in a summit with
leaders of former Soviet republics on Friday, the day when navy
officials were expected to acknowledge that the Kursk crew will be
out of air.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president has only appeared on television once since
the Kursk disappeared last Saturday. On Wednesday he pronounced the
situation ``critical'' and said everything was being done to save
the crew. But later, after consulting with Western officials,
including a 25-minute telephone conversation with President
Clinton, Putin ordered the military to accept all offers of foreign
assistance in the rescue operation. Many Russian now believe he
waited too long.
</P>
<P>
   The most poignant criticism was expressed on national television
by the mother of Aleksei Nekrasov, a sailor from the city of Kursk,
for which the submarine was named. ``We are indignant,'' she told a
local official charged with arranging her transport to the far
north, where her son lies trapped in the icy hull. ``We are
indignant that our children are still there, and not enough has
been done to get them out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Murmansk, where Russian naval officials had
mobilized the hospital ship Svir, a sense of gloom set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I know apart from that my husband is dying there,'' a
tearful Galina Beleyeva, the wife of one crew member, told
reporters as she arrived in Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Lyachina, the wife of Kursk's commanding officer, Gennadi
Lyachin, 45, told a Murmansk television station on Thursday that
she still was holding out hope.``I will only listen to what is said
officially,'' she said, her voice trembling. ``I will not pester
every day, asking what is going on. I think that when there is
news, they will tell us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A film clip shown on Russian television Thursday night showed an
ebullient Captain Lyachin returning to port after missile firing
exercises in 1999. Wearing an officer's hat, a navy great coat and
speaking a little breathlessly as he stood on the pier next to the
Kursk, Lyachin told an interviewer that, ``I am proud to be the
commander of this boat.'' But with a jovial aside, he said that
during the ``last hours'' of the cruise, ``the thought of being
reunited with our relatives kept us from sleeping or eating.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Russian media questioned why the military and
Putin failed to disclose to the nation that a tragedy had occurred
last Saturday, when the first reports of underwater explosions
rattled Western intelligence sensors in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sailors on the Kursk fell silent yesterday,'' the
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda stated in large red type, ``Why has
the president been silent? Why on earth did he think it was
possible to keep mum for five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Izvestia said the catastrophe had ``sunk the people's faith'' in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater video taken over several days and analyzed at navy
headquarters today confirmed massive structural damage to the
forward compartments of the ship, including the compartment that
contains the bridge directly beneath the conning tower, where
Captain Lyachin, 45, and a number of senior officers of the
Northern Fleet would have been stationed during the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials referred to a large dent in the conning tower,
another sign of collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident happened so quickly we can say it was like a
flash,'' said navy spokesman Igor Dygalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, a 14,000 ton vessel, traveled through the shallows of
the Barents Sea at a depth that several Russian naval officers
regarded as dangerously shallow.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar II class attack submarine, designed during the Cold
War to assault the American aircraft carrier battle groups and cut
off NATO from reinforcing convoys from the United States, has a
overall length of 490 feet. If it stood on end in the place where
it sunk, a 100 foot section of the hull would rise above the
surface. And, from the bottom of the keel to the top of its conning
tower and periscope masts, the submarine measures more than 100
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Operating submerged at such a shallow depth, a simple failure of
a torpedo tube, or a stuck diving plane could pull its nose down
and send it crashing into the bottom, Western and Russian naval
experts said.

CONVENTION BOOSTING DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES FOR FIGHT AHEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Delegates had arrived at the Democratic National
Convention anxious about their presidential nominee trailing in the
polls, but they said Thursday they are leaving more confident and
excited about a tough battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big feeling that there is a fight ahead of
us,'' said Daniel Krausz, 20, a college student from Swarthmore,
Pa. ``I don't think anyone had given up hope, but after the last
three nights there's more hope than there was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   A speech by vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
appeared to have given many of the delegates a renewed confidence
that Vice President Al Gore can win the presidency in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But many admitted Gore's poor position in the polls was
troubling, and they were counting on a good nomination acceptance
speech to get him back into the game with Republican George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have everything riding on it, like some people are
making out, but it sure will help,'' said Joe Gunn, president of
the Texas AFL-CIO. ``He doesn't have to hit a grand slam home run.
A two bagger will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about delegate unease began surfacing Wednesday as
Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware told a group of delegates ``there's a
lot of anxiety hanging over this convention'' because of Bush's
lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Republican observers of the convention were fast to fan the
flames of doubt and division.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me was how factionalized this party is at its
base,'' said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, R-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that questions Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles,
raised about Lieberman and his commitment to minority issues showed
a rift among Democrats, ignoring a public display of solidarity
that Waters and Lieberman engaged in on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Gilmore, R-Va., said the Democratic convention stands
in stark contrast to the unified Republican gathering two weeks ago
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have observed how nervous and dispirited this
convention is,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a bigger task than reinventing themselves. They
almost need to reinvent party unity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the convention may have been firing up delegates, it had
failed in its first days to light a fire under voters. A
Voter.com-Battleground 2000 poll showed Bush had held onto a 10
percentage point lead over Gore through Wednesday night _ 50
percent to 40 percent in a two-way contest that does not include
third-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the polls say, but except for us political
junkies, everyone's out buying school clothes for their kids. No
one's paying attention,'' said Linda Howe, 58, a probation officer
from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said Ohio Democrats will leave the convention energized to
work at carrying their critical swing state. They will selling Gore
on the issues, such as the conservative voting record of Republican
vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement officers are going to be upset when they look
at Dick Cheney's vote against banning cop-killer bullets,'' Howe
said, as she drew a sign that said ``Hi Mom!'' with a purple
marker.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Campbell, 38, an office manager from Uhrichsville, Ohio,
who wore a ``2000'' crown on her head, said she got a new
confidence after hearing Lieberman speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any doubts at all, I have laid them aside,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Guthrie, 53, an auto parts worker from Three Rivers, Mich.,
sported a button on his vest that said, ``Read my lips, no more
Texans.'' He said the tide will turn once organizations that have
just recently endorsed Gore, like the United Auto Workers, start
organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said he also is counting on the American people finding
out what he believes is the truth about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fake, misleading people with total distortions,''
Guthrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Pame Moore-Morrow, 50, from Columbia, Tenn., worked for Gore in
past campaigns. She said the public needs to get to know Gore like
she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the stiff person people try to make him out to be,''
Moore-Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Anderson, 44, a corporate executive from Memphis, said he
is counting on Gore to take Bush out in this year's presidential
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) still hasn't proven that he can handle it
mano-a-mano. John McCain proved that,'' Anderson said. ``It's one
thing to stand at a podium and deliver a practiced speech. It's
another thing to handle a debate.''

BUSH AGREES TO 3 DEBATES, BUT HITCHES ARE POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Advisers to Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday
that he would participate in three presidential debates, an
announcement clearly intended to blunt a drumbeat of criticism from
the campaign of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, that Bush was
trying to avoid such face-to-face contests.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's advisers left open the question of whether those
debates would be the ones suggested by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, which sponsored all of the post-primaries
presidential debates since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Bush and his advisers were obviously trying to
retain either some bargaining power over the length, format and
other aspects of the commission's debates or the option of looking
to other sponsors for debates that better suited the campaign's
desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush wants a thoughtful debate,'' said Karen P.
Hughes, a senior adviser for the Bush campaign, ``and we feel that
as the nominee, he should have some input into the structure and
format of the debates.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes pitched the announcement that Bush would participate in
three debates and that his running mate, Dick Cheney, would
participate in two vice presidential debates as ``a modern-day
record,'' saying that five combined presidential and vice
presidential debates would be the most in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican strategists said the Bush campaign was
clearly concerned about making sure that the Texas governor ended
up in the kind of debate formats that flattered him the most.
</P>
<P>
   They said this reflected both an awareness among Bush's advisers
that debates were not necessarily his best showcases and the fact
that the front runner, which polls show the governor to be,
typically has more to lose than gain from debates. In 1996, for
example, President Clinton agreed to only two debates while former
Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, was amenable to three.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a Gore campaign spokesman, noted that Gore had
long ago publicly agreed to all three debates suggested by the
commission, and dozens of other debates. ``The more, the merrier,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the chairman of the Gore campaign, William M. Daley,
released a statement late Thursday saying that the campaign had
told the debates commission it was ready ``to meet with them
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   With the post-conventions phase of the campaign nearly upon
them, both the Bush and Gore campaigns were demonstrating an
awareness of how large the matter of debates loomed, and were
maneuvering to put their candidates in the optimal positions.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's announcement, Bush's advisers were clearly
trying to quell any sense that Bush was frightened of a somewhat
extemporaneous contest of wits. But they and Bush have also gone
out of their way to talk about what an impressive debater Gore is,
a tactic designed to diminish expectations for the Texas governor
and make sure he exceeds them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the presidential candidates agreed to three debates.
There was only one vice presidential debate, sponsored by the
commission, in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group, has
proposed presidential debates on Oct. 3 in Boston, Oct. 11 in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.

TIPPER GORE INTRODUCES HER HUSBAND AND SHOWS THE FAMILY PHOTOS.
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDs: UPDATES to relfect that Mrs. Gore delivered her speech.
Minor edits in first 4 grafs)
</P>
<P>
   By JUDY HOLLAND and SUSANNA McBEE
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mary Elizabeth ``Tipper'' Gore, a dedicated
advocate for her husband of 30 years, introduced Al Gore as the
Democratic presidential nominee at the party's national convention
Thursday, saying that he ``has always been there for our family and
he will always be there for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that faith and family are at the center of
Al's life,'' she said, underscoring a key campaign theme that both
Democrats and Republicans are pushing this year. ``Many of you know
Al to be a decisive leader with strong values, deeply held
convictions, and an unwavering commitment to making the American
dream a reality for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Mrs. Gore, who was a photographer for five years in the
1970s at the Nashville Tennessean when Al Gore was an investigative
reporter there, sought in her prime-time speaking slot to give the
nation a more intimate look of their life together by showing
family photographs to convention delegates and the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, some of you are saying, please, not the family photo
album,'' she said. ``But for those of you running for the door,
stay for just a while and see the man I love in a way you may not
have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who celebrates her 52d birthday Saturday, has been at
her husband's side since they dated in high school and has given
speeches and campaigned for him throughout his career. An aide said
Thursday that she will continue to stump for him this fall,
traveling separately to reach as wide an audience as she can.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic image makers say her relaxed and confident demeanor
is a big asset on the hustings. They also say her dedication to her
family and her wholesome All-American looks give her a personal
appeal that can win votes and soften the stiffer image her husband
has projected.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman and an
adviser to presidents of both parties, said earlier this week that
if Gore wants to boost his standing with certain blocs of voters _
southerners generally and women in particular _ he should send his
wife on a campaign train through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss recalled that Lady Bird Johnson, wife of President
Lyndon Johnson, made such a trip in the fall of 1964, stopping in
47 places in four days. Her ``Lady Bird Special'' whistle-stop tour
was credited with helping her husband retain much of the South in
his election battle against Barry Goldwater that year.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Mrs. Gore is ``a very appealing campaigner,' Strauss
added that she also could help Democrats running for Congress in
certain areas of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has said if she becomes first lady, she will continue
her efforts to improve mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration she has sought to remove the
stigma from mental illness. Last year she publicly discussed her
own battle with depression, which she said was triggered when her
son Albert, then six, nearly died after being struck by a car 11
years ago. She also served as President Clinton's top adviser on
mental health and presided over a White House conference on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago Mrs. Gore became an object of scorn among some
elements of the music industry and some civil libertarians when she
crusaded against obscene, sexually explicit rock and rap lyrics. In
pursuing that effort, she joined with Susan Baker, wife of
President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, in founding
the Parents' Music Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort led to five months of Senate hearings, and the
entertainment industry, to stave off federal legislation, agreed to
police itself and put labels on tapes and albums warning of graphic
material.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore also was attacked as a prissy censor on a moral
mission when she wrote a book, ``Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated
Society'' in 1997.'
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Hollywood and many civil libertarians came as
a shock to Tipper Gore, a longtime follower of the Grateful Dead
and a drummer in her high school rock band. She was dismayed to
find that she had become, in the minds of some, the worst enemy of
the pop music industry. She acknowledged in her1996 book, ``Picture
This: A Visual Diary,'' that her campaign ''landed me in hot
water.``
</P>
<P>
   But so far Hollywood has been a rich source of campaign
contributions for Democrats. The entertainment industry has given $
5.9 million to Democrats since January 1999, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, not including events at the Los
Angeles convention, making it the fourth largest donor to the
Democratic Party. Hollywood has doled out$3.7 million to
Republicans during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore has also been an advocate for women's issues and for
helping poor people, particularly the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of her husband before her speech Thursday night, she
told CNN that ``even though he's had a very busy public life and
career... whenever any of us have needed him, he's been there for
us,'' That, she said, shows he will ``be there for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she hoped to be a mother of a politician as well
as the wife of one, she said she wants her children to find out who
they are, what their gifts are ``and to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Convention has been a family affair for the
Gores.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, is a close
adviser to her father. She seconded his nomination Wednesday night,
praising him for balancing his family life with his career and for
once helping her with a dinosaur diorama after a day of hearings on
Capitol Hill. The Gores' other children are Kristin, 23; Sarah, 21,
and Albert III, who is now 17. The Gores also have a one-year-old
grandson, Wyatt Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, was called Tipper by
her mother, an accountant who suffered from depression. Her parents
had a difficult marriage and were divorced when she was four. She
has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in psychology and has
considered the idea of becoming a family therapist _ even if she
becomes first lady.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Al Gore sat down at his laptop to write _ no
pressure, but everyone said it had better be the speech of his life
_ he began by raiding some of his favorite speeches past, culling
some material that had been written for him and some of his own
stuff, like the eulogy he wrote for his father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   He threw in everything he might even conceivably want to mention
_ 12,000 words in all. Then he let his speechwriters edit and
polish, tinker and tweak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the speech reflects what he wanted in the
speech, if you know what I mean,'' said his top consultant, Carter
Eskew, one of three aides who helped edit Gore's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   The top-down approach is not only the perfect reflection of the
way Gore operates, but the mirror image of the way his Republican
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, worked on his recent acceptance
speech. Bush, as is far more typical, left the writing to the
professionals and then fiddled with the text, asking for certain
changes and adding some personal touches.
</P>
<P>
   That Gore would make the highly unusual decision to write his
own words surprised no one who knows him well. After all, he wrote
his own book, ``Earth in the Balance,'' and before running for
office worked as a reporter for the Nashville Tennesseean, where
his former editors fondly recall having to tear copy out of his
hands as he kept right on reporting past deadline, never satisfied
that he had all the information.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday afternoon, he was still asking his staff for
various documents he might want to draw from.
</P>
<P>
   For such an important speech, Bush put his writers through 17
drafts.
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours before Gore was to deliver the address, his aide
Laura Quinn joked, ``It's in draft 625'' _ and not necessarily in
final form even then.
</P>
<P>
   Of this much, though, Quinn was positive: ``It won't be short,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore's original first draft ran 12,000 words, he never
intended to deliver a speech of that length, Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process was to gather a lot more material than he knew he
could use,'' he said. ``He enjoys the editing process, and that's
how he likes to work. That helps him decide what's essential.''
</P>
<P>
   What was essential? He wanted to explain why he is running, what
he's learned from listening to voters. He wanted to introduce
himself with some good biographical stories. Yet he also wanted to
get into policy details he thought Americans ought to hear before
deciding how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   And another thing: What he most wanted to do, he told his staff,
was look to the future. ``He was adamant that it not be a
recitation of past accomplishments,'' Eskew said. ``He wanted a
direct statement that says this is not an award for past
performance; It's about the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After taking his initial, 12,000-word crack at the speech, he
handed a computer disc with that first draft on it to consultant
Robert Shrum and speechwriter Eli Attie, who whittled the speech
down to 7,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took that version with him on his recent vacation in North
Carolina and worked on it throughout the week of the Republican
convention.
</P>
<P>
   He kept putting various chunks that his aides had taken out back
in _ again in contrast to Bush's impulse to pare down his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to include a foreign policy section,'' for example,
Eskew said. ``Some of us felt that might be a place to cut, but he
said it's an important part of the job and I want to talk about it
and explain how the threats facing our country have changed over
the last 20 years. That's very much him.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked, recently, whether he regretted anything he had
written in ``Earth in the Balance,'' a book that proposed phasing
out the internal combustion engine, and has been widely parodied,
he answered not as a candidate, but as a writer, saying he's still
mulling and very much regrets some sections that were edited out.
</P>
<P>
   As a senator, he not only wrote his own op-ed pieces, but in the
early '80s once turned up at the office New York Times, announced,
``I pulled an all-nighter on this one!'' and hung over an editor's
shoulder as his piece on arms control was being edited.
</P>
<P>
   Where he did make cuts in his acceptance speech, though, they
were in some rhetoric that speechwriters had come up with that did
not feel comfortable for him. His aides, for example, had come up
with the line, ``We're for the people; they're for the powerful,''
_ a line his team wanted him to repeat about a half-dozen times,
throughout the address.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't feel right to him, he told them. Eskew said:
``He said, `Well, that's true, but I only need to say it once.' He
was very much for stripping down the rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Kristin, who works as a comedy writer, contributed
a joke at the last minute, not a side-splitter but a play on words
on why he opposes a Republican-size tax cut: ``You would get 63
cents in change, but that's not the change I'm seeking in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his daughter Sarah, though, who will be a senior at
Harvard in the fall, who of all his family worked most closely with
him on the speech, and spent much of the family vacation helping
him edit and rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did practice his speech the last couple of days before he
was to deliver it, trying parts of it out on his family, the three
aides who had helped him write it and a couple of members of the
staff of his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Eskew said the speech _ now down to
5,700 words, about 1,800 more than Bush's _ was finally more or
less finished, except for ``a few little word things. He might
still have to take some things out for time, but he's not making
substantive changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew insisted that Gore did not feel pressured by expectations
and the perception among some pundits that he had to hit a homerun
to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking forward to it,'' he said, shortly before show
time. ``It's a speech he's been waiting to give for a long time.''

   In 1996, the Bureau of Engraving began redesigning paper
currency to incorporate anticounterfeiting measures like
color-shifting ink, microprinting and a security thread woven into
the paper. These days it's nearly impossible to make high-quality
money at home.
</P>
<P>
   It is likewise difficult to reproduce the exact mechanical
alchemy that gives certain cars their living spirit. Lexus, for
example, put BMW's 328i on its color copier and came up with the IS
300, a car that is nearly identical to the BMW sport sedan in all
the crucial dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In height, width and length the Lexus is within an inch of the
BMW. Both cars' profiles are what horse trainers call
short-coupled, with compact, athletic dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Both are motivated by in-line six-cylinder engines with highly
efficient variable valve timing. Both wear outsized, antilock disk
brakes behind lightweight alloy wheels and low-profile tires. Both
interiors are richly appointed with leather and brightwork, both
dashboards are jammed with avionics-style displays.
</P>
<P>
   But the 3-Series' legendary quality is its high-performance
handling, the surreal quality of being almost an anatomical adjunct
to the driver. Once in the Bimmer's deeply bolstered driver's seat,
the contoured leather wheel in your hands, it seems your nerve
endings stretch out to each wheel; control becomes less a matter of
speculation than a matter of limbic certainty. It's not that the
3-Series has such incomparable limits _ it is, after all, a luxury
car on street tires _ but that those limits are so palpable.
</P>
<P>
   How, exactly, BMW designers achieve such a lyric quality is
something even they might find difficult to explain, but if they
could bottle it, other companies would buy it. In vigorous
cornering, the Bimmer's rear tires slide in a controlled and
progressive way, allowing the car to change directions like a skier
schussing his way through a slalom. The ability of a car to behave
this way, called oversteer, is designed in. Oversteer makes a car
more lively and more fun to drive near the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Most cars are designed with a lot of the opposite quality,
understeer, built in _ meaning that in a hard corner the front
tires scrub and scuff like a novice skier plowing down the bunny
slope. Understeer is inherently safer because it requires less
driving skill.
</P>
<P>
   The IS 300, while it has the mechanical credentials to challenge
the 3-Series (in fact, with 215 horsepower and slightly lower curb
weight, the Lexus has a better power-to-weight ratio than the
193-horse BMW) ultimately fails to clone the soul of the German
car. In aggressive driving the Lexus tends to plow _ ``push,'' as
they say in Nascar _ through tight corners and hairpins, scrubbing
the shoulders of its 17-inch Goodyear Eagle GS-D's. It is possible
to get the tail to pitch around by chopping the throttle, but when
tossed around, the IS 300 never seems as comfortable and
controllable as the BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus' speed-sensitive steering felt a little leaden,
accurate but immoderately heavy, particularly at slow speeds. The
3-Series, with its joystick quickness, remains the gold standard of
vehicle dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say the Lexus is a slug _ not by a long shot.
Even with the automatic transmission, which would dampen the flame
of any performance car, the IS 300 is gloriously quick. The
charcoal-metallic test model had gone more than 3,000 miles and
seemed, by benefit of that break-in period, quicker than the cars
tested by enthusiast magazines. Motor Trend paced the IS 300 to 60
mph at 7.4 seconds; I saw 7.1 seconds on my handheld stopwatch.
</P>
<P>
   Deactivate the traction control and the Lexus will smoke the
tires nicely. The brakes are fabulous, stout and fade-free, the
calipers seizing the ventilated discs with a longshoreman's grip
long after the pads begin to stink from the effort. Sitting on a
well-damped and sprung suspension, the IS 300 exhibits excellent
control of body roll, and the ride is first rate, cloudlike and
supple in the hovercraft way that Lexus has perfected. At its most
harried the IS 300 hums like a transformer.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 Americans are expected to pick up their copies of
this Lexus, and they can console themselves with the IS 300's high
design quotient. The signature piece of the IS 300 is its
instrument panel styled like a Breitling chronograph. Combined with
the many climate and audio buttons, the drilled-out aluminum foot
pedals and a hefty globe of polished aluminum serving as a shift
knob, the IS 300 gives you plenty to look at. Ultimately, however,
it seems to lack the BMW's maturity and seriousness, a quality that
political pundits might call gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lexus yields to the BMW in driving pleasure, it
surrenders nothing in value. The test car, with leather, moonroof,
heated seats and more, came in at $34,635 _ roughly $3,000 less
than a comparably equipped 3-series. And even with the siren call
of the BMW's delightful handling, 3 grand is to most buyers a lot
of money. Unless they print their own.

GORE VOWS TO FOCUS ON WORKING FAMILIES

 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his
debut as the Democratic presidential nominee Thursday night with a
vow to work for all Americans, ``especially those who need a voice,
those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they
are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated
him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Gore said bluntly,
``I stand here tonight as my own man'' _ a clear rejoinder to the
Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this most important hour of his political career,
the shadow of Clinton fell across Gore's path. It was disclosed in
Washington that a new grand jury has been convened to consider
whether the president should be indicted after leaving office for
having lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared text, distributed before Gore appeared on the
stage at the Staples Center on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles,
the vice president said that he would give working families ``a
full range of targeted tax cuts,'' including an end to the
so-called marriage penalty and a reform of the estate tax. But his
proposals stopped well short of those made by his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to Bush's proposal to cut income taxes by
more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, Gore said, ``I will not go
along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Bush in the polls, faced with an uphill fight in the
Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic swing states that will decide the
outcome, Gore seemed to be laying the groundwork for a campaign in
which he would identify himself as the friend of the little guy and
Bush as the candidate of the rich and influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just
the few, but all working families,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he spoke of unspecified ``powerful forces'' and
``powerful interests,'' which he implicitly identified with the
Republicans, standing in the way of working men and women. It was
reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt's denunciation of ``the
malefactors of great wealth'' in 1907 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's
castigation of ``economic royalists'' during the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many
businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' the vice president
said. ``This country is richer and stronger. But my focus is on
working families _ people trying to make house payments and car
payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by
their kids.''
</P>

 &HT;    Miller, 23, relies on experienceBy Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At Bela Karolyi's training camps earlier this year,
Shannon Miller didn't feel like she was so old that she creaked
around the other gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in the gym, it's like we're the same age,'' said
Miller, 23, who is trying for her third Olympic team. ``In a lot of
ways, I'm still a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Once outside the gym, however, Miller acted her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play GameBoy during breaks,'' she said. ``I
want to read a book or call my husband. I gotta pay the bills when
I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   The most decorated gymnast in U.S. Olympic history with five
medals _ two gold _ Miller is one of the final three holdouts from
Atlanta's Magnificent Seven at the Olympic trials. She and
Dominique Dawes, also 23, and Amy Chow, 22, hope their seasoning
will match up well against the younger gymnasts' skills.
</P>
<P>
   A committee headed by Karolyi, who has praised Miller's effort,
will select the team after Sunday's final all-around competition.
</P>
<P>
   Miller decided to return in December while she was getting into
shape for the post-Olympic tour. She took a year off from Oklahoma,
where she is a junior majoring in finance _ ``I just love numbers,
I always have'' _ to train.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Miller has been asked point-blank if she has put her
reputation on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Steve (Nunno, her coach) asked me that: `Do you really
want to tarnish your image? What if you go all the way and don't
make the team? Why not finish on a high note?' I look at it, `Why
would you quit knowing you can succeed, instead of trying and maybe
fall a little short?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller doesn't plan on falling short. This time, she has
even invited her husband to watch. Chris Phillips, an
ophthalmologist who is doing his residency in Houston, has never
seen his wife compete in person.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips didn't come to St. Louis for the national championships
because Miller wasn't sure if she would perform. Because of a
hairline stress fracture in her right leg, she wound up doing only
one routine, tying for second on the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, Miller said, ``is really not even in the equation
right now. It's just whether I have done enough numbers of routines
to be able to hit it when I need to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Olympic trials were held here in 1996, Miller didn't
need to hit anything. Because of a wrist injury, she sat out the
trials. Her scores carried over from nationals, and she placed
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upstairs in the suites,'' Miller said. ``I'm happy to be
down on the floor this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was also on the sidelines as the athlete rep when a young
U.S. team finished sixth at the 1999 World Championships in China.
She wants to help her country return to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing this sport,'' she said. ``To be able to hold an
Olympic medal in your hand is something I've felt before, and it'd
sure be nice to feel it again.''

ANALYSIS: IN CHENEY'S RETIREMENT PACKAGE, SOME UNCHARTED
TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The retirement package awarded by the Halliburton Co. to Dick
Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, is nowhere near
the largest ever given to a chief executive, but it is trailblazing
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cheney's estimated $20 million package consists of a
stock option grant. And although options are an increasingly
popular form of executive compensation, they would be in totally
uncharted territory in the hands of a vice president, whose role in
the White House has the potential to affect the company's fortunes
and so place him in a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney resigned from Halliburton on Wednesday, he received
an unspecified bonus, was free to sell 140,000 formerly restricted
shares of company stock and was allowed to keep options on 1.16
million shares. The current value of Cheney's stock and options,
which give him the right to buy Halliburton shares at a specified
price, is approximately $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said that if the Republican ticket wins the election,
he will sell his Halliburton shares before he takes office,
removing one potential conflict of interest that he would have in
the future of Halliburton, the oil services giant.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Halliburton has structured part of Cheney's option
grant would keep him squarely in a conflict: 233,000 of his options
_ worth around $3.8 million, if they could be exercised today _ can
be turned into shares of Halliburton only in December 2001 and
December 2002. Because he cannot sell or transfer the options
before then, he would continue to have a stake in the company while
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Vande Beek, a spokesman for Cheney, former secretary of
defense, said Thursday, ``Secretary Cheney will do whatever he
needs to do to avoid any conflict of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But exactly what, as a practical matter, he would need to do is
not cut and dried. Neither the president nor the vice president is
subject to the criminal conflict-of-interest laws that govern all
other employees in the executive branch. Both must complete
financial disclosure statements, and politics demands that they
work to avoid creating a conflict with their personal interests;
the assumption is that voters can judge for themselves whether
these elected officials are living up to the nation's standards.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of time-tested practices that a high official
can follow to avoid conflicts. Cheney, for example, could recuse
himself on matters involving the oil industry, though that might
limit his usefulness as a presidential adviser. Like President
Clinton or former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, an official
can also set up a blind trust for his holdings. But such a trust
would not solve any conflict issues posed by Cheney's options,
because the trust is meant to be invested in assets whose identity
is unknown to the beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said Cheney's best approach would be to divest
himself of every Halliburton share and option. ``The cleanest route
would be to eliminate self-interest altogether and forfeit and
cancel the options,'' said Patrick McGurn, vice president of
Institutional Shareholder Services, an investment advisory firm in
Rockville, Md. ``But is anybody going to do that? Given the paper
value, that's putting a pretty hefty price tag on altruism.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is by no means the only politician whose public life has
been complicated by his or his family's investments. Vice President
Al Gore has become the object of environmentalists' wrath for his
mother's stake in the Occidental Petroleum Corp. _ a holding worth
$250,000 to $500,000, according to government filings. And the
income earned by Gore on land he leases for zinc mining has raised
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is Cheney's retirement package that shines the
spotlight on practices in executive compensation that critics
describe as over the top, from enormous grants of stock options to
pay that has nothing to do with performance. Carl Schmitt, vice
president at WestWard Pay Strategies, an executive compensation
consulting firm in San Francisco, said he believed that Cheney's
deal would bring more public scrutiny to executive pay in general
and to retirement packages in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be the continuing issue of the smell test,''
Schmitt said. ``It's very common for boards of directors to give
sweetheart deals to executives who are retiring. But that may not
pass the smell test in the political arena, and that may be a new
issue for people to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   The immense wealth created by rising stock prices in recent
years has made the intersection of Wall Street and Washington an
increasingly busy place. Politicians, like most Americans, have
flocked to the stock market in search of portfolio gains.
Meanwhile, public service holds appeal to many in the corporate
sector who have made their fortunes and are looking for a way to
give something back to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nature of the beast today that you don't see that
many lifetime politicians anymore _ they tend to jump in and out of
public life,'' McGurn said. ``So every time one of these
transitions occur, the boards of the companies on which they serve
have to deal with these issues. It's another one of those issues
that is going to come up in the stockholder or stock option society
that we've moved into.''
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat surprising that Cheney's relatively modest exit
deal should create such a stir. Retirement packages among corporate
titans have become so outsized today that some of them can make
Cheney's look like chump change.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Doug Ivester retired last year after a
two-year, largely unsuccessful stint as chairman of the Coca-Cola
Co., he received a total package worth $120 million, according to
Graef Crystal, an executive compensation specialist who writes a
column for Bloomberg News. And Jill E. Barad left as chief
executive of Mattel Inc. with a $50 million package even though the
company and its stock had performed woefully under her leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But Cheney's deal was unusually favorable in one way, according
to experts in executive compensation: Halliburton's board did not
demand that he quickly exercise all his options. When executives
and even lower-level employees retire from a company, they are
typically forced to exercise their options within one year of their
exit. The longer an option lasts, the greater the potential for
large gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a minority of companies that provide the full term of an
option, post-retirement,'' said Ed Archer, vice president at Pearl
Meyer &AMP; Partners, an executive-compensation consulting firm in New
York. ``Most don't do it.'' Indeed, he said, the general
requirement that options be exercised quickly means they are very
often unlikely to pose conflicts for ``28-year-old dot-commers''
running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Hall, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, said Cheney had
received no special treatment. ``All of this is part of our
standard retirement policy,'' she said.

IN LOS ANGELES, NEW YORK HOPEFULS MAKE THE ROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Andrew Cuomo, the federal housing secretary who
wants to be governor of New York, had just finished speaking to the
Native American Caucus and was heading for the African-American
Caucus when he was stopped by a delegate who had heard him speak to
the California delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to put you on the spot,'' Cuomo declared, leaning
in close to the Californian, as passers-by snapped photographs of
the son of a New York celebrity. ``Who gave a better speech this
morning, me or Ted Kennedy?''
</P>
<P>
   The delegate did not even stop for a breath: ``Ted Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo froze, shook the man's hand and moved on down the hall of
the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, whispering over his shoulder to a
reporter who had observed the encounter, ``California is Kennedy
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, at times this week, California seemed to be more like
New York country, or rather, New York political country. No sooner
had Hillary Rodham Clinton taken her campaign for senator from New
York back to New York than Cuomo _ and the other New York Democrat
who wants to run for governor in 2002, Carl McCall, the state
comptroller _ plunged into their own political rounds, talking to
state delegates and any delegation who would hear them, and of
course, to reporters. Both men even got a chance to address the
convention here, McCall on Wednesday and Cuomo tonight, though both
speeches were given south of prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo insisted Thursday that his top concern here was not
tending to any hope he might have to become the second New York
governor named Cuomo, but rather in advancing the campaign of Vice
President Al Gore, whom Cuomo refers to as ``Al.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Democratic convention,'' Cuomo said, on a drive over
to the convention center here. ``As a cabinet member, my job here
is to communicate the record and mobilize the Democrats to go
forward. That's job No. 1. Everything else is a distant second _ it
being two years away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo has received pointed reminders this week of both McCall's
enduring popularity among Democratic leaders in New York, as well
the lingering animosity some Democrats hold toward Cuomo's father,
Mario. And Andrew Cuomo is still viewed in some quarters here as a
bit of a political whippersnapper.
</P>
<P>
   So Cuomo's schedule of events is 23 pages long for the week,
taking him Thursday to the empty convention floor for an interview
with Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV, Channel 4 in New York, and to
private meetings with New York delegates. There he argued that the
success of Gov. George W. Bush to date was proof that Cuomo would
not be weighed down by his own father, who was defeated for a third
term in 1994, should he run for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned in this election is the American people
don't condemn a son for the acts of the father,'' Cuomo said. And
then, referring to his own case, Cuomo said: ``If that were the
case, this election would be over _ even if you thought Mario
Cuomo's a negative in the state, which I don't believe it is.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall has also been methodically tending to his own political
future, meeting with New York Democrats and lining up future
financial contributors in a state where, he said Thursday, he has
already raised $400,000 toward the 2002 race. McCall was loudly
applauded when he appeared before the New York delegation, where he
was repeatedly referred to as ``the next governor of the state of
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay a lot of time paying attention to what Andrew
Cuomo or anyone else is doing,'' McCall said Thursday. ``Let met
just tell you what I'm doing. I've just solidifying what I have.
I've been relating to these folks for quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo suggested he was less than impressed with that. ``It's
what I would have to believe,'' he said. ``I've been in Washington.
His is the highest patronage office. It has to be that way. It
can't be any other way. What does the Democratic Party
establishment do for you? It's not a field operation. It's not your
money-raising operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Cuomo was a bit more splashy in his
activities here, traveling around with a contingent that includes
his wife, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, and a California-based public
relations consultant who alerted reporters back in New York to
Cuomo's comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuomo, the high point Thursday was his speech to the
convention, an event that inevitably recalled the keynote speech
that Mario Cuomo delivered in 1984 to the Democratic National
Convention in San Francisco, one of the most memorable of recent
conventions. (It seemed that the four words Cuomo heard most often
Thursday were, ``I loved your father''). But the younger Cuomo
blanched at the suggestion that his own speech invited comparisons
to his father, quickly noting that his mission was limited to
talking up Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only five minutes,'' he said.

 &HT;    Woods fires a 66 to assume share of 1st-round lead
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Stop me if you've heard this one. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's a major championship and Tiger Woods is in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the remote, Mildred. Is there anything else to watch?
</P>
<P>
   If golf fans have been following during the previous two majors,
there might be only one question remaining: Will Woods rout a major
championship field for the third consecutive time or just eke one
out to spare everyone from a humiliation hat trick?
</P>
<P>
   For those clinging to high-drama hope in the 82nd PGA
Championship at Valhalla Golf Club, Woods, 24, at least for one
night had to hit the sack as merely a co-leader, having been
matched at 66 by Scott Dunlap, the well-traveled Duluth, Ga.,
resident.
</P>
<P>
   What happens from here on in could be all too predictable. If
mind-boggling trends from Pebble Beach and St. Andrews, where Woods
has won a U.S. Open by 15 shots and a British Open by eight, are to
continue, we could be in for an historical, but familiar rerun.
Players with afternoon tee times who glanced at the leaderboard
Thursday, seeing Woods at 66 before they even began, could not help
but feel they knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a player of that caliber gets that much confidence and
sees and feels the other players saying, `Oh, there he goes again,'
it gives him another shot of confidence,'' said Greg Norman, who
struggled to a 75. ``You have to get over that hump and know you're
good enough to beat whoever is leading. If you feel like you're not
good enough to do that, don't even be out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Dunlap, who has no intention of leaving but trails Woods in
PGA Tour victories 21-0, had to admit, ``He's won the last two
majors by 23 shots. I'd be lying to suggest that his presence is
anything but discouraging to everyone else involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the rest of the field, which contains 91 of
the world's top 100? If Dunlap can keep pace with Tiger for a day,
so can others. The bad news? Woods could have just as easily shot
Nicklaus' age.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to equal Ben Hogan's 1953 record of three major titles in
one year, Woods birdied all of the par-5's and the par-4 9th,
bogeying only the 5th hole after blasting long from a bunker and
missing a 20-footer. He made a 10-footer for par on the 17th, then
needed only a 3-footer at the par-5 18th after blasting from the
greenside bunker. He hit driver, 7-iron to the 597-yard 7th, taking
the short cut after the island fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing with a man who is shooting a 66 and looks like
he's shooting a 60,'' said Nicklaus, who for the first time was
grouped with Woods, joining Vijay Singh, in a major championship.
``He is unlucky to shoot 66. You're out there struggling for 75. It
makes you feel like you're shooting 95.''
</P>
<P>
   While thrilled with the opportunity, Nicklaus, who had a 77, was
distracted somewhat after the death of his 90-year-old mother
Wednesday. Playing in what could be his final PGA Championship,
Nicklaus remained in the tournament according to his mother's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what she wanted me to do,'' Nicklaus said. ``I had no
desire to be here, I promise you. But I felt like that is what she
would have wanted me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III, the 1997 PGA champion, and Northern
Ireland's Darren Clarke are tied for third at 68, which could be a
wash as competition for Woods. Love carved a negative image by
showing he was intimidated by Woods at Bay Hill. Clarke beat Woods
in the World Golf Championship Match Play in February.
</P>
<P>
   With the course drying out and firming up with temperatures in
the 90's, Woods has a great advantage hitting shorter irons into
the par-4's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger can spin it so much,'' said Fred Funk, who had a 69,
``he can hit a 7 or 8-iron 170-180 yards, spin the heck out of it
and stop it. He's amazing. He's in a different world right now and
I don't know who is going to be able to challenge that kind of
shotmaking he has.''

JACK AND TIGER: MIRROR IMAGES

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Tiger Woods' name traveled up the giant
scoreboard beside the 17th green at Valhalla Golf Club Thursday
like an elevator called to the penthouse. A fan stood off to the
side, mesmerized by the red numbers rising next to Woods's name.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods hit 5-under par, the fan blinked, turned back to his
friend and, pointing to the scoreboard, said, ``I can see Tiger
going into Saturday 10 strokes ahead of everyone else. Good God.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Good Woods to you, Scott Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   You, too, Darren Clarke, Davis Love III, Edward Fryatt, et al.
</P>
<P>
   Woods spent most of the morning chasing Dunlap, who clipped six
strokes off par to grab the lead at the PGA Championship. He caught
the journeyman on the 18th hole, matching Dunlap's 66 with a 3-foot
birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods ensconced alongside Dunlap at the top of the
leaderboard after one round of golf's fourth and final major of the
season, we feel quite comfortable saying ``60 Minutes'' curmudgeon
Andy Rooney can start affixing his smirk; this CBS weekend sports
production is in the can.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to surpass Woods _ Clarke? Sure, the Irishman shot
an opening 68. But he also stated earlier this week that Woods
clearly is the one to beat in the majors for the foreseeable future
and ``the fact that Tiger is going to play so well gives less
opportunity for the rest of us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   You like Love's chances, you say? Yes, he fired a 68, too. But
you should know he is the same guy who earlier this year said of
Woods, ``He plays his best more than we do. You start thinking,
`Can I beat him?' and he thrives on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap might be every duffer's choice, but he has zero victories
in 87 PGA tournament starts. Fryatt, who fired a 69? His goose is
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   We like Woods' chances of becoming the first golfer since Ben
Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive majors because he has led
after the first round three times in the past two years and won two
of those events. Moreover, since his victory in the 1999 PGA
Championship, the 24-year-old has been within two strokes of the
lead after the first round nine times and emerged victorious in
eight of those tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   No way would we advise betting against Woods to win the fifth
major of his career and his seventh tournament of the year right
here. Not after the Man inside the ropes with Woods on Thursday
spoke as emphatically of him as the fan we heard around the 17th
green.
</P>
<P>
   For Jack Nicklaus, his round with Woods _ the first-ever pairing
of the two in a tournament _ unfolded like a compact mirror. He
caught a reflection of his much younger self in the former Stanford
star out of Anaheim's Western High.
</P>
<P>
   The steely focus, the prodigious length off the tee, the
masterly course management that Nicklaus used to win 18 major
professional tournaments were all there, albeit in a decidedly
distinct package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus he has, the shots he hits, the absolute control of
what he'strying to do is fantastic,'' Nicklaus said. ``He shot the
easiest 66 today. He missed a half-dozen putts that were burning
the hole. It was a privilege to watch him.''
</P>
<P>
   The honor was mutual. From the time Woods was a wee one,
Nicklaus has been the yardstick by which he has measured the growth
of his game. He has patterned his golf so closely after Nicklaus'
that Nicklaus knew exactly what magic trick Woods had pulled out of
his bag on the 166-yard, par-3 eighth hole when he waved his
9-iron. The ball landed 12 feet below the pin and he made the
birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of funny,'' Woods said, ``because he asked me,
`You are trying to play short of the swell?' I said, `Yeah . . .
but I got away with it and hit it at the flag.' Most people would
be thinking (he was) trying to hit the ball up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me a couple of times what I was trying to do. Most
people don't do that. I thought that was kind of interesting
because I feel like I have an understanding of how he plays. I kind
of play the same way he used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was understandably not himself Thursday. His
90-year-old mother had passed away the previous day after a long
illness, and thoughts of her punctured his concentration. ``I had
no desire to be here, I promise you,'' Nicklaus said after posting
a 77 (the same as Vijay Singh, who rounded out the day's must-see
threesome). ``But I felt like playing is what she would have wanted
me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The small city that followed the threesome around on another
sweltering day let Nicklaus know it appreciated his presence. He
received the warmest, loudest, longest applause at every tee and
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was yelling `Jack, Jack, Jack, look over here,
Jack.' No one saw me,'' Woods said, breaking into a wide smile.
``It was kind of nice. Shot 66.''
</P>
<P>
   And 149 golfers' hearts stopped.

WOMEN SENATORS HOST BREAKFAST

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Democratic women senators headlined a
breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Wednesday to celebrate
women in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the U.S. Senate there are only nine of them, but
the speakers, including California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, urged everyone to work hard to elect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women today are the major political force in this country,''
said Feinstein to the 150 guests, many of whom quickly erupted into
applause.
</P>
<P>
   When the cheering quieted, Feinstein said, ``I didn't see a
single man clapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,852 people who have served in the United States Senate,
27 have been women, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Of the women,
12 served for a day or two to fill in for their husbands who had
just died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really proud that our husbands did not have to die in
order for us to serve,'' said Murray, who hosted the breakfast
sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has hosted numerous events this week at exclusive
locales, such as Spago. The breakfast Thursday was one of only
three events open to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the seemingly endless week of socializing and
political promoting were showing Thursday morning. Guests guzzled
coffee in preparation for the final day of convention activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, we should have scheduled (the breakfast) a
little earlier in the week or a little later in the morning,'' said
Ed Tobin, an executive at Microsoft who introduced Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said she's been so excited since she
arrived in Los Angeles that she lost her voice. But she quickly
found a doctor to fix her up. And who better than Barbra
Streisand's doc?
</P>
<P>
   The singer's doctor told her, ``If you follow these
instructions, you'll never be able to sing like Barbra, but you'll
be able to talk tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Landrieu's voice was still a little raspy, she gave a
quick speech and was off to the next event.

   SURDA, West Bank _ If it had happened at another time, or to
somebody less celebrated in his community, the death of Mahmoud
Bazar Abdullah from an Israeli soldier's bullet early Wednesday
might have been put down to the mischances and misjudgments that
can happen whenever men and guns mix in hard places and hard times.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24 Palestinian civilians have died in clashes with
Israeli troops this year. But Abdullah, 73, was notable for his
American citizenship, and for being the uncle of Hassan Abdel
Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's chief
representative in Washington _ effectively, Yasser Arafat's
ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had given up his wholesale clothing business in the
U.S. Virgin Islands and returned to Surda 15 years ago. To
neighbors who often made the journey up the hill to see him, he was
something more than a rich man with a palatial home. He was a
``wajih,'' a kind of Arab sage who could offer counsel in times of
marital trouble, or land disputes, or myriad other village
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   His home, set amid olive groves and vineyards, lay close to
Ramallah, a sprawling Palestinian-controlled city, and not far from
the largest Israeli military headquarters on the West Bank. Under
interim agreements, it was classified a ``B'' area, with
Palestinian civil government and Israeli security control.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning at 2:30, Abdullah, alerted by noises in the
rocky terrain downhill from the house, went up to its flat roof.
What happened next is disputed. Israeli military spokesmen said he
fired several pistol shots in the direction of the Israeli
soldiers. Abdullah's family said all they heard was Abdullah,
nervous about burglaries, shouting, ``Who's there?'' followed by a
fusillade of automatic fire.
</P>
<P>
   At Abdullah's home Thursday, two of his sons related how they
had rushed to the roof, found their father unconscious in a pool of
blood, then begged for an hour or longer to let him be taken to the
hospital. By the time Israeli troops relented, they said, he was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli soldier was injured. Israeli commanders acknowledged
that troops had held back two ambulances that arrived soon after
the shooting _ one Palestinian, the other Israeli. But they said
the delay had lasted about half an hour. According to Ma'ariv, an
Israeli newspaper, Col. Gal Hirsch, the regional commander, said
the delay had been necessary until ``it became completely clear
that there were no terrorists in the house and that it was not
booby-trapped with explosives.''
</P>
<P>
   The army issued statements justifying the shooting as a response
to hostile fire, and implying a need to prevent Islamic ``terrorist
organizations'' from sabotaging the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Abdullah, 41, said he and his brother, Saif, 20, had
ducked below the roof parapet to avoid the Israeli fire. Then, he
said, he went downstairs and called an Israeli military liaison
officer he knew at the Beit El camp in Ramallah, asking him to tell
the troops to stop firing and allow the Palestinian ambulance to
reach the house.
</P>
<P>
   But Hisham Abdullah, who is a reporter for Agence France-Presse,
said the troops decided that his father had to be carried out by
the women in the house. He said that he told them his father was
too heavy, and that the soldiers then ordered him and Saif, along
with their brother, Mahmoud, 13, to leave the house with their
hands above their heads so they could be searched for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, he said, were the three of them allowed to place
their father on a mattress and drag him along a rocky pathway to
the gate. Then they were ordered to return to the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They forced us to leave him there and go back, and he was
still alive,'' Hisham Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Hisham and Saif Abdullah were taken to the Beit El
military camp, where they were held for five hours and told to
report back for more questioning on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Abdullah said an officer of Shin Bet, Israel's internal
intelligence service, had accused him of having illicit contacts
with Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based Islamic radical movement that
fought Israeli troops in southern Lebanon until Israel ended its
occupation three months ago after 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah said he had tried to turn the conversation to his
father, but had been told: ``You're not here because of what
happened to your father. You're here because we were going to
arrest you anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A question widely discussed in the Israeli press Thursday was
whether the victim had opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Abdullah and his younger brothers said they had never
seen their father with a gun, and saw no weapon on the roof after
the shooting. But Colonel Hirsch said, ``My troops found the
shooter's gun in the spot from which he fired.''
</P>
<P>
   As friends and relatives mounted vigil at the house until
Abdullah's funeral on Friday, sipping thimble-sized cups of
unsugared coffee, high-ranking Palestinian officials said the
shooting boded ill for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Rahman, the PLO's Washington representative, suggested
that Israelis opposed to peace might have staged the shooting
provoke a Palestinian response, thus scuttling the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a cold-blooded murder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Imad Falouji, the Palestinian communications minister, said he
saw the shooting as a warning of the way Israel would react if
Arafat declared statehood on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they react like this, I can tell you that they will start a
war,'' he said.

PIAZZA FEVER IS CATCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether you are watching tonight's Dodgers/Mets
game from the living-room couch or the fancy seats behind home
plate, don't be surprised how far away Mike Piazza looks now.
</P>
<P>
   He has been gone just a few years, but in the past several
months he has really moved on, forging an identity Dodgers fans
once hoped they would see forever: National League MVP.
</P>
<P>
   In a season filled with worthy candidates, including the
Dodgers' Gary Sheffield and former Angel Jim Edmonds, Piazza is the
hottest player on baseball's hottest team. A year ago, the Mets
were one inning from the World Series and this season they might be
even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been the most valuable, the most spectacular, the most
dependable,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said of Piazza during
their recent run of 19 victories in 24 games. `He's been the most
of a lot of things this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just the numbers, although his .346 average, 31 homers
and 97 RBI clearly have helped the Mets lock onto Atlanta's bumper
in the tight Eastern Division race.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is headed to his first MVP award _ and the first by an NL
catcher since Johnny Bench in 1972 _ for plenty of other reasons,
reasons that never were fully realized with the Dodgers. In L.A.,
he twice finished second in MVP balloting, including 1997 when his
gaudy .362 average, 40 homers and 124 RBI earned him runner-up to
Colorado's Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
   But though he was the team's best player, Piazza was aloof in
the dysfunctional Dodgers clubhouse. He wanted to just lead by
example when the Dodgers needed Kirk Gibson to grab them by the
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, through maturity and a growing comfort level with his new
surroundings, Piazza has an expanded role in New York. He still is
not the loudest guy in the room, but on a team filled with veterans
of pennant races past, Piazza is just as important joking or
cutting up with teammates. He never let his hair down like that
until this year.
</P>
<P>
   He even has called two clubhouse meetings this season. Once in
L.A. he tried to call one with pitcher Ramon Martinez and was
laughed at by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   These days, a table for 10 teammates at a Manhattan restaurant
is a regular stop, making the $91 million man with the Playboy
Centerfold girlfriend and a date in Cooperstown just one of the
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership take on many shapes,'' said Mets third baseman
Robin Ventura, who Orel Hershiser once called the greatest
clubhouse presence he had ever seen. ``You can't have players be
someone they aren't. Mike has carried us. He is our MVP. And not
just on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza refuses to get swept up in MVP hype even though he plays
in a city that knows no other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't changed my approach to the game or to life
away from the game,'' he said. ``Just stay relaxed and take things
as they come. There is no reason to talk about MVP right now, so I
won't. The season still has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight, the Mets (72-49) are 2 games behind the
Braves in the East with 41 to play. Six of their last 14 games are
against the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the demands of his position, Piazza has carried the
offense. Earlier this season, he had a 21-game hitting streak. He
also recorded an RBI in 15 consecutive games, two short of the
major-league record.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Piazza provided one of the season's greatest
snapshots when his three-run homer beat the Braves after New York
had fallen behind 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   And after missing three games with a sore knee earlier this
month, Piazza returned to bat .539 with two homers and nine RBI in
the next four games. There were many who feared Piazza might be
lost for the season. He was back by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most lingering image of his season came in early
June against the Dodgers when he was struck in the head on a
backswing by Sheffield. Blood gushed from beneath his catcher's
mask, providing sensational pictures for sports sections and TV
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He missed a few games and later missed his first All-Star Game
in seven years when he was beaned by Yankees right-hander Roger
Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza always seemed to return better and kept the Mets'
momentum intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems a little more driven this year,'' Valentine said
``Every game he has played in has been special.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza admits he pressed when he first joined the Mets just one
week after the Dodgers and Florida Marlins completed a blockbuster
trade on May 12, 1998, that included Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was a pending free agent when he and the Mets agreed to a
seven-year, $91 million contract. Last season, he had 40 homers and
124 RBI, but struggled in the playoffs until hitting a game-winning
homer against the Braves that forced a Game 7 in the National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   During the winter, he moved out to suburban New Jersey but kept
a place in Manhattan. Piazza enjoyed the club scene and
occasionally rode the subway but did not travel with an entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an East Coast guy,'' said Piazza's agent, Dan Lozano.
``New York can be a crazy place, but Mike feels very comfortable
there. With all he's been through, he is very happy now, very at
peace with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that he met and began dating Darlene Bernaola,
who with sister Carol posed for the January issue of Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Already a paparazzi target and the subject of more than 100 fan
Web sites, Piazza's new romance could have been crushing. Instead,
he says New Yorkers have given them some space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been great,'' he said. ``You just have to realize
the attention comes with the territory. You're a public figure and
people are going to be curious, especially when the person you are
dating is a public figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found people usually very respectful. They want to meet
you and you can't prevent them. If I need a break, I hang out at
home or go out to familiar places that people know you and don't
bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   One place he hasn't been is the World Series. The buzz created
by the thought of a matchup between the Mets and two-time defending
Series champion Yankees started back in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   During his time with the Dodgers, Piazza played on one division
championship and one wild-card winner. The Dodgers have not won a
playoff game since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Mets do not overtake the Braves in the East, they
are well ahead in the wild-card race. New York was the wild-card
representative last year and defeated West-champion Arizona in the
divisional series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing great, but now is not the time to sit back
and think about it,'' Piazza said. ``If I do what I'm supposed to
do and we play like we're capable of playing, we can get to where
we want to go.''

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Democratic women senators headlined a
breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel on Wednesday to celebrate
women in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the U.S. Senate there are only nine of them, but
the speakers, including California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, urged everyone to work hard to elect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women today are the major political force in this country,''
said Feinstein to the 150 guests, many of whom quickly erupted into
applause.
</P>
<P>
   When the cheering quieted, Feinstein said, ``I didn't see a
single man clapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,852 people who have served in the United States Senate,
27 have been women, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. Of the women,
12 served for a day or two to fill in for their husbands who had
just died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really proud that our husbands did not have to die in
order for us to serve,'' said Murray, who hosted the breakfast
sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has hosted numerous events this week at exclusive
locales, such as Spago. The breakfast Thursday was one of only
three events open to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the seemingly endless week of socializing and
political promoting were showing Thursday morning. Guests guzzled
coffee in preparation for the final day of convention activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, we should have scheduled (the breakfast) a
little earlier in the week or a little later in the morning,'' said
Ed Tobin, an executive at Microsoft who introduced Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said she's been so excited since she
arrived in Los Angeles that she lost her voice. But she quickly
found a doctor to fix her up. And who better than Barbra
Streisand's doc?
</P>
<P>
   The singer's doctor told her, ``If you follow these
instructions, you'll never be able to sing like Barbra, but you'll
be able to talk tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Landrieu's voice was still a little raspy, she gave a
quick speech and was off to the next event.

ANALYSIS: A MAN OF MANY TASKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore tried on Thursday night to accomplish a
political feat so daunting that even, say, President Clinton
himself might have had trouble pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Gore presented himself as his own man and did not dwell for long
on his service as vice president as he sought to convince the
nation that he is more than the dutiful lieutenant. But he also
tried to take credit for helping to bring about ``the biggest
surpluses ever'' _ the grandest achievement of the Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to shake the impressions of Americans who consider him
boring and stiff. But he also asserted that he would build a
campaign based on the dry timber of issues rather than on the flash
and dazzle of personality.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to embolden and excite liberals whose turnout are
essential to his victory. But he also tried to embolden and excite
moderate voters who are crucial to a victory in November _ and have
shown an interest in Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that has alarmed
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's elaborate _ and often conflicting _ objectives on
Thursday night, and throughout this convention week, reflect the
trying challenges he and the Democrats confront as they emerge from
this convention. Forget all the confetti and mirthful talk of
harmony from the rostrum this week. For the Democrats, happy days
are certainly not here again. They may not be panicked, but they
are jittery about their standard bearer. And they are jittery about
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a difficult campaign,'' said James Patrick Leahy, a
delegate from Ohio, even after four days of enforced partisan
cheerleading. ``Gore has one of those personalities you have to
develop a relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls showing Gore behind, Leahy said, have dampened his
enthusiasm. ``The polling has a psychological effect,'' he said.
``It's like when you go to the race track and look at the racing
form and see your horse isn't supposed to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such worries when the Republicans concluded their
political production in Philadelphia two weeks ago. At that
convention, Dick Cheney, the vice presidential nominee, did not
have to scurry from constituent group to constituent group with
words of appeasement _ as Sen. Joseph Lieberman did on Thursday,
and the two days before.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years on the outside, even Republican delegates who
were not pleased with the inclusive tone of the program are so
desperate to return to power that it took little, if any, prodding
to corral them behind Bush. Eight years ago, Democrats were also
willing to put aside their differences in the name of the greater
goal of helping Bill Clinton bring them back to power. Now, they
are less accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   So the party tried to fire up the rank and file by jamming the
stage this week with liberal icons, from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to leaders of labor, abortion rights and
gay rights groups. Even Lieberman, in his acceptance speech,
retreated from his usual condemnation of collapsed culture of
Hollywood and instead played the partisan.
</P>
<P>
   More than one Democratic official groused that the campaign this
week seemed more focused on winning over the liberals who might
back Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, than the biggest
threat, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that unlike the Republicans, the Democrats had
less success in presenting a convention that appeared to be broader
than the party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans played to the country _ the Democrats played
to the hall,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``Voters
saw through the big tent Republican convention. They know it was
staged. But they were thankful that somebody cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is Al Gore. Whether it is his link to the
scandals of Clinton, the unfavorable comparisons to the more
politically adroit president _ or simply his personality _
Democrats here are just not as enamored of their new nominee. On
this day four year ago, even the bombshell that Clinton's top
strategist was having an affair with a call girl did nothing to
disrupt _ and maybe add a little spice _ to the week of lock-step
partisan harmony behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before his boss was to deliver the most consequential
speech of his political career, one of Gore's top aides confessed
that he was worried because the campaign is still roiled by
squabbling factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Daley has not gotten the warlords under control yet,''
this campaign official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then-Vice President George Bush, in his acceptance speech
in Dallas in 1988, did not face the difficulties of Gore. He, too,
had the unfortunate fate of having to stand on his own after eight
years in the shadow of a far more dexterous political performer.
But Bush never had such trouble untangling himself from Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic transfer of political power was far smoother in
1988 when Reagan put forth a dignified and full-throated pitch for
his No. 2. This week, Clinton was criticized for not making more of
an energetic case for Gore in his speech here on Monday _ or in
their joint appearance in Michigan the next day. The rub is that
had he been more generous in his praise, Clinton might have been
accused of injecting himself too much into the role of star
performer giving an assist to his understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's pitch on Thursday night was not altogether different from
Bush's 12 year ago. ``Instead of losing jobs,'' Gore said in his
prepared text, ``we have 22 million new jobs. Above all, our
success comes from you, the people who have worked hard for your
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush put it this way in 1988, ``We've created 17 million new
jobs in the past five years, more than twice as any Europe and
Japan combined.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the appeal will work and that people will
entrust Gore to continue bringing the nation down the path of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident, certainly, that Gore spewed out lots of
policy on Thursday night. He was trying to make the case that
``people deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of polls showing that the public gives Democrats higher
marks than Republicans on a range of issues, Gore's aides said they
hope the campaign can be fought on that terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Before he can do that, Gore wants to neutralize Bush's biggest
advantage _ his appealing personality. That explains that footage
in a film lauding Gore for his Frankenstein disguise during a
Halloween party. That is why all week Democrats, and the candidate
himself, offered testaments to the fuzzy and decidedly un-vice
presidential Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telling acknowledgment that the campaign ahead will not
be easy, Gore's aides were already playing down the import of
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important moment, a crescendo,'' said Tad Devine,
one of Gore's top strategists. ``It's the first time Al Gore is on
the stage by himself. But there will be other big moments in this
campaign, including the presidential debates.''

 &HT;    McGarity tries to make last cut at camp
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ As Wane McGarity will attest, not every
promising football story has a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   This comes from a young man who knows plenty about adversity.
Knee injuries. A separated shoulder. A broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is another hurdle to clear before the regular season
begins in 16 days. There is no guarantee that the Dallas Cowboys,
heavily stocked with capable wide receivers, will keep the comeback
kid from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything to help this football club,'' McGarity said
after Thursday morning's camp workout. ``This is where I need to
be. This is where I feel I'm at my best.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest decisions the coaching staff faces will be
final cuts. The Cowboys are expected to keep six receivers _ maybe
five _ and a few talented players will not make the grade.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Joey Galloway, Rocket Ismail and James
McKnight will make the cut. McGarity and Jason Tucker likely will
make it, too. Then again, Chris Brazzell, Darran Hall and Jeff
Ogden also have impressive credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, the players who aren't on top of the depth chart
are fighting for playing time _ and for jobs,'' Coach Dave Campo
said.
</P>
<P>
   If you read between the lines, though, McGarity's job status
appears safe. Before he missed 11 games last season with various
injuries, McGarity impressed the Cowboys with his toughness and
positive attitude. When pressed on McGarity's status this week,
Campo and offensive coordinator Jack Reilly gave him a vote of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Campo: ``Wane showed me enough last year to make me think he
will have playing time this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly: ``I don't feel he's in that (bubble) category. He's done
a very good job. You never know what could happen in the next
couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been McGarity's year of redemption. The screws that
were inserted into his right ring finger during last fall's surgery
have been removed. By squeezing putty daily during rehabilitation,
his hand once again is strong enough to handle Troy Aikman's
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Mention injuries and McGarity smiles. Mention his comeback from
injuries, he smiles again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big relief,'' McGarity said. ``All I have to worry
about now is the soreness. I've been injury-free in camp, and I
take good care of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Final cuts are hard to determine because other players have been
slowed by camp injuries. Ismail, Knight, Tucker and Ogden have
missed part or all of camp because of injuries. How the injury
status affects roster decisions, no one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can do is control my position,'' McGarity
said. ``I try to make my statement every day. It's going to be a
tough decision, though. (The receivers) are out here working hard
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity has had a fair share of camp mistakes. He has dropped
passes in games and practices. He has lined up wrong on a few
occasions. Yet he has made up for it with enough good plays to keep
him around.
</P>
<P>
   There was another sign this week that McGarity's job is safe. He
is learning how to be a holder for field goals, and it makes little
sense to cut a player who has been asked to handle such an
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's practice, McGarity joined Galloway on the
first-team offense while Ismail (thumb injury) and McKnight (knee)
took time off.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway and Ismail will start at wide receiver during the
season, and McGarity is expected to be an inside (slot) receiver on
passing downs. Tucker likely will make the team over Brazzell and
Ogden because he played well last season. A starter in four games,
Tucker finished with 22 catches, 439 yards and two touchdowns. It
makes no difference that he has missed most of summer camp with a
groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel Tucker did enough last year to solidify the fact that
he can be an improving player as it goes,'' Campo said. ``I have a
real good feel for what he did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the receivers at the back of the pack still have time
to make a good impression. The two remaining preseason games could
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's going to work out for everybody,''
McGarity said. ``I'm going to keep on working and let it all come
to me.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is just a short walk from the Staples Center,
where the Democrats, the news media and assorted demonstrators
spent the week playing out the politics of the Information Age. But
the thriving Los Angeles fashion district has more in common with
12th-century Baghdad than the California of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-block jumble of prewar commercial buildings, hastily
constructed low-rise arcades commingled with a few modern towers,
is home to 5,000 companies employing 50,000 people and taking in $8
billion a year in wholesale and retail sales. And it epitomizes raw
capitalism in both its glory and its shame.
</P>
<P>
   The district has a reputation for paying its lowest rung of
workers brutally low wages _ which drew the ire of demonstrators
last week _ and for having too little respect for trademark laws
and tax codes. But for many of those who work here, including some
who have made fortunes, the district also reflects the essence of
the American dream. It is a place where recent immigrants can build
successful businesses and new lives in an environment not
dissimilar to those found in many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a souk,'' said Uri Harkham, one of the
major property owners in the district. ``It's open to everyone, and
it's the kind of place you can go to buy something for $3 or
$300.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkham, who was born in Iraq and is chief executive of Jonathan
Martin, one of the area's leading garment manufacturers with more
than $100 million in annual sales, is reluctant to talk
specifically about the extent of his holdings in the district. But
they are big and growing. One new building that he is constructing
with his Moroccan-born partner, Moshe Aflalo, has space for 13
retail stores and more than 60 companies clamoring to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   The district, just southeast of the center of downtown Los
Angeles, was widely perceived as dirty and dangerous five years
ago, but it has since blossomed. Property values have more than
doubled and vacancies, particularly for ground-floor properties,
are almost impossible to find in much of the area, said Ed
Zoraster, a vice president at CB Richard Ellis, a real estate
broker. The city has issued more than 650 building permits for
renovations or new construction in the district since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Zoraster gives some credit for the revival to a business
improvement district, organized that year, that has improved the
neighborhood's appearance and security. But the most important
factor, he said, has been the drive of immigrants like Harkham, 52,
who came to Los Angeles in 1975 after living in Israel and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his peers, Harkham brought with him the bazaar
culture of his native land, with its love of bargaining, jostling
and quick, seat-of-the-pants decision-making. ``At the end of the
day, the Middle Easterners are all traders at heart _ Arab, Jew and
Persian, Christian, Muslim, it doesn't matter,'' he said. ``We have
the ambition and the drive others don't. The fashion business is so
fast you have to be willing to be a gambler, and live on the
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Sullivan, the editor of California Apparel News, a trade
paper, said newcomers from the Middle East and North Africa had
largely replaced the American-born Jewish entrepreneurs, many
transplanted from New York, who helped establish Los Angeles as a
leading center for sportswear and women's garment manufacturing in
the 1950s. Though Middle Easterners own only 7 percent of the
district's apparel manufacturers and account for a negligible part
of the factory work force, they own most of the area's premier
brands, including Guess, Hot Kiss, Bissou Bissou and BCBG, and
control much of the region's textile trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are better at developing brands and styles than
anyone else who has been here,'' Sullivan said. ``They are more
aggressive than the native-born. They know what sexy is. They are
willing to strike their own path and offer no apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant scene in the district has come to reflect the new
ethnic order. Many Israeli, Persian and North African
establishments have opened, and many get the bulk of their sales
from meals they deliver to their perpetually harried customers.
Korean eateries are also popping up, reflecting Korean immigrants'
emergence as the second powerful ethnic influence in the
increasingly polyglot district.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those from the Middle East, who dominate the local
industry's high-fashion end, the Korean entrepreneurs tend to make
their presence felt in the lower price ranges and in manufacturing.
Victor Kim, owner of Cherish International, a consulting firm in
the district, said people of Korean background own at least 600
wholesale and retail operations, as many as 1,000 contractors _ the
companies who actually do the sewing under contract from marketers
and design houses _ and hundreds of knitting and other
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said many business people of Korean descent in the district
felt unfairly tarred with negative stereotypes _ that Koreans rely
on knockoffs of styles developed by others; that the worst wages
and most abusive labor practices are found in their factories; that
they dodge paying taxes. In fact, he said, Koreans are more likely
than other groups to be victims of unfair business practices, like
landlords' demands for astronomical rents and ``key money,'' an
upfront payment to obtain a lease that can run as high as $200,000.
Protests by Korean groups against this practice have been laced
with talk about ``Merchant of Venice'' figures, a none-too-subtle
stereotyping of the landlords, many of whom are Jewish, Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions may ease as the Korean segment of the district
becomes more self-sufficient, Kim said, with Korean-owned banks and
real estate companies coming to the fore and with Korean-owned
garment companies like Koo's Manufacturing, Bubblegum USA and
Impression developing their own fashion sensibility, often by
hiring recent Korean-American graduates of the nearby Fashion
Institute of Design and Merchandising and other local design
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos constitute the third major ethnic element in the
district, accounting for the majority of the work force, including
85 percent of factory workers; most retail shoppers in the district
are Hispanic as well. Spanish-speaking immigrants have only begun
to be a business force in the district, through the rise of locally
trained designers of Latin background and through ownership of
sewing shops.
</P>
<P>
   Sewing is proving to be the part of the industry most vulnerable
to overseas competition, said Joe Rodriguez, the executive director
of the Garment Contractors Association of Southern California. The
number of production jobs has fallen by 10,000 since the peak in
1997, and low unemployment has made the remaining jobs harder to
fill with legal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Rodriguez said, such conditions might lead to higher
wages. But most shops cannot afford to go much above the $7-an-hour
average paid by legitimate contractors, because of intense price
pressures from retail customers and the ease with which production
can be moved outside the country, especially to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures have also hampered union organizers, who, after
decades of trying, have yet to penetrate virtually any of the
district's small factories, most employing 50 or fewer workers.
Goetz Wolff, research director for the County Federation of Labor,
cited overseas competition, fragmentation and the ready supply of
illegal workers available to less scrupulous operators.

TIGER WOODS OFF TO EARLY LEAD IN PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ They were gasping for air at the 82d PGA
Championship Thursday at Valhalla Golf Club, to no avail. The heat
index of 105 degrees was bad enough; then Tiger Woods sucked the
life out of the festivities with another clinic that dropped a
bucket of despair on the other 149 players in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy it? Listen to Scott Dunlap: ``He's won the last two
majors by 23 shots. His presence is nothing more than discouraging
for the rest of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that those words belong to a man who had just hit 14
greens, taken only 26 putts, and birdied the par-5 18th to shoot a
6-under 66, and you get a real sense of why this major championship
was tucked snugly into a blanket of frustration just five hours
after it started. That's because Woods, threatening to join Ben
Hogan as the only players to win three major championships in a
season, continued his incomparable play with a 66 to grab a share
of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Clarke, whose match-play triumph over Woods in February
is often used as a rallying point for those competitors who feel
hopeless, shot 68, as did Davis Love. The group at 69 consists of
Edward Fryatt, Fred Funk, Stephen Ames, and J.P. Hayes, while those
at 70 include Phil Mickelson, Brian Henninger, Miguel Angel
Jimenez, and Jean Van de Velde.
</P>
<P>
   Formidable players, but on a rainless day that was interminable
_ 18 were still on the course when darkness halted play at 8:27
p.m. _ the overpowering stature of Woods dominated. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can shoot 66 in a major championship, you are
going to be pretty happy,'' said Woods, who seemingly didn't break
a sweat in his near-perfect trip around a course on which he had
barely practiced on. It was a performance that led his playing
partner, Jack Nicklaus, to utter an expression that was once spoken
by the legendary Bobby Jones:
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays a game with which I am not familiar,'' said Nicklaus,
who prompted that Jones quote back in the early 1960s, when the
Golden Bear was mauling Augusta National and starting his stockpile
of green jackets. He is the Olden Bear now, more an ambassador than
a competitor, and recently he acknowledged that other PGA Tour
players have waved the white flag to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Woods for the first time in competition, Nicklaus
(77) now knows why. That's because the guy who this summer has
posted 12- and 8-shot wins at the US Open and British Open,
respectively, was at it again over a course designed by Nicklaus.
Woods hit 11 of 14 fairways, 16 greens, and ``shoots a 66 that
looks like 60,'' said Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   A nice compliment, said Woods, but not quite accurate. ``I don't
know if I left that many (shots on the course), but I definitely
left a few. Then again, I also made some good putts for par, so
it's give-and-take.''
</P>
<P>
   More like take-and-keep-taking because the roll Woods is on is
unprecedented. Including the final two rounds of this year's
Masters _ when an opening 75 led to a fifth-place finish _ Woods is
now a mind-boggling 44-under par in the last 11 rounds at major
championships. He opened with a 65 at the US Open, a 67 at the
British, so you may see some sort of trend here.
</P>
<P>
   His competitors sure do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a player of that caliber gets that much confidence and
when he sees and feels the other players saying, `Oh, there he goes
again,' it gives him another shot of confidence,'' said Greg
Norman, who shot 75 and is one of the many marquee names who can
say goodbye to this chance for a major victory.
</P>
<P>
   That list includes Ernie Els and Colin Montgomerie, both of who
drew an afternoon tee time that set them in motion on a six-hour
torcher chamber in sweltering heat, accompanied by the knowledge
that Woods had already shot 66.
</P>
<P>
   What they may not know are the details, which again featured a
trademark Woods birdie-burst. Even par through six holes, he
birdied the 597-yard par-5 seventh with a driver, 7-iron and two
putts from 30 feet, then ran off birdies at the next three holes to
get to 4-under. After a 3-wood, 6-iron combination set up a 12-foot
birdie putt at the 467-yard par-4 12th, Woods strung together five
pars, highlighted by one nightmarish hole. Or what passes as a
nightmare for him these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th wasn't very good,'' said Woods, who drove it into the
rough, left his second shot well short of the green, and stubbed a
chip shot. Ah, but when you putt the way your playing partner
(Nicklaus) used to 30 years ago, there are no worries. Woods
drained the 15-foot par save, then birdied the par-5 18th after
nearly holing his sand shot for eagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putt at 17 enabled me to keep the momentum going,'' said
Woods, who stole virtually all of the thunder from the unheralded
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   That should come as no surprise, since Dunlap's resume such
victories at the Manitoba Open, Litoral Open, Peru Open, and
Argentine Open. He has one top 10 finish in eight major
championships and though he eagled the par-5 second and recorded
five birdies against a lone bogey at the par-3 third, there is a
1-2 punch dwelling on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is come out (Friday) and hopefully do a whole lot
better than I did Friday at the British Open,'' he said, referring
to his 68 start that got wiped out with a 78.
</P>
<P>
   And Woods?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is going to do it, he is going to do it. There is no
stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap wouldn't find many who'd argue.

 LOS ANGELES: their kids.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economy is in many ways Gore's greatest asset on the stump.
Given its strength, he should be doing much better, by normal
standards. Candidates of parties that hold the White House usually
fare well when the economy is strong and the country is involved in
no foreign war.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been unable to generate the kind of
electricity that follows Clinton everywhere. And Clinton's speech
on Monday night did nothing to light a fire for his protege. ``All
he did was, he made a good case for Clinton,'' said Gerald
Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's imagemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks ago, Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who is working in the Gore campaign,
defined the goals of the two candidates at their respective
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, he said, needed to show some gravitas, while Gore needed
to show some levitas. In other words, one needed to show he was not
a lightweight, the other to lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   By common consent, the Republican made at least a start at the
Philadelphia convention towards establishing himself as a serious
political figure, capable of handling large issues. It was much
less clear that the Democrat had improved on his image as a
plodding, overearnest orator and campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   At least in its written form, Gore's speech seemed pedestrian,
without notable rhetorical flourishes or unexpected new policy
departures.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his camp still hope for a modest post-convention
``bounce'' in opinion polls about Gore's candidacy, but their
ultimate goal is to turn the race around in the debates with Bush.
The Texas governor agreed Thursday to three debates with the vice
president, starting in early October, as well as two between the
vice presidential nominees. But the Bush campaign made no agreement
as to the debates' length or format.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, an experienced and accomplished debater, said earlier in
the campaign that he would like to debate twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was preceded to the podium by a parade of speakers,
including Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who is now president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente of California, the first statewide
Hispanic officeholder in this state this century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the modern, made-for-television style, a parade of
friends of the nominee extolled his virtues. Among the speakers
were David Halberstam, the journalist and author, a family friend,
and Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Gore while both were
stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala., in their service in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam while Bush did not, and the Democrats
have made a point of that difference all during their convention.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, came on to
introduce him. An amateur photographer, she described her husband
as ``a decisive leader with strong values, deeply held convictions
and an unwavering commitment to making the American dream a reality
for all our people,'' and showed samples from what she described as
``the family photo album.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an echo of Tipper Gore's past attacks on popular music
that features explicit sexual content in Gore's speech, much of
which he wrote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness
and not enough meaning,'' he said. ``And as president I will stand
with you for a goal that I know we share: To give more power back
to the parents, so that you can choose what your own children are
exposed to, and pass on the basic lessons of responsibility and
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gore's other themes was an openness to voters' views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm elected president,'' he said, ``I'm going to keep on
having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out to
you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes,
with the quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing John F. Kennedy, who announced the start of a journey to
a New Frontier when nominated here in Los Angeles 40 years ago,
Gore urged listeners to ``set out on a new journey to the best
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it, in some of the most poetic language he used, a
journey ``on which we advance not by the turning of wheels, but by
the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision and the daring
grace of the human spirit.''

GORE VOWS FIGHT AGAINST COMPLACENCY, SAYS HE'S `NOT SATISFIED' &HT;    (EDS: Updates with new material throughout.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES Al Gore, capping a 24-year political career with the
Democratic presidential nomination, tried to steal Republican
George W. Bush's campaign thunder Thursday night by insisting that
the Democratic heirs to President Clinton are ``not satisfied''
with mere prosperity and will now lead the nation ``on a new
journey to the best America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, staking out a political persona apart from the
impeached and acquitted president, acknowledged Clinton by name on
one occasion for leading the nation ``out of the valley of
recession.'' But Gore delighted cheering Democrats with a firm
declaration that after almost eight years as Clinton's loyal vice
president, ``Now we turn the page and write a new chapter ... I
stand here tonight as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee for president devoted his acceptance
speech to policy proposals and personal anecdotes about his life _
and to his campaign message that the nation's booming prosperity
wealth must reach all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is not an award for past performance,'' Gore
declared, saying that he was eager to expand the nation's
prosperity beyond expanding federal budget surpluses, the lowest
inflation rate in a generation and 22 million new jobs since 1993
in order to build a ``better, fairer, more prosperous America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families,'' Gore said. ``And for all
our good times, I am not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, hoping to draw a contrast with what aides dubbed campaign
generalizations by the Republican rival, insisted that voters
``deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do.''
Gore called for tax cuts for working families, health insurance for
all children by 2004, expanded child-care opportunities, reductions
in the inheritance tax and ending the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' that requires married couples to pay more federal taxes
than they would if they filed separate returns as single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed the Bush tax cut plan, saying it provided $10 in
tax breaks to the wealthy but only left about 62 cents for the
average family _ ``enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added, without mentioning Bush by name: ``Let others
restore the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the environment _ his signature speciality _ Gore
declared: ``On the issue of the environment, I've never given up,
I've never backed down and I never will. And I say it again
tonight: We must reverse the silent, rising tide of global
warming.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to fight for campaign finance reform, saying
that would be ``the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I send
to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his public image as a boring policy wonk, Gore said
he knew that ``sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk
too much substance and policy...But the presidency is more than a
popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke as Clinton's legal travails edged into the spotlight,
with the disclosure in Washington that special prosecutor Robert
Ray is weighing whether to indict Clinton for obstruction of
justice and perjury in connection with his cover-up of a sexual
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ray impaneled a federal grand jury on July 11 to hear evidence
in the episode that led to Clinton's impeachment by the House and
acquittal by the Senate, legal sources told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, trying to stand apart from Clinton, said he wanted America
to ``know me for who I truly am.'' He recounted his biography and
his practice of meeting ordinary people on a regular basis back in
Tennessee when he was in the House and Senate. He vowed to continue
the practice if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was nominated on Wednesday night by his eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, emphasized that he has ``strong
values the love of my family, my faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also tried to co-opt Bush's campaign theme of national
renewal and a restoration of morality, telling his audience that
America ``must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not
enough meaning.'' Speaking just a few miles from the heart of
America's multibillion-dollar entertainment industry in Hollywood,
Gore also promised to ``give more power back to parents'' to
protect children from entertainment that ``glorifies violence and
indecency.'' He promised to hike penalties for predators using the
Internet to reach children.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president paid homage to Los Angeles, the city where
America's westward migration ended and where John F. Kennedy
declared the New Frontier in his 1960 convention address. ``Let us
set out a new journey to the best America,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Harvard-educated son of a U.S. senator, repeatedly
allied himself with ``working families,'' vowing to stand by their
side against ``powerful forces and powerful interests (that) stand
in your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``I want you to know this: I've taken on the
powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll
stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to fight for gay rights and said he would cut the
crime rate year by year; add 50,000 police officers to the nation's
ranks; add a crime victims' bill of rights to the Constitution; and
seek mandatory background checks to keep guns away from criminals
and mandatory child safety locks to protect kids.
</P>
<P>
   National polls show Gore trailing Bush by as much as 10
percentage points. But a Harris poll released Wednesday showed Gore
getting a ``bounce'' as the Democratic convention began, enabling
him to edge ahead of Bush for the first time since the GOP
convention two weeks ago. The survey showed Gore leading Bush, 43
percent to 42 percent, with 6 percent favoring Green party
candidate Ralph Nader and 5 percent favoring disputed Reform party
candidate Pat Buchanan. The survey had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the final night of the four-day Democratic National
Convention traced Gore's life from his roots in Carthage, Tenn.,
his education at Harvard, his volunteer Army service in Vietnam and
his early career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the 51-year-old wife of the nominee and an
experienced amateur photographer, introduced her husband for his
acceptance speech with a series of photos she has taken over the
years. ``Faith and family are at the center of Al's life,'' Mrs.
Gore said, adding: ``Al has always been there for our family and he
will always be there for yours.''.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore spent nearly two months crafting his address,
the most important political address of his 24 years in national
politics as a member of the House, the Senate and the Clinton
administration. Gore won a House seat from Tennessee in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was literally the person at the typewriter on this,''
explained Tad Devine, a senior Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, the
58-year-old senator from Connecticut, planned a four-day 400-mile
boat trip down the Mississippi River starting Friday. The journey
aboard the Mark Twain river boat would take them past the
battleground states of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky and
Missouri. Bush plans a post-convention raid on Gore's native
Tennessee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Gore's address, the Bush campaign announced in
Austin, Texas, that the second-term Texas governor and GOP running
mate Dick Cheney would seek to negotiate a total of five campaign
debates this fall with Gore and Lieberman. Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes said Bush hoped to stage three debates with Gore and GOP
vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney hoped to reach agreement on
two debates with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's agreement to take part in three debates appeared designed
in part to underscore the Texan's confidence that he has mastery of
the policy detail and the temperament to match Gore's knack for the
campaign debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane responded to the announcement by
saying Gore ``has been ready to debate for months,'' adding:
``Their new-found readiness to debate shows this campaign is
tightening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington, Ray's office neither confirmed nor denied that
the legal deliberations could lead to an indictment of Clinton
after he leaves office on Jan. 20. Ray emphasized in an ABC News'
interview in March when he succeeded special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr that he would determine ``whether crimes have been committed
and whether ... it is appropriate to bring charges'' against the
president after he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert condemned the inopportune
revelation, saying: ``The timing of this leak reeks to high
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of potential federal legal action against a high
ranking official at a sensitive moment in the election year
recalled the indictment of former Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger by special prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh four days before
the 1992 election. Aides to then-President George Bush blamed the
indictment for contributing to the Republican's loss to Clinton
that November.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, a federal judge threw out the one-count
indictment against Weinberger in connection with a six-year inquiry
into Reagan administration arms sales to Iran and the secret
diversion of some of the profits from the sales to provide arms to
anti-Marxist guerrillas battling the regime in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign criticized the disclosure Thursday, with the
Bush spokeswoman saying: ``We think the timing is wrong,'' adding:
``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made on
the day that the vice president is going to accept the Democratic
nomination. This election is not about the past, it's about the
future.''

DEMOCRATS' CONVENTION, LIKE THAT OF GOP, UNDERWRITTEN BY
CORPORATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., S.D., N.J., Calif., Va.)   By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Barely an hour after Vice President Al Gore issued
a call for reforming the ways political campaigns are paid for, he
headed back to the fund-raising circuit for a concert that raised
$5.2 million for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the prepared drafts of his acceptance speech Thursday night,
aides said, Gore once again called for an end to the large,
unrestricted political contributions known as soft money and
promised to make legislation banning soft money the first bill he
would send to Congress as president.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-day Democratic convention here was a soft-money
extravaganza, underwritten by scores of corporations that have
already contributed millions of dollars to Democratic committees
and from which the party hopes to reap millions more. Most notable
among the convention's sponsors were telecommunications companies,
which have reaped large profits from the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials were quick to note that the sold-out
fund-raising concert at the Shrine Auditorium Thursday night
featuring Barbra Streisand continued a tradition of celebrating the
party's nominee at an event after the convention ends.
</P>
<P>
   And they noted that the concert Thursday night, also starring
Whoopi Goldberg and Enrique Iglesias, raised only ``hard'' dollars,
money collected in amounts from $150 to $20,000 that the party can
use directly on Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic National Committee has always held a gala at
the end of the convention to raise money and excitement for the
ticket,'' said Jennifer Backus, a spokeswoman for the party. She
said that the event was consistent with the party's support for
campaign finance reform because it collected only hard money. The
$5.2 million raised Thursday night was the largest hard-money event
in Democratic Party history, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sen. Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, a Democratic
co-sponsor of a measure to ban soft money in politics, was critical
of the concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer there be no such events at our convention,''
Feingold said. ``It doesn't add to our message to have these events
going on in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert was the only fund-raiser that the Democratic
National Committee held this week. But Democratic candidates and
congressional fund-raising committees courted contributors
ceaselessly all week.
</P>
<P>
   At a luncheon at the home of children's entertainment executive
Haim Saban, the most generous donors to the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee sipped lemonade and picked at a luncheon of
chicken salad with the Senate minority leader, Thomas Daschle of
South Dakota; Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, the committee's
chairman; Dianne Feinstein of California; Charles Robb of Virginia,
and a bevy of other Democratic senators.
</P>
<P>
   After playing a prominent role at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, telecommunications
companies were big underwriters of events for the Democrats.
Corporate giants like AT&AMP;T, BellSouth, Verizon, SBC Communications,
Sprint Telecommunications and Teligent sponsored more than a dozen
costly receptions for top lawmakers this week.
</P>
<P>
   They entertained members of the House and Senate commerce
committees, their legislative overseers, at Dodger Stadium Tuesday
evening. Among the sponsors of Dodger Day 2000 was the U.S. Telecom
Association, a trade group whose president, Roy Neel, is a former
chief of staff for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   They also helped underwrite a ``Mardi Gras'' party for Sen. John
Breaux of Louisiana, and a nightclub show featuring the singer
Sheryl Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Knight, another former chief of staff for Gore and now
deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has lobbied
on behalf of two telecommunications companies, Bell Atlantic and
Leap Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies rented out Spago restaurant in Beverly
Hills for Torricelli on Tuesday and for House Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, which donated $250,000 to both Republican and
Democratic conventions, also paid for a dinner to honor Daschle on
Wednesday. The company seeks federal approval to lay a
telecommunitions cable across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which has the most prominent presence here of any
telecommunications company, gave $1 million in goods and services
to each party for their conventions. The long-distance giant is the
largest contributor to the Republican Party, having given $1.4
million since January 1999, and the fourth-largest to the
Democrats, who received $993,000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``These firms are the driving engine of the new economy and are
in the process of becoming the driving force in political
finance,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign
finance reform. ``They have a huge stake in government decisions,
more so than almost any other sector of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications companies rely on Congress and the executive
branch for approvals of mergers, for access to the airwaves, for
permission to offer local or long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of telecommunications technology has made these
companies enormously wealthy and they are spreading that wealth
around elected officials without regard to party affiliation,
Wertheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Taylor, the chief lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said that communications companies support members of
both parties because issues that concern them, including visas for
foreign workers and privacy protection on the Internet, are
generally not ideological and require bipartisan majorities for
passage.

   (NYT1) NEW YORK -- Aug. 17, 2000 -- ADV. FOR SUN., AUG. 20 --
JANSSEN-FILM -- Famke Janssen is having a thrill ride of a summer.
As Jean Grey, the telepathic, telekinetic protege of Professor X,
Janssen was part of the team that not only arrested the vengeful
Magneto's quest for world domination in ``X-Men'' but has also
raked in a superheroic $144 million at the box office in five weeks
of release. Now, opening on August 25, comes Valerie Breiman's
romantic comedy ``Love and Sex,'' a crowd pleaser at the last
winter's Sundance Festival. Janssen in theoffices of Lion's Gate,

   By JUDY HOLLAND and SUSANNA McBEE
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tipper Gore, a dedicated advocate for her husband
of 30 years, introduced Al Gore as the Democratic presidential
nominee at the party's national convention Thursday night after
dancing her way to the podium and saying that he ``has always been
there for our family and he will always be there for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that, ``many of you know that faith and family are at
the center of Al's life,'' thus underscoring a key campaign theme
that both Democrats and Republicans are pushing this year. ``Many
of you know Al to be a decisive leader with strong values, deeply
held convictions, and an unwavering commitment to making the
American dream a reality for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Mrs. Gore, who was a photographer for five years in the
1970s at the Nashville Tennessean when her husband was an
investigative reporter there, sought to give the nation a more
intimate look of their life together by showing family photographs
to convention delegates and the TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, some of you are saying, please, not the family photo
album,'' she said. ``But for those of you running for the door,
stay for just a while and see the man I love in a way you may not
have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as an unconventional, humorous woman, she danced around
the stage to rock music before her speech, doing high-fives with
with several people nearby and bringing the delegates to their
feet. She let out a big whoop when the entire audience held up
round signs saying ``Tipper Rocks.'' The delegates laughed, roared
their approval and danced themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, who celebrates her 52d birthday Saturday, has been at
her husband's side since they dated in high school and has given
speeches and campaigned for him throughout his career. An aide said
Thursday that she will continue to stump for him this fall,
traveling separately to reach as wide an audience as she can.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic image makers say her relaxed and confident demeanor
is a big asset on the hustings. They also say her dedication to her
family and her wholesome All-American looks give her a personal
appeal that can win votes and soften the stiffer image her husband
has projected.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Strauss, a former Democratic Party chairman and an
adviser to presidents of both parties, said earlier this week that
if Gore wants to boost his standing with certain blocs of voters _
southerners generally and women in particular _ he should send his
wife on a campaign train through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss recalled that Lady Bird Johnson, wife of President
Lyndon Johnson, made such a trip in the fall of 1964, stopping in
47 places in four days. Her ``Lady Bird Special'' whistle-stop tour
was credited with helping her husband retain much of the South in
his election battle against Barry Goldwater that year.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Mrs. Gore is ``a very appealing campaigner,' Strauss
added that she also could help Democrats running for Congress in
certain areas of the South.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore has said if she becomes first lady, she will continue
her efforts to improve mental health care.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration she has sought to remove the
stigma from mental illness. Last year she publicly discussed her
own battle with depression, which she said was triggered when her
son Albert, then six, nearly died after being struck by a car 11
years ago. She also served as President Clinton's top adviser on
mental health and presided over a White House conference on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago Mrs. Gore became an object of scorn among some
elements of the music industry and some civil libertarians when she
crusaded against obscene, sexually explicit rock and rap lyrics. In
pursuing that effort, she joined with Susan Baker, wife of
President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, in founding
the Parents' Music Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort led to five months of Senate hearings, and the
entertainment industry, to stave off federal legislation, agreed to
police itself and put labels on tapes and albums warning of graphic
material.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore also was attacked as a prissy censor on a moral
mission when she wrote a book, ``Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated
Society'' in 1997.'
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Hollywood and many civil libertarians came as
a shock to Tipper Gore, a longtime follower of the Grateful Dead
and a drummer in her high school rock band. She was dismayed to
find that she had become, in the minds of some, the worst enemy of
the pop music industry. She acknowledged in her1996 book, ``Picture
This: A Visual Diary,'' that her campaign ''landed me in hot
water.``
</P>
<P>
   But so far Hollywood has been a rich source of campaign
contributions for Democrats. The entertainment industry has given $
5.9 million to Democrats since January 1999, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, not including events at the Los
Angeles convention, making it the fourth largest donor to the
Democratic Party. Hollywood has doled out$3.7 million to
Republicans during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore has also been an advocate for women's issues and for
helping poor people, particularly the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of her husband before her speech Thursday night, she
told CNN that ``even though he's had a very busy public life and
career... whenever any of us have needed him, he's been there for
us,'' That, she said, shows he will ``be there for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she hoped to be a mother of a politician as well
as the wife of one, she said she wants her children to find out who
they are, what their gifts are ``and to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Convention has been a family affair for the
Gores.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores' eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, is a close
adviser to her father. She seconded his nomination Wednesday night,
praising him for balancing his family life with his career and for
once helping her with a dinosaur diorama after a day of hearings on
Capitol Hill. The Gores' other children are Kristin, 23; Sarah, 21,
and Albert III, who is now 17. The Gores also have a one-year-old
grandson, Wyatt Gore Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore, born Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson, was called Tipper by
her mother, an accountant who suffered from depression. Her parents
had a difficult marriage and were divorced when she was four. She
has a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in psychology and has
considered the idea of becoming a family therapist _ even if she
becomes first lady.

POOR MAN'S POLITICAL POLL: FINAL NUMBERS: CLINTON 25, LIEBERMAN 15,
GORE 5 
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD WEINRAUB AND ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Can political star power be measured by parking
lot rates? If so, Al Gore may have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the outdoor parking lots closest to the convention has
altered its rates on a daily basis. On the day President Clinton
spoke, the lot charged $25. The Joseph Lieberman night resulted in
a discounted parking rate of $15. Thursday, the biggest and final
day of the convention, when the presidential candidate, Al Gore,
spoke to the delegates, parking lot rates tumbled. All-day parking
cost only $5.
</P>
<P>
   Big Guy in Gore's Shadow
</P>
<P>
   Now that Al Gore is the Democratic Party's new leading man, what
happens to the big guy still on stage in the White House? At a
raucous reunion party late Wednesday in West Hollywood for past and
present Clinton staffers, Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman,
said that the president would be out fund-raising for Gore ``a
couple of times a week'' between now and the election.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Clinton's role in the Gore campaign is undecided _
and a big source of debate here. Will Clinton's presence on the
campaign trail strengthen Gore, or dwarf him? ``The president can
raise money and raise issues, but otherwise he ought not to be out
there campaigning,'' said Paul Begala, the former Clinton adviser,
who turned up at the party at Manhattan Wonton Co., a restaurant on
Melrose Place. `He would tend to distract and overshadow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton would do whatever the Gore campaign
wanted, which, a Gore adviser said, will be trips to the South, to
black communities and to California _ places where he is popular.
Clinton is also speaking nearly every day to his old friend,
William Daley, the Gore-Lieberman campaign manager. Offering
political advice, yes? Lockhart wouldn't say, but Begala, a veteran
of the 1992 Clinton campaign offered this: `In 1992 there was
always a creative tension between the people who were hired to run
the campaign and the person who wanted to run the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghost of Elvis?
</P>
<P>
   He was Elvis in feathers one night, the serious guy on the
podium the next. Although Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana's biggest
role here was nominating Lieberman in a speech at the convention
Wednesday night, it was hard to forget his far more mesmerizing
appearance here: As an Elvis look-alike in white tights, big white
collar and purple, green and gold feathers at an over-the-top faux
Fat Tuesday party at Paramount Studios. The party, estimated to
cost $500,000, was paid for by the Democratic Leadership Council
and many of the companies Breaux helps to regulate on the finance
and commerce committees.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said Thursday that his costume was not, in fact, Elvis,
but a traditional Mardi Gras outfit that was `just Breaux being
Breaux.'' He also said that `there are some people in New York who
might think that's a little bit of an unusual costume for a U.S.
senator, but it's perfectly acceptable back home.''
</P>
<P>
   New Kosher Kid on the Block
</P>
<P>
   Kosher food for the Liebermans? No issue, said Wolfgang Puck,
the premier chef of Los Angeles, who has catered dozens of
convention parties in the last few days. Puck said he had not yet
specifically made dinner for Lieberman and his wife, Hadassah, who
keep kosher. ``But,'' he said, ``there's no difficulty at all _ I
cook for a lot of customers who have kosher homes and they eat some
white fish, some vegetables, some fruit. They don't eat butter and
cream with meat. You avoid these.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Orthodox Jews, like the Liebermans, either avoid
restaurants at any cost, or even bring their own plates out of
concern that restaurant dishes, however clean, had been used in the
past for nonkosher food. But the Connecticut Democrat has eaten at
numerous receptions here and dines at at trendy places in
Washington, like I Ricci. One of his friends said, ``He eats salad
and fish _ no big deal. He has bread. And he's a stickler for
kosher wine _ that's what he drinks when he has wine. Of course, he
wouldn't be caught dead at a steak place like The Palm or Smith &AMP;
Wollensky.''
</P>
<P>
   Puck, owner of Spago and other restaurants, said jokingly that
while providing food for the Liebermans would pose no difficulties,
the hungry delegates were another matter. ``They like to eat, they
really like to eat, much more than people do in L.A.,'' he said.
``In L.A., with the movie people, they take a little food, a little
mineral water, sometimes a glass of champagne. But these delegates
are something else. They enjoy their food! I like that. We had a
dinner the other night at Spago. Eight hundred were supposed to
show. Well, 1,800 showed. I was shocked. They kept coming and they
kept eating. That's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP Spin Squad
</P>
<P>
   Republicans? At the Democratic convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like the people who were entering `Checkpoint
Charlie,' it's kind of like going into East Germany,'' said Rick
Wilson, a consultant to the Republican National Committee who has
been in town for the last week with a half-dozen members of the GOP
shmoozing the press at the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Were the Republicans spinning the news? ``I prefer to call it
`rapid response,' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican spinners included Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey, Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas, Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, and Pat Harrison, co-chairman. The
group operated from a small suite opposite the Staples Center, and
fanned out each day, sometimes wearing press passes, walking the
corridors and talking to journalists and radio correspondents about
the inadequacies of the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican convention in Philadelphia, the Democrats had
a similar squad, but their members were sometimes harder to spot.
The Republican group here wore pins reading: ``Bush/Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said the week passed perfectly pleasantly for the
interlopers. ``Actually we were treated kind of well by the
Democrats,'' Harrison said, sounding a bit puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Pity the Poor Millionaire
</P>
<P>
   One-two-three. Everyone. Let's all feel sorry for the
millionaires at the Democratic Party. While billionaires like Eli
Broad, one of the Democrats' most generous patrons, seem to have no
complaints about how the party is falling all over itself with VIP
treatment, the lesser contributors are another matter. Lesser means
those who have given only, say, $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   As rich as these donors are, the red carpet is looking a bit
frayed to them. The computers were down when they checked into the
five-star Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, their parking passes and
convention center credentials were not ready, their skyboxes at the
convention had been commandeered by Democratic officials and their
parties, which they initially assumed would be exclusive affairs,
turned out to be grossly oversubscribed and seemed, at times, like
the subway at rush hour in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   One party fund-raiser heard a torrent of complaints from one big
donor and suggested that the unhappy millionaire speak to the party
leadership. ``He said to me, `who am I going to complain to? This
whole thing is being run by a bunch of 23-year-old kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   One-two-three. Everyone. Let's all feel sorry ...

THE PEOPLE'S AL GORE   STEPS TO THE PODIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For eight years the vice president has had a
prominent place on the national stage, for four days the Democrats
have spoken of the Al Gore hardly anyone knows, and for one hour
Thursday night he appeared before the American people, shorn of
advisers, free of props, apart from the president who has
overshadowed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand here tonight as my own man,'' he said, ``and I want
you to know me for whom I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Al Gore whom Al Gore wanted the nation to see is a populist,
with an antagonism to entrenched interests; a fighter, with a taste
for the battle; and a reformer, with an impatience for the way
things are.
</P>
<P>
   All that plus a thinker, with no fear of specifics. Gore set out
to add depth and perspective to the sketch Americans have of him,
and his strategy clearly was to show that he is a man of depth and
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   And though the campaign has struggled to reconcile two notions _
that Gore wanted to continue the Clinton-era prosperity even as he
wanted to separate himself from Clinton-era scandals _ the
Democrats' new presidential nominee made clear that he would be no
mere steward of what preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a style of leadership that would sow the notion of
personal responsibility, not simply speak of it; a society that
would make parents' jobs easier, not harder; an economic culture
that gives the striving and middle classes, and not just the
educated and the elite, a larger chunk of the product of the
American prosperity engine.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is the New Democratic agenda that Clinton never
accomplished, or that Clinton's own comportment made it impossible
to achieve. Moreover, Gore's view of the presidency is rooted more
in his own experience as a congressman and senator and as a
presidential candidate than in what he witnessed as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   His presidency would be, in a word freighted with meaning in the
information age, interactive.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawmaker, Gore held a continual series of town meetings
each weekend, listening to ordinary people, staying in touch. As a
presidential candidate he vowed to answer every last question,
sometimes remaining at an event site even as the maintenance crew
was completing its last rounds of a near-empty hall. And as
president, he vowed Thursday night, he'd keep the lines open,
meeting with people continually ``because I want to stay in touch
with your hopes; with the quiet, every-day heroism of hard-working
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were full of graceful turns of phrase and gentle
asides, and when the vice president spoke of ``the daring grace of
the human spirit,'' he invoked as well the spirit of John F.
Kennedy's 1960 acceptance speech, when the Massachusetts senator
first set forth the idea of the New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Few shimmering phrases emerged from Gore's remarks, but the
speech included much of the tone _ especially the sense of
challenge _ of the Kennedy speech. ``In our democracy, the future
is not something that just happens to us; it is something we make
for ourselves _ together,'' he said. ``So to the young people
watching tonight, I say: this is your time to make new the life of
our world. We need your help to rekindle the spirit of America.''

 &HT;    GORE VOWS TO FIGHT FOR 'EVERYDAY HEROES'
 &HT;    Eds: Will be updated.
 &HT;    700&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore promised to support the
``quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans'' as he
accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that focused on the possibilities of the future
rather than the accomplishments of the Clinton administration, Gore
declared himself ``my own man'' as he re-introduced himself to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than try to match the charm of his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the notoriously formal Gore used his
acceptance speech to draw distinctions on issues he believes will
help him overcome Bush's steady lead in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to use the federal government's record budget
surplus to expand health care coverage, improve education, shore up
safety net programs and extend tax cuts to help ``every
hard-working family'' to ``open the door to their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled how he had fought ``against the powerful
interests'' over the course of his career, pushing for welfare
reform and an improved environment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his own abuses of the campaign finance system, Gore
vowed that a reform bill will be the first one he sends to Congress
as president. ``Let others try to restore the old guard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took direct aim at a sweeping tax cut proposal at the
heart of Bush's campaign. ``Let me say it plainly: I will not go
along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's emphasis on issues in a speech he largely crafted
himself, the convention's final day was mostly devoted to showing
the American public parts of the 52-year-old Gore's life that have
been obscured by his eight years as President Clinton's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friends of Gore played roles in an evening talk-show
style segment that featured anecdotes about Gore's relationship
with his father, a fiddle-playing populist senator from the hill
country of Tennessee; his decision to join the Army during the
Vietnam War; and his career in journalism before entering politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, an accomplished photographer, used photographs from
their three decades of marriage and his 24 years in politics to
present her husband as a family man. ``Al has always been there for
our family and he will always be there for yours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family photo album was shared not only with the more
than 4,368 delegates in the Staples Center, the site of the
convention, but also with the prime-time national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biography has a central part of nearly every night of the
convention since Clinton's curtain call and departure Monday night,
a reflection of the concern among Gore advisers that voters
continue to view the vice president through the lens of Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were not diminished by the disclosure earlier
Thursday that a new grand jury has been empaneled to continue the
investigation of Clinton in connection with his extramarital affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Democrats, but also Republicans expressed dismay over
the disclosure just hours before Gore was to accept his party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made
on the day that the vice president is going to accept the
Democratic nomination,'' said senior Bush strategist Karen Hughes.
``This election is not about the past; it's about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his acceptance speech, paid a brief single tribute to
Clinton. ``Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long
time to come because of the job that's been done to President
Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we turn the page and write a new chapter,'' he said.
``We're entering a new time. We're electing a new president. And I
stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know who I
truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have strong values, the love of my family, my
faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention delegates erupted with cheers as Gore entered the
convention hall after Tipper's introduction. He walked down an
aisle past the Tennessee delegation on his way to the speaker's
podium.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Promising to champion ordinary folks and their children, Gore
said, ``Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better,
fairer, more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience of the administration's economic
accomplishments: 22 million new jobs, the lowest inflation in a
generation, the highest home ownership ever, the lowest
unemployment in a quarter century and the biggest budget surpluses
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``for all of our good times, I am not satisfied,'' he
added. ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Gore said he would continue the open meetings that
were a part of his presidential campaign and his 16 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay
in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, every-day heroism of
hard-working Americans,'' he said. ``So this is not just an
election between my opponent and me. It's about our people, our
families, and our future _ and whether forces standing in your way
will keep you from having a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not dwell exclusively on economic issues, however. He
also vowed to use the presidency to ``challenge a culture'' that
has ``too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''

ANALYSIS: IN CHENEY'S RETIREMENT PACKAGE, SOME UNCHARTED
TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The retirement package awarded by the Halliburton Co. to Dick
Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, is nowhere near
the largest ever given to a chief executive, but it is trailblazing
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cheney's estimated $20 million package consists of a
stock option grant. And although options are an increasingly
popular form of executive compensation, they would be in totally
uncharted territory in the hands of a vice president, whose role in
the White House has the potential to affect the company's fortunes
and so place him in a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheney resigned from Halliburton on Wednesday, he received
an unspecified bonus, was free to sell 140,000 formerly restricted
shares of company stock and was allowed to keep options on 1.16
million shares. The current value of Cheney's stock and options,
which give him the right to buy Halliburton shares at a specified
price, is approximately $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said that if the Republican ticket wins the election,
he will sell his Halliburton shares before he takes office,
removing one potential conflict of interest that he would have in
the future of Halliburton, the oil services giant.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Halliburton has structured part of Cheney's option
grant would keep him squarely in a conflict: 233,000 of his options
_ worth around $3.8 million, if they could be exercised today _ can
be turned into shares of Halliburton only in December 2001 and
December 2002. Because he cannot sell or transfer the options
before then, he would continue to have a stake in the company while
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what he would need to do to avoid a conflict is not cut
and dried. Neither the president nor the vice president is subject
to the criminal conflict-of-interest laws that govern all other
employees in the executive branch. The assumption is that voters
can judge for themselves whether these elected officials are living
up to the nation's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said Cheney's best approach would be to divest
himself of every Halliburton share and option. ``The cleanest route
would be to eliminate self-interest altogether and forfeit and
cancel the options,'' said Patrick McGurn, vice president of
Institutional Shareholder Services, an investment advisory firm in
Rockville, Md. ``But is anybody going to do that? Given the paper
value, that's putting a pretty hefty price tag on altruism.''

 G.C. MYERS, 69, DEMOGRAPHER WHO PROFILED AGING WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. George Carleton Myers, a sociologist and demographer who
compiled and interpreted facts and figures about the elderly
worldwide, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Burnsville, N.C. He was
69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Duke University, from
which he retired as professor emeritus of sociology in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Myers founded the Center for Demographic Studies at Duke in 1972
and, as its director for the next 25 years, built it into an
internationally known research center. In his specialty, medical
demography, he provided projections concerning the elderly,
including data on health and causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every significant development in the demography of aging on
the world scene over the past three decades has been either
organized by George Myers or he has been a participant in it,''
said George L. Maddox, director of the Center for the Study of
Aging and Human Development at Duke, in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was the author or co-author of some 100 publications
analyzing demographic trends and findings from surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Central to his influence was his role as a coordinator for the
Committee of Centers of Population Research, the International
Network on Healthy Life Expectancy and the population activities
unit of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Myers served as a consultant to government agencies and as an
editor for professional journals dealing with aging and
gerontology. He lectured at universities as far away as Australia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, George Myers graduated from Yale University in
1953 and did postgraduate work at the University of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   He received his Ph.D. in 1963 from the University of Washington
in Seattle. He taught at Cornell University until 1968, when he was
named a professor in the sociology department at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who also had a home in Deerfield Beach, Fla., is survived
by his wife of 46 years, Pauline Kraebel Myers; two sons, George
C., of Westerly, R.I., and Peter D., of Baltimore; two daughters,
Marie Lloyd of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Kathleen A. Myers of Raleigh,
N.C.; and seven grandchildren.

 &HT;    GORE VOWS TO FIGHT FOR 'EVERYDAY HEROES'
 &HT;    Eds: Will be updated.
 &HT;    700&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore promised to support the
``quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans'' as he
accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that focused on the possibilities of the future
rather than the accomplishments of the Clinton administration, Gore
declared himself ``my own man'' as he re-introduced himself to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than try to match the charm of his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the notoriously formal Gore used his
acceptance speech to draw distinctions on issues he believes will
help him overcome Bush's steady lead in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to use the federal government's record budget
surplus to expand health care coverage, improve education, shore up
safety net programs and extend tax cuts to help ``every
hard-working family'' to ``open the door to their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   He also recalled how he had fought ``against the powerful
interests'' over the course of his career, pushing for welfare
reform and an improved environment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his own abuses of the campaign finance system, Gore
vowed that a reform bill will be the first one he sends to Congress
as president. ``Let others try to restore the old guard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took direct aim at a sweeping tax cut proposal at the
heart of Bush's campaign. ``Let me say it plainly: I will not go
along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's emphasis on issues in a speech he largely crafted
himself, the convention's final day was mostly devoted to showing
the American public parts of the 52-year-old Gore's life that have
been obscured by his eight years as President Clinton's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friends of Gore played roles in an evening talk-show
style segment that featured anecdotes about Gore's relationship
with his father, a fiddle-playing populist senator from the hill
country of Tennessee; his decision to join the Army during the
Vietnam War; and his career in journalism before entering politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, an accomplished photographer, used photographs from
their three decades of marriage and his 24 years in politics to
present her husband as a family man. ``Al has always been there for
our family and he will always be there for yours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family photo album was shared not only with the more
than 4,368 delegates in the Staples Center, the site of the
convention, but also with the prime-time national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biography has a central part of nearly every night of the
convention since Clinton's curtain call and departure Monday night,
a reflection of the concern among Gore advisers that voters
continue to view the vice president through the lens of Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were not diminished by the disclosure earlier
Thursday that a new grand jury has been empaneled to continue the
investigation of Clinton in connection with his extramarital affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Democrats, but also Republicans expressed dismay over
the disclosure just hours before Gore was to accept his party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made
on the day that the vice president is going to accept the
Democratic nomination,'' said senior Bush strategist Karen Hughes.
``This election is not about the past; it's about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his acceptance speech, paid a brief single tribute to
Clinton. ``Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long
time to come because of the job that's been done to President
Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we turn the page and write a new chapter,'' he said.
``We're entering a new time. We're electing a new prer families,
and our future _ and whether forces standing in your way will keep
you from having a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not dwell exclusively on economic issues, however. He
also vowed to use the presidency to ``challenge a culture'' that
has ``too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut,
planned to leave Los Angeles shortly after the climactic event of
the convention to begin a four-day trip down the Mississippi River,
through Midwestern battleground states.

ROBERT GILRUTH, 86, AN EARLY LEADER IN U.S. SPACE PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Minn., Texas)   By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert R. Gilruth, an early leader of the American space program
and director of the Johnson Space Center during the Apollo lunar
landings, died Aug. 17 in Charlottesville, Va. He was 86 and lived
near Warrenton, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the limelight occupied by astronauts, flight directors
and former German rocket scientists, the reticent and laconic
Gilruth stood aside when the cheering started, puffing on his pipe.
When President John F. Kennedy pinned a medal on him in 1962, he
froze, speechless, in front of the microphone. He was used to
letting others speak for him and the program.
</P>
<P>
   But the relatively unknown Gilruth was at the center of things
nearly every step of the way from the Sputnik launching in 1957 to
the Moon landings that began in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, he became director of the Space Task Group at Langley,
Va., the nucleus for the nation's human space flight program. He
oversaw the development of the Mercury spacecraft and made the
flight assignments for the first astronauts. He ran the Manned
Space Center (later renamed for President Lyndon B. Johnson) at
Houston during the Gemini and Apollo projects, retiring in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilruth's management style developed the best minds in the
space program into the finest organization of its time,'' said
Christopher C. Kraft Jr., a colleague from those days and his
successor as the space center director. ``Personally, I had a
higher regard for Gilruth than any other person in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Goldin, the NASA administrator, said that Gilruth's
engineering skills and leadership ``directly contributed to the
ultimate success of the Apollo program and the landing of a man on
the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rowe Gilruth was born Oct. 8, 1913, in Nashwauk, Minn., a
town on the Mesabi iron range near Duluth. He studied aeronautical
engineering at the University of Minnesota, earning a master's
degree. Then he joined the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics in Langley, NASA's predecessor agency, in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   There Gilruth led research using rockets to test the dynamics of
vehicles at supersonic speeds. In 1945, he organized an engineering
team to investigate rocket-powered aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth would recall later that, after the first Sputnik
launching by the Soviet Union on Oct. 4, 1957, he sensed his career
might be headed in an even more ambitious direction. He remembered
watching sunlight reflected off Sputnik as it passed over his home
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put a new sense of value and urgency on things we had been
doing,'' he said. ``When one month later the dog, Laika, was placed
in orbit in Sputnik 2, I was sure that the Russians were planning
for man in space.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1958, the day before his 45th birthday, Gilruth was
called into the office of T. Keith Glennan, administrator of the
just-created NASA, and given the assignment of placing men in
space. Glennan's order was terse: ``Go with the project.''
</P>
<P>
   As recounted in ``Suddenly, Tomorrow Came: A History of the
Johnson Space Center,'' Gilruth gathered a group of fewer than 10
engineers and, working night and day, came up with all the basic
principles of what would become Project Mercury, the first American
human spaceflight program, begun in 1959. These included the design
of the Mercury capsule, the choice of rockets and decisions on
astronaut qualifications and mission control procedures.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Space Task Group, responsible for the Mercury
project, Gilruth worked with 34 other engineers and flight
directors at Langley. It was a truly formative period for the
country and space flight. As one of his former associates, Dr.
George M. Low, once said, ``Everything we've done, our approach,
has grown out of the Bob Gilruth formula for running Project
Mercury.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the task group outgrew its Langley headquarters and the
political powers decided to move the operation to Houston, where a
huge campuslike space center would be built. At first, Gilruth
objected to James E. Webb, the new NASA administrator in the
Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Aiming for the Stars: The Dreamers and Doers of the Space
Age'' (Smithsonian Institution Press), Tom D. Crouch, senior
curator of the National Air and Space Museum, wrote: ``Gilruth
suggested that it might be easier and less expensive to expand the
existing Langley Research Center. `Bob,' Webb replied, `what the
hell has Senator Harry Byrd ever done for you or NASA?''' Byrd
represented Virginia at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Webb went on the explain that Houston was in the district of
Rep. Albert Thomas, who controlled NASA's budget, and in the home
state of Vice President Lyndon Johnson, one of the space program's
enthusiastic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gilruth is survived by his wife, Georgene Evans Gilruth, a
daughter and a stepson.
</P>
<P>
   As the Apollo project was winding down, Gilruth could hardly
wait to retire and devote full time to building the boat of his
dreams, one in which he could circumnavigate the world. He
completed a 52-foot multihull boat, sailed it to his retirement
home in Virginia, but apparently never felt his nautical skills
matched his astronautical ones. He never went around the world.

DEMOCRATS TRY TO SHORE UP THE CRUMBLING LABOR PILLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Organized labor has always been one of the
strongest pillars supporting the Democratic Party. Or, as John J.
Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, enthused on Sunday while
addressing a cheering throng of union members here for the
Democratic National Convention:
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at you _ 1,500 strong, 30 percent of the delegates to
this convention and 100 percent of the soul of the Democratic
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But cracks are showing in the labor pillar as this convention
draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the union officials and union members who showed up here
are still deeply upset about the trade deal the Clinton
administration negotiated with China. They remain convinced that
the agreement, which organized labor bitterly fought, threatens
American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Other union officials and members here say their party has
become too centrist on social matters and less firmly committed to
goals like maintaining affirmative-action programs and opposing
school voucher plans.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders are concerned about such talk, especially because
members of a group that makes up another pillar, black Democrats,
have also expressed concern here about the party's ideological
direction. The party bigwigs have spent much of the week scurrying
from delegation to delegation trying to reassure disgruntled union
members, lest union support flag for the Gore-Lieberman ticket,
with grievous consequences on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut met
for the second time with Bob Chase, president of the National
Education Association, to reassure members of the powerful teachers
union that while he had supported experimental voucher programs in
the past, he would now go along with Vice President Al Gore in
opposing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good, productive meeting,'' Chase said in a statement
issued by his office.
</P>
<P>
   This is the calculus the party leaders cannot escape: In the
last presidential election, when Bill Clinton won a second term, 23
percent of all voters came from union households, and they voted
Democratic 63 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Will they do it again?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, say delegates from one of the country's most heavily
unionized states, Michigan, where one of every two households has a
union member. But sometimes their doubt is unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with Al Gore and Joe Lieberman all the way, every step,''
said Clarice Squillace, a retired autoworker from Eastpointe,
Mich.. ``I'm not happy with the China trade thing but I'm resigned
to it because it's a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we get our people to turn out on Election Day? I don't
know. I'll do everything I can to build the excitement. We've got
to convince people there really are big differences between the two
tickets. That's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Flynn, a National Education Association member from
Sterling Heights, Mich., struck a similar note as he discussed how
to turn out a big vote for the Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about this,'' Flynn said. ``It's the issues that
will do the job, the differences between the two tickets. If you
can make them clear, I believe we can drum up the kind of
excitement we've seen here on the floor of the convention. I just
wish I could bottle this excitement and take it back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he concerned that the Democratic Party was becoming too
centrist, edging too close to things like school vouchers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you think on a particular issue or issues, the center
is where you win,'' he said. ``I'm comfortable with Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman. Why not? Ted Kennedy and Jesse Jackson got up there on
the podium the other night and praised them to the skies. If it's
OK with a pair like Ted and Jesse, it's sure as heck OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lana Boldi, a United Auto Workers official from Grand
Rapids, Mich., the China trade deal was a stinging blow. ``But as
much as I disagree with that,'' she said, ``I disagree with George
W. Bush even more on just about everything he stands for. You weigh
it all out, and you go with Al Gore easily, whatever serious
differences you may have with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any other real choice. You can't throw in with
somebody like Ralph Nader just because he says the right things on
something like China trade. That's just throwing a vote away.''
Nader is running on the Green Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Until just before the convention opened here, the UAW's
enthusiasm for Gore was considerably less than overwhelming. The
union held back on endorsing him _ its president, Stephen P.
Yokich, is a Michigan delegate _ until just about the last moment.
And in an auto state like Michigan, which also happens to be one of
the important Midwestern swing states in Election 2000, that hurt _
and still hurts. The latest Michigan poll has Gore trailing Bush by
eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won the endorsement of the AFL-CIO leadership earlier on,
though again, there was much concern about his support for the
China trade agreement. Another powerful union, the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, has still not committed to a candidate.
Its president, James B. Hoffa, is being heavily courted by both the
Gore and Bush camps, as well as by Nader, who is drawing 5 percent
to 10 percent of the vote in some big labor states, mainly at
Gore's expense.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa was welcomed as an onlooker at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia. And here in Los Angeles, he is listed
as a ``superdelegate'' in the Michigan delegation. But he says the
Teamsters will not make a decision on whom to back until after
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, said here at
midweek that organized labor's vote would be crucial not only in
the presidential race but also in many congressional races and,
ultimately, the control of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that in 1994, when the Democrats lost 52 seats in the
House and, with that, control of the House, turnout by union
members was only 13 percent. But turnout was 23 percent, he said,
in 1996, when the party regained nine seats, and in 1998, when it
regained five more seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or base has not come home yet,'' Gephardt said. ``We will have
to work on that. The Republican base has accepted George Bush much
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   His view of the base?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about the base,'' he said, ``we are talking about
yellow-dog Democrats _ like union members _ who are mostly white
males, and who we have not done particularly well with.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Editors: This story is an analysis of the Gore speech 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Al Gore camp is fond of tossing around the
Texas saying ``all hat and no cattle'' to describe Republican rival
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As the Democratic contender finally got his chance to address a
national audience Thursday night he clearly sought to show there
was more beef in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to focus groups of undecided voters who say they are
tired of vague political speeches, Gore said he was there to talk
seriously about his proposals on Social Security, Medicare, middle
class tax cuts, and prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And he offered some specifics such as his commitment to ``an
iron clad lockbox '' to protect federal retirement program
surpluses from being raided for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   He effectively pointed to real people he has met along the
campaign trail to illustrate his commitment to such measures as HMO
reform and school building program.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge facing Gore was far greater than just
demonstrating that he has dutifully done his homework.
</P>
<P>
   The cautious politician who carefully modulates his every
response had to show sizzle and somehow connect with voters who
find him remote and patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   While the delegates lustily cheered his address it was unclear
whether he would be able to puncture his old image with the voters
outside the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, written by Gore on his laptop computer, seemed
lacking in soaring rhetoric or memorable quotes. And unlike his
boss President Clinton, Gore is not adept at breathing life into
mundane lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidate also seemed more relaxed and natural than he
often does on the campaign trail, punching out some sharp lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not in Clinton's league when it comes to rousing
speechmaking. But the Texas governor entered his Philadelphia
convention in far better shape than Gore, with the Republican base
electrified and independent voters more comfortable with his
amiable demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The address also provided an opportunity for Gore to more firmly
cut the umbilical cord to Clinton _ to demonstrate to voters that
after playing understudy for almost eight years he could take over
the leading role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're entering a new time,'' he said. ``We're electing a new
president. And I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you
to know me for who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   But even on a day when the spotlight was supposed to shine
solely on him, Gore could not escape from Clinton's shadow as the
news was leaked that a grand jury had been convened a month ago to
probe the Monica Lewinsky matter that has dogged Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to President Clinton's philandering, Gore made a
point of noting that he was still in love with the woman he met the
night of his senior prom.
</P>
<P>
   He also fleshed out his life story in an effort to demonstrate
that he had a compelling autobiography and had made tough choices
such as his decision to enroll in Vietnam _ another departure from
Clinton who avoided the draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore didn't want to completely distance himself from the
Clinton years, which has generated the economic prosperity the
Democratic candidate hopes will propel him to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So far polls show that Americans do not seem to be giving Gore
credit for the good times. Gore used his address to hammer home the
point that the current period of prosperity can only continue if
Democrats stay put at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flung back at Republicans a word they freely used against
the current administration at their convention. In Philadelphia,
Bush accused Clinton and Gore of squandering their two terms in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seized on the same language when he warned of the dangers
of making the wrong choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could squander this moment, but our country would be the
poorer for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the convention the Gore camp has been intent on
portraying the candidate as someone who is not just a stiff policy
wonk but a warm and funny family man with roots outside of
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   They continued that theme on the final night when his wife
Tipper introduced him by opening up her family photo album to show
folksy an irreverent photos she had taken of her husband over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   The coming weeks will tell whether voters replace their mental
snapshots of the Democratic candidates with the warmer images
presented in Los Angeles.

BEANO COOK CALLS DECISION `IDIOTIC'
</HEADLINE>

By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC might be excited about the opportunity to
play Penn State in the Kickoff Classic, but its decision to open
the season against the Nittany Lions is ``idiotic,'' according to
ESPN college football analyst Beano Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a dumb move on USC's part. It's ridiculous.
They're nuts,'' Cook said by phone from his home in Pittsburgh.
``It's a home game for Penn State. I don't understand it. USC plays
a tough enough nonconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give USC some credit for playing the game. It's not the
dumbest move since Hitler went to war on two fronts, but it's
close. I said the same thing about Arizona last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State routed Arizona 41-7 last year in the season opener
for both teams, although that game was played in State College,
Pa., and not the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Cook predicts the Nittany Lions will defeat the Trojans 28-14
but added, ``tell (USC coach) Paul Hackett I hope I'm wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Trojans, they remain unfazed by Cook's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``USC has not been getting the respect it deserves and this
year, that's what it is all about,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said.
``That's just another challenge. We're not out to prove it to him,
we're out to prove it to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Waiting for decision: Although David Newbury has basically
won the kicking job, Hackett said he will wait until Monday to
officially make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Bell has been disappointing, but he needs to get his act
together and I want to give him a little longer to bounce back,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell will probably handle kickoffs again. Freshman John Wall of
Birmingham High is expected to redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defensive breakdown? The defense's weakness against the run
in Wednesday's scrimmage was a prime topic addressed during
Thursday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked awful on defense,'' defensive coordinator Bill Young
said. ``That's the first time we looked that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said players were often not in their proper positions on
the field, which accounted for so many big running plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a tremendous concern,'' he said. ``It can be
corrected just like that. We also had some defenses that we hadn't
run a lot as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said the defense settled down in the second half, when the
Trojans went back to their base defense.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kelly improving: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly, who had two
catches for 76 yards and a touchdown in the scrimmage, said his
strained knee feels about ``95 percent'' recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Malaefou MacKenzie, who cut his hand Wednesday and
required stitches, practiced Thursday, but did not do anything that
required the use of his injured hand. He is expected to return
full-time perhaps as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Petros Papadakis (sore foot) is expected to return
today after missing two days.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he expects tight end Antoine Harris (sore
hamstring) to start the Penn State game but isn't sure how long he
will last.

GORE VOWS TO FOCUS ON WORKING FAMILIES

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A deputy no more, Vice President Al Gore made his
debut as the Democratic presidential nominee Thursday night with a
vow to work for all Americans, ``especially those who need a voice,
those who need a champion, those who need to be lifted up so they
are never left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Democratic National Convention that nominated
him on Wednesday night and to the nation beyond, Gore said bluntly,
``I stand here tonight as my own man'' _ a clear rejoinder to the
Republicans who have sought to picture him as a cut-rate version of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But even in this most important hour of his political career,
the shadow of Clinton fell across Gore's path. It was disclosed in
Washington that a new grand jury has been convened to consider
whether the president should be indicted after leaving office for
having lied under oath about his affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared text, distributed before Gore appeared on the
stage at the Staples Center on the fringe of downtown Los Angeles,
the vice president said that he would give working families ``a
full range of targeted tax cuts,'' including an end to the
so-called marriage penalty and a reform of the estate tax. But his
proposals stopped well short of those made by his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to Bush's proposal to cut income taxes by
more than $1.3 trillion over 10 years, Gore said, ``I will not go
along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Bush in the polls, faced with an uphill fight in the
Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic swing states that will decide the
outcome, Gore seemed to be laying the groundwork for a campaign in
which he would identify himself as the friend of the little guy and
Bush as the candidate of the rich and influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not just
the few, but all working families,'' the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, he spoke of unspecified ``powerful forces'' and
``powerful interests,'' which he implicitly identified with the
Republicans, standing in the way of working men and women. It was
reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt's denunciation of ``the
malefactors of great wealth'' in 1907 and Franklin D. Roosevelt's
castigation of ``economic royalists'' during the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many
businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' the vice president
said. ``This country is richer and stronger. But my focus is on
working families _ people trying to make house payments and car
payments, working overtime to save for college and do right by
their kids.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The economy is in many ways Gore's greatest asset on the stump.
Given its strength, he should be doing much better, by normal
standards. Candidates of parties that hold the White House usually
fare well when the economy is strong and the country is involved in
no foreign war.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president has been unable to generate the kind of
electricity that follows Clinton everywhere. And Clinton's speech
on Monday night did nothing to light a fire for his protege. ``All
he did was, he made a good case for Clinton,'' said Gerald
Rafshoon, Jimmy Carter's imagemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks ago, Sam Popkin, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who is working in the Gore campaign,
defined the goals of the two candidates at their respective
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, he said, needed to show some gravitas, while Gore needed
to show some levitas. In other words, one needed to show he was not
a lightweight, the other to lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   By common consent, the Republican made at least a start at the
Philadelphia convention towards establishing himself as a serious
political figure, capable of handling large issues. It was much
less clear that the Democrat had improved on his image as a
plodding, overearnest orator and campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   At least in its written form, Gore's speech seemed pedestrian,
without notable rhetorical flourishes or unexpected new policy
departures.
</P>
<P>
   Some in his camp still hope for a modest post-convention
``bounce'' in opinion polls about Gore's candidacy, but their
ultimate goal is to turn the race around in the debates with Bush.
The Texas governor agreed Thursday to three debates with the vice
president, starting in early October, as well as two between the
vice presidential nominees. But the Bush campaign made no agreement
as to the debates' length or format.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, an experienced and accomplished debater, said earlier in
the campaign that he would like to debate twice weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was preceded to the podium by a parade of speakers,
including Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who is now president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamente of California, the first statewide
Hispanic officeholder in this state this century.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the modern, made-for-television style, a parade of
friends of the nominee extolled his virtues. Among the speakers
were David Halberstam, the journalist and author, a family friend,
and Robert Delabar of Seattle, who met Gore while both were
stationed at Fort Rucker, Ala., in their service in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Gore served in Vietnam while Bush did not, and the Democrats
have made a point of that difference all during their convention.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, came on to
introduce him. An amateur photographer, she described her husband
as ``a decisive leader with strong values, deeply held convictions
and an unwavering commitment to making the American dream a reality
for all our people,'' and showed samples from what she described as
``the family photo album.''
</P>
<P>
   There was an echo of Tipper Gore's past attacks on popular music
that features explicit sexual content in Gore's speech, much of
which he wrote himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness
and not enough meaning,'' he said. ``And as president I will stand
with you for a goal that I know we share: To give more power back
to the parents, so that you can choose what your own children are
exposed to, and pass on the basic lessons of responsibility and
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gore's other themes was an openness to voters' views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm elected president,'' he said, ``I'm going to keep on
having open meetings all over this country. I'm going to go out to
you, the people, because I want to stay in touch with your hopes,
with the quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing John F. Kennedy, who announced the start of a journey to
a New Frontier when nominated here in Los Angeles 40 years ago,
Gore urged listeners to ``set out on a new journey to the best
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He called it, in some of the most poetic language he used, a
journey ``on which we advance not by the turning of wheels, but by
the turning of our minds, the reach of our vision and the daring
grace of the human spirit.''

   Judge Halts Program to Crack DVD Film Codes &QL;

<P>
   A federal judge ruled Thursday that a Web site operator cannot
distribute a computer program used to crack codes that prevent the
piracy of movies. The ruling, a victory for the motion picture
industry, applies only to the Web site operator, Eric C. Corley,
and his company, 2600 Enterprises. But experts on both sides of the
issue agreed that the decision could have far greater reach as the

   This was supposed to be a jubilee year for Firestone. One

established Firestone Tire &AMP; Rubber Co., and the company was
planning to celebrate that fact, in a big way. Then it all came

<P>
   The retirement package awarded to Dick Cheney, the Republican
nominee for vice president, is neither the largest nor the most
generous ever given a chief executive officer. But the estimated
$20 million package from Halliburton is remarkable in other ways.
It has brought executive compensation back from the dead as a

potential conflicts it may pose to politicians who have amassed it
_ to center stage. '

COMMENTARY: BEING AL GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Updates with comments on speeches by Tipper Gore and Al Gore) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And what, you may ask, have we learned from the
Democratic convention?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it appears the Kennedy magic has fizzled. Ted Kennedy, one
of the few surviving politicians to whom the word ``bellowing'' is
relevant, has become a commodity best reserved for off-screen
appearances. Seeing Caroline was nice, but the next-generation gene
pool seems to be getting shallow.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats did not feel compelled to
keep their congressional delegation locked up. In fact, if you are
represented by a Democratic member of the House who was not on
television sometime during this week's activities, he or she either
has a very safe district or a party scheduled for the Playboy
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the convention was all about Al Gore, and
a lot like a birthday party being thrown by an anxious family for a
kid who isn't particularly popular. The parents keep inserting
themselves into the action, joshing nervously and trying to create
the impression that all the fun is emanating from the rather
lumpish guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
   This was a convention in which the presidential nominating
speech focused on a story about how at Harvard, Gore once roasted a
turkey in the dorm fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched `Star Trek' when maybe we should have been
studying,'' Tommy Lee Jones assured the nation. The actor, who was
Gore's roommate at Harvard, was part of a cast of thousands who
marched onstage to hammer home the idea that the vice president is
actually the life of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night Tipper Gore did everything but turn cartwheels to
get the auditorium revved up on her husband's behalf, and the crowd
practically levitated when he came into the auditorium. But by the
time we got to ``the private sector, the engine that drives
economic growth,'' you knew he was never going to master the trick
of creating a sense of intimacy within a huge arena. He delivered a
speech that was true to himself: serious, issue-driven, estimable,
partisan, but no walk in the park.
</P>
<P>
   The curse of Al Gore's life is that he appears insincere, even
when his heart is totally in it. We keep trying to find reasons for
this in his upbringing, or his ambition, but perhaps the bottom
line is that what we've got here is a perfectly OK person who's
been cursed by fate with an unwinning smile and a tin ear that
flattens out his speech.
</P>
<P>
   The convention also saw a 13-minute video about Gore's lighter
side that was directed by Spike Jonze, of ``Being John Malkovich''
fame. Try to catch it if you get a chance _ this may be your only
opportunity to see the candidate body-surfing, showing off the gas
masks the security guys make him carry in the car, and cheerfully
pointing out a nude self-portrait of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The film does make Gore seem like a guy who's fun to be around,
but you can't help noticing the amount of heavy lifting Tipper and
the girls have to do to get him there. The vice president is good
at playing the straight man, protesting mildly while his children
make fun of the way he overmanages the family TV viewing. (When a
video is on, Gore apparently stops the action whenever anybody
leaves the room, and rewinds back to the FBI warning when the lost
sheep returns.) However, the real message you get is that it might
be amusing to hang out with Karenna.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore does have a sense of humor, but it's very dry.
This year the Democratic ticket is carrying around a whole lot of
wit that's on the arid side. If the American public ever puts out a
call for irony, these guys are ready.
</P>
<P>
   The public's Gore aversion may be nothing more than a sense that
the current team in the White House is like a TV series that's run
its course. Even ``MASH' got canceled eventually. ``Home
Improvement'' ran out of steam after eight years, and the people on
that were less stressful company than the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of the last four days was to prepare the
American mind for the spinoff, to make people realize that Bill
Clinton may be ``Happy Days'' in its final season, but Al Gore is
the first episode of ``Joanie Loves Chachie.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not exactly.

   Although the tragedy with Russia's Kursk submarine has placed an
urgent spotlight on the need for rescue craft, the U.S. Navy is
planning to retire one of its two best undersea rescue vehicles at
the end of August in a cost-cutting move that could make it harder
to save stricken U.S. submariners, military officials said
Thursday.

   Defense experts say that if the Russian navy had accepted the
offer, it would have had a much greater chance _ though no
guarantee _ of saving any survivors than it has had with its own
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that
one of the minisubmarines, the Avalon, is to be retired at the end
of this month. The decision was made long before the Kursk sank
last weekend, and Navy officials said they had no plans to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy plans to build a new generation of rescue vehicles in
the next five years. The officials said they could get help from
other Western nations if a crisis taxed their other rescue
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said there could be pressure from Congress to keep
the Avalon in use until the new equipment is ready. After the Kursk
disaster, Norman Polmar, an independent Navy analyst, said, ``I
think the decision demands a re-evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Navy's decision could now set off a controversy that
would never have occurred had the Kursk not gone down.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalon and its sister craft, the Mystic, have been based in
San Diego for nearly 30 years but have never been needed for a
rescue operation. The United States has lost only two
nuclear-powered submarines, the Thresher and the Scorpion. Both
sank in the 1960s in such deep waters that there was no chance of
saving anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even many submariners take little comfort in the
idea that the vehicles were available. The Avalon and the Mystic
theoretically can rescue 24 men at a time at depths of up to 2,000
feet, while in most areas of the oceans, a stricken submarine would
plunge tens of thousands of feet, disintegrating along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Both craft operate under their own battery power and can
maneuver themselves onto the hatches of sunken submarines to rescue
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have relied on less-advanced gear, including diving
bells that dangle from a surface ship and are hard to guide.
</P>
<P>
   If the Russians had asked for help immediately after the Kursk
sank, U. S. officials said, either the Avalon or the Mystic could
have been flown to a Russian port by Monday and carried to the
Kursk by a Russian cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
   One concern was whether the hatches on the U.S. craft would have
fit tightly enough with the hatches on the Russian submarine.
Another was whether the Kursk was leaning too far toward one side
for the rescue craft to connect to it.
</P>
<P>
   But after Russian officials finally requested international help
on Wednesday, Great Britain dispatched a smaller rescue submarine.
It is expected to reach the Kursk on Saturday. And though that
could be too late to save any crew members who survived the
submarine's plunge to the seabed, British authorities said Thursday
that their hatches should match up with the Kursk's.
</P>
<P>
   They also quoted Russian officials as saying that the Kursk is
listing only 20 degrees, and not 60 degrees, as previously
announced. That raises the possibility that either the Avalon or
the Mystic, which were designed to work at angles of up to 45
percent, could have carried out a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Pentagon's plan, the Mystic will remain in use until
2005, when the next rescue devices are scheduled to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescue craft require periodic overhauls, and critics
worry about what might happen if a submarine were to sink when the
Mystic is not available. The Navy's backup would be two old diving
bells similar to some tested by the Russians this week, though U.S.
officials say they could also seek help from Britain and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Some Navy veterans also fear that the next generation of rescue
equipment may be less capable in some ways. No one questions that
the Avalon and the Mystic are aging and need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But while they theoretically could carry 24 submariners to
safety at a time, the replacement systems will be centered around
diving bells that might be able to rescue only 12 men on each
descent.
</P>
<P>
   The bells would be far more sophisticated and maneuverable than
current ones, Navy officials said, adding that they also could be
transported more easily and quickly to rescue sites. And their
efforts would be augmented by deep-sea divers, who would be able to
aid rescue efforts at much greater depths. Navy officials said they
are buying four high-tech diving suits, at $1.5 million each, that
will allow divers to go as far underwater as 2,000 feet.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES Al Gore, capping a 24-year political career with the
Democratic presidential nomination, tried to steal Republican
George W. Bush's campaign thunder Thursday night by insisting that
the Democratic heirs to President Clinton are ``not satisfied''
with mere prosperity and will now lead the nation ``on a new
journey to the best America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, staking out a political persona apart from the
impeached and acquitted president, acknowledged Clinton by name on
one occasion for leading the nation ``out of the valley of
recession.'' But Gore delighted cheering Democrats with a firm
declaration that after almost eight years as Clinton's loyal vice
president, ``Now we turn the page and write a new chapter ... I
stand here tonight as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee for president devoted his acceptance
speech to policy proposals and personal anecdotes about his life _
and to his campaign message that the nation's booming prosperity
wealth must reach all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is not an award for past performance,'' Gore
declared, saying that he was eager to expand the nation's
prosperity beyond expanding federal budget surpluses, the lowest
inflation rate in a generation and 22 million new jobs since 1993
in order to build a ``better, fairer, more prosperous America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families,'' Gore said. ``And for all
our good times, I am not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, the 51-year-old wife of the nominee and an
experienced amateur photographer, introduced her husband for his
acceptance speech with a series of photos she has taken over the
years. As she turned the podium over to her husband, the couple
engaged in a long embrace, sending the delegates into a raucous
chorus of screams and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, hoping to draw a contrast with what aides dubbed campaign
generalizations by the Republican rival, insisted that voters
``deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do.''
Gore called for tax cuts for working families, health insurance for
all children by 2004, expanded child-care opportunities, reductions
in the inheritance tax and ending the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' that requires married couples to pay more federal taxes
than they would if they filed separate returns as single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed the Bush tax cut plan, saying it provided $10 in
tax breaks to the wealthy but only left about 62 cents for the
average family _ ``enough money to buy one extra Diet Coke a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added, without mentioning Bush by name: ``Let others
restore the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the environment _ his signature speciality _ Gore
declared: ``On the issue of the environment, I've never given up,
I've never backed down and I never will. And I say it again
tonight: We must reverse the silent, rising tide of global
warming.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to fight for campaign finance reform, saying
that would be ``the very first bill that Joe Lieberman and I send
to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his public image as a boring policy wonk, Gore said
he knew that ``sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk
too much substance and policy...But the presidency is more than a
popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke as Clinton's legal travails edged into the spotlight,
with the disclosure in Washington that special prosecutor Robert
Ray is weighing whether to indict Clinton for obstruction of
justice and perjury in connection with his cover-up of a sexual
dalliance with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ray impaneled a federal grand jury on July 11 to hear evidence
in the episode that led to Clinton's impeachment by the House and
acquittal by the Senate, legal sources told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, trying to stand apart from Clinton, said he wanted America
to ``know me for who I truly am.'' He recounted his biography and
his practice of meeting ordinary people on a regular basis back in
Tennessee when he was in the House and Senate. He vowed to continue
the practice if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was nominated on Wednesday night by his eldest
daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, 27, emphasized that he has ``strong
values the love of my family, my faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also tried to co-opt Bush's campaign theme of national
renewal and a restoration of morality, telling his audience that
America ``must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not
enough meaning.'' Speaking just a few miles from the heart of
America's multibillion-dollar entertainment industry in Hollywood,
Gore also promised to ``give more power back to parents'' to
protect children from entertainment that ``glorifies violence and
indecency.'' He promised to hike penalties for predators using the
Internet to reach children.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president paid homage to Los Angeles, the city where
America's westward migration ended and where John F. Kennedy
declared the New Frontier in his 1960 convention address. ``Let us
set out a new journey to the best America,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Harvard-educated son of a U.S. senator, repeatedly
allied himself with ``working families,'' vowing to stand by their
side against ``powerful forces and powerful interests (that) stand
in your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``I want you to know this: I've taken on the
powerful forces. And as president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll
stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to fight for gay rights and said he would cut the
crime rate year by year; add 50,000 police officers to the nation's
ranks; add a crime victims' bill of rights to the Constitution; and
seek mandatory background checks to keep guns away from criminals
and mandatory child safety locks to protect kids.
</P>
<P>
   National polls show Gore trailing Bush by as much as 10
percentage points. But a Harris poll released Wednesday showed Gore
getting a ``bounce'' as the Democratic convention began, enabling
him to edge ahead of Bush for the first time since the GOP
convention two weeks ago. The survey showed Gore leading Bush, 43
percent to 42 percent, with 6 percent favoring Green party
candidate Ralph Nader and 5 percent favoring disputed Reform party
candidate Pat Buchanan. The survey had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the final night of the four-day Democratic National
Convention traced Gore's life from his roots in Carthage, Tenn.,
his education at Harvard, his volunteer Army service in Vietnam and
his early career in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Gore spent nearly two months crafting his address,
the most important political address of his 24 years in national
politics as a member of the House, the Senate and the Clinton
administration. Gore won a House seat from Tennessee in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was literally the person at the typewriter on this,''
explained Tad Devine, a senior Gore adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, the
58-year-old senator from Connecticut, planned a four-day 400-mile
boat trip down the Mississippi River starting Friday. The journey
aboard the Mark Twain river boat would take them past the
battleground states of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky and
Missouri. Bush plans a post-convention raid on Gore's native
Tennessee on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Gore's address, the Bush campaign announced in
Austin, Texas, that the second-term Texas governor and GOP running
mate Dick Cheney would seek to negotiate a total of five campaign
debates this fall with Gore and Lieberman. Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes said Bush hoped to stage three debates with Gore and GOP
vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney hoped to reach agreement on
two debates with Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's agreement to take part in three debates appeared designed
in part to underscore the Texan's confidence that he has mastery of
the policy detail and the temperament to match Gore's knack for the
campaign debate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane responded to the announcement by
saying Gore ``has been ready to debate for months,'' adding:
``Their new-found readiness to debate shows this campaign is
tightening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington, Ray's office neither confirmed nor denied that
the legal deliberations could lead to an indictment of Clinton
after he leaves office on Jan. 20. Ray emphasized in an ABC News'
interview in March when he succeeded special prosecutor Kenneth
Starr that he would determine ``whether crimes have been committed
and whether ... it is appropriate to bring charges'' against the
president after he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert condemned the inopportune
revelation, saying: ``The timing of this leak reeks to high
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of potential federal legal action against a high
ranking official at a sensitive moment in the election year
recalled the indictment of former Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger by special prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh four days before
the 1992 election. Aides to then-President George Bush blamed the
indictment for contributing to the Republican's loss to Clinton
that November.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, a federal judge threw out the one-count
indictment against Weinberger in connection with a six-year inquiry
into Reagan administration arms sales to Iran and the secret
diversion of some of the profits from the sales to provide arms to
anti-Marxist guerrillas battling the regime in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign criticized the disclosure Thursday, with the
Bush spokeswoman saying: ``We think the timing is wrong,'' adding:
``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made on
the day that the vice president is going to accept the Democratic
nomination. This election is not about the past, it's about the
future.''

 &HT;    THE AL GORE BIOGRAPHY QUIZ
 &HT;    By FRANK CERABINO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's say, for argument's sake, that you actually
listened to all the speeches this week. I know. Nobody's that
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nobody here at the convention actually listened to the
speeches. The protesters outside the hall were too busy condemning
the convention to listen. The reporters were too busy analyzing to
actually listen. And the delegates are too busy checking out each
other's goofy hats and buying $3 McDonald's quarter-pounders on the
concourse level.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches on the convention floor went on for nearly seven
hours every day, a kind of rhetorical Muzak that most people here
tuned out by the first afternoon. There were always seats available
in the media section, even during the big speeches, and the network
anchors _ as if to punctuate their lack of enthusiasm for the
proceedings _ sat in glass enclosures with their backs facing the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm concerned that America has missed some of the incredibly
important information that has come from the podium during this
week.

SALLY AMATO, 82, A FOUNDER OF AN INTIMATE OPERA COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sally Amato, a singer and actress who founded the
Amato Opera with her husband, the conductor Anthony Amato, died on
Aug. 16 at her home in City Island in the Bronx. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years, Amato was in many ways the welcoming
face of her family-run opera company. An operagoer was greeted by
her at the door of the tiny Amato theater on the Bowery, and would
then proceed down a flight of stairs or into the balcony, where
Anthony Amato would conduct, stopping at intermission to draw
raffles out of a barrel and award prizes to audience members. The
company became a home for enthusiasts on both sides of the
footlights: amateur singers (and some who became professionals) go
there to learn and perform the great works and occasional rarities,
and opera lovers on tight budgets go there to hear their favorite
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Amato was born Serafina Bellantone in Manhattan in 1917. She
began her performing career as a child, when she and her sisters
performed vaudeville skits in movie theaters, and she continued to
work as an actress and singer into the first decades of the Amato
Opera, which she and her husband started in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   She met Anthony Amato in 1943, when they were both performing at
the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. Their meeting itself was
not auspicious: the two had been cast as American Indians, and in
one scene Anthony Amato was to throw his future wife to the floor
and kick her. But she was charmed by his expressions of concern
when the scene ended. She also said that she admired his tenor
voice.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1945, and continued to work together at the
American Theater Wing, where Anthony Amato directed workshops. They
also shared an abiding love of opera, and it occurred to them soon
after World War II that a company was needed to provide
opportunities for aspiring singers returning from military service.
The Amato Opera gave its first performances in the basement of Our
Lady of Pompeii Church in Greenwich Village. The company later
moved to 159 Bleecker St.; in 1963 it took over the jewel box
theater at the corner of the Bowery and Second Street that has been
its home ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Amato performed with the company under her maiden name for
several seasons, but she increasingly took on many of the house's
nonmusical jobs. She made many of the company's costumes, ran its
box office, and operated its lighting board.
</P>
<P>
   Amato is survived by her husband and a sister, Ann Frydel, of
Manhattan. &QL;

LAZIO EXPRESSES OPTIMISM ON UPSTATE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENDICOTT, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican Senate
candidate, toured two high-tech businesses Thursday to underscore
what he said were bright spots in the upstate economy and to
counter what he said were Hillary Rodham Clinton's portrayals of
the region as an ``economic wasteland.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, on the second day of a bus tour across the state, watched
machinery spool cable wire at a plant in Cortland and then donned a
white protective coat and blue ducks as he inspected components for
motion sensors at a company in Ithaca.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he called the companies examples of an economic
rebound and models of the future in a region that he said had got a
negative reputation. Although upstate has lagged in job growth, it
is now catching up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we are in an economic wasteland, like the other
side likes us to believe,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep things moving, Lazio said, he would work for tax relief
for businesses, including cutting the capital gains tax rate from
20 percent to 15 percent, and encourage technology businesses to
move upstate, perhaps linking with local colleges and universities,
as the Kionix Technology Co. in Ithaca did with Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   The state's chief economist, Stephen Kagann, reported last month
that private-sector employment increased and unemployment rates
fell over the last year, both downstate and upstate. Private
employment in June rose 2.3 percent over June 1999, with a 2.5
percent increase in New York City and its suburbs and 1.8 percent
upstate. The national growth rate was 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts, however, have said that much of the growth
occurred in low-paying retail jobs. The statewide unemployment rate
fell to 4.5 percent in June from 5.3 percent a year earlier but
still remained higher than the national average of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates view the upstate region as a pivotal trough of
votes and have mounted remarkably similar swings through the area.
Just last month, Clinton, too, visited electronics and technology
companies, advocating those sectors as potential areas of growth
and promising tax breaks and other incentives. Her aides said she
has never called the region a wasteland but, like Lazio, has talked
of young people leaving the area for higher-paying jobs and the
need to explore other areas like technology to stimulate growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, Hillary is the only candidate in this race who
knows upstate needs more jobs and has a plan to create them,' said
Cathie Levine, a spokeswoman for Clinton, referring to a plan the
first lady unveiled in February.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio sought to keep his day focused on the economy, he
was distracted by the tactics of Clinton's campaign, which has a
young worker following the congressman with a videocamera for
prospective advertising footage, and the Democratic Party, which
has sent a young man dressed as Uncle Sam to pursue Lazio and
demand he release his income tax returns. Lazio, for the third
consecutive day, said he would release the returns sometime this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides, after nearly three months of tolerating the young
man's videotaping, turned angry Thursday and began holding signs in
front of the man's camera. One aide stuck his face right up against
the lens, with a hard stare.
</P>
<P>
   At a stop in Owego, Lazio ended his remarks to a gathering of
party loyalists by introducing the young man who was taping him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let's all say hello to Hillary Clinton and the whole
Clinton camp,'' Lazio said. ``We don't have to resort to that
stuff, do we?'' A chorus of no's then rose up from the four dozen
people.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had arrived in Owego somewhat self-consciously since his
staff had misspelled it in a news advisory as Oswego _ which is on
the shores of Lake Ontario about 300 miles away. The gaffe was
noted by local newspapers Thursday. The campaigns have seized on
each other's upstate geographical blunders as evidence of a lack of
familiarity with the state.

MILT ROSEN, 77, A MASTER OF ZINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milt Rosen, a versatile writer whose work included television
scripts, comedy one-liners and books, died Aug. 11 at his home in
Los Angeles. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said a friend and author, Austin Kalisch.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's more than a dozen books include ``The Second Book of
Insults'' (1985), containing lines like: ``She's not very
photogenic, especially in person,'' ``He stays longer in an hour
than most people do in a week,'' and ``She's not the girl she used
to be, and she never was.''
</P>
<P>
   He also edited the book ``More of the Best of Milton Berle's
Private Joke File'' (1994, Avon). Berle and Arnold Schwarzenegger
were among the celebrities he wrote one-liners for.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen edited the book ``A Treasury of Sports Quotes and Wisdom''
(1999) Rosen and Robert Foster were nominated for an Edgar Award of
the Mystery Writers of America in 1976 for an episode ``Murder
Comes in Little Pills'' for the CBS series ``Kate McShane.'' Among
the other television series Rosen wrote for were `CHiPs,'' ``Lewis
&AMP; Clark,'' ``Mr. Novak'' and ``Tales of the Gold Monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a co-author of the screenplay for the film ``Do Not
Disturb'' (1965) with Doris Day.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Poland, Rosen came to New York City with his family as a
toddler and went on to graduate from City College. During World War
II he became chief navigator of his squadron in the 8th Air Force
in the European Theater of Operations. He won the Air Medal five
times, Kalisch said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen taught in New York City public schools and moved to
California in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Judy; a son, Joshua; two daughters,
Stephanie Rimbach and Rachel Rosen, all of Los Angeles; and four
grandchildren. &QL;

IN WAKE OF OLYMPIC TRIALS, U.S. SWIMMERS HAVE LITTLE REST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The U.S. Olympic swimming trials ended Wednesday
night, only a month before the 2000 Summer Games begin in Sydney,
Australia. It was a scheduling decision that was both calculated
and risky.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Americans held their trials so close to the
Games was also the last time the Summer Olympics were held across
the international date line _ 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. Except
for Janet Evans and Matt Biondi, the Americans put on a tepid
performance in Seoul, and for only the second time in the history
of the modern Games did not win the swimming medal.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Americans held the 1996 Olympic trials in
March, four months before the Atlanta Games, giving swimmers a
chance to decompress before building their training again toward
the Olympics. The United States ended up winning 26 medals (13
gold) in Atlanta, more than any other country, in the home pool.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Dolan, who won the 400-meter individual medley in Atlanta,
was highly critical of the U.S. swimming federation for not putting
the same break between the 2000 trials and the Sydney Games.
Athletes would essentially have to remain at their peak from now
through late September, he said after winning the 400-meter and
200-meter individual medleys at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's one big meet that takes two months,'' Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Talbot, who coaches the Australian Olympic swim team,
said the Americans might benefit from holding the trials so close
to the Olympics. It can be difficult for swimmers to regain their
momentum and intensity in training when there is a long period
between the two events, he said. The Americans will now train for
two weeks in Pasadena, Calif., before beginning to taper their
workouts as they point toward the Sydney Games. The swimming
competition begins on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned something from 1988,'' said Richard Quick, who will
coach the American women's team in Sydney. ``We do need to have
that balance of work and rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine American records were set at these trials, compared with
none in 1996, but no world records were broken, compared with five
world records set at the Australian trials in May. In Sydney, the
American men will be favored to win six golds _ two by Lenny
Krayzelburg, in the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes; Dolan in the
400 individual medley; and Tom Malchow in the 200-meter butterfly
and a pair of relays. Gary Hall Jr. also swam the fastest 50-meter
freestyle in an eight-lane competition and could upset the Olympic
champion Aleksandr Popov of Russia. Ed Moses could also win the
100-meter breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   The American women will be favored in only two individual events
_ the defending Olympic champion Brooke Bennett in the 800-meter
freestyle and 16-year-old Megan Quann in the 100-meter
breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprints, Dara Torres, at age 33, will be the first
American to swim in four Olympic Games. Jenny Thompson has been
among the world leaders for a decade. But they will be underdogs in
Sydney to Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands, who has set world
records this year in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle and the
100-meter butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to improve,'' Quick said of the women's team.
``We're ranked No. 1 in the world in one event, the 800 freestyle.
It's my belief we have athletes in many events that have the right
to think about and prepare for winning efforts. But they will have
to swim better than they ever have in their lives to do that.''

GORE FACES UPHILL BATTLE IN COUNTDOWN WEEKS TO ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the past half-century, America's fall
presidential campaigns have resembled less a come-from-behind horse
race, and more a hydroplane race in which one boat stays ahead from
starting line to checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1960, when Richard Nixon had a wafer-thin lead over
John F. Kennedy, has a candidate ahead in the polls on Labor Day
lost the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has run behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush
in opinion surveys throughout the year, even as the national
economy has continued to surge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   As he took the podium Thursday night, Gore was still waiting for
the convention ``bounce'' that would narrow the gap with Bush and
show that the vice president is emerging from the shadow that Bill
Clinton has cast over American politics for the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in a subordinate role, vice presidents have a traditional
problem getting respect. But the malady has been painfully acute
with the current No. 2 man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think Al Gore was born in the summer of 1992,''
said James Carville, the consultant who helped put Clinton in the
White House that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is very talented and very smart but he doesn't understand
political communication. ... The public is bored by him,'' said
Frank Luntz, a top Republican opinion expert who has been
assembling focus groups of undecided voters for MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faces a narrow post-convention window of attention to make
American voters see him, in Gore's words Thursday night, as ``my
own man'' and an agenda-driven potential president different in
character from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a Gore intimate, reflected on the
difficult, multi-dimensional task facing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to establish Gore as a real leader,'' Dicks said. ``We
have to show him as a real human being. And we have to energize the
Democratic base. Republicans are already unified. Democrats have to
get off their duffs and show the same intensity and desire we're
seeing with the Republicans. They want the White House back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is appearing increasingly robust, recently
taking the GOP nominee to Democratic-leaning West Coast states and
agreeing to hold a record five debates during the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush managers said Thursday that they are ready for three
Bush-Gore faceoffs and a pair of encounters between vice
presidential nominees Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman. Just last
month, Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, forecast only two
debates and said: ``Our debate strategy can be summed up in one
word: Survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has built his lead in the polls, in large
part, coming across as an affable, unthreatening and at-ease guy,
focused on a few big-picture goals.
</P>
<P>
   Using an array of surrogates, including Jim Frush, the
Seattle-area attorney who guided Gore to the top of Mount Rainier
last summer, Gore's campaign has spent the week seeking to humanize
its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Key Democrats concede, however, the likeability battle may
already be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake is not whether you want to have lunch with
him, or a beer with him, but whether you want him running the
country,'' said Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, a former Democratic
National Chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The main hope for a Gore victory is summed up in five words by
Dicks: ``Issues are on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe they hold the high ground on an array of
popular proposals: prescription drug coverage for seniors under
Medicare; a patient's bill of rights in dealing with health
insurers; a higher minumum wage; guarantees of privacy in the
information age; and protection of America's environment.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Greenberg, President Clinton's pollster, did a nationwide
survey of 1,007 voters last week. It found that Gore trailed Bush
by nine points, but that Democrats have an advantage in public
confidence on such issues as health care, Medicare and managing the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush wins this race by nine points, boom! The (Democratic)
party is wiped out,'' Carville said. ``It would be like the
dinosaurs.'' The ``Ragin Cajun'' political strategist is convinced,
however, that Republicans have reached ``their high-water mark.''
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential race unfolds, key developments to watch
include:
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATIC TENT: As he spoke Thursday night, polls showed
Gore supported by only 75 percent of Democrats, while Bush enjoys
90-plus percent support among Republican-leaning voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has to win back Democrats inclined to vote for Bush,
including one-quarter of union voters, according to Greenberg's
poll. He also needs to ``deal with Nader,'' in Dicks' words.
</P>
<P>
   By draining support from Gore, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader
has helped turn states that Democrats need to win into tossups.
Washington, Oregon and Michigan are three examples.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEBATES: Having bested such foes as Jack Kemp, Ross Perot
and Bill Bradley in the past, Gore will confront huge expectations
when he takes the stage with Bush this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As to Bush, ``He simply has to survive and not make mistakes,''
said independent pollster John Zogby. ``Voters are telling us they
like George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   SEPTEMBER'S SHOWDOWN: President Clinton has gone eye-to-eye with
Congress' Republican leadership in recent fall budget battles, and
it is the GOP that has blinked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can use the upcoming budget showdown to focus attention
on such topics as patients' rights and prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (congressional leaders') worst nightmare,'' Dodd said.
``It is an opportunity to break through into public consciousness
with our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   THE STRETCH RUN: Dramatic come-from-behind victories haven't
happened since Harry Truman's whistle stop campaign of 1948, but
stretch runs do happen.
</P>
<P>
   After falling far behind after early fall debates, Nixon came
within 110,000 votes of catching Kennedy. Hubert Humphrey,
massively outspent and with Democrats divided over Vietnam, wiped
out a 15-point deficit in the polls and barely lost to Nixon in
1968. Gerald Ford trailed Jimmy Carter by as much as 30 points in
1976 polls, but lost 50-48 in a photo-finish election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice Presidents are good closers,'' said Carville. ``Gore is a
good closer.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of this year, a largely contented America has tuned out
the televised babble of political junkies, and switched channels
when the Republican and Democratic national conventions came on.
Opinion experts are encountering a public that has refused to pay
much attention to picking a new president.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Brazile, Gore's campaign manager, summed it up on CNN on
Thursday night: ``People are really taking their time to figure out
where they are and where they want to go.''

GORE TO EMPHASIZE DRY TIMBER OF ISSUES OVER FLASH AND DAZZLE OF
PERSONALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Updates with quotes from speech and comments from Gore aides on
future of campaign) 
   By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Gore tried to accomplish a political feat so
daunting Thursday night that even, say, President Clinton himself
might have had trouble pulling it off.
</P>
<P>
   Gore presented himself as his own man and skated over his
service as vice president as he sought to persuade the nation that
he is more than the dutiful lieutenant. But he also tried to take
credit for helping to bring about ``the biggest surpluses ever'' _
the grandest achievement of the Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to shake the impressions of Americans who, in the words
of his campaign chairman, think he is ``boring, stiff'' and
``unable to speak.'' But he also asserted that he would build a
campaign based on the dry timber of issues rather than on the flash
and dazzle of personality.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to embolden and excite liberals whose turnout are
essential to his victory. But he also tried to embolden and excite
moderate voters who are crucial to a victory in November _ and have
shown an interest in Gov. George W. Bush of Texas that has alarmed
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's elaborate _ and often conflicting _ objectives Thursday
night, and throughout this convention week, reflect the trying
challenges he and the Democrats confront as they emerge from this
convention. Forget all the confetti and mirthful talk of harmony
from the rostrum this week. For the Democrats, happy days are
certainly not here again. They may not be panicked, but they are
jittery about their standard bearer. And they are jittery about
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a difficult campaign,'' said James Patrick Leahy, a
delegate from Ohio, even after four days of enforced partisan
cheerleading. ``Gore has one of those personalities you have to
develop a relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   The polls showing Gore behind, Leahy said, have dampened his
enthusiasm. ``The polling has a psychological effect,'' he said.
``It's like when you go to the race track and look at the racing
form and see your horse isn't supposed to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no such worries when the Republicans concluded their
political production in Philadelphia two weeks ago. At that
convention, Dick Cheney, the vice presidential nominee, did not
have to scurry from constituent group to constituent group with
words of appeasement _ as Sen. Joseph Lieberman did Thursday, and
the two days before.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years on the outside, even Republican delegates who
were not pleased with the inclusive tone of the program were so
desperate to return to power that it took little, if any, prodding
to corral them behind Bush. Eight years ago, Democrats were also
willing to put aside their differences in the name of the greater
goal of helping Bill Clinton bring them back to power. Now, they
are less accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   So the party tried to fire up the rank and file by jamming the
stage this week with liberal icons like Sen. Edward Kennedy and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, and leaders of labor, abortion rights and gay
rights groups. Even Senator Lieberman, in his acceptance speech,
retreated from his usual condemnation of the collapsed culture of
Hollywood and instead played the partisan.
</P>
<P>
   More than one Democratic official complained that the campaign
this week seemed more focused on winning over the liberals who
might back Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, than the biggest
threat, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that, unlike the Republicans, the Democrats had
less success in presenting a convention that appeared to be broader
than the party itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans played to the country _ the Democrats played
to the hall,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ``Voters
saw through the big tent Republican convention. They know it was
staged. But they were thankful that somebody cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is Al Gore. Whether it is his link to the
scandals of Clinton, the unfavorable comparisons to the more
politically adroit president _ or simply his personality _
Democrats here are are just not as enamored of their new nominee.
On this day four years ago, even the bombshell that Clinton's top
strategist was having an affair with a call girl did nothing to
disrupt _ and maybe added a little spice _ to the week of lock-step
partisan harmony behind the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before his boss was to deliver the most consequential
speech of his political career, one of Gore's top aides confessed
that he was worried because the campaign was still roiled by
squabbling factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Daley has not gotten the warlords under control yet,''
this campaign official said, referring to William Daley, Gore's
campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident, certainly, that Gore spewed out lots of
policy Thursday night. He was trying to make the case that ``people
deserve to know specifically what a candidate proposes to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of polls showing that the public gives Democrats higher
marks than Republicans on a range of issues, Gore's aides said they
hope the campaign can be fought on that terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Before he can do that, Gore wants to neutralize Bush's biggest
advantage _ his appealing personality. That explains that footage
in a film Thursday night lauding Gore for his Frankenstein disguise
during a Halloween party. That is why all week Democrats, and the
candidate himself, offered testaments to the fuzzy and decidedly
un-vice-presidential Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Bush has the edge on charm, Gore said, ``The
presidency is not a popularity contest. It's a day-to-day fight for
people. Sometimes, you have to chose to do what's difficult or
unpopular. Sometimes you have to be willing to spend your
popularity in order to pick the hard right over the easy wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then-Vice President George Bush, in his acceptance speech
in Dallas in 1988, did not face the difficulties of Gore. He, too,
had the unfortunate fate of having to stand on his own after eight
years in the shadow of a far more dexterous political performer.
But Bush never had such trouble untangling himself from Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic transfer of political power was far smoother in
1988 when Reagan put forth a dignified and full-throated pitch for
his No. 2. This week, Clinton was criticized for not making more of
an energetic case for Gore in his speech here on Monday _ or in
their joint appearance in Michigan the next day. The rub is that
had he been more generous in his praise, Clinton might have been
accused of injecting himself too much into the role of star
performer giving an assist to his understudy. In his speech
Thursday night, Gore seemed to borrow a bit from the playbook of
the man whose son is standing in his way to the White House. He
directly addressed what the personality questions, saying, ``If you
entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be the most
exciting politician.'' But, he pledged, ``I will work for you every
day and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Bush said in 1988: ``I may not be the most eloquent,
but I learned that eloquence won't draw oil from the ground. I may
sometimes be a little awkward, but there's nothing self-conscious
in my love of country.''And, as Bush did 12 years ago, Gore sought
to fasten himself to the economic successes of his administration
</P>
<P>
   . ``Instead of losing jobs,'' Gore said, ``we have 22 million
new jobs. Above all, our success comes from you, the people who
have worked hard for your families.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush put it this way in 1988, ``We've created 17 million new
jobs in the past five years,'' more than twice as many as in Europe
and Japan combined.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the appeal will work and that people will
entrust Gore to continue bringing the nation down the path of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telling acknowledgment that the campaign ahead will not
be easy, Gore's aides were already playing down the import of
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important moment, a crescendo,'' said Tad Devine,
one of Gore's top strategists. ``It's the first time Al Gore is on
the stage by himself. But there will be other big moments in this
campaign, including the presidential debates.''

LEWINSKY GRAND JURY TIMING `REEKS' TO DEMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats meeting in Monica Lewinsky's hometown
were outraged Thursday to learn that a new grand jury had been
impaneled to hear evidence against President Clinton in the scandal
involving the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   They were convinced that the timing of the news, which rippled
through the Democratic National Convention only hours before Al
Gore accepted his party's presidential nomination, was designed to
derail his race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But they predicted it would not affect the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has taken pains throughout his campaign to distance himself
from the scandal, which led to Clinton's impeachment by the House
and acquittal in a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing reeks to high heaven,'' said Eric Hartman, a
convention delegate from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's part of a consistent pattern to get people to
concentrate on extraneous matters'' and ignore more substantive
differences between Gore and Republican nominee George W. Bush,
Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman blamed the news leak about a grand jury that was
impaneled more than a month ago on Republicans who want to continue
to ``hound Clinton'' and hurt Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' moaned Sue Schechter, chairwoman of the Harris
County (Texas) Democratic Party. ``I'm sure it's to take away from
Gore's (acceptance) speech. They never know when to stop playing
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Ahmed, a delegate from Detroit, predicted the Republican
ploy _ if that's what it was _ wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an Arab-American. But in Southern terms, that dog won't
hunt,'' he said. ``The American people have had their time to look
at this for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Guthrie, an auto parts worker from Three Rivers, Mich.,
blamed the news media for keeping the Lewinsky story alive by
giving the independent counsel a forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pure trash. If the press can't find anything else to go
for, they ought to pack their bags and move out of the country,''
he said. ``I'm tired of the press trashing our country. It's your
country, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Rizzo, a delegate from Newton, Mass., also lashed out at
the news media. ``I think it's a ridiculous waste of time and a
ridiculous waste of ink for newspapers,'' she said. ``People don't
want to hear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said that people would rather hear about other issues,
such as health care.
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Sheppard, secretary-treasurer of the Texas AFL-CIO and a
delegate from Austin, said the timing of the news ``probably
stinks.'' The aim, he said, was to help Bush by turning off
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just trying to drive voter participation
down,'' Sheppard said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Krausz, of Swarthmore, Pa., predicted the new grand jury
probe will be a negative for Bush in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all this rhetoric about running a positive campaign, all
these behind the scenes attacks by others have a chance of
backfiring on him,'' Krausz said. ``The American public is smart
enough to see things don't happen by coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of Claremount Graduate University agreed
that the investigation could hurt Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good for Gore, but there could be a backlash,'' she
said. ``They (voters) are sick and tired of Clinton, but they're
also sick and tired of the scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe said the development also could put Gore's running mate,
Joseph Lieberman, on the spot. Lieberman was an early Democratic
critic of Clinton's behavior during the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he (Lieberman) fall in line or does he continue to speak
out?'' she asked.

GORE ACCEPTS DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vowing to extend prosperity to the working
families that he's made central to his campaign, Democrat Al Gore
on Thursday accepted his party's presidential nomination,
declaring, ``Our whole future is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The future should belong to everyone in this land,'' Gore said
in remarks prepared for delivery at the Democratic National
Convention. ``We could squander this moment, but our country would
be poorer for it. Instead, let's lift our eyes and see how wide the
American horizon has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the most important speech of his life on the
convention's closing night, the 52-year-old vice president marked a
pivotal moment between more than a year of non-stop campaigning and
the final sprint to Election Day Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to project a passion that would overcome low
expectations, lagging polls numbers and the reputation for a stiff
personality that has been the subject of Republican derision, late
night television one-liners and even his own self-deprecation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know this,'' Gore said in accepting the
Democratic nomination and calling on voters to support him and his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken on the powerful forces. And as president, I'll
stand up to them, and I'll stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   He specifically mentioned the pharmaceutical industry, invoking
a key campaign theme _ health care reforms including Medicare
coverage for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll fight for it and the other side will not,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan crowd responded often with applause and cheers of
``Go, Al, Go.''
</P>
<P>
   With his campaign for president trailing Republican Gov. George
W. Bush for months heading into the Democratic National Convention,
Gore strove in a speech he wrote himself to knit his name and
message to the nation's bounding economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that the stock market has boomed and so many
businesses and new enterprises have done well,'' he said. ``This
country is richer and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my focus is on working families _ people trying to make
house payments and car payments, working overtime to save for
college and do right by their kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to those who did not support him and his more centrist
campaign for president, Gore acknowledged Bill Bradley, the former
U.S. senator from New Jersey the vice president vanquished in the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lighting on a question raised frequently about his difficulty in
emerging from the shadow of President Clinton, Gore said, ``We're
electing a new president. And I stand here tonight as my own man,
and I want you to know me for who I truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week leading up to Gore's climactic speech,
Democratic supporters and family members have urgently worked to
convey an enhanced, multifaceted image of Gore, whom many voters
say they find stolid and inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore, his wife of 30 years and an avid amateur
photographer, introduced her husband at the convention through a
montage of her own pictures and others showing the family man
behind the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of you know that faith and family are at the center of
Al's life,'' she said. ``Many of you know Al to be a decisive
leader with strong values, deeply held convictions and an
unwavering commitment to making the American dream a reality for
all our people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also want you to know that as a husband, father and
grandfather, Al has always been there for our family and he will
always be there for yours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Texan Robert Strauss, former ambassador to the Soviet Union and
lifelong friend and adviser to presidents of both parties, said
earlier this week that in order to connect with voters, Gore would
have to deliver an issue-laden convention address that also was
``appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biographical journey that preceded Gore's speech traced his
life from Carthage, Tenn., to Harvard College, Vietnam, years spent
working as a journalist, 16 years in Congress and eight as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   In adding family flourishes, such as remarks by his wife and
daughters Karenna and Kristin, to Gore's delivery on the
convention's national stage, his handlers hope to benefit from a
post-convention ``bounce'' in the polls, such as the one that Bush
enjoyed after the Republican National Convention two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Gore laid out a list of accomplishments and an
agenda for the country's future aimed at closing the gap between
the Democratic and Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal budget surplus makes possible ``a full range
of targeted tax cuts to working families. Not just to help them
save for college, but to pay for health insurance or child care, to
reform the estate tax ... and to end the marriage penalty _ the
right way, the fair way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he wants to build upon the nation's prosperity, as
symbolized by expanding federal budget surpluses, the lowest
inflation rate in a generation and 22 million new jobs since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families,'' Gore said. ``And for all
our good times, I am not satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   In a swipe at Bush and what Gore has deemed the ``do-nothing
Republican Congress,'' Gore said: ``Let me say plainly. I will not
go along with a huge tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of
everyone else and wreck our good economy in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, try as he might to define his own persona separate from
Clinton, the president's ongoing legal troubles invariably inserted
themselves during what was to be Gore's unspoiled moment in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to address the convention, the disclosure came
from Washington that a new federal grand jury was impaneled July 11
to hear evidence in Clinton's affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a decision by special prosecutor Robert Ray on
whether to indict Clinton for obstruction of justice and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert condemned the inopportune
revelation, saying: ``The timing of this leak reeks to high
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign was similarly critical of the news, as was
Karen Hughes, spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, who said, ``We
think the timing is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Also before Gore's address, the Bush campaign announced from
Austin that Bush and running mate Dick Cheney would negotiate a
total of five debates this fall with Gore and his running mate,
Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   With the conclusion of the convention, Gore and Lieberman plan a
four-day 400-mile boat trip down the Mississippi River starting
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The journey aboard the Mark Twain river boat would take them
past the key of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri,
battlegrounds in the race for electoral college votes.

 &HT;    DOES AL GORE'S VISION OF AMERICA REFLECT REALITY?
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the past week, the focus of speculation about
Al Gore has been whether the American people really know him, as he
said in his speech Thursday night, for who he truly is.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's acceptance speech at the Democratic National
Convention suggested another question that could be even more
important to the outcome of the November election: How well does
Gore know the American people?
</P>
<P>
   The hard-working families Gore spoke of, struggling to make the
monthly house payment and educate their children, have been stock
characters in Democratic speeches since the party began turning
toward the center and distancing itself from its special interest
groups. That strategy proved so effective the Republicans this year
have gone all-out to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   These days those working families come in many more
configurations than they used to, which ought to work to the
advantage of what has traditionally been the party of outsiders and
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there is keen competition for families of all
sorts, and it was for this reason that the vice president pointed
out several specific Americans and their families in his speech,
attempting to personalize a larger American family that is becoming
more and more extended.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged several debts in this speech, outright or
implicitly.
</P>
<P>
   First and most obviously, he thanked Bill Clinton, on whose
watch grew the economy on which the Democrats' appeal this year is
centered.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged to continue having open meetings in the places
where Americans live and work, something he said he has been doing
for 25 years. Perhaps so, but in this campaign year it was
Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley who made the first
inroads with their freewheeling town meetings. Gore, the good
student, shifted to this format early on, giving him the vital
boost that insured his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Through the efforts of his wife Tipper, Gore has been identified
with those who decry the coarsening of the American culture. But in
decrying a culture with ``too much meanness and not enough
meaning,'' he was clearly leaning more in the direction of his
running mate, Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are deep concerns about the violence and license
in much of popular culture. But that's a slippery slope in
presidential politics, as the Republicans have learned. It wasn't
coincidence that Gore's words were preceded by Tipper bobbing out
on stage to ``Turn the Beat Around'' and showing America her looser
side.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's entrance across a convention floor, which was much more
crowded and boisterous than the one at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia, was a risky but perhaps necessary move.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only needed to negate the image of stiffness which has
dogged him, but even more he needed to electrify this Democratic
crowd and demonstrate to the American television audience that this
party will pursue the presidency with as much enthusiasm as the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risk to deliver this long a speech and write it
himself, but the Gore campaign did have the foresight to bring the
candidate on stage a few minutes ahead of prime time, and to put
some of his most important lines in the opening paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   It was, indeed, a different Gore than most Americans think they
know. The question now is how closely those Americans he singled
out Thursday night resemble the electorate that will show up to
vote in November.

TURMOIL AT UNITED MAY FORCE DELEGATES TO FLEE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thousands of delegates in Los Angeles for the
Democratic National Convention are being urged to leave Friday
instead of Sunday to avoid delays caused by a labor dispute at
United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the early departure could cost the city and region millions
of dollars in lost tourist revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking to people in Beverly Hills and businesses
there have definitely felt a positive impact from the convention,''
said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of money was being dropped on Rodeo Drive,'' he said.
``The economic impact is estimated to be $4million spent on retail.
If they are told to get out of town, you are taking away a few good
business days.''
</P>
<P>
   UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, has delayed or
canceled thousands of flights this summer, primarily due to a
dispute with its 10,500 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes as United, the official airline for the
Democratic convention, scrambles to shuttle thousands of delegates,
lobbyists and journalists home from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   United has four information stands set up at the Democratic
National Convention _ two inside Staples Center and two inside the
Convention Center _ where a steady stream of delegates and media
members checked on flights Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Curley, a public relations specialist from Washington,
D.C., wanted to make sure she has a seat on her 6:30 a.m. flight
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' she said after being reassured by a United
employee. ``I wanted to make sure my flight was still going and it
wasn't delayed or canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois delegates, who will fly back to United's Chicago hub
today, were warned by delegation leaders to go early to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Kaplan, a delegate from Chicago, was supposed to fly
United but changed her flight. ``I'm flying American back because I
flew United a week ago for a vacation and was delayed eight hours
going from Maine to Chicago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline says its pilots have refused to work overtime and
increasingly have been calling in sick to protest prolonged
contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents United pilots,
denies there is any organized job action.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled this
summer, some due to bad weather but most because of the labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking steps to protect the high number of passengers
leaving Los Angeles and flying back to their homes,'' said Matt
Triaca, an airline spokesman. ``We plan to allocate enough spare
planes to key hubs.''
</P>
<P>
   At Los Angeles International Airport, United is fully staffed
and has extra planes and crews standing by just in case they are
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline also bulked up to get delegates to the convention,
but their efforts were lost on Ed Hasevawa, a delegate from
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delayed three hours coming out here. I hope I'm not
delayed three days going back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline issued an apology to its passengers Thursday and
handed out bonus miles to its most loyal customers in a face-saving
move that came on the same day as an embarrassing earnings
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a month, UAL Corp. announced Thursday
that it expects third-quarter earnings per share to be lower than
the $2.60-to-$3.20 range it previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say the revised earnings estimates are because
travelers worried about flight cancellations at its United unit are
switching to other air carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Kyser said savvy travelers shouldn't wait until a cancellation
to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though United Airlines is the largest airline at LAX, it
is not the dominant carrier,'' he said. ``You have American, Delta
and Southwest among others. If you were in Chicago it's American
and United. You are not being held hostage at LAX.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of cancellations and delays by United and other air
carriers, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has called for a
summit with the airlines' chief executives in Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will also include airport and labor officials in an
attempt to address the recent impact of weather, scheduling and
other problems put on the traveling public.

other problems put on the traveling public.

NETZERO FORGES LOCAL ADVERTISING ALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE _ Hoping to expand its core source of revenue,
NetZero announced Thursday its partnership with a producer of local
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership between the free Internet access provider and
Fairfax, Va.-based Amazing Media means that NetZero subscribers
will now see the site's ubiquitous ads coming from companies in
their own regions.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Goldston
described the deal as a pioneering venture in Internet advertising
akin to ``spot media'' ads seen and heard on local television and
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``For (small businesses), it's like create-your-own-ad,''
Goldston said. ``You're talking about a pretty potent idea.''
Analysts called the agreement a minor, but necessary, development.
</P>
<P>
   ``NetZero is exclusively deriving revenues from e-commerce,''
said Youssef Squali of ING Baring. ``They have to be able to
attract not only national advertisers but local advertisers as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses near NetZero users will target them based on
profiling traits picked up by NetZero's zCast feature. The
technology allows the Internet service provider to monitor a Web
surfer's navigation and interests and flash ads from local
companies on the NetZero window onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Squali said that the strategy's success will be measured further
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the pudding, right?'' he said. ``We should be
seeing NetZero making announcements regarding advertisers using
their services.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NetZero were up 25 cents to close at $4.94 on moderate
volume Thursday.

BOEING, UNION MEET OVER EMERGING OPERATIONS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The largest union at The Boeing Co. said Thursday the
company had notified it of an emerging plan to shut down some
operations, move others and uproot but retain roughly 1,000 union
members.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the potential moves created anxiety among some
affected workers in the Puget Sound area who worried about the
possibility of longer commutes and new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years Boeing would close its Harbour Pointe
facility near Mukilteo, transferring at least 300 workers to other
company jobs in the region, according to the International
Association of Machinists District Lodge 751. The union said it
expected Boeing to unveil the proposal Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, outlined for the first time in Thursday's
Post-Intelligencer, would also call for Boeing to build new tools
in Wichita, Kan., tapping 2,000 Puget Sound tooling workers for
support programs and retraining an additional 350 members, the
union said.
</P>
<P>
   The union posted an outline of the plan on its website Thursday,
and said an announcement was coming Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials Thursday said the company had nothing to
announce. Company spokesmen declined to comment on the union's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not announcing anything at this point. But, if
something does come to pass we would be endeavoring to communicate
directly with our employees,'' Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman,
told the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are scared,'' said one worker at Harbour Pointe, who
requested anonymity. ``It's like we are being sold down the river.
We don't know at which port we are going to land.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps, if taken, would represent the latest in Boeing's
broader campaign to shed underutilized assets and boost efficiency.
If the Seattle-based company does announce a consolidation plan
Friday, that may not be the only step it takes in the region to
trim operations.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from Boeing workers to reports of the emerging plan was
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees said the potential steps could help the company
eliminate unnecessary costs, while also allowing union members to
retain their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of new airplane orders at Boeing also is making some
employees feel a bit more comfortable, according to Steve Vergala,
who works on parts control in the wire shop of Boeing's massive
Everett, Wash., facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more orders they see the better off people feel,'' Vergala
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others worried that the potential consolidation is only the
beginning of deeper cuts, according to John Scofield, who works in
final assembly on the 777 airplane line in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in our area think this is just the
beginning of the end over the next five to 10 years,'' Scofield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other steps, announced by the union but not confirmed by the
company, the company would take include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Close a machine shop in Kent, which employs more than 300
people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Move an emergency support team, known as Blue Streak, to
Boeing's EMF building in Auburn. The plan would also eventually
shift a similar team in Everett to the Auburn facility.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consolidate Boeing Auburn facility's Process Assembly.
Affected union members would be retrained and receive lateral
positions in the region.

 &HT;    GORE VOWS TO FIGHT FOR 'EVERYDAY HEROES'
 &HT;    950&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore promised to support the
``quiet, everyday heroism of hard-working Americans'' as he
accepted the Democratic Party's presidential nomination Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that focused on the possibilities of the future
rather than the accomplishments of the Clinton administration, Gore
declared himself ``my own man'' as he re-introduced himself to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than try to match the charm of his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the notoriously formal Gore used his
acceptance speech to draw distinctions on issues he believes will
help him overcome Bush's steady lead in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my own imperfections,'' he said. ``I know that
sometimes people say I'm too serious, that I talk too much
substance and policy. Maybe I've done that tonight. But the
presidency is more than a popularity contest. It's a day-to-day
fight for people.''
</P>
<P>
   And with news of a new investigation of President Clinton
casting yet another shadow on his candidacy, Gore added, ``If you
entrust me with the presidency, I know that I won't always be the
most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will work
for you every day and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's new presidential standard-bearer promised to use the
federal government's record budget surplus to expand health care
coverage, improve education, shore up safety net programs and
extend tax cuts to help ``every hard-working family'' to ``open the
door to their dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged his support for affirmative action, new gun
controls, federal hate crime legislation, an increase in the
federal minimum wage, a patients bill of rights, funding for more
police and teachers and cracking down on the marketing of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Although frequently interrupted by the pennant waving delegates
and chants of ``Go, Al, Go,'' Gore drew the most sustained applause
when he reiterated his support for abortion rights, a direct
counterpoint to Bush's opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no doubt: I will protect and defend a woman's
right to choose,'' he said. ``The last thing this country needs is
a Supreme Court that overturns Roe v. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also recalled how he had fought ``against the powerful
interests'' over the course of his career, pushing for welfare
reform and an improved environment.
</P>
<P>
   And despite his own abuses of the campaign finance system, Gore
vowed that a reform bill will be the first one he sends to Congress
as president. ``Let others try to restore the old guard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also took direct aim at a sweeping tax cut proposal at the
heart of Bush's campaign. ``Let me say it pla Those concerns were
not diminished by the disclosure earlier Thursday that a new grand
jury has been empaneled to continue the investigation of Clinton in
connection with his extramarital affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Not only Democrats, but also Republicans expressed dismay over
the disclosure just hours before Gore was to accept his party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made
on the day that the vice president is going to accept the
Democratic nomination,'' said senior Bush strategist Karen Hughes.
``This election is not about the past; it's about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his acceptance speech, paid a glowing but brief tribute
to Clinton. ``Millions of Americans will live better lives for a
long time to come because of the job that's been done to President
Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we turn the page and write a new chapter,'' he said.
``We're entering a new time. We're electing a new president. And I
stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know who I
truly am.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I have strong values, the love of my family, my
faith, my love for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention delegates erupted with cheers as Gore entered the
convention hall after Tipper's introduction. Wearing the more
traditional blue suit rather than the earth tones that were
ridiculed during the presidential primaries, Gore took the unusual
route to the speaker's podium, charging down an aisle on the
convention floor past the Tennessee delegation.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Promising to champion ordinary folks and their children, Gore
said, ``Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better,
fairer, more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded the audience of the administration's economic
accomplishments: 22 million new jobs, the lowest inflation in a
generation, the highest home ownership ever, the lowest
unemployment in a quarter century and the biggest budget surpluses
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``for all of our good times, I am not satisfied,'' he
added. ``Together, let's make sure that our prosperity enriches not
just the few, but all working families.''
</P>
<P>
   As president, Gore said he would continue the open meetings that
were a part of his presidential campaign and his 16 years in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out to you, the people, because I want to stay
in touch with your hopes, with the quiet, every-day heroism of
hard-working Americans,'' he said. ``So this is not just an
election between my opponent and me. It's about our people, our
families, and our future _ and whether forces standing in your way
will keep you from having a better life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not dwell exclusively on economic issues, however. He
also vowed to use the presidency to ``challenge a culture'' that
has ``too much meanness, and not enough meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's 43rd convention, much more traditional than the
TV-driven GOP gathering two weeks ago, ended with a picturesque sea
of red, white and blue balloons and confetti dropped from the
Staples Center as family, friends and political joined Gore on the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut,
planned to leave Los Angeles shortly after the climactic event of
the convention to begin a four-day trip down the Mississippi River,
through Midwestern battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Their trip follows word from the Bush campaign that the
Republican nominee and his running mate, former congressman Dick
Cheney, would like five debates this fall: three involving the
presidential candidates, two with the vice presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush initiative calls into question the three debates
scheduled by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which usually
organizes and runs the debates. The Bush campaign is seeking other
organizations to sponsor the debates.
</P>
<P>
   William Daley, the Gore campaign chairman, suggested that the
five debates sought by Bush should be in addition to the three
already scheduled by the debate commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of our campaign will be simple: to set up the
greatest number of debates in forums accessible to the greatest
number of voters, starting at the soonest possible time,'' Daley
said.

DOES JOHNSON NEED PLAYOFFS TO SAVE JOB?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The games within the games, at least we have that.
You can't take that from us.
</P>
<P>
   Try to bore us to death on the field. Saddle us with a Los
Angeles Dodgers team that specializes in going sideways. Bloat the
payroll, dot it with pieces that don't fit, trade back for players
who didn't work out the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Give us a $90 million team with $1 worth of personality and
we'll still find our intrigue behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Current double-secret insider scoop has the Dodgers firing
manager Davey Johnson if his team doesn't make the playoffs. This
would be the same guy the Dodgers kept advertising as having the
``best winning percentage of any active manager.'' He is second now
and sinking with every loss.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson goes, intrigue specialists _ those ``sources said''
types _ tell us the Dodgers will make a run at Giants manager Dusty
Baker. If not, there is Mets manager Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Managers who are ex-Dodgers seem to get bonus points, though
Mike Scioscia, Johnny Oates, Davey Lopes and Phil Garner will
apparently have to wait another day to crash Intrigue Central.
</P>
<P>
   Intensifying the Baker and Valentine talk is that both are in
the final year of their contracts. Both have been mentioned as a
possible Dodgers manager for years.
</P>
<P>
   See how this works?
</P>
<P>
   Ironically for Johnson, both are in position to offer up his
head by keeping the Dodgers out of the postseason _ Baker, by
taking the NL West; Valentine, by earning the wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   This is juicy speculation for those who love the games within
the game. Not to discourage water-cooler conjecture, but we're
doubting either is likely to end up the Dodgers manager, though
they might well end up richer for the thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   Baker is in no hurry to make a call. The Giants, understandably,
want him back. For Baker, the Dodgers simply could _ and likely
will _ prove to be valuable leverage.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the Giants, the last thing you want is to lose your
Manager of the Year to those devils down south. That threat alone
figures to be worth a few bucks to Baker, which shouldn't prove a
problem now that they're generating all that extra revenue from
that understated Coke bottle beyond left field.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is a different matter. Having taken the Mets to the
playoffs last year, he was miffed not to be offered an extension
during spring training. That he was not offered a contract, or that
he was miffed, came as a surprise to no one.
</P>
<P>
   He and Mets general manager Steve Phillips have the kind of
relationship that make Johnson and Dodgers GM Kevin Malone look as
cozy as Gore-Lieberman. Things deteriorated a couple of years ago
when Valentine got wind that Phillips was trying to trade John
Olerud and Carlos Baerga to the Orioles for Rafael Palmeiro and
Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, not wanting to lose Olerud, leaked the trade to the
media to kill the deal. Phillips heard this from, incredibly,
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   These are serious games within games.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when Phillips went on leave over the
threat of a sexual-harassment suit from a spring-training employee
during the general managers meetings. A friend called him to say
Valentine was bad- mouthing Phillips at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Which might explain Phillips' overreaction last April when
Valentine spoke to the Wharton School of Business at the University
of Pennsylvania, under the assurance that nothing he said would
leave the room. Valentine again criticized Phillips, and a fan in
the audience posted his comments on a Mets Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blowing it off, Phillips rushed to Pittsburgh to
confront Valentine. We could take lessons from New York on this
games-within-games stuff.
</P>
<P>
   If he wanted to fire Valentine, he apparently found no backing
in upper management. But once again, intrigue specialists were
saying if the Mets didn't make the playoffs, Valentine was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Only the thing is, the Mets are playing well. They are not only
in position to capture the wild-card berth for the second
consecutive year but giving the mighty Braves another tough fight
in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Mets are again news in a city that is home to
the world-champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy you don't bring back?
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's price is actually going up, which probably means the
only chance he has of turning the Mets down is if their offer is so
low _ and he's making $1 million this season _ he gets ticked again
and goes back to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   That would require that the Dodgers want him, which despite
their need to inject some life into the team, is far from a lock.
Most Dodgers management is already weary of in-house fighting, and
Valentine brings all that baggage.
</P>
<P>
   And his biggest supporter within the Dodgers has always been
buddy Tommy Lasorda, increasingly removed from management
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers at least have to look like great leverage to
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's how the game is played. In L.A., it beats
watching .500 baseball.

NEW GRAND JURY TO HEAR EVIDENCE IN LEWINSKY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS with inserts, revisions thruout)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel investigating President
Clinton's relationship with a White House intern has empaneled a
new grand jury to hear evidence in the case, government officials
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Robert W. Ray, convened the panel last
month as part of his publicly announced intention to consider
whether Clinton should be charged with criminal wrongdoing in the
case, once he leaves office, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there was no indication that the decision to empanel the grand jury
was based on any fresh evidence in the case. Nor did it indicate
that prosecutors were preparing to seek an indictment anytime soon,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted angrily to the grand jury disclosure,
coming as it did just hours before Vice President Al Gore was to
accept the Democratic Party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven,'' said Jake
Siewert, a White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the new grand jury was empaneled on July 11. But
its existence became known only Thursday, a day after a panel of
three federal judges decided to allow the special prosecutor to
continue his investigation for another year. It was unclear if the
judges' decision had anything to do with the timing of Thursday's
leak to The Associated Press, which first reported the existence of
the new grand jury, attributing the information to ``legal
sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Ray's office were said Thursday to be fearful that
the disclosure would undercut their credibility and force an
investigation into whether anyone in the office had provided the
information.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office issued a statement that said:
``News organizations are reporting that a new grand jury has been
empaneled to hear evidence with respect to the investigation
involving allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice by
President Clinton. This office has no comment with respect to these
reports and will neither confirm nor deny them. These reports
indicate, and we confirm, the source of these reports is not within
the Office of the Independent Counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, mindful that the 1998 impeachment of Clinton
had probably contributed to their loss of seats in the House,
expressed reluctance to see any re-emergence of the Clinton scandal
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing is terrible,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, a
Republican moderate from Connecticut. ``I wish he hadn't done this
in a political season. It needs to be done when it can be
considered on its own merits and doesn't color other matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, the fiercely partisan former senior adviser to
Clinton, said the news from Ray's office was ``brazenly political''
and predicted that it would cause a backlash against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take my hat off to their gall,'' said Emanuel, now an
investment banker in Chicago. ``But my gut tells me the American
people, in their great wisdom, will once again recognize the
political nature of this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, declined to speculate on the political impact of Ray's
action. But a spokesman for the governor said the development would
be viewed by the public as a reminder of the caustic climate in
Washington during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are sick and tired of investigation and
scandal,'' said Ray Sullivan, the Bush spokesman. ``The best way to
change that and change the tone in Washington is to change
administrations in the White House. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney
aim to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest grand jury's work begins more than 2 1/2 years after
Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr, first initiated his inquiry into
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, then a White House
intern, and more than a year-and-a-half after the president was
impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Starr began his inquiry examining the Whitewater real estate
development in Arkansas, and over the years expanded that
investigation to include a number of other matters, including the
intern issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although the independent counsel statute expired in June 1999,
Ray remains in office because the investigation began before the
law lapsed, assailed by both political parties as an unwieldy
investigative bludgeon that failed in its intended purpose to
remove politics from corruption cases against high-level
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews earlier this year, Ray, who took over from Starr
last October, said that he had completed the investigation into
whether presidential aides engaged in wrongdoing in connection with
the firing of employees at the White House travel office and with
another matter, the collecting of hundreds FBI personnel files by
White House employees. Ray decided against bringing charges in
either case.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray said that two matters remained open in an investigation
that had already spent $47 million when he took over. One was
whether the White House improperly kept e-mail messages from
congressional and Justice Department investigators looking into a
variety of accusations involving presidential aides.
</P>
<P>
   But the other far more incendiary issue was whether Clinton
could be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice when he
denied having a relationship with Lewinsky when he was deposed in
the Paula Jones sex harassment civil case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Jones case has already found that Clinton
testified falsely and fined him for civil contempt of court. The
disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has also moved
to revoke Clinton's law license.
</P>
<P>
   In empaneling the grand jury, Ray will seek to determine whether
Clinton's testimony in the Jones case was sufficiently misleading
to warrant bringing criminal charges against the president once he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's office would not comment on the decision to convene the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court panel that re-authorized Ray to continue his
work for another year, decided that termination was ``not currently
appropriate.'' Under the law, the panel must decide annually
whether to discontinue investigations of independent counsels like
Ray, who were named before the law expired.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, one of the three judges, Richard D. Cudahy, a
Democratic appointee to the bench, said the ``endless
investigation'' should be shut down when Starr stepped down. The
two other judges, appointed under Republican administrations, Peter
T. Fay and David B. Sentelle, ruled the office should continue. On
Wednesday, the decision to keep the inquiry open was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ausbrook, senior counsel to Ray, said Thursday that the
judges' decision suggested that the prosecutor was making progress
to conclude the inquiry. ``It reflects substantial progress in
completing our work,'' Ausbrook said. ``It also reflects that there
are open matters.''

STUNT KEEPS A FOCUS ON LAZIO'S TAX RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican U.S. Senate nominee in New York,
has attracted an unbidden guest at some of his campaign events this
week: a Democratic lackey in an impressively garish Uncle Sam
costume who taunts Lazio over his failure to release copies of his
income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Call it sophomoric or tacky (Lazio partisans call it much
worse). Still, the jeers have helped draw attention to a question
that has hung over Lazio: Why has he not yet disclosed his tax
returns, particularly given the long history of politicians in New
York stumbling over this issue?
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the day Lazio entered the race in May, his campaign
has pledged to make the information public. And with each passing
week, his assistants say they need more time, explaining that they
want to ensure that the returns are thoroughly researched so that
when they are released, the campaign will not be blind-sided by
anything in them. By the end of summer, the assistants promise. By
Labor Day? The autumnal equinox on Sept. 22? They won't say.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have been sowing conspiracy theories of the
what-is-Lazio-hiding variety, not to mention dispatching Uncle Sam
to keep the issue in reporters' faces. On Wednesday, Howard
Wolfson, the chief spokesman for Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, even showed up at a Lazio event in Harlem to fan the
flames.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that Lazio is hiding anything, and no law
requires candidates to release their tax returns. But it has become
customary in high-profile contests for candidates to do so; many
elected officials always do. President and Mrs. Clinton have
released their returns since he took office in 1993, and before
that, when he was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio thus cannot easily brush aside the matter, leaving him
fending off the same accusations of obfuscation hurled at the
Clintons at times. And that diverts him from his strategy of trying
to keep the spotlight on whether Mrs. Clinton is suitable for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton campaign very badly needs to get him into the
race,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for
Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``Lazio would happily rent a
rowboat up in the Adirondacks and just paddle around until November
and let it stay all about Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, reporters repeatedly asked Lazio about the returns as
he campaigned in central New York. ``People are going to find this
is a pretty boring subject,'' he said, declaring that he was not a
wealthy man and vowing that the public and the media would have
plenty of time to examine the returns. He seemed to suggest that
they might be released by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also attacked the Clinton campaign and the State
Democratic Committee, which is paying for the Uncle Sam character.
``It's beneath what the public expects, I think, in a good,
civilized dialogue about the issues and about government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is residency and whether you actually ever paid
New York state income taxes,'' he said. ``How can you possibly
represent the people of the state of New York if you've never paid
a dime of New York state income taxes?''
</P>
<P>
   To which Wolfson responded, ``He should stop making excuse after
excuse, come clean with New Yorkers, and release eight years of tax
returns for the eight years he has been in Congress.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since he went to Washington in 1993, Lazio has been required to
file financial disclosure statements with the House, which are
available to the public and provide limited details about his
investments and other aspects of his finances. Lazio, whose
congressional salary in 1999 was $136,700, disclosed several
securities trades on the forms but the profits were not specified;
they were listed under a range that goes from zero to $15,000 each.
Information in those documents about Lazio's trading in the
securities of a brokerage firm, Quick &AMP; Reilly, led to an ongoing
inquiry by regulators into whether he profited from inside
information.
</P>
<P>
   The returns would supply far more data, including how much, for
example, his wife, Patricia, earned; how much the couple donated to
charity; and other deductions they took.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling over the returns could have few repercussions if
Lazio releases them soon and they are unremarkable. Yet the delay
has already left its mark, in that the returns seem likely to be
scrutinized far more closely now than if they had been distributed
in June.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lesson that more than a few politicians in New York
have learned over the years, most notably former Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro. In her last three runs for office _ for vice president in
1984 and for the U.S. Senate in the Democratic primaries of 1992
and 1998 _ Ferraro had to confront criticism that she was not
releasing her tax returns or was hindering access to them. She lost
all three races.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, her delay in releasing her and her husband's returns
dominated the news after Democratic presidential nominee Walter
Mondale selected her as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to have a stroke, only because the media frenzy
was so bad,'' Ferraro, now a consultant, said this week. ``The
media was killing me. What happens is that when you don't stop that
kind of stuff, and it gets out of control, you discuss nothing
else. You discuss no issues, you discuss no campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, in her final run for office, she imposed
restrictions on access to her returns, allowing reporters only
three hours to view them and declining to provide copies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, fights over disclosure of tax returns have
roiled other New York campaigns. After Gov. Hugh Carey, a Democrat,
won a difficult re-election in 1978, assistants of his Republican
opponent, Perry Duryea, a former Assembly speaker, conceded that
Duryea's refusal to release several years of returns had played a
crucial role in his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Such history did not impress Michael Long, chairman of the
Conservative Party and a Lazio adviser. Long said he did not think
Lazio had to release anything because the disclosure forms he filed
with the House provided plenty of information about Lazio's
finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the average New Yorker understands that here we
have a person who has never worked in New York, never paid income
taxes in New York, now asking for someone else's tax returns,''
Long said. ``It's clearly harassment, it's clearly a diversion to
create a distraction. Just because Mrs. Clinton wants to see his
tax returns, the congressman should jump through a hoop and do
everything she demands?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any purpose for it,'' Long said.

SHIELDS SPURNS LSU FOR PROS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SANTA CLARITA, Calif. _ Reluctantly rejecting a full athletic
scholarship, 18-year-old Hart High graduate Jamie Shields has
instead opted to sign a three-year contract with baseball's Tampa
Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough choice, but I just have to follow my dreams
now,'' Shields said of his decision to play with the Devil Rays
rather than Louisiana State University. ``To get the opportunity to
play pro ball is pretty exciting and I feel like I can do a good
job right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by Shields' 93-mph fastball, the Devil Rays drafted
the pitcher in the 16th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the natural tools of his velocity, we liked his
athleticism and his competitiveness,'' said Fred Repke, the Devil
Rays scout who has been working with Shields. ``We were also
impressed by his work ethic, and he comes from a solid family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said his parents, Jack and Cindy Shields, allowed him to
make his own choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're happy with whatever makes me happy,'' he said.
``They're just there to support me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields will report for an eight-week camp in St. Petersburg,
Fla., on Sept. 17, then will return to Santa Clarita until spring
training begins in March.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting a brand new Cadillac SUV, Shields declined to reveal
the amount of his signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money really wasn't an issue to me,'' he said. ``I just had to
decide whether or not I really wanted to play right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A back injury forced Shields to sit out most of last year's
season. After months of intensive therapy, however, he said his
back is in ``awesome'' shape.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MAINZ, Germany _ The most expensive auction in history ended
here Thursday, when six companies bid nearly $50 billion for
licenses to offer a new generation of wireless communications in
Germany, the largest economy in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The bids exceeded almost all expectations, and far exceeded the
$35.5 billion paid by many of the same companies for similar
third-generation wireless licenses in Britain in April.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and bond investors seemed concerned both about the
billions the bidders spent on licenses and the billions more
required for building the new networks in a brutally competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the results represented something of a defeat for
Europe's two biggest wireless competitors: Deutsche Telekom, a
former monopoly, and Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, which owns
Mannesmann Mobilfunk and is a neck-and-neck rival with Deutsche
Telekom in this country's wireless market. Each had been intent on
capturing enough licenses to limit the number of new rivals.
Despite pushing up the bids by nearly $15 billion since Monday
morning, they failed to knock out smaller companies and must now
face more competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Thursday's buyers are intent on owning pan-European and
even global wireless networks. Besides Deutsche Telekom and
Vodafone, they include MobilCom, a fast-growing German phone
carrier that is backed by France Telecom; Viag Interkom, in which a
controlling stake has just been bought by British
Telecommunications; Group 3G, led by Telefonica of Spain and Sonera
of Finland; and another consortium led by KPN Mobile of the
Netherlands and NTT DoCoMo of Japan.A third partner, the Hong Kong
conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, withdrew a few hours after the
group won a $7.7 billion license, Bloomberg News reported from Hong
Kong on Friday, quoting Canning Fok, Hutchison's group managing
director.)
</P>
<P>
   Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, head of Germany's telecommunications
regulatory agency and the auction's architect, said that ``for
consumers, the result promises the most intense competition.'' He
added, ``This was the most favorable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's license sales, coming four months after Britain's
third-generation wireless auction, are part of a much larger
project. European Union nations, and eventually those in Eastern
Europe, are all awarding new licenses. Analysts predict that the
total cost of licenses across Europe could reach $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, with 82 million people, is crucial for companies with
pan-European ambitions. In addition, the affluent Germans use
mobile phones less than people in many countries nearby, so there
is room for growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs of controlling a Continental chessboard are huge.
Beyond the cost of wireless licenses, the big companies are
spending enormous amounts of money acquiring existing carriers.
Just Thursday, British Telecom announced an agreement to pay as
much as 7.35 billion euros, or $6.7 billion, for 45 percent more of
Viag Interkom, Germany's fourth-largest wireless company.
</P>
<P>
   That deal comes in the wake of France Telecom's recent purchase
of Orange PLC, with Britain's second-largest wireless network, and
Deutsche Telekom's bid to acquire VoiceStream Wireless of the
United States for $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the new third-generation wireless networks will
provide the capacity and technology to offer far faster and more
advanced data services than those now available. Supporters of the
third-generation networks talk of high-speed mobile Internet
access, scores of mobile commerce applications, and even the
ability to receive streams of video over a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, no one is yet sure what services will prove
practical and what consumers might be willing to pay for them. But
most analysts say that ordinary mobile phone service will become
steadily cheaper and will no longer provide the steep revenue
growth that wireless operators have enjoyed in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The big bet is that as mobile telephones become even more widely
used but far less profitable, exotic new data services will more
than make up for the difference.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't believe that the average revenue per month will
double over the next 10 years, then there really isn't any point in
participating in the auctions,'' said Holger Grawe, a
telecommunications analyst at WestLB Panmeure in Duesseldorf.
Grawe, along with many others, is convinced that the bet will
ultimately pay off.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, investors are increasingly nervous.
Deutsche Telekom's stock has fallen by almost half this year,
mostly in the wake of the British auctions that generated
unexpected high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Warwick-Champion, telecommunications analyst at Standard
&AMP; Poor's in London, said that all the companies in Thursday's
auction were poised for possible downgrading of their credit
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vulnerable, Warwick-Champion said, is Royal KPN of
the Netherlands, which has teamed up with BellSouth of the United
States to acquire control of the E-Plus wireless network in
Germany. But Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and British Telecom
will be put on a credit watch list for possible downgrading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these sorts of auctions are shortsighted and
counterproductive,'' said Eden Zoller, a senior consultant at Ovum,
a telecommunications research firm in London. ``They would all be
much better spending their money on developing new services.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the huge cost of wireless licenses in Europe, investors
are also digesting the impact of deals like France Telecom's
purchase of Orange and Deutsche Telekom's agreement to acquire
VoiceStream. And Deutsche Telekom's bid may be blocked by U.S.
regulators, adding to the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Eylert, a Deutsche Telekom executive who is also chairman
of a mobile phone industry group called the UMTS Forum, said the
huge cost of licenses could put pressure on operators to build
their networks as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Other executives expressed frustration. ``We could have had it
for 30 billion marks less,'' said Peik von Bestenbostel, a
spokesman for Viag Interkom, which announced several days ago that
it would seek only two rather than three licenses allowed under the
bidding rules.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive called it ``the worst possible scenario'' _
high license prices and the maximum number of competitors at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Under the German government's rules, 12 licenses were up for
auction but a company had to win two licenses to establish a
service. Theoretically, it was possible for four companies to
emerge with all the licenses, but most experts had predicted that
five companies would prevail _ two with three licenses each and
three smaller competitors with two each.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinarily high prices, von Bestenbostel said
Viag was ready to plow ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is an extraordinary opportunity, and we are ready
for a market with six players,'' he said.

JUDGE RULES SKAKEL SHOULD BE TRIED IN '75 CONN. SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ A juvenile court judge ruled Thursday that
Michael Skakel should be tried in the 1975 slaying of Martha
Moxley, finding that there was ``reasonable cause'' to believe that
Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy's, bludgeoned the 15-year-old
girl to death when they were neighbors in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Maureen Dennis, must now make the crucial decision of
whether Skakel should be tried as an adult. Skakel, who is now 39,
was charged as a juvenile because he was 15 at the time of Miss
Moxley's death. If convicted as an adult, he could face a sentence
of life in prison; conviction as a juvenile would carry a maximum
sentence of four years and could very well involve no jail time at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Moxley case _ because of the suspected involvement of a
Kennedy relative, its setting in one of America's wealthiest
suburbs, and the nearly quarter-century delay by the authorities in
obtaining an indictment _ has been the sensational subject of
numerous best sellers and television documentaries. It also set
judicial precedent in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, as it existed in 1975, pertaining to juvenile
crimes, Dennis was required to conduct a hearing to determine
whether there was reasonable cause to proceed with the case against
Skakel and, if so, whether the case should remain before her in
juvenile court or be transferred to state Superior Court and heard
by a jury that could convict him as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing in June, two former classmates of Skakel at a
school for troubled youths in Maine testified that they had heard
him in the late 1970s confess to killing Miss Moxley. In her
13-page decision Thursday, Dennis wrote that she found those
witnesses ``credible.'' She also found credible a witness who said
Skakel once admitted being at the murder scene on the night of Miss
Moxley's death.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis wrote: ``Having considered all of the state's
documentary, photographic and testimonial evidence, as well as the
respondent's submissions for purposes of rebuttal, the court finds
that there is reasonable cause to believe that the respondent has
committed murder.'' She ordered an ``investigation'' into whether
Skakel should be tried as an adult in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said that investigation was a procedural matter to
be conducted by the juvenile court system. Under normal
circumstances, they said, it would be used to determine a juvenile
defendant's family situation and performance in school, any
previous criminal record and other pertinent information that could
be used in deciding whether the juvenile or adult court system was
the more appropriate jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about this case is normal or usual,'' said Daniel P.
Weiner, a veteran criminal defense lawyer, who has represented many
juvenile clients. Weiner said that Connecticut's juvenile court
system had always emphasized rehabilitation and that if Skakel had
been convicted as a teenager, the court's inclination at the time
would likely have been to send him to reform school.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, that is not an option. ``You have a 39-year-old
man,'' Weiner said. ``How can you send him to bad-boy school?
That's preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is unprecedented for Connecticut, leaving Dennis
with a perplexing judicial challenge: how to allow for an
appropriate sentence if Skakel was convicted while still affording
him all of the rights he would have been entitled to as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant state's attorney, Jonathan C. Benedict, and his
leading investigator on the case, Frank Garr, praised the judge's
finding of reasonable cause and said they expected her to transfer
the case to Superior Court. ``This will eventually be transferred
to the adult court,'' Garr said, adding that he expected a decision
shortly. ``I feel pretty confident at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Moxley's brother, John, said the family was pleased with
the decision but said they wanted the case to be transferred. ``We
are very pleased that Judge Dennis verified the grand jury
findings,'' he said in a television interview. ``I think we're a
little disappointed that she did not go all the way and recommend
the transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, said that he disagreed with
the judge's assessment of the witnesses but that he was not
surprised by her decision, even as he reiterated his client's
innocence. ``I am neither surprised nor disappointed,'' he said.
``I always believed this case would be tried, whether by a judge or
a jury.'' He added, ``I really do trust the system and I believe
that in the end Michael will be exonerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Moxley, a pretty and popular 15-year-old, was found with
her skull bashed in, lying under a tall pine tree in the yard of
her family's home in the wealthy Belle Haven enclave of Greenwich
on Oct. 31, 1975. Investigators found pieces of the murder weapon,
a Tony Penna six-iron golf club that was later determined to have
come from a set owned by Skakel's father.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, who attended the Elan School in Poland Spring,
Maine, with Skakel in the late 1970s, testified at the
reasonable-cause hearing that Skakel had told him that he had made
romantic advances toward Miss Moxley and that when she rebuffed
him, he ``drove her skull in'' with a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman also testified that Skakel said: ``I am going to get
away with murder. I am a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   In her decision, Dennis wrote, ``From the evidence presented, a
reasonable and prudent person of caution could logically infer''
that Skakel ``retrieved the Tony Penna number 6 iron golf club, the
instrument used to murder the victim from his family home and/or
the outbuilding thereon and ran through the woods and pine trees
near his home to the Moxley property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person of reasonable caution could further infer and
deduct,'' Dennis continued, that Skakel ``was at the location where
the murder took place and at a time when it occurred.'' She noted
that Skakel ``has acknowledged to at least two individuals that he
was at the scene where the body was found.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also pointed to testimony by Coleman and another
witness, Andrew Pugh, who was a childhood friend of Skakel in
Greenwich. Coleman and Pugh both testified that Skakel had told
them that he masturbated at the murder scene. ``It is also more
than mere coincidence,'' Dennis wrote, ``the respondent made
statements concerning his masturbating either on the victim, or in
the tree on the Moxley property on the night the victim was
murdered.''

BREAKAWAY CABLE SPOOL SERIOUSLY HURTS 2 AT SUBWAY WORK SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHAILA K. DEWAN and RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 7,500-pound spool of electrical cable being lowered
into a Manhattan subway station Thursday suddenly broke loose and
barreled down the stairs of the station, gravely injuring two
women, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened at about 11:45 a.m. at the 14th Street and
Eighth Avenue station. Workers for Sheldon Electric, a
subcontractor for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, had left half
of the stairway open, allowing passengers to use it as workers
lowered the spool on the other side, which had been taped off, said
Bob Slovak, a transit authority spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The one-inch thick nylon rope that held the spool snapped, he
said, and the spool, which had reached only the third step, went
rolling down the stairs with enough force to destroy the metal
bannisters, bouncing off a wall and then hitting the women, Slovak
said.
</P>
<P>
   The women, identified by the police as Andresa Kippins, 73, of
Brooklyn and Valca Valentine, 41, whose address was not known, were
badly injured, with multiple broken bones, said the police and
hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kippins' son David said she and Valentine, who did not know each
other, had stopped at the foot of the stairs when they saw the
spool, about 5 feet in diameter, being lowered. But they were
assured by workers that they could proceed, David Kippins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy waved to them and said it was OK to pass,'' he said.
``And the next thing they knew, it broke and this thing came at
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kippins suffered several broken bones, including the fibula and
the tibia of one leg, three ribs, her collarbone and her pelvis,
her son said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine broke her left leg and clavicle, according to a
spokeswoman for St. Vincents Hospital, where the women were taken.
</P>
<P>
   David Kippins said he was astonished at the lack of safety
precautions. ``How could they just have men holding a rope? Why
didn't they have a crane lowering something like that? It was 7,500
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Electric, which is based in Queens, had not notified the
transit authority of its plan to use a ``muscle operation'' to
lower the spool, Slovak said. ``If they had, we would have had them
close off this staircase completely when the cable was being
lowered,'' he said. ``We would have directed people away from the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Electric was working for CAB Associates, the main
contractor for the $15 million renovation of the subway station,
which is served by the A, C, E and L trains. The renovation began
in 1994, but Sheldon has been working for the transit system for at
least a decade, a city official said. Sheldon is owned by a company
called Railworks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has faced questions about safety issues before, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had other safety issues in which they at least had
to be talked to about the problems,'' the official said. ``I don't
know if there were any penalties involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cahn, the chief executive of Sheldon, said he did not
know whether the company had notified the MTA that it was going to
lower the spool manually. He did not provide more details about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of it is such that my attorney would probably tell
me not to say anything about this, and that's easy because I really
do not know what happened,'' Cahn said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kippins was to have surgery Thursday night, her son said.
</P>
<P>
   A retired first-grade teacher, she had been on her way to a
class with other retired teachers in which she was learning to play
the recorder, a flutelike instrument, her son said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very active lady,'' said Dorothy Kippins, the wife of
Mr. Kippins. The family of the other victim could not be reached.
She was reported in stable condition by a hospital spokeswoman
Thursday night.

EPA EXAMINES WHY IT FAILED TO PROTECT MONTANA TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBBY, Mont. _ Five federal inspectors came to this tiny town
this week, looking not for asbestos but for something even harder
to grasp _ why the Environmental Protection Agency failed for
decades to protect miners and their families from the deadly
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is extraordinary. Although every federal agency has an
inspector general's office to review its actions, those
investigations are normally bloodless _ conducted by phone or by
reviewing mountains of paper.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors in Libby are sitting face to face with real people
_ victims of the actions of W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and the inaction of
their own agency, which admits it knew about the deadly hazard of
asbestos-tainted ore at Grace's vermiculite mine and did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors are in living rooms, motels, coffee shops,
schoolrooms _ anywhere they can get people to tell them stories.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 22 of the men and women who came to give information
to the inspectors had parents, other relatives or friends who died
from asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of the people sitting in the red chairs of the
brightly-colored school auditorium were themselves dying because of
exposure to the lethal fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Once-strong men sat next to their women _ wives and mothers
sickened by the asbestos the men brought home on their work
clothes. All of them made it clear that they were more concerned
about what the EPA is doing about the problem today than about what
happened 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were glad that the EPA auditors came to hear
their stories, but they were not shy about asking why
representatives of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Mine Safety and Health Administration _
agencies responsible for the well-being of workers _ were not there
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole government screwed up by not telling anyone about
the dangers they'd found, but the only one here is the EPA. Where
is OSHA? Where is MSHA?'' asked Les Skramstad in a whisper. Years
of working in the mine have decimated his lungs. His wife, Norita,
also has asbestosis, as do two of their five children. He fears for
the health of the other three.
</P>
<P>
   ``OSHA and MSHA weren't here when we needed them to tell the
workers the truth and they aren't here today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Tafer, the leader of the EPA inspection team, told the
group of Libby residents that the inspectors' mission was to
determine who in the EPA knew about the hazards, when they knew it
and why nothing was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting together a huge puzzle and you may have some
of the pieces we need,'' Tafer said. ``Send us an anonymous box of
documents, call our free hot line, invite us to your home. We need
the right pieces to put this puzzle together so we can ensure it
doesn't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s and '80s, EPA health experts were among a parade of
federal investigators who dropped by this bucolic corner of
northwest Montana to visit the world's largest vermiculite mine.
They reported the dangers, and the inspector general's staff is
trying to pin down why nothing was done about those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Those sporadic visits by EPA researchers were far outnumbered by
mandatory inspections by other state and federal agencies.
Inspectors from OSHA, MSHA and the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health toured the mine on a regular basis
and repeatedly reported that the miners were at great risk.Yet in
the end those agencies, too, did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the EPA team tried to keep the focus on EPA's actions,
the miners and their families kept questioning the failure of other
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand we've got all these dead bodies, our relatives and
friends. On the other, we've got all these covered-up government
documents. What are the real answers to why the government let the
people of Libby die?'' Bob Dedrick asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't trust anyone any more. Not doctors, lawyers or the
government. We've just been hit, betrayed, too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported in November that
hundreds of the miners and their family members have died or
contracted fatal disease from asbestos in the mine.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of documents the P-I collected while investigating
the Libby situation included government reports and Grace's
internal papers discussing those reports.
</P>
<P>
   EPA made at least four reports, in 1980, 1982 and 1985 and 1991.
The reports presented the risk the miners faced and the hazards to
the townsfolk six miles downwind from the stacks at the mine, which
spewed 5,000 pounds of tremolite asbestos into the air every
working day.
</P>
<P>
   Of wider national significance, the EPA investigators also
projected the risks to the millions of consumers using insulation,
garden products and other materials containing vermiculite from the
mine, and to the tens of thousands of workers using the tainted
material in construction and a hundred other professions.
</P>
<P>
   None of the recommendations in any of the reports was followed
or passed on to other agencies. EPA pulled the funding halfway
through the most comprehensive of the studies. Ironically, next
Tuesday, 15 years later, EPA is releasing a new report on the
asbestos risk faced by consumers and workers using vermiculite for
gardening and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the four EPA reports, the P-I found dozens of
other reports and extensive correspondence about Libby from the
U.S. Bureau of Mines, OSHA and NIOSH.
</P>
<P>
   Files were full of letters to and from Grace discussing the high
levels of asbestos exposure to miners, found by the agencies'
investigators year after year. There is no indication in the
worker-safety agencies' files that the miners or their unions were
ever told about the risk. In fact, some Bureau of Mines reports
were stamped ``confidential,'' for management eyes only.
</P>
<P>
   Several miners complained to the EPA team about federal mine
inspectors giving Grace three or four days notice before they
showed up to examine safety conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as management got the word the inspectors were coming,
we stopped everything and spent the next few days shoveling and
hosing the vermiculite dust out of sight so the inspectors wouldn't
see how bad the problems were,'' said Butch Hurlbert. Tall and
handsome, the former steelworker and rodeo roper is still a poster
image of a cowboy, but his three years working at the vermiculite
mine were enough to damage his lungs and his life, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dedrick and his wife, Carrie, both have asbestosis. He told the
inspectors that he was disappointed in his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting some very, very rich people with very powerful
friends. All we have is us and the truth,'' Dedrick said, gesturing
to the handful of people sitting around him, ``and a handful of EPA
workers who care a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's team took copious notes and shook their
heads occasionally at the comments they were hearing, even though
they knew that most of complaints were well beyond the scope of
their inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the authority or the ability to unravel
everything that happened here,'' team member Eileen McMahon told
the group. ``We will give you our full efforts but even though we
report to Congress, we can't force any other agency to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors didn't come to Libby to answer questions, but
even if they had, the questions being asked by the locals were too
hot to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen after the election, if Bush and Cheney
win?'' asked Gayla Benefield, whose mother and father both died of
asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the new administration pull out the EPA people that have
been trying to help us for months? Will the Republicans stop
everyone from investigating asbestos? How will we know if they stop
you from doing your report?''
</P>
<P>
   Tafer looked uncomfortable and said she couldn't comment on most
of the questions, but added, ``If we don't finish the report,
you'll know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Judge, the head of Montana's AFL-CIO, suggested that if the
inspectors really wanted to find out why EPA's asbestos efforts
were thwarted in the '80s, they might be in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're back in Washington, check out what impact the
Grace Commission had on all the agencies' effort to regulate
asbestos,'' Judge said. ``The 28,000-page Grace Report on getting
government off industry's back was taken to heart by the Reagan
White House. And Reagan's EPA administrators were way too cozy with
industry. Check it out. You may find your answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grace Commission was headed by the late J. Peter Grace,
former head of W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and a close friend of President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   For white-collar, bureaucratic types, the auditors have
impressed many of the Libby victims with their efforts. Since they
arrived, they've been working dawn to dark, and the sun sets late
in Libby. They shed their pin-striped suits and grown-up clothes
for durable pants, sneakers and boots as they toured some of the
asbestos-contaminated sites where Grace processed and shipped the
ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about. This is vermiculite,'' Jim Stout
said, holding up a piece of ore for the inspector general's team to
see and photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Stout works for URS Corp., which is managing the cleanup project
for Grace at the old expansion plant near the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   He showed no reluctance in telling the auditors that he and EPA
don't come close to agreeing on how much the site has to be
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only find a trace of asbestos and EPA says we have to
remove it. Hell, it's only a trace. Why go to all that effort for a
trace? Kids go to school all day in buildings that have traces of
asbestos and that's no big deal,'' Stout said.
</P>
<P>
   They walked past the large, open-sided building that Grace used
to store huge piles of Zonolite waiting to be bagged and shipped.
It was where most of the kids in town climbed and played in piles
of the ore. It's also where many apparently sucked in the tremolite
asbestos fibers that are killing them today.
</P>
<P>
   When an auditor asked about the tremolite, Stout answered, ``We
don't deal with tremolite in the United States. The only place you
find it is here. We're really only worried about three kinds of
asbestos _ chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite. The rest don't
matter much.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the auditors who had studied the federal regulations
looked puzzled. A couple of supervisors from the cleanup company
were suddenly examining the clouds, and Duc Nguyen, the EPA guide
for the tour, quietly shook his head and said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   All government agencies list six types of asbestos as
cancer-causing and thus regulated. They include the three that
Stout mentioned, but also anthophyllite, tremolite and actinolite.
</P>
<P>
   The latter two contaminate the Libby vermiculite and other ore
mined around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremolite and actinolite are not really a big deal. They're
not used much, and I never really heard about that anthophyllite,''
Grace's project manager added as the auditors returned to their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Skramstad accompanied the auditors on their tour of the
contaminated buildings where he was exposed to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked away from the crowd, Stout said he was sorry
Skramstad was sick, but added, ``He's a hell of a troublemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, another group of residents told their stories at the
school auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   In the front row sat Alice Priest and Edna Oikle. Some of the
inspectors kept glancing at the small oxygen tanks the women held
in their laps. Edna's husband, Gerald, patted her hand
reassuringly.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the comments went well beyond EPA's past actions.
</P>
<P>
   Don Wilkins told the auditors of a case in Idaho where the owner
of small waste-processing plant knowingly sent his employees into
situations where chemicals could harm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was given 30 years in prison and none of his people died.
Why can't Grace officials be charged with homicide? They knew they
were killing their people and concealed it. Hundreds here have
died. Why can't criminal charges be brought against Grace?''
Wilkins asked.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Maynard, whose father and grandfather worked at the mine
and died from asbestos, got in the last word of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Libby in the last century can still happen
elsewhere in America today and it shouldn't be allowed to occur,''
Maynard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if industry can thwart government's responsibility to the
workers, then we are not any safer than workers in a third-world
country. Will what you people from the inspector general are trying
to do make any difference? Can you get the other agencies to
protect the workers and their families or will thousands more die
because government doesn't care?''
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said they would do what they were permitted,
gathered the new documents they were handed and returned to their
motel.
</P>
<P>
   They knew the sun rises early in Libby.

DELEGATES SAY HOPE IS BUOYED BY CONVENTION
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Editors: tightens, updates &QL; 
 &QL; 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE &QL; 
C.2000 Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Delegates had arrived at the Democratic National
Convention anxious about their presidential nominee trailing in the
polls, but they said Thursday they are leaving more confident and
excited about a tough battle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big feeling that there is a fight ahead of
us,'' said Daniel Krausz, 20, a college student from Swarthmore,
Pa. ``I don't think anyone had given up hope, but after the last
three nights there's more hope than there was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   A speech by vice-presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman
appeared to have given many of the delegates a renewed confidence
that Vice President Al Gore can win the presidency in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But many admitted Gore's poor position in the the polls was
troubling, and they were counting on a good nomination acceptance
speech to get him back into the game with Republican George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have everything riding on it, like some people are
making out, but it sure will help,'' said Joe Gunn, president of
the Texas AFL-CIO. ``He doesn't have to hit a grand slam home run.
A two bagger will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about delegate unease began surfacing Wednesday as
U.S. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware told a group of delegates ``there's
a lot of anxiety hanging over this convention'' because of Bush's
lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Republican observers of the convention were fast to fan the
flames of doubt and division.
</P>
<P>
   ``What struck me was how factionalized this party is at its
base,'' said Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, R-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that questions Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles,
raised about Lieberman and his commitment to minority issues showed
a rift among Democrats, ignoring a public display of solidarity
that Waters and Lieberman engaged in on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Gilmore, R-Va., said the Democratic convention stands
in stark contrast to the unified Republican gathering two weeks ago
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have observed how nervous and dispirited this
convention is,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a bigger task than reinventing themselves. They
almost need to reinvent party unity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the convention may have been firing up delegates, it had
failed in its first days to light a fire under voters. A
Voter.com-Battleground 2000 poll showed Bush had held onto a 10
percentage point lead over Gore through Wednesday night _ 50
percent to 40 percent in a two-way contest that does not include
third-party candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the polls say, but except for us political
junkies, everyone's out buying school clothes for their kids. No
one's paying attention,'' said Linda Howe, 58, a probation officer
from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said Ohio Democrats will leave the convention energized to
work at carrying their critical swing state. They will be selling
Gore on the issues, such as the conservative voting record of
Republican vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement officers are going to be upset when they look
at Dick Cheney's vote against banning cop killer bullets,'' Howe
said, as she drew a sign that said ``Hi Mom!'' with a purple
marker.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Campbell, 38, an office manager from Uhrichsville, Ohio,
who wore a ``2000'' crown on her head, said she got a new
confidence after hearing Lieberman speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any doubts at all, I have laid them aside,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Guthrie, 53, an auto parts worker from Three Rivers, Mich.,
sported a button on his vest that said, ``Read my lips, no more
Texans.'' He said the tide will turn once groups that have just
recently endorsed Gore, like the United Auto Workers, start
organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said he also is counting on the American people finding
out what he believes is the truth about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fake, misleading people with total distortions,''
Guthrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Pame Moore-Morrow, 50, from Columbia, Tenn., worked for Gore in
past campaigns. She said the American public needs to get to know
Gore like she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the stiff person people try to make him out to be,''
Moore-Morrow said.

GORE STEPS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT AND OUT OF CLINTON'S SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Bill Clinton's backstage walk to valediction on
Monday was a heavyweight champion's last indulgent moment in the
sun, Al Gore's arrival in the Staples Center on Thursday night was
a dogged contender's first chance to enter the arena alone. He
strode through a sea of pennants down a side aisle with a posse of
seconds trailing humbly in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gore had climbed the gray-carpeted steps of the
podium and wrapped his wife, Tipper, in a sweeping embrace and a
long kiss, the giant arena was shaking as if in a California
earthquake, strobe lights flickered, tears streaked delegates'
faces, and the crowd was utterly his.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking unusually quickly (faster, one of his writers said,
than he ever did in rehearsals), confidently, even ebulliently at
times, Gore seemed determined to shake the plodding pace and tone
of condescension that often mark his formal speeches. He virtually
raced through a litany of causes and issues dear to the core
Democratic constituencies, from health care to civil rights,
affirmative action, public education, and abortion rights, with
perhaps the biggest applause line of all that ``the last thing this
country needs is a Supreme Court that overturns Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Gore left no doubt that he was determined to
show himself without Clinton's shadow darkening his center stage,
after eight years of loyal service to a consummate, intuitive
political performer.
</P>
<P>
   And when he said literally those words, ``I stand here tonight
as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am,'' his
young speechwriter, Eli Attie, and his image-meister, Carter Eskew,
slapped a satisfied high-five as they watched from just below the
podium.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 minutes later, at the end of his speech, Gore even
found his own formulation of Clinton's 1992 pledge to stay with the
voters of New Hampshire until the ``last dog dies,'' by vowing:
``If you entrust me with the presidency, I know I won't always be
the most exciting politician. But I pledge to you tonight: I will
work for you every day and I will never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with the disappointment Clinton has caused
Democrats was unspoken, but perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   But as they climbed the aisles to the press section afterwards,
Gore's aides took particular satisfaction at the way he had defined
his identity and delineated his argument for election, by saying:
``This election is not an award for past performance. I'm not
asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we have.
Tonight, I ask for your support on the basis of the better, fairer,
more prosperous America we can build together.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's aides also expressed surprise that Gore had
finished his speech far faster than in any of his repeated
rehearsals with a teleprompter.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, for a candidate with proven skill at cut-and-thrust,
Gore made not a single mention of his Republican opponent Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, and very few indirect ones.

STRATEGIES: THE WHOLE OF VOLATILITY IS LESS THAN ITS PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20) 
 By MARK HULBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be difficult to imagine that any decade in American stock
market history saw the magnitude or number of violent swings
witnessed in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, however, the market volatility of the last 10
years was no higher than the average of the last seven decades. In
fact, there was less volatility in the 1990s than in either of the
two previous decades _ 21 percent less than the 1970s and 31
percent less than the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the more startling conclusions of a new stock
volatility study by Professor John Campbell of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; Martin Lettau, senior economist at the New
York Federal Reserve Bank; Prof. Burton Malkiel of Princeton; and
Prof. Yexiao Xu of the University of Texas at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, do the recent gyrations seem so severe? One possible
explanation is in another of the researchers' findings: that even
though the overall market may be no more volatile than in the past,
the average stock is much more so. In fact, the volatility of the
typical stock in the 1990s was about twice as high as in the early
1960s. That is because the correlation between individual stocks'
gyrations has fallen _ in other words, more stocks are rising
sharply at the same time that other stocks plunge.
</P>
<P>
   So on a day when an Internet retailer misses earnings
expectations and immediately sheds a third of its market value, the
stock of another company is skyrocketing because it has just
reported unexpectedly good news. The extent of the volatility for
any given company is indeed a modern phenomenon. But across the
entire stock market of more than 7,000 companies, these gyrations
largely cancel one another out, leaving the overall market no more
volatile than it was in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of higher volatility and reduced correlation
has profound implications for how many stocks an investor needs in
a portfolio in order to achieve adequate diversification. For
years, statisticians have argued that a portfolio of about 20
stocks, in a variety of industries, is large enough to diversify
away 90 percent of the volatility associated with owning a single
stock. According to the new study, however, given that the average
stock's volatility is twice as high as it was during the 1960s and
1970s, the number of stocks needed to achieve such diversification
is now closer to 50.
</P>
<P>
   If your portfolio does not have that many stocks, chances are
that you will have more sleepless nights and yet no greater returns
to show for it, than you would with a larger portfolio. Your
greater suffering will be in vain.
</P>
<P>
   That melancholy conclusion comes from the market's structure. In
a stock market as efficient as ours, investors are for the most
part rewarded only for taking unavoidable risks. But the volatility
and risk associated with smaller portfolios are entirely avoidable
_ and thus you shouldn't expect higher returns for incurring them.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for the average stock's much-increased volatility?
Answering with any certainty will require additional research, but
the authors of the new study point to two contributing factors. The
first is the trend over the last decade away from conglomerates and
toward companies whose businesses are more focused. In a
conglomerate, poor earnings from a single division have a
relatively small impact on the price of the company's stock. If
that division is spun off and becomes publicly traded on its own, a
similarly poor earnings report will have a much greater impact.
</P>
<P>
   A related factor is that a greater number of younger and smaller
companies are publicly traded today. Because investors feel far
less certain about the long-term prospects of these companies,
their stock prices are much more sensitive to good or bad news than
are those of larger, more established concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the reasons, the wider gyrations of individual
stocks teach a broad lesson: Diversification, which has always been
an important way to gain immunity from volatility, is now more
crucial than ever.

YANKS POWER ANGELS, 6-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are your parents' Yankees, a team reliant on
power, Bronx bombers. Only now the slugger whose best position is
in the batter's box is not Johnny Blanchard, but Glenallen Hill.
The left-handed hitter with a swing suited perfectly for Yankee
Stadium is David Justice, not Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Jose Canseco, who came here with 440 career home runs,
and suddenly the Yankees' lineup is transformed. Less defense, less
speed. Far more explosive. The Yankees hit 100 home runs in 83
games before the All-Star Game break, but already have 53 in 34
games since the break, including homers from Hill, Justice and Luis
Sojo Thursday night in a 6-1 thumping of Anaheim at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle gave up nine hits in six and two-thirds scoreless
innings and snapped his three-game losing streak, helped by three
exceptional defensive plays from third baseman Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, Justice and Canseco are all best suited as designated
hitters, and they all were in the starting lineup Thursday night _
Hill in left field, Justice in right field and Canseco as the
designated hitter. They have combined for 20 home runs since
joining the Yankees, in only 202 at-bats, or about one for every 10
at-bats. Manager Joe Torre does not exactly know how it will work
out, trying to find playing time for all of them; the only thing he
does know is that so far, it has worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco and Justice struck out against Anaheim's Kent Mercker to
open the second inning, but when Mercker tried to whip a fastball
past Hill, he turned on the ball. His drive soared, on the line,
just to the right of straightaway center, and the ball bounded into
the black-painted seats _ only the 19th home run hit there in the
remodeled Yankee Stadium. It was his 38th at-bat with the Yankees,
and his seventh home run, and it gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added another run in the third, on a sacrifice fly
by Bernie Williams (his 107th RBI). The Angels would threaten in
almost every inning, but twice sabotaged rallies with base-running
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco walked leading off the sixth inning. He seems to have
been liberated in the Yankees' lineup, feeling free to take bases
on balls, rather than swing at bad pitches in an effort to create
offense, as he did for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Justice followed.
</P>
<P>
   Justice has always been a pull hitter, but scouts who have
followed the Yankees over the last month believe that the short
right-field stands present a particularly attractive target for
him, and think that in certain situations, he will try to turn on
pitches and lash them to right.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander Juan Alvarez pitched to Justice in the sixth
inning, and threw a ball inside. Justice lifted and flicked his
right foot, turned his hips, swung, and the only thing that
prevented the ball from landing in the upper deck was the screen
attached to the right-field foul pole. Justice has 11 homers with
the Yankees, nine in Yankee Stadium.

SOUTH BRONX LITTLE LEAGUERS FALL 
</HEADLINE>

   BRISTOL, Conn. _ A team from the South Bronx that was bidding to
earn a trip to Williamsport, Pa., and trying to become the first
Little League World Series champion from New York City in 36 years,
stumbled in the Eastern Regional final Thursday night at the A.
Bartlett Giamatti sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a team from Goffstown, N.H., will make the trip after
it got a run in the seventh inning and won, 1-0, behind the two-hit
pitching of Bud Collins, who scored the game's only run.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Almonte of the Rolando Paulino Little League team, which
represented New York State, matched Collins in a wondrous pitching
duel through the regulation six innings, striking out 10 New
Hampshire batters and not yielding a hit until two were out in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seventh inning, a walk to Collins, a sliced single to
right by Jarek Ostrowski and an errant throw from right field gave
the team from a suburb of Manchester, N.H., the green light to
Williamsport, where the eight-team tournament begins a weeklong run
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It also ended a superb run for the team from the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Only three teams from New York City have reached the Little
League World Series, and all three were from Staten Island. Mid
Island won the championship in 1964. Teams from South Shore
qualified in 1985 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 family members and friends of the Bronx players,
almost all of them wearing the team's cardinal red colors and some
of them with their faces painted red, sat behind the team's dugout
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love these kids,'' said Rolando Torres, whose son Victor is
on the team. ``Most of us have been here for every game.''

FBI AGENT ADMITS HIS TESTIMONY AGAINST NUCLEAR SCIENTIST WAS
MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 1st 3 grafs to clarify, expand)

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ An FBI agent admitted in federal court here
Thursday that he had provided inaccurate testimony last December on
a critical point that made a Los Alamos scientist accused of
mishandling nuclear weapons secrets appear deceptive when he had
not been.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is critical because the government has successfully
argued since last December that the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, be held
without bail in part because his pattern of deceptions, along with
the fact that computer tapes containing a vast amount of nuclear
secrets remain unaccounted for, suggested he was a major threat to
national security.
</P>
<P>
   In his written decision denying bail to Lee last December, the
federal judge, James A. Parker, cited Lee's ``deeply troubling''
deceptions. Lee is trying for bail a third time and the government
is now acknowledging what amounts to misleading testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is the first person ever to be accused under the specific
atomic energy statute cited in his 59-count indictment, and a
growing number of Asian-Americans and civil rights proponents have
rallied to his side saying that he was singled out for prosecution
at least in part because of his Chinese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Messemer, an FBI supervisory special agent, had said
under oath last December that when Lee improperly downloaded a
trove of weapons secrets six years ago onto portable computer
tapes, he had lied to a colleague in order to gain access to the
colleague's computer. Messemer had testified that Lee told the
other scientist that he was just going to download a resume, which
was not true.
</P>
<P>
   But since December, Lee's defense lawyers have gained access to
that other scientist's previous grand jury testimony, and it does
not mention that Lee spoke of a resume.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer acknowledged that fact on the stand Thursday, but said
his misleading testimony represented ``an honest mistake,'' and
that it was not intentional. Messemer insisted nevertheless that,
in other areas, Lee had been deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, several other instances in which the
defense appeared to show that the government had misled the judge
in describing Lee's supposed deceptions. Messemer had testified at
the December bail hearing that Lee had not disclosed certain
contacts with Chinese scientists during officially sanctioned,
professional visits to Beijing during the 1980s. But the defense
attorneys have since obtained a report Lee filed after a 1986 trip
in which he listed seven Chinese scientists with whom he spoke
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer also acknowledged that, though Lee clearly disclosed
the contacts, he was never subsequently questioned about them.
Messemer also disclosed that he never consulted Lee's trip report
before testifying in December. He still maintained that Lee had
been deceptive because he had not been open about ``the full nature
and scope'' of his contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that until Lee faced questioning a year
ago, he failed to report a highly suspicious meeting he had with a
Chinese scientist in his hotel room during a 1988 visit. The
government also insists that Lee's downloading of the huge library
of weapons secrets was itself a deliberate act of deception that
took more than 40 hours of computer time and knowingly violated
rules on the handling of classified data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   None of the statements in court here Thursday or Wednesday
appeared decisive. The government presented weapons experts who
insisted Lee's downloading was unprecedented and a grave threat to
national security, since the data, in hostile hands, could alter
the global balance of power. The defense offered its own experts
who insisted that most of the information was already public and
that its use to another country was extremely limited.
</P>
<P>
   In one tense exchange, Paul Robinson, the president of the
Sandia National Laboratories, said that one of the defense experts,
Harold M. Agnew, a former director of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, had simply not understood the information Lee
downloaded or had not understood the threat posed by Lee's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Agnew fired off an affidavit Thursday in response to that
testimony, saying, ``What Paul said is a bunch of bull,'' and then
refuted parts of Robinson's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In two other areas Thursday, defense lawyers tried to show that
that government witnesses had provided misleading evidence in
December. Messemer had said Lee had failed to disclose
correspondence he conducted with some Chinese scientists, saying
that he had only exchanged Christmas cards. On Thursday, one of
Lee's lawyers, Mark Holscher, produced a transcript of an interview
with Lee and the FBI on March 5, 1999, in which Lee did discuss
correspondence with the Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Messemer had said in December that during the
search of Lee's home, the FBI had discovered letters that Lee had
sent to a number of foreign scientific institutes seeking a job.
The prosecution has said in previous filings that they believe the
principal reason Lee improperly downloaded the nuclear secrets was
to enhance his job prospects with the foreign institutes.
</P>
<P>
   But under questioning, Messemer acknowledged Thursday that the
FBI found some letters but had no evidence they were either mailed
or received by the foreign institutions, which were in countries
like Australia, France, Singapore and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The bail hearing will resume on Friday. Parker has allowed the
examinations and cross-examinations of the witnesses, much of it in
closed sessions because it involved classified information, to
stretch on far longer than is usual at bail hearings.
