GRETZKY COULD BE AT THE END 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wayne Gretzky carefully guided the puck to Mathieu
Schneider, who blasted it from just inside the blue line. John
MacLean deflected it into the net for the decisive goal in the New
York Rangers' 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning. In the
stands, children dressed in No. 99 jerseys held up signs pleading
with him to return next season. Gretzky is not sure. With two games
remaining in the Ranger season the question hangs in the air: Will
he or won't he retire after 20 seasons?
</P>
<P>
   John Davidson, the Rangers' television analyst and a longtime
friend of Gretzky's, said Sunday that Gretzky was about 80 percent
certain that the Rangers' final game next Sunday against Pittsburgh
would mark the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just time to think about things,'' Gretzky said Monday
night at Madison Square Garden. ``I said this before, that it's a
year at a time now. It's a lot different than it was last year. All
of a sudden it's become a bigger issue than maybe I had imagined.
It's become a hot topic. That's why I'm trying to talk about it.
We'll see what happens over the next five or six days.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Gretzky's agent, Michael Barnett, said: ``Only
time will tell. He certainly hasn't decided anything yet. When he
does, I'm sure he'll tell people that he feels need to hear it
first. When that is, no one knows. He's always maintained that he
would know before anyone else when it's the right time. I'm sure
that's still his belief. Everyone will respect that decision. At
this point, I do not believe he's made a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait until I meet with John,'' Gretzky said, speaking of
a postseason meeting with coach John Muckler. ``Nothing has been
decided. It's something that is obviously more at the forefront
than this time last year. But there is no decision at this time.
We're going to sit down at the end of this year and discuss what
the future holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who signed with the Rangers as a free agent on July 21,
1996, has one year left on his contract, which is a team option
worth $5 million. But the option is clearly Gretzky's.
</P>
<P>
   There are few milestones left for Gretzky, having passed his
boyhood idol, Gordie Howe, with his 1,072nd professional goal on
March 29. In sight are 900 regular-season National Hockey League
goals; he is six short. Even now, a long time since he signed with
the Indianapolis Racers in 1978, and with the disk problem in his
neck hampering him throughout the season, he leads the Rangers with
61 points.
</P>
<P>
   The bulging disk that sidelined him for 12 games still pains
him. Before the game, while preparing, he wore a neck brace as
protection. Whether he wants to play through the pain for a team
that has missed the playoffs in two consecutive seasons may be the
most telling part of the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Gretzky has maintained that he would not conduct
a farewell tour of the NHL. But as Davidson pointed out, if he
returns next year he will have no choice. Even in the indecision,
Gretzky has been subjected to scenes such as the one he saw in
Chicago on Friday night, when the fans stood and cheered for him,
moving him to tears on the bench. But it will be a decision that
will not be made rashly with Gretzky still maintaining that he has
not decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indications as far as Wayne retiring are in that
direction,'' Davidson said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indications,'' Davidson said, ``are that he's very
seriously thinking of looking at this upcoming weekend as his final
game.''

T. WILSON, FORMER BOEING CHAIRMAN, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ T. Wilson, who led Boeing through the dark days of the
``Boeing Bust'' in the 1970s to record sales, died in his sleep
Friday night at his winter home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman and chief executive, Thornton A. Wilson _
known simply to his friends as `T' _ wanted to fly airplanes as a
young man. But he broke his leg and ended up building airplanes for
Boeing instead. It was an accident that forever changed aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson went on build the Minuteman missile that helped define
the Cold War and committed billions of Boeing dollars to the risky,
simultaneous launch of the 757 and 767 aircraft that helped define
commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
   When he turned the daily reins of the company over to Frank
Shrontz in 1986 following years of deep recession in the airplane
business, sales were at an all-time high and so was the backlog of
airplane orders.
</P>
<P>
   And when he stepped down as chairman the next year, Shrontz
said: ``T. Wilson guided the company from one of its lowest points
in the late 1960s to fiscal strength and market leadership today.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sutter, sometimes called the father of the 747 and a retired
executive vice president of the commercial airplane company, said
Monday: ``When T left Boeing, it was an end of an era. T had
courage, the courage to launch two airplanes (757 and 767)
simultaneously. ... T was a very firm leader. You knew who was
running the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing President Harry Stonecipher, while recalling
the ``old Boeing,'' recounted a conversation with Wilson in which
he told him, ``Boeing is arrogant. He (Wilson) responded: `And
rightly so!' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Sutter offered a different perspective. ``There
wasn't an arrogance at Boeing. Boeing had an edge, an edge on the
competition. We had ... the mental attitude to get in it to stay.
There was an espirit d'corps. And T was the leader. He made all the
big decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   E.H. ``Tex'' Boullioun, retired president of Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, knew ``T as a good friend since 1950 when I was
shooting missiles up in the air for the company and T started on
the airplane business and invited me to come over and work with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``T was a good leader,'' said Boullioun. ``Even though he might
disagree with you, it wasn't a deal like `I'm right and your
wrong.' We'd go in big rooms and talk and it was like man and wife.
He could bark real hard and real loud. But he was very sincere and
very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   M. Lynn Olason, retired vice president and general manager of
the 747 program, Monday called Wilson ``a man of decisions. When he
got all the facts that he wanted, he would make a decision and that
was it. He loved airplanes. He was a great designer. He listened to
the designers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson started working for Boeing in 1943 after getting an
undergraduate degree from Iowa State University in aeronautical
engineering. He got his master's degree in 1948 from California
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   His first job at Boeing was developing the B-47 swept-wing
bomber. Then he became a project engineer on the B-52. In the
1960s, Wilson ran the team that won the Minuteman ICBM contract for
Boeing and became the Minuteman general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he was named president and had the added duties of
chief executive officer in 1969. He was elected chairman of the
board in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is survived by his wife, Grace Miller Wilson; their three
children, Thornton A. Wilson III, Daniel Wilson and Sarah
Parkinson; and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who apparently died in his sleep, was found by family
members Saturday morning, Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said Monday.
The cause of his death was not known.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no memorial services, Boeing spokeswoman Amanda
Landers said. Remembrances can be sent to the University of
Washington, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and his wife spent half the year in Rancho Mirage and the
other half at their long time home in Normandy Park, south of
Seattle, Olason said.

JEROLD HOFFBERGER, 80, EX-OWNER OF ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Del., Va.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerold Hoffberger, who owned the Baltimore Orioles when they won
five American League pennants and two World Series titles in the
1960s and 1970s, died last Friday at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore
after collapsing during a business meeting. He had celebrated his
80th birthday two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Following a path established by owners like Jacob Ruppert of the
Yankees and August Busch of the St. Louis Cardinals, Hoffberger,
who had been president of the Baltimore-based National Brewing Co.,
blended the beer business with baseball ownership.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baltimore and a major benefactor of its educational,
medical and religious institutions, Hoffberger played a role in
bringing major-league baseball to his hometown. When the Griffith
family, owners of the Washington Senators, expressed opposition to
the sale of the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore investors in 1953,
Hoffberger offered to have his brewery sponsor Senator games. That
deal helped soften the Senators' opposition to a nearby competitor
for their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffberger became chairman of the Orioles in June 1965 after
purchasing the 40 percent interest owned by Joseph Iglehart. The
following December, the Orioles obtained the slugger Frank Robinson
from the Cincinnati Reds, a deal that helped propel Baltimore to
pennants in four of the next six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1982, Robinson
paid tribute to the Oriole owner's personal touch, saying that
after a game, ``he wouldn't come over and slap you on the back and
say nice game-winning home run, nice double, nice play or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first words out of his mouth were: `How are you? How's
your family? Is there anything I can do for you?''' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hoffberger was a member of the Player Relations
Committee, the club owners' labor-relations unit, he drew the ire
of Marvin Miller, the players union leader. Miller accused
Hoffberger of being the most active owner in efforts to break the
players' strike of 1972, saying that he had the other owners acting
as ``puppets on his string.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffberger denied that, saying that he had often been on the
losing end of ownership votes, and he called Miller's remarks ``the
tactics of guys who are losing ground with their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Orioles' success on the field, they did not draw
particularly well at Memorial Stadium at a time when suburban
multipurpose stadiums with better sight lines were being built.
Hoffberger spent several years seeking new ownership, and then sold
the Orioles in August 1979 for $12 million to the Washington lawyer
Edward Bennett Williams, who then owned the Washington Redskins
football team.
</P>
<P>
   When he had taken control of the Orioles, Hoffberger asked Frank
Cashen, a former sports columnist and advertising director for his
brewery, to run the team. Cashen was the Orioles' executive vice
president from 1966 to 1975, and then returned to a position at the
brewery. In February 1980, Nelson Doubleday, the new co-owner of
the floundering Mets, received an unsolicited phone call from
Hoffberger, who suggested he hire Cashen as general manager. The
Mets did that, and Cashen went on to build their 1986 World Series
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Jerold Charles Hoffberger, the grandson of a Baltimore ice and
coal merchant, attended the University of Virginia and served in
the 1st Armored Division in World War II. His father, Samuel, a
major stockholder in National Brewing Co., later brought him into
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffberger was known for his charitable contributions, which
included assistance to Johns Hopkins Hospital, the University of
Maryland and Goucher College. Town &AMP; Country magazine estimated in
1983 that he had donated more than $10 million to charities.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alice; three sons, Peter and Richard
of Baltimore and David of Arnold, Md.; a daughter, Carol McCarthy
of Newark, Del.; two sisters, Lois Feinblatt of Baltimore and Rosel
Schewel of Lynchburg, Va., and 10 grandchildren.

Rangers' pitching woes result in disappointing 3-4 homestand
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ARLINGTON _ They brought him back home after a five-year hiatus to
further juice what already was one of baseball's most imposing
lineups. The Texas Rangers didn't necessarily expect to get a spin
doctor in the bargain, but they seem to have landed one of those,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you get off to a great start, you tend to
relax,'' designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro said in assessing the
first week-plus of the season. ``You think it's going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost better to get off to a slow start to make us
realize that it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be handed
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3-4, the Rangers are not off to a good start. Nothing is
looking particularly easy, either. If first impressions go for
anything, in fact, the defending American League West champions
couldn't feel too good about things as they packed their bags for a
12-game road trip that begins tonight in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bit of bad news: a 13-5 loss to Anaheim on a sunny
Monday afternoon at The Ballpark in Arlington, giving the Angels
three wins in four games in this early AL West showdown. In the
series, the Rangers were outscored 34-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get much worse,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``There's really only one way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem: A pitching staff that was
considered shaky at best now aspires to mediocrity after giving up
19 hits Saturday night and 20 more (10 of them doubles, an Angels
club record) on Monday. An overworked bullpen struggles under the
load of a succession of bad starts.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of clutch pitching, expected improvement in the
field has yet to materialize, due in part to a lingering shoulder
injury that has kept shortstop Royce Clayton out of the last four
games.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, not exactly a great beginning for a team with a $75
million payroll, one supposedly primed to improve on last year's 88
wins and a humbling Divisional Series sweep at the hands of the
Yankees. And as early litmus tests go, this series with the Angels
couldn't have gone much worse for the Rangers, who were embarrassed
by a team that seemed ripe for the taking.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim hit town with nine players on the disabled list,
including big offseason signee Mo Vaughn (ankle), shortstop Gary
DiSarcina (broken left forearm) and outfielder Jim Edmonds (groin,
shoulder). The Angels had other excuses, too, since they didn't
arrive at their hotel until 7 a.m. on Friday _ barely 12 hours
before game time _ after sitting through a lengthy rain delay on
getaway night at home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Anaheim managed to win the first two games by a combined
score of 18-4, including a 10-0 Saturday night skunking in which
the Angels outhit Texas 19-3. The Rangers averted the sweep with a
6-3 win Sunday night, but Monday made that look more like an
aberration than a sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Clark, making his second start as a Ranger, labored through
five ugly innings, giving up eight runs and 11 hits in a
performance very much in keeping with the early trend.
</P>
<P>
   In the first seven games, the Rangers got only two starts of
more than five innings, both from Aaron Sele, who is 2-0 with a
0.71 ERA and feeling very much out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the good pitches I threw weren't good enough,'' Clark
said after his latest shelling. ``It was just one of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   In just over a week, days like this have been far too frequent,
more than offsetting a respectable 5.1 runs a game from the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can overcome 13 runs, 10 runs, eight
runs,'' Oates said. ``Mentally, you just can't do that everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Time for a change of scene, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``Going on the road will be good for us,'' Palmeiro said.
``We've got some quality arms, some quality pitchers. It'll be good
to see if we can put all three phases together.''
</P>
<P>
   Those phases hardly were in sync Monday. After falling behind
1-0 on Tim Salmon's first-inning RBI double, the Rangers tried to
help Clark out with a three-run second, with Lee Stevens, Jon Shave
and Mark McLemore driving in runs, but the lead wouldn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim got a run in the third on back-to-back doubles by Randy
Velarde and Darin Erstad, then batted around in a five-run fourth,
with Salmon's three-run double accounting for most of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim made it 8-3 in the fifth when Troy Glaus doubled, went
to third on a ground ball and scored on a wild pitch, ending
Clark's misadventure. Todd Zeile's two-run homer in the bottom of
the inning cut the deficit to three, but that was as close as it
would get.
</P>
<P>
   So the Rangers hit the road to Seattle, Oakland, New York and
Minnesota. After an opening homestand they hoped would provide some
momentum, they instead find themselves facing an early crisis of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not this bad,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the evidence suggests otherwise.

COMMISSIONER'S USE OF DETECTIVES SETS OFF NEW ROUND OF CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani found himself defending Police
Commissioner Howard Safir once again Monday, acknowledging that the
commissioner had used eight on-duty detectives to provide security
at his daughter's wedding but calling it ``perfectly appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Safir both said the eight detectives, assigned to
the squad that is responsible for the commissioner's safety, were
necessary to provide adequate security for Safir and his family.
The detectives logged a total of 119 hours of work at the wedding,
costing the city more than $3,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a perfectly appropriate use of the detail,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without being asked, the mayor also said that he had no plans to
request that Safir step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police commissioner is not leaving,'' Giuliani said. ``He
is not going anywhere. The more unfair stories that you write about
him, the more I am convinced that he is doing a really good job and
people are threatened by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir also defended his use of the detectives at the wedding,
saying, ``I get threats every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's use of detectives at the wedding was first
reported Monday in The New York Post, which said the detectives
drove Safir's extended family to a photo session in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for the Police Department, said
Monday that limousines were hired for the wedding, but added, ``The
detectives may have given some people lifts, but it was all for
security reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has had to defend Safir a number of times in recent
weeks as the commissioner has faced scrutiny over whether he has
abused his authority.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Safir and his wife, Carol, took an
all-expenses-paid trip last month to the Academy Awards in Los
Angeles. That trip, paid for by a Revlon executive whom Safir has
described as a family friend, is now the subject of a city ethics
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the Safirs filed a lawsuit against a Queens
woman who had been involved in a car accident with Mrs. Safir two
years ago, Safir admitted that he had sent two detectives to the
woman's home to see if she posed a security risk to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, chairman of the Public
Safety Committee, said Monday that he was disturbed by what he said
appeared to be a pattern of poor judgment by Safir. ``It has become
part of a pattern of the commissioner apparently thinking that
these uses of city police officers are part of the perks of the
job, when the opposite should be the case,'' the councilman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sets a bad example for all the other cops,'' he
said. ``There are 40,000 cops on the force who are not supposed to
even take a free sandwich.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor criticized news organizations for the way they have
covered Safir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think that you are playing games with the police
commissioner,'' he said Monday at Shea Stadium, where he was
attending the Mets' first home game of the season. ``I understand
the game. It is a really cruel one and it's a nasty one and it's
trying to go after somebody in public life. And it's really a shame
that you do it and it's a shame that the media can't learn a little
more discipline in the way in which they handle it. I am not angry,
I am not lashing out. Somebody's going to write that tomorrow
because no matter how calmly I say something, that's what you
write.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the car accident, Safir said Monday that his wife had
dismissed the lawyer who filed the lawsuit on their behalf,
claiming that he never informed them about what was in the suit.
They replaced the lawyer, Martin Grossman, with Raoul Felder, a
friend of the family who has represented the Safirs before.
</P>
<P>
   The original suit, against Monica Nascimento, a concierge at a
midtown hotel who lives with her mother in Queens, asked for $1
million in damages for injuries to the commissioner's wife and
$250,000 because Safir was deprived of her ``companionship and
consortium.'' It contended that Ms. Nascimento was intoxicated from
drugs or alcohol, but offered no evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Felder said that he expected to file an amended suit and that
Safir would probably not be a party to it. ``I don't think it's in
his character to want to be one of the plaintiffs,'' Felder said.
</P>
<P>
   The amended suit, he said, would probably not accuse Ms.
Nascimento of being intoxicated. ``It's unknown how the allegations
of intoxication and the drug business came in there,'' Felder said.

POTVIN TOO TOUGH FOR DEVILS' BEST SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils set a franchise
record on Monday night for most shots in a game with 57, but Felix
Potvin of the New York Islanders tied the team's franchise record
for saves, turning aside 55 attempts as the usually hapless
Islanders gained a 4-2 victory at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils missed an opportunity to tie the Ottawa Senators for
first place in the Eastern Conference. The Senators were beaten,
2-0, by Florida on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin's performance was a rare bright spot for the Islanders,
who will miss the playoffs for the fifth straight season. After
becoming the backup goalie in Toronto when the Maple Leafs signed
Curtis Joseph as a free agent last summer, he eventually left the
team and was later traded to the Islanders, where he has struggled,
posting a 5-8-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Potvin, traded for Bryan Berard in
what seemed a one-sided deal until Monday night, would not play
again this season after injuring his groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to be part of the win,'' Potvin said. ``I sure
tested the groin tonight. It was fine all night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (44-24-11) still have a chance to catch the Senators
(44-23-13) because they have three games left to two for Ottawa,
the team that eliminated the Devils in the first round of the
playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at the scoreboard and say, `Ottawa is losing,'
because it doesn't matter whether Ottawa is winning or losing,''
said Brian Rolston, who scored the first goal for the Devils.
``What we want is to play solid hockey going into the playoffs, and
we didn't tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Robbie Ftorek and Rolston cited the Devils' lack of
patience in the offensive zone and their shot selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pressing a little and I don't know why,'' Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, who made 19 saves for the Devils, said Potvin
was the difference in the game. ``He played real well,'' Brodeur
said, ``but we had our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Orszagh, playing in his 10th game for the Islanders,
opened the scoring with his first goal in the National Hockey
League, 12 minutes 17 seconds into the game. The shot fooled
Brodeur because it deflected off the stick of Scott Stevens, the
captain of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Mats Lindgren gave the Islanders a two-goal lead with his eighth
of the season, on a power play just five seconds before the first
intermission, sending the Devils to the dressing room trailing by
2-0 even though they were outshooting the Islanders by 19-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils dominated action in the first two periods but had
difficulty capitalizing against Potvin. Patrik Elias had numerous
chances from excellent positions but was unable to convert.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin faced 40 shots during the first two periods, the only one
that eluded him being Rolston's blast from near the point at 5:04
of the second on a power play. Potvin was screened by Dave
Andreychuk of the Devils on the goal, Rolston's 22nd of the season
and third in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Watt extended the Islanders' lead with his eighth of the
season at 8:09 of the third period. After Jason Arnott responded
with his 27th less than two minutes later, Claude Lapointe sealed
the victory for the Islanders with his 14th of the season with 2:19
left.

REMEMBERING THE DAY 50 YEARS AGO WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO CRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At 11:55 a.m. on a Good Friday 50 years ago Tuesday,
housewives around Puget Sound were tuned into KVI radio's ``Queen
for a Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was savoring a win by its beloved Rainiers baseball club
over the Sacramento Solons the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, city workers were streaming into the streets to begin
their lunchtime rush hour. Outside in the 58-degree weather, kids
on spring vacation were playing.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:56 a.m., it was all forgotten in the most destructive
earthquake this century in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 7.1 magnitude temblor centered near Olympia
cracked the ground and toppled walls around Western Washington. A
keystone on a cupola at the state Capitol in Olympia was shaken
loose, almost bringing down the dome.
</P>
<P>
   In Tacoma, the dome of the Carnegie Library buckled, and the
Pierce County Courthouse was so badly damaged it later was razed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the dust and fear settled, eight people were dead, 64
injured. The area took stock of damages of as much as $170 million
in today's dollars _ and its good fortune. It could have been much
worse, they said. Bricks and debris fell on streets packed with
lunchtime crowds, but few were hit. In most towns, the schools were
empty.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Dorothy E. Rogers, now 77, was home in bed nursing a
cold at the Roy Apartments. She remembers leafing through a
magazine when the quake hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures on the wall began banging back and forth,'' she
recalled. ``I got up to go to the window, but I could hardly stand
up. I was sliding back and forth on a throw rug and I had to hang
on to the window sill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked into the alley and saw movement all around. I looked
up and saw the third-floor above us _ you could actually see it
bulge and sway out over the first-floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the city around her, frightened office workers and shoppers
raced into the streets. Trolleys skidded to a halt. Cars lurched
along the roads, jamming intersections. Clocks stopped. Water mains
burst. Lights flickered out.
</P>
<P>
   Though Seattle was on the northern fringe of the rumbling
ground, the force caused the Smith Tower, then the city's tallest
building, to sway violently. The old Seattle Hotel on Yesler Way
was too old to sway. It buckled, raining cement to the street.
Parked cars were flattened.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia suffered much more damage. Centered 30 to 40 miles
beneath the surface near the capital, the fault that caused the
quake is too deep to see even with today's machines, geologists
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Walsh a state Division of Geology and Earth Resources
geologist, says the 1949 quake essentially was caused by the Juan
de Fuca slab subducting into the Earth's mantle under the North
American plate.
</P>
<P>
   That means it caused the earth to move in a rolling nature, much
like a shaken bowl of jelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1949 quake had been preceded by two 6 magnitude quakes in
1939 and 1946, which some (scientists) considered to be foreshots
of the 1949 earthquake,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the ground held relatively firm in Olympia, where
scientists might expect to see liquifaction _ soil turning to
quicksand. It had been a dry year. Olympia could have suffered
more.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a community died.
</P>
<P>
   A Post-Intelligencer photographer recorded the picture of Roland
and Linnea Lund, then nine and six years old, respectively, who had
attended Cascade School. It, along with Cascade and Lafayette
school in West Seattle, was extensively damaged and closed.
</P>
<P>
   But the demise of the Cascade school helped usher in the end of
old Cascade neighborhood, long a transitional residential area for
immigrants and the poor. The loss of its school took away the heart
of the community.
</P>
<P>
   The Lund children and a friend were playing with a friend near
their father's house at Howell Street and Denny Way when the ground
around them revolted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only six years old and I remember that moment,''
recalled Linnea Lund Benthien. ``I remember looking at my brother
and our friend and seeing the questions on their faces. My brother
was holding a capgun and I remember seeing it swaying in his
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Roland Lund, now spokesman for the state Department of Labor and
Industries, ran into his father's house, not realizing it might be
unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard glass, everything, crashing around inside _ I was a
9-year-old kid and didn't know better. I ran back outside and by
then it was over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Children elsewhere weren't as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Among the eight dead was Marvin Klegman, 11, of Tacoma, a sixth
grader and Cub Scout who left school early to take his post as a
noon-hour crossing guard. He was crushed by bricks from a
fourth-floor dormer at Lowell Elementary School. A year earlier,
the fourth floor was condemned after parents urged it be torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Klegman, now a Federal Aviation Administration attorney in
Redondo Beach, Calif., was in second grade when his older brother
died. He still has his brother's crossing guard vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very close to Marvin. I would wait for him to come home
from school every day. I have pictures of us sitting together on
the school steps,'' Klegman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Rosen, also a second-grader, had walked out of the school
with Marvin after lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked back and people were pulling bricks off Marvin,''
said Rosen, now president of Rosen Supply Co. in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin was buried two days later at Home of Peace, the Jewish
cemetery in Lakewood. School crossing guards formed a cordon of
honor.
</P>
<P>
   In Castle Rock, senior class president Jack Roller, was also
leaving school for lunch when he was killed by a falling brick. He
was 18.
</P>
<P>
   Adults died in Centralia, Olympia, Cosmopolis and Seattle,
killed by falling bricks and heart attacks. The injured suffered
broken bones, sprains and cuts from flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   One 29-year-old Seattle woman, Dorothy Hazel Rogers, (no
relation to Dorothy E. Rogers) was delivering a son by Caesarean
section when the quake hit. Their lives hung in the balance when
the quake knocked out the hospital's oxygen and anesthesia
equipment. Mother and child were later said to be fine.
</P>
<P>
   Before 11:56 a.m., the troubles of the world were held at arm's
length.
</P>
<P>
   Moviehouse newsreels showed President Truman urging Congress to
approve the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers were following events in San Marino, Calif.,
where 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus had fallen into an abandoned well and
was clinging to life after 48 hours. Seattle's emergency officials
were pre-occupied taking reports of open wells here. They changed
their focus at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of persons poured into downtown Seattle streets at
the height of the quake,'' the P-I reported, ``fleeing the danger
of falling buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They huddled in the center of streets, in parking lots and any
available open space, many women crying and children screaming as
the paralyzing fear of sudden disaster ran through the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Busy Bee on Third Avenue, bartender Bill Given vaulted
the counter to bar the door to his fleeing patrons. Seconds later
concrete boulders smashed into sidewalk outside.
</P>
<P>
   While there was great fear, there was little panic. At Boeing,
15,000 workers conducted an orderly evacuation, as did personnel at
military bases.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of near misses, one of the more dramatic happened at
the Tacoma Narrows bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In Gig Harbor, Jack Smith remembers his stepfather, Bill Grant,
was one of the state highway bridge builders breaking for lunch on
a barge below the towering span.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the earthquake flicked off a gigantic steel saddle
capping the northeastern tower, which was installed but not riveted
down. It rocketed 600 feet to the barge below just as the men were
opening their lunchboxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went right through the barge'' but missed the stunned crew,
Smith recalls from what Grant told him. One man was injured by
flying lumber and a nearby workboat steamed toward the barge to
help out.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time it got there, they were all up to their chests in
water,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to think about that quake,'' said Smith, a
WWII veteran who has lived through several of them. ``I think a lot
of how you remember it depends on where you were at that day.''

 JUSTO RODRIGUEZ SANTOS, 83, EXPATRIATE CUBAN POET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Justo Rodriguez Santos, a Cuban poet who became
disenchanted with Fidel Castro in the 1960s, exiled himself from
his native land and became an advertising executive in the United
States, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
in Manhattan. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Santos was a minor member of Origenes, a prominent
group of writers and painters founded by the poet Jose Lezema Lima
in the 1930s and loosely linked to the American poet Wallace
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The name Origenes was a play on words, meaning both origins and
a church father; the group's work was strongly influenced by the
Roman Catholic faith. Origenes was also the name the artists chose
for an influential literary magazine they published from 1944 to
1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important journal in the history of Latin
American culture,'' said Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, a professor
of Hispanic and comparative literature at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez Santos was born in Santiago, Cuba, on Sept. 28, 1915,
and moved to Havana at an early age. He earned a degree at the
University of La Salle in Havana and a doctorate in philosophy and
literature from the University of Havana. He also worked in
television and radio in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   His books of poetry include ``Luz Cautiva'' (``Captive Light,''
1936), ``La Belleza Que el Cielo No Amortaja'' (``The Beauty the
Sky Will Not Shroud,'' 1950), ``El Diapason del Ventisquero''
(``Echoes of a Whirlwind,'' 1976), ``Los Naipes Conjurados y las
Operas del Sueno'' (``The Conjured Cards and the Operas of
Dreams,'' 1979 and 1989).
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote a nonfiction account of the Cuban revolution,
``The Moncada Epic: Poetry of History,'' in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was translated into several languages, and it was a
favorite of Mao's,'' said Rodriguez Santos' daughter, Mari
Rodriguez Ichaso of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cuban revolution in 1959, Rodriguez Santos wanted to
stay in Cuba, although his wife and children left in 1963. In 1967,
though, after a disheartening trip to China, he asked permission to
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very in favor of democracy and felt betrayed by what he
felt were the excesses of the revolution,'' Ms. Rodriguez Ichaso
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of receiving permission to leave, he was sent to a work
on a tobacco farm, his books were withdrawn from library shelves
and he was banned from the Cuban Writers Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``They converted him into a nonentity, a nonperson,'' Ms.
Rodriguez Ichaso said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later and ailing, Rodriguez Santos was permitted to leave
Cuba and settled in New York. In 1972, he was hired as director of
advertising for Goya Foods in Secaucus, N.J. He retired from Goya
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Antonia Ichaso
Rodriguez, and a son, Leon Ichaso, of New York.

A WORD WITH PLAYER GOT OLAZABAL GOING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ At the Masters champions dinner last Tuesday
night, Gary Player provided Jose Maria Olazabal with some timely
inspiration. The atmosphere is always special at the annual affair,
when legendary former winners like Player, Jack Nicklaus, Sam
Snead, Byron Nelson and Arnold Palmer come together in one room, to
share stories and memories.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during last week's gathering, Player asked Olazabal
about his confidence. ``I said, `It's not really that great,' ''
said Olazabal, who last won a major at the 1994 Masters. ``He
looked at me with those eyes. He said: `You have a great swing. If
you didn't, I wouldn't tell you. But you have to believe in
yourself.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood. He kept on saying, `You have to believe in
yourself.' The determination and his words, and the way he said it,
helped me to believe in myself, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone who witnessed Olazabal at the Masters believes in
his ability. His performance re-established him as one of the
world's best golfers. After his memorable victory on Sunday at
Augusta National Golf Club, by two strokes over Davis Love III and
three over Greg Norman, Olazabal completed a long and difficult
journey, overcoming disabling foot pain three years ago that
threatened to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reaffirming Olazabal's status, the year's first
major tournament also confirmed how deep the talent pool is today
in golf. Much of the pretournament talk centered around David Duval
and Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1- and No. 2-ranked players,
respectively. While a Duval-Woods rivalry has been been talked
about as an energizing force for the PGA Tour, we are still waiting
for a Duval-Woods head-to-head confrontation at a major.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who had won the previous two tournaments on the tour,
recovered from a shaky start to tie for sixth place at three under
par, while Woods never found his putting stroke and finished tied
for 18th. Many great players rose to the forefront this weekend,
however, setting up a furious finish.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's final round, a host of former winners of
majors had a chance to overtake Olazabal, including Love, Norman,
Nick Price, Steve Elkington, Lee Janzen and Justin Leonard. In
addition, other players had a chance for unexpected glory, like Bob
Estes and Steve Pate, who finished tied for fourth, and Carlos
Franco of Paraguay, who finished tied for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But Olazabal held off everyone, proving once again that golf's
talent extends around the globe, far beyond the PGA Tour. How many
people picked Olazabal to win before the first round? Yet in his
five previous Masters, he had never finished worse than a tie for
14th, so Sunday's triumph could hardly be called a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quite good, isn't he?'' Colin Montgomerie, who finished
tied for 11th. ``When he gets in this position, he's very difficult
to dislodge.''
</P>
<P>
   By winning another Masters at age 33, Olazabal proved he still
belongs in the cast of players capable of winning a major at any
time, a pool that is extremely deep. Only three players under the
age of 35 have won two majors _ Olazabal, Janzen and Ernie Els.
Olazabal knew that Sunday's victory put him in a different
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won my first one, you might say, `OK, it might have been a
lucky week,' '' Olazabal said. ``But when you win two, especially
the way I did it, it means a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   By finishing third this week, less than a year after shoulder
surgery, Norman put himself back in the hunt at a major, and back
among players who cannot be overlooked. He was a sentimental
favorite for those who remembered his collapse on the last day of
the Masters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more disappointed in '96 than I am now,'' said Norman,
who lost a six-stroke lead to Nick Faldo during the final round
that year. ``I feel 80 percent success, 20 percent failure.
Ninety-six was a totally different animal. Back in '96, there was
probably 90 percent disappointment, 99 maybe. I feel I've climbed
up a pretty good mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's peers seemed almost as happy about his re-emergence.
``I have the utmost respect for Greg,'' Duval said. ``He's never
been anything but nice to be, very cordial, polite, friendly,
encouraging. It's great to see him up there again.''
</P>
<P>
   So there is much to look forward to anticipating the next major,
the U.S. Open this June in Pinehurst, N.C. But in the meantime,
Olazabal can savor another day when he rose to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could barely hold my tears on 18,'' said Olazabal, who
finally did cry during his post-tournament news conference. ``At
this moment, I'm a very happy man.''

ARE THE YANKEES BETTER THAN THE BEST?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1999 Yankees could be better than the 1998 Yankees, who won
125 games and have ``Best Ever'' inscribed on their World Series
rings. Do not flip the page with derision at this suggestion. Do
not scoff at this possibility. Do not speculate that it is a
belated April Fool's joke. It is not.
</P>
<P>
   One of the beauties of baseball is comparing players and teams,
even if the difference in eras often makes it a thorny process. But
there is little difference from 1998 to 1999, so expect a season of
passionate debate about whether these talented Yankees are or can
be better than those talented Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Even speculating about the latest version of the Yankees someday
being superior to the 1998 version seems irreverent. Those Yankees
won more games than any other team in history, including a sweep of
the Padres in the World Series. Any resolution to this comparison
is six months away and, even if the 1999 Yankees keep the debate
percolating by winning a World Series, any resolution might only be
an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, six games into the season, the Yankees have performed
like a team intent on building a legacy. Sure, it is less than 5
percent of the season and injuries can undermine the most
formidable teams. Sure, it will be nearly impossible to duplicate
1998. Sure, there are innumerable reasons why a 5-1 team should not
be compared with a 125-50 team. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   But when Joe Torre, the proud manager of the 1998 champions who
will be back next month to manage the 1999 wannabes, was asked
whether the 1999 team can be better than the 1998 team, he did not
hedge.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' Torre said. ``Just because you don't win as
many games doesn't mean you're not a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Six and a half weeks before the opener, the Yankees became
better by acquiring Roger Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays for
David Wells, Graeme Lloyd and Homer Bush. The team with the best
record ever nabbed one of the best pitchers ever. Clemens, who has
not lost a game in almost a year, has brought leadership, intensity
and, so far, one of many victories to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Clemens, there is less pressure on David Cone to
stretch seven innings every start or for Andy Pettitte to hurry
back from a sore elbow. Clemens actually makes the confident
Yankees more confident and is a major reason the starters are 4-0
with a 2.12 ERA (he has a 1.93 ERA in two starts). That has
happened without Pettitte, whose 55 victories are more than anyone
else in the American League in the last three years, and with
Ramiro Mendoza, who was supposed to be a reliever and sixth
starter. After the champs received their Series rings on Sunday,
Clemens, his fingers naked, gazed at the ring on Torre's right
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we're going to improve on this, but we're
going to try,'' Torre told him. Clemens simply kept staring. ``The
look in his eyes wasn't envy, it was hunger,'' Torre recalled. ``I
think that's what you get when you get a Roger Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Tony Clark said Clemens gives New York ``a different
air,'' and Manager Larry Parrish cited the significance of having
Clemens and designated hitter Chili Davis, who is batting .500 with
three homers and seven runs batted in, for a full season. Parrish
forgot Orlando Hernandez, who will torment hitters for a whole year
and could win 20 after winning 12 in 21 starts last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to give them the World Series already,'' said
Parrish, who turned silent for 10 seconds and considered whether he
wanted to predict another title for the Yankees a few days into the
season. He bridled himself. ``But they are definitely going to be
having a shot at doing that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course they are. Analyze the roster and the only places where
the Yanks are not better or as equipped as in 1998 are in short
relief, because they do not have the luxury of a second southpaw
like Lloyd, and in bench speed, because Bush is gone. Quick,
someone send George Steinbrenner a sympathy card.
</P>
<P>
   With four No. 1-type starters, the rotation is better. Fronted
by Mariano Rivera, the bullpen is sound. Tino Martinez should
produce more because he was bothered by a nagging back injury last
year. Chuck Knoblauch underachieved a year ago and already looks
more confident. Derek Jeter could be the premier player in the
league. Scott Brosius might not drive in 98 runs again, but a No. 9
batter does not have to.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will provide more consistent production at d.h. The
combination of Jorge Posada and Joe Girardi will be better because
Posada will catch more. Bernie Williams won a batting title and is
still blossoming. Paul O'Neill will retire when he stops hitting
lasers. Some combination will handle left field.
</P>
<P>
   Could 1999 be another dream team?
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be better,'' Cone said. ``We could conceivably be in
better shape in terms of overall health. We had so many things
break right for us last year, some dramatic come-from-behind wins.
That's tough to match. But I still think that we're going to be in
a lot of games. Night in, night out, we'll have a chance to win
because of our pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   These Yankees will win, and the debate will continue. See you in
October.

SEAVER AND MCCARVER ADJUST TO NEW JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Seaver insisted that he ignored the carping when
he took Tim McCarver's place in the New York Mets' television booth
and, at the same time, became the organization's newest pitching
guru. The din was loud, so Seaver must have worn dandy earplugs at
home in Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue,'' he said outside the WPIX-TV booth at Shea
Stadium Monday before he threw out the first ball for the home
opener and then broadcast his third game of the season. ``It's the
mentality of regarding what a broad spectrum of people said when I
pitched. You can't control what people write.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching side of his Mets' employment (his other
front-office duties are unspecified) is confined to spring
training, but he will talk to any pitcher who seeks his opinion. On
Monday, he spoke to Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do that if I were just an announcer,'' Seaver said. ``You
owe it as a member of the fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   But he confessed Monday to anxiety about returning to the Mets
after a long exile and to TV after a five-year absence. Perhaps
that was manifested in Seaver's errant ceremonial first pitch,
which must have tempted Mike Piazza, the ceremonial first-pitch
catcher, to bend despite his sprained knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not Tom's personal catcher,'' the Mets spokesman Jay
Horwitz observed.
</P>
<P>
   During his first Mets game for WPIX, on Friday night in
Montreal, Seaver said he felt anything but comfortable, working
into a dither of preparation. ``You should have seen my hotel room
Thursday,'' he said. ``It looked like a bomb shelter. You're
paranoid you won't have that one crucial piece of information, but
you try to balance all that against 25 years of pitching inside my
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   If not yet memorable in the booth, Seaver seems at ease. Working
beside Gary Thorne will improve anyone making a decent effort. They
have rapidly meshed into a functioning team, as Thorne has engaged
Seaver with smart questions. Seaver avoided one question Friday
night about how he would pitch to Piazza by saying, ``At 54, I'd
pitch him very carefully _ hopefully when the lights are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver benefits by not having to assume any of the play-by-play
load, which he did without distinction on New York Yankee games
from 1990 to 1993 with Bobby Murcer and Phil Rizzuto. Leaving that
to Thorne is wise because he is one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   And Thorne will rescue his partner. A terrific play Friday by
Rey Ordonez, the Mets' shortstop, begged for comment by Seaver.
Noticing the silence, Thorne asked, ``What are you smiling at?''
Seaver said, ``He made that look so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver's best analysis focuses on pitching; he was exasperated
enough with Montreal's lousy pitching Friday night to walk into the
Expo clubhouse Saturday morning and ask, ``Who was responsible for
the pitching yesterday?''
</P>
<P>
   His non-pitching insights are pedestrian, requiring that he more
quickly scope out strategies and view the full field as well as he
spies sinkers.
</P>
<P>
   And insights enhanced by personal anecdotes will help. When he
discussed pitchers' hitting, Seaver recalled, ``Koosman thought he
was Mickey Mantle.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver will be judged by his candor. He can say what he pleases;
if he is blunt, viewers will feel he is not shielding any of his
students' feelings.
</P>
<P>
   WNYW's McCarver-Murcer Yankee team had a rockier start in its
first game last week. Murcer's introductory comments, likening the
Yankees to a multicourse meal, were overlong. McCarver bobbled a
few names and seemed nervous.
</P>
<P>
   But by Game 2, they struck a better rhythm with McCarver saying
Yankee catcher Jorge Posada has as good an arm as the Texas catcher
Ivan Rodriguez, and engaging in good repartee about pine tar,
catching a knuckleball and Derek Jeter's use of the top hand on his
bat to generate more power. By Sunday, they openly discussed
Orlando Hernandez's possible perfect game. Discussing the $63
million payroll disparity between the Yankees and Oakland, McCarver
said, ``For that money in 1965, they could have built two
Astrodomes.'' Murcer said, ``Thank Heaven that didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver and Murcer create a warm, folksy blend. Yet, Murcer
should not be the lead play-by-play announcer for six innings.
Murcer has never been strong or careful enough for play-by-play.
McCarver should be the dominant voice.
</P>
<P>
   Masters Rating
</P>
<P>
   The well-produced final round of the Masters _ subtitled ``The
Major Tournament CBS Really Wishes Greg Norman Would Win'' _
generated a 10.7 overnight Nielsen rating, up 8 percent from last
year.

 RABBI LEVI BEN LEVY, 64, HEAD OF BLACK JEWISH GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rabbi Levi Ben Levy, the chief rabbi of the Israelite
Board of Rabbis for the New York metropolitan area and the Western
Hemisphere, died last Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
Manhattan. He was 64 and lived in the Queens Village section of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, said his son Sholomo Ben Levy, also a
rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelite Board of Rabbis serves black Hebrew Israelites, as
they prefer to be known by their fellow Jews and others.
</P>
<P>
   David Pollock, the associate executive director of the Jewish
Community Relations Council of New York, said that members of
``Rabbi Levy's group consider themselves part of the Jewish
community, and everybody whom I know who has examined this group
has concluded that they are part of the Jewish community.''
</P>
<P>
   Levi Ben Levy was born in Linden, N.C. In 1950, he moved to New
York, where he met Rabbi Wentworth Matthew. Matthew was born in
Africa and, when he died in 1973, was described by his family as
the first ordained black rabbi in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew established a black synagogue in Harlem. In 1925, he
also founded the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College, also in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Levy entered City College in 1957, but two years later, having
decided to become a rabbi, he enrolled at the Ethiopian Hebrew
Rabbinical College. He was ordained in 1967, a year after
graduating. The college is now called the Israelite Rabbinical
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was encouraged in his religious studies and works by
Matthew, who was also chief rabbi of the Israelite Board of Rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's first synagogue, Beth Shalom Ethiopian Congregation,
began on a modest scale, with eight families gathering in the
living room of his Queens home. The congregation is now in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, he was elected chief rabbi of the Israelite
Board of Rabbis. At that time, the board's responsibilities were
limited to the New York metropolitan area, but later they were
expanded to include new congregations in other countries in the
Western Hemisphere. He held the title of chief rabbi at his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Rabbi Sholomo Ben Levy, Levy's older son, became the
spiritual leader of another synagogue, Beth Elohim Hebrew
Congregation, which Levy had founded in 1983 in Queens. Another
son, Benyamin, became Sholomo's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Levy spent much of his retirement in North
Carolina, but he often traveled to New York to visit relatives and
to advise Jewish organizations to which he had ties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his sons, both Queens residents, Levy is survived
by his wife, the former Deborah Byrd; four daughters: Deborah,
Yehudith, Tamar and Zipporah; two brothers: Issac and Frank
McKethan; four sisters: Enola McNeil, Irene Elliot, Lillian Issac
and Laura Brown, and nine grandchildren.

WINNING RECORD FOR VALENTINE (BUT WHO'S COUNTING?)
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBN-METS-MARLINS) 
 (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That was not just another victory the Mets gained in
their Shea Stadium opener on Monday. The 8-1 conquest of the
Florida Marlins gave the Mets' manager a winning record in his
11-year major league managerial career. The team doesn't play
Tuesday, so Bobby Valentine can savor his over .500 mark _ 775
victories, 774 losses _ at least until Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opener, John Franco was asked if the team felt any
pressure trying to win this one for Bobby. ``He didn't say
nothing,'' the Mets' veteran closer and team leader said, ``so I
guess there isn't that much pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Bobby Bonilla, whose two-out broken-bat single
was the key hit in a four-run surge in the fifth inning, was asked
how it felt to get Valentine on the winning side of the ledger.
``Nobody really knew about it,'' Bonilla replied, ``but it's nice
to see that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, so the manager's won-lost record wasn't the most
emphatic thought on the players' minds. It evidently wasn't on
Valentine's either. ``You can't count years when you take over a
team,'' Valentine has said in rejecting the thought that he's a
losing manager, ``because it's not your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine became a major league manager with the Texas Rangers
in May 1985. He went from June 20 of that season to last Sept. 16
without having more victories than losses. After he went two
victories over losses in the ensuing three days, the Mets lost the
last five games of the season, sending Valentine back to a losing
record and themselves home.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets cannot escape those final five games. One or two
victories would have catapulted the Mets into the playoffs as the
wild-card team, but the victories never came.
</P>
<P>
   Players and managers don't like to look back and dwell on what
happened last year. ``Last year was last year,'' they proclaim
robotically. ``This year is this year.'' But it is in the job
descriptions of fans and reporters to look back and continue to
scrutinize past seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But even Valentine allowed himself a comment Monday on the
difficulty the Mets had last season with the Marlins and the
Montreal Expos, who had the worst records in the National League.
The Mets have begun this season by beating those same two teams six
times in eight games, three of four each.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know their players better,'' Valentine said when asked why
the difference. ``We've scouted them better. Rather than saying
we're better than them and just throw our gloves out there, we've
prepared better for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Valentine's first two seasons with the Mets, they did not
have their own person scouting teams in advance of games against
them. They used a service that provided films and reports on
players. For this season, however, the Mets hired John Stearns, one
of their former catchers, to serve as the advance scout.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mets opened the season with a three-game series
against the Marlins, Stearns, who had watched them play 12
exhibition games in 17 days, submitted an intricately detailed
30-page report. The value of the report has been obvious in the
results of the games. Some of the Marlins have noticed a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to pitch me inside,'' first baseman Derek Lee said.
``They're pitching me outside this year. Maybe that is a case of
better scouting. Last year a lot of us were first-year players, so
they probably have a better idea of what we can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Mark Kotsay said that ``maybe pitching-wise they
might show that they have scouted us out as hitters better,'' but
he offered another observation as to the difference between the
Mets' September failure and their April success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is it's not a pressure situation,'' he said.
``It's early in the season. Obviously you want to win ball games,
but there's not a playoff spot on the line right now. Last year
there was a lot of pressure for them to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a game won in April is one less a team has to win
in September, and winning six of the first eight beats losing the
last five.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A surprise guest was on hand for the winning home opener. Seated
in a third-base box with the co-owner Fred Wilpon was Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, the Yankees' first fan.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani attends a baseball game, it's virtually always at
Yankee Stadium, and he wears his ``lucky'' _ his description _
Yankees jacket. That apparel, of course, would have been in bad
fashion taste Monday, so he wore, at his suggestion, a Mets jacket
and cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like he was in pain, though,'' said Steve Phillips,
the Mets' general manager, who instantly looked as if he wanted to
swallow his politically incorrect words.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat through the game, Giuliani most likely was unaware
that the Mets' clubhouse was being flooded by backed-up sewer
water, a result of a pump problem the Mets said the city was
responsible for avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it likely that the Mayor knew about Valentine's winning
record, but then, the manager's players didn't know either.

PHONING FOR `PHANTOM' TICKETS MAY BE ALLOWED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To camp out or not to camp out may no longer be
the question.
</P>
<P>
   Fans seeking tickets to the first showings of ``Star Wars,
Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' had been told two weeks ago that
George Lucas and 20th Century Fox wanted movie theaters to limit
sales to same day only. That would have mostly prevented ticket
scalping during the first dozen days.
</P>
<P>
   But the mogul and studio have apparently relented in the face of
exhibitor complaints and will allow advance sales.
</P>
<P>
   How far in advance and how many tickets per customer are still
to be determined. The Hollywood Reporter, citing unnamed sources,
said Monday presales are expected to last at least a week prior to
the May 19 opening and could feature a credit-card system that
would limit multiple purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sherak, chairman of Fox Domestic Film Group, said no
definitive agreement has been reached on presales but added that
Fox has been trying to take theater owners' concerns into account.
The executive conceded two weeks ago that Fox could not force
theaters to ban advance sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working with the theater owners to work out the
best way to handle this,'' Sherak said. ``The whole idea has always
been to protect the public from ticket scalping.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.
service, said the proposed advance-sales ban was problematical for
theater chains. He noted the potential difficulties of dealing with
patrons who would be frustrated over having no guarantee of seeing
the movie even after spending hours in lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lucas and the studio may be loosening up how they do
this and try to make it a little easier for the ticket buyers,''
Dergarabedian said, adding that some kind of limit on the number of
tickets is likely. In any scenario, business will be huge, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to sell out no matter what the delivery is,''
Dergarabedian said. ``You'll have pretty quick sellouts that way if
you've got several ways of buying tickets. And I don't know how
you'd prevent scalping.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dozens of hard-core fans began forming lines last week
outside Mann's Chinese and Westwood Village theaters, advance sales
would likely be welcomed by many other patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd buy tickets over the phone without a second's hesitation
because I'm too old to stand in line for hours,'' said Altadena
resident Richard Manly, who plans to take his 13-year-old son,
Josh, to see ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for `The Exorcist,' but that was back when I had the
energy for doing crazy things. I'm a middle-aged man now,'' said
Manly, whose son was born three years after the last ``Star Wars''
movie _ ``Return of the Jedi'' _ was originally released.

PROCTOR JONES, 83, PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio, N.C.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proctor Patterson Jones, an author, photographer, publisher and
lawyer who was a presence in San Francisco for over four decades,
died there on April 2 at his home in the Pacific Heights section of
the city. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Jones began his career writing legal texts. But he turned
professional photographer, filmmaker and author and in 1970 founded
Proctor Jones Publishing Co. He was still its president at his
death.
</P>
<P>
   The company's book list reflected Jones' curiosity about French
and Napoleonic history, on which he wrote extensively. He also
published photographic books and mystery novels, contributing
himself to both genres.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a native of Cleveland, graduated from Western Reserve
University in 1937 and studied law at Harvard and Stanford
universities before serving in the military in North Africa and
Italy in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He received a doctor of laws degree at Western Reserve, now Case
Western, in 1948. That year he returned to Stanford to study
political science, from which grew four decades of public service
on many governmental boards in the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   His books about Napoleon included English editions of the
memoirs of Baron Fain, a cabinet official (1998), and of Louis
Joseph Marchand, the emperor's valet and friend (1998). He was a
contributor to ``Napoleon: An Intimate Account of the Years of
Supremacy, 1800-1914'' (Random House, 1992), which earned the 1992
Literary Award of the Napoleonic Society.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife supported San Francisco's museums, symphony and
opera, as well as several historic sites in France.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is survived by his wife of 52 years, Martha Martin Jones;
two sons, John of Los Angeles, and Proctor Jr. of San Francisco;
three daughters, Melinda Windisch of Greensboro, N.C., Greta Jones
of Raleigh, N.C., and Martha Griffinger of Piedmont, Calif.; 10
grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

ANGELS ENJOY HITFEST

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ No Mo? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels arrived in Texas Friday lacking Mo Vaughn and Jim
Edmonds and maybe a little confidence after the Cleveland Indians
shut them down in a season-opening series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas Rangers provided the necessary relief _ a pitching
staff that is trying to find itself. The result was three Angels
wins in four games, including a 13-5 victory Monday afternoon
before 24,601 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-game series the Angels had 57 hits. They had 20 hits
Monday, including a career-high four hits by Troy Glaus, four by
Tim Salmon and three each by Randy Velarde and Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was a record-setting day for the Angels:
</P>
<P>
   __ Their 10 doubles is a new club record, breaking the previous
mark of eight.
</P>
<P>
   __ The three doubles by Glaus tied a club record.
</P>
<P>
   __ The five RBI for Salmon tied a career high.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Mark Clark (0-1) took the brunt of the attack,
giving up eight runs and 11 hits in five innings. But the Angels
didn't play favorites on this day, scoring in every inning but the
second and sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Every starter except designated hitter Chris Pritchett had at
least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can hit,'' said Erstad, who singled twice, doubled, walked,
drove in one and scored three. ``We've got guys who are unselfish,
who will do what it takes to win, who will situational-hit. Look at
Pritchett _ he has no hits yet, but he doesn't care. He gets a guy
over to third base so we can drive him in. Stuff like that is so
valuable. We've got a good mix of guys right now. Numbers come
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Those putting up the biggest numbers now are Glaus and Salmon.
Glaus is hitting .481 (13 for 27) with two homers and seven RBI in
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of time and effort into the offseason,'' Glaus
said. ``I wasn't doing it for a little while but (for) the whole
offseason. Right now it's paying off.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus is only 22 and less than two years removed from playing at
UCLA. But he says that doesn't give him an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who I am or how long I've been here,'' he
said. ``I'm up there to drive in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's five RBI give him nine this season. He's hitting .393
(11 for 28), which is significant because traditionally he's been a
slow starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm trying to do anything different,'' Salmon
said. ``A lot of times in the past we're playing New York, Boston
and Cleveland at the beginning of the year. And they have the best
pitching staffs. Maybe that has something to do with my slow
starts. Now maybe we're not facing the best pitching, and we're
taking advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Glaus and Salmon have been the most noticeable, the
hitting has come from all over. Even Orlando Palmeiro and No. 9
hitter Andy Sheets had two hits apiece Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about it is we've got nine guys getting the job
done,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``Those two guys (Glaus
and Salmon) have gotten a lot of hits, but everybody's getting
them. We're spreading it out.
</P>
<P>
   All the offense made it easy for the Angels pitchers Monday,
even if Ken Hill wasn't able to stay in long enough to get the
victory. Hill gave up five runs and five hits _ walking seven _ in
four-plus innings. Mike Magnante (1-0), the first of three
relievers, earned the victory with 21/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   While winning three of four from the Rangers was nice for the
Angels, Collins wasn't anywhere near giddy. His memory is too good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we came in here halfway through the season and won
three of four,'' Collins remembered. ``And at the end of the season
we couldn't beat them. We just have to win some games. No
statements are made April 12.''

SHOULD ORGANS HELP SICKEST OR STAY IN STATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There's no question in Dani Bonham's mind about
``what'' should be done with her organs after she dies. The
Chandler mother of six has been a card-carrying organ donor ever
since a stranger 12 years ago donated his liver and saved her
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   It's the question of ``where'' her organs and those of other
Arizona donors will go that's being fiercely debated.
</P>
<P>
   Should people on waiting lists in Arizona get first dibs on
them? Or should they go to sicker people in other states?
</P>
<P>
   And should the sickest people in Arizona be at the top of the
list for organs that become available in other states?
</P>
<P>
   A bill in the state Legislature would make sure those on Arizona
waiting lists continue to be first in line for organs donated in
the state. It has drawn fire from doctors, ethicists and transplant
patients who say it is just a ploy to protect Arizona transplant
centers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Under the bill, patients listed at Arizona transplant centers
would be matched first. If there were no matches in Arizona, then
the organ would go to other centers in Region 5 of the federal
transplant network, which includes California, Hawaii, Nevada, New
Mexico and Utah. If it isn't matched regionally, then it is matched
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the current system works _ and many say it does a
disservice to people throughout the United States who need organ
transplants the most.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argues that the system, which has
more than 60 different areas working inside 11 regions, doesn't
work fairly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, liver transplant patients in New York City wait 600
days while those in New Jersey, just across the river but in a
different organ-procurement area, wait an average of 56 days,
according to a 1997 federal report. &QL; 
Not close enough &QL; 
Or consider Fort Worth and Dallas. The cities are only 30 miles
apart but because they are in different areas, they don't easily
share organs. If a heart becomes available in Fort Worth, it is
sent to Houston instead of Dallas because Houston is the same
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous. It's a violation of patients' rights, of
human rights,'' said Pam Silvestri, of the Southwest Transplant
Alliance. Texas is considering legislation similar to Arizona's.
But Silvestri's group, which procures organs in southeastern Texas,
has lobbied hard against it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to revisit the controversial issue of organ
allocation this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Texas are two of seven states that have either
passed or considered laws as a response to federal efforts to get
organs to the most needy patients _ whether they are in the
neighborhood or across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In their successful attempt to get Congress to delay any changes
until October, the United Network of Organ Sharing argued that the
system needs more organs, not more federal interference.
</P>
<P>
   If the rules change, only larger transplant centers would
survive and most of Arizona's five transplant centers would suffer,
said Jack Cremin, president and chief executive officer of the
Donor Network of Arizona. The non-profit group coordinates organ
donations for the state. It is part of the United Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran some numbers. If in fact we had to do mandatory
sharing, there would be only one liver from an Arizona donor to
remain in Arizona and that would go to UMC (University Medical
Center in Tucson),'' Cremin said. The center does the most
transplants of any hospital in the state. &QL; 
More fairness &QL; 
Federal officials say Cremin and other members of the United
Network are wrong _ and that the federal government just wants more
equity. It's up to the United Network and its members to come up
with a system that is fairer, said Jon Nelson, director of the
office of special programs for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   But if more organs go to the sickest patients, then larger
hospitals, which tend to be the ones that treat those patients,
will end up doing the bulk of transplants. Under federal rules, a
transplant center must perform 12 transplants a year to receive
organs, Cremin said.
</P>
<P>
   He disputes charges that his group is just trying to protect
transplant centers.
</P>
<P>
   Cremin points to the liver donations as an example of how
Arizona already shares with other states. In 1998, 74 livers _ the
most scarce of transplantable organs and the first that would be
affected by any rule changes _ were donated in Arizona.
Twenty-seven went to people waiting on Arizona transplant lists and
the rest went to people in other states.
</P>
<P>
   But frequently, Arizona is on the receiving end of the organ
chain. In 1997, for example, a third of the hearts were imported
from other states, said Dr. Belton Meyer, the former medical
director of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. Meyer,
an ethicist, was a former committee member of Donor Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The measure being pushed in the state Legislature is not
necessarily in favor of Arizonans: It's in favor of Arizona
transplant centers, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Beyda, director of pediatric critical care and an
ethicist at Phoenix Children's Hospital, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a transplant center and it needs local support,'' he
said. ``You need organs to come into the transplant center, it ends
up becoming a business. This is not a big philosophical issue.
Organs are being made a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about money, and we need to look beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   People should think about the ethics behind the economics, says
Beyda. &QL; 
Tough questions &QL; 
Say you were an organ donor and you have a family member who is a
patient in Pittsburgh with 24 hours to live. Should your kidney be
shipped to that patient, or should it go to someone on an Arizona
waiting list who is out playing golf?
</P>
<P>
   Beyda, Meyer and other ethicists across the country argue that
allocating organs by ZIP code rather than by need is ``ethically
indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are more transplant programs opening up. This
summer, Mayo Clinic Hospital and Good Samaritan Regional Medical
Center will open liver transplant programs. Good Samaritan had a
program two years ago but closed it because of lack of staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Samaritan and Mayo are neutral on the bill pending in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Valley patient groups such as the Arizona chapter of the
American Liver Foundation and the National Kidney Foundation also
said they are remaining neutral because their national groups
haven't weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual patient advocates have made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Cullison, executive director of the Arizona Liver
Foundation, said she backs the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel the need to rock the boat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But another, Dale Ester, former president of the Arizona
Association of Kidney Patients, said inequities hurt people no
matter what state they live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill came up too fast and it leaves patients wondering
what is going on out there. The message I got (from the
Legislature) was that they were not going to listen anymore. They
had made up their minds,'' said Ester, who had been on the federal
committee that wrote the 1997 report.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Sue Grace, chairwoman of the health committee and the
bill's sponsor, said she is pushing it because it protects
Arizonans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a donor state now,'' Grace said. ``There are states
that aren't doing as much as our organizations. It seems that we
are penalizing the state for doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Donor Network of Arizona doesn't keep a register of organ
donors. But according to federal statistics, Arizona's rate of
donors per million was 19.6 from 1994 to 1995. It ranks 45th among
the country's 66 organ procurement groups.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said she doesn't understand why this issue has drawn so
much ethical fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, however, predicts the Arizona Legislature will spark
other states to take similar defensive moves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of curtailing the sharing of organs, the Legislature
should be more concerned with increasing donations, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some suggestions that more families of donors
would approve the donation if they knew where the organs were
headed, said Glenna Shapiro, director of the Arizona Kidney
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the loved one would like them to go to a Baptist in a
certain age group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said she recently led a focus group of potential organ
donors that demonstrated their diversity. One person in the group
wanted his organs to go to a young person with a full life ahead;
another person in the circle said, ``No, I want them to go to a
middle-age person because I don't know long they (the organs) could
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham, the Chandler mother convinced of the value of donation,
is just as divided as the people in Shapiro's focus group. She's
not enthusiastic about more federal involvement, but she strongly
believes the sickest should get them the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, as for my organs,'' Bonham said, ``they can pack them up
in the Igloo and send them to whoever needs them the most.'' &QL;

BLAZERS' STRATEGY WAS TAYLOR-MADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers continue providing
evidence that they play to the level of competition, which at 5-31
indicates the NBA is up to David Stern's chin in bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips' latest conquest was Sunday's 89-83 stunner in
Portland. This followed Saturday's pasting by the Trail Blazers in
Anaheim and gives the Clippers two wins in five games against the
league's two top teams by record _ the Blazers and Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory was managed despite Portland holding a
nine-point lead late in the fourth quarter. The Blazers didn't
score in the game's final 2:27.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers forward Maurice Taylor, who scored 14 consecutive
points in the fourth quarter, said his outburst was easy to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Blazers) weren't doubling me,'' he said. ``I could have
plenty of quarters like that if they don't bring the double team.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland decided against using that almost-automatic tactic
because Rasheed Wallace, the Blazers' quick and springy 6-foot-11
forward, had been solid defensively against Taylor most of the
weekend. The 6-8 Taylor, who prefers backing his way to the hoop
from the low post, was forced to change this strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play with your back to Rasheed,'' he said, ``because
he's long and quick off his feet. So I turned and faced him and
went from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for those scoring at home as Taylor was in Portland, credit
for that offensive approach should go to Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations. Baylor just
happens to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, forward in
the history of forwards.
</P>
<P>
   __ `Cap' room: Point guard Sherman Douglas scored a season-high
19 points in the victory at Portland, and was expert at feeding
Taylor down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, coach Chris Ford named Douglas team captain for the
remainder of the season and Douglas has responded by taking charge
of the offense. But Douglas says his recent success is the product
of improved health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting healthy and getting in shape is the most important
thing,'' said Douglas, who was signed to a one-year contract the
day before the season opener. He wasn't exactly fit as a fiddle
then and his lack of conditioning was exacerbated by subsequent
groin and thigh injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who will run the show tonight against his most-recent
former team, the 10-25 New Jersey Nets, is stepping lively now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting there,'' he said. ``I'm about 85 or 90 percent. We
need to go out now and show some consistency. After our other wins,
we've gone out there the next game and set basketball back a couple
thousand years.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hawking Hudson: The second 10-day contract of CBA escapee
Troy Hudson expired Monday, but Baylor spent part of the day
working out a deal to keep the young point guard around for the
rest of the season and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson provided glimpses of what could be a bright future while
backing up Darrick Martin, but his minutes have been in sharp
decline since Douglas' return from the injured list.

EDITORIAL: DO-IT-YOURSELF TERM LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 13:
</P>
<P>
   Reps. George Nethercutt, a conservative Republican from
Washington, and Martin Meehan, a liberal Democrat from
Massachusetts, share a peculiar problem. They first ran for office
promising self-imposed term limits. Now they have come to the point
when they vowed they would quit. Both are wondering if their
constituents would object to a self-imposed reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Since it has become clear that the House of Representatives has
no appetite for passing a constitutional amendment that would
impose term limits across the board, many candidates for Congress
have promised their constituents that if elected, they will
voluntarily step down after a given number of years. U.S. Term
Limits, which specializes in getting candidates to sign these
pledges, says 10 House members will hit their self-imposed deadline
next year. Most seem content to leave on schedule, but a few,
including Nethercutt and Meehan, apparently like the job more than
they expected, and are wavering.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt beat Speaker Thomas Foley in 1994 in a campaign that
focused heavily on Foley's opposition to term limits. Nethercutt
made a point of promising to stay in office for no more than three
terms, but now his aides say he did not understand how important
seniority was in Congress. This page has long argued that term
limits are a bad idea, but nevertheless, this is a lay-down hand.
People who run for office should be accountable for what they say.
Voters are smart enough to understand that a vow to cut taxes or
fix education has to be taken with a grain of salt. But anybody can
keep a promise to quit. Many people voted for Nethercutt because
they agreed with him about term limits. If they had wanted
seniority, they would have stuck with Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, a fine legislator, says he made a mistake in promising
to limit himself to four terms, and that his constituents now would
be upset if he abandoned causes like campaign finance reform.
Pragmatically speaking, he does not have to worry. His district is
a safe one. If he runs again, the Democrats will nominate him, and
the Republicans are unlikely to waste money running a strong
candidate against him. But politics is not going to be improved by
demonstrating to voters that Meehan's party does not expect to hold
him to his promise, and that the public will probably be given no
satisfactory alternative to re-electing him.

Talk helps Rockets end slump
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MINNEAPOLIS _ Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich, having covered all
the pregame Xs, Os and keys he cared to, spoke about ``passion,
fire.'' Hours earlier, Rockets players sat down for a players-only
meeting to talk about, among other things, passion and fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the grip of a sudden free fall from the heights of their
nine-game winning streak, the Rockets longed for a return to their
lost winning ways.
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed to have worked to the letter Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets built a big second-half lead, lost it, then faded
badly down the stretch. But at the brink of a defeat, they
recovered neatly to beat the Timberwolves 95-90 at Target Center.
The good old days of March were finally back.
</P>
<P>
   With their first road victory against a winning team this
season, the Rockets even picked up a half-game on the Lakers to
move percentage points ahead for the fourth seed in the Western
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   But more than all that, they had a win they needed, having
invested far more emotion than in any of their four games since the
April 1 collapse in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been terrible to have it stolen from us after
everything we talked about at our meeting today, and everything
we've gone through the last week or so,'' Rockets forward Othella
Harrington said. ``To lose that way, today, it would have been bad,
really bad for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been, Tomjanovich said, ``devastating.'' Having
lost four of their past five games beginning with the crushing
defeat in Utah when they squandered a 15-point lead in the final
eight minutes, the Rockets recaptured the intensity that marked
their winning streak and built a 16-point second-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   They had run their offense as expertly as in the days when they
could not be beat. They had, as they had so often back then, found
the one hot hand at the 3-point line, getting 17 points they had to
have from Sam Mack off the bench. Scottie Pippen, though still
playing a limited role as a shooter, harassed Kevin Garnett into a
9-of-24 shooting night.
</P>
<P>
   The funk that had infected the Rockets since the April Fool's
Day collapse _ save the rout of the Warriors _ seemed to have been
fully lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw passion and fire in the guys today,'' Tomjanovich said
as if that in itself was a victory. ``I mentioned two games, San
Antonio and Seattle, as far as coming out when it's an important
game playing with fire and passion. That first quarter set the
tone. We had a great second quarter. And held them off to 10 (going
into) the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   But with that, the Rockets suddenly lost their edge. The
Timberwolves found their shooting touch in the final minutes of the
third quarter, making five of six shots to end the quarter with a
10-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   After Charles Barkley posted up to push the Rockets' lead to 12
to start the quarter, the Timberwolves scored the next seven
points, and the lead that had been 16 less than five minutes
earlier was down to five. Barkley hit a pair of free throws and
Hakeem Olajuwon a hook in the lane for a nine-point lead, but
suddenly the Rockets' offense collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said, however, that the Rockets' control was taken from
them, and not by the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officiating was terrible tonight,'' Barkley said. ``We had
two blind mice. They let them get in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have seven players on the court at all times tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   A prime example might have been a fast-break layup Barkley
missed when James Robinson seemed to be intentionally fouling him.
Bryce Drew followed the miss to push the Rockets' lead to 10 one
last time, but the Timberwolves immediately cut the lead back to
six, Robinson making two free throws and Joe Smith a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen blocked a Garnett shot, his second rejection of Garnet,
and Mack went down for what seemed a momentum grabbing layup. But
three consecutive Rockets turnovers quickly sapped any momentum
they had taken. Smith hit two free throws and a 22-footer to move
the Timberwolves within four, 87-83, with 2:53 left.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to inspire the Rockets to repeatedly go inside
to Olajuwon and Barkley. But they combined to miss three straight
shots, and Pippen threw away a pass to Olajuwon in the post.
Garnett pulled the Timberwolves within two with a finger roll with
1:58 left as part of a 10-2 Minnesota run.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was called for charging Smith, and Robinson had an
18-footer for a tie.
</P>
<P>
   But when it missed, Barkley grabbed the long rebound, drove the
ball upcourt and found Mack in the corner for a 3 and a five-point
lead with 1:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just let the play develop,'' Barkley said of his sudden role
as point-power forward. ``I though Sam would go to the basket, but
I saw him out there at the 3-point line.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Rockets made just enough free throws to hold off
the Timberwolves and believe their lost touch from March
recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with a sense of urgency,'' Pippen said. ``We have to
come out and be the aggressor and not get back on our heels. We
played hard-nosed defense, we stopped them from second-shot
opportunities. That was the difference in the game. We had to come
out and show some dominance. We've been down the past couple weeks.
It's times we get it back.''

GOING DEEP: QUARTERBACK DEPTH IN NFL DRAFT BEST IN YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tim Couch. Akili Smith. Daunte Culpepper. Donovan
McNabb. Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the Class of '99, because these those five
quarterbacks definitely are the creame de la creame of what is the
deepest position in this year's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Each is expected to be selected in the first round Saturday,
with either Kentucky's Couch or Oregon's Smith being the top pick
overall by the expansion Cleveland Browns, and there is a distinct
possibility that quarterbacks could be selected in the top three
spots for the first time since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to determine exactly who goes where and when is like
taking orders from a group of kids in an ice cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to flavor. Which flavor do you prefer?'' said
Randy Mueller, Seahawks vice president of football operations.
``Each of these guys has strengths and very few weaknesses, but
what's the flavor you like best?''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, depends on whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   While one scout gushes about Smith's arm strength, another is
awed by Couch's poise. While one general manager views McNabb's
scrambling ability as a definite plus, another wrinkles his nose at
the thought of the Syracuse quarterback running for his life from
phantom pressure. While one offensive coordinator looks at UCLA's
McNown and sees the next Steve Young, another sees a short passer
with a side-arm delivery. While one personnel director is enamored
with the size of Central Florida's Culpepper, another wonders how
big is too big to play the position in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Modrack, director of football operations for the
Philadelphia Eagles, puts it, ``These quarterbacks are so close
together, you could just throw their names into a magic hat, pull
one out and you'd get a good football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Each is drawing so much attention because so many teams are in
the market for a quarterback, and some are downright desperate _
the Browns, Eagles and Cincinnati Bengals, who have the first three
picks; as well as the Chicago Bears and Tampa Bay Buccaneers; and,
to a lesser degree, the Seahawks, Miami Dolphins and Baltimore
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``League-wide, there is a need for quarterbacks,'' said Pat
Mondock, Seahawks college scouting director. ``And this is
definitely a good group.''
</P>
<P>
   The best ever? That's going a little too far. This year's group
has numbers _ with Couch and Smith being followed closely by
Culpepper and McNabb and McNown sitting somewhere between the big
four and a second group that includes Tulane's Shaun King, Ohio
State's Joe Germaine, Miami's Scott Covington, Howard's Ted White
and Washington's Brock Huard.
</P>
<P>
   Each has put up impressive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But to say Couch, Smith and company constitute a better group
than the 1983 class that started with John Elway as the first pick
overall and did not stop until Dan Marino was the sixth QB taken in
the first round is saying too much. Also included in that '83 class
were Jim Kelly, Tony Eason, Ken O'Brien and Todd Blackledge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Blackledge's meager contributions, these six have
combined for 11 Super Bowl appearances, 24 Pro Bowl selections and
105 miles in passing yardage _ led by the future Hall of Fame trio
of Elway, Marino and Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say anyone in this group is going to be Dan Marino or John
Elway or Jim Kelly, no. No chance,'' Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   OK then, the best class since that class of '83?
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, they all have above-average arms, above-average
athletic ability, great delivers, quick releases,'' Mueller said.
``As a group, they're as good as any group in the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch, Smith and Culpepper put up numbers last season comparable
to those of Elway, Marino and Kelly in their final seasons at
Stanford, Pitt and Miami. But those QBs from '83 have, or had,
special qualities that can't be measured in yards or completion
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing to evaluate about quarterbacks is what makes
them tick,'' Mueller said. ``That's what you don't know about this
year's group. That's what you won't find out about this group until
they've played at this level for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the uniqueness of what happened 16 years ago, a
total of six quarterbacks were selected in the first round of the
next five drafts combined.
</P>
<P>
   Also consider that in the 29 drafts since the NFL-AFL merger in
1970, two quarterbacks or more have been drafted in the first round
only four times and a QB has been the first pick overall only eight
times _ including 1971, when Jim Plunkett, Archie Manning and Dan
Pastorini went 1-2-3; 1993, when Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer went
1-2; and last year, when Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf were the top
two picks.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for this.
</P>
<P>
   It can risky to use a high pick on a quarterback, especially for
teams reaching to fill a need. For every Elway, there has been a
Dan McGwire. For every Terry Bradshaw, an Art Schlichter.
</P>
<P>
   A safer route is to opt for what looks like a sure thing. This
year, that would be the best player in the draft, Texas running
back and Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams; or the best athlete
available, Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey; or the rare commodity,
a tall, athletic corner in Arizona's Chris McAlister or a big-play
inside linebacker in USC's Chris Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks often push their way ahead of more secure picks
because of the position, which only makes this year's group that
much more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   All have touch, not to mention arm strength, mobility and
impressive athletic ability. But each also brings his own unique
touch to the table.
</P>
<P>
   Couch is the bumpkin, born in a one-stoplight town of 350 people
in the hill country of Kentucky, who blossomed into a
football-flinging gentleman the past three seasons for the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the former minor-league baseball player, who returned
to football only after flailing at curveballs during a three-year
stint as an outfielder in the Pittsburgh Pirates farm system.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper was born in a prison, where his mother was serving a
term for armed robbery. He was raised by his grandmother, who also
had 14 adopted children.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb is a physical specimen who stands out even in this
impressive group, a gifted athlete who benches 380 pounds, has a
vertical leap of 36 inches and runs 40 yards in 4.45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   McNown is the Doug Flutie of his generation, a plucky passer who
somehow gets the job done, and then some, despite not being the
biggest athlete on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the almost-overlooked fact that three of the top
five are black. When Smith, Culpepper and McNabb are grabbed up in
the first dozen picks or so, it will match the total of black QBs
taken in the first round in the entire history of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being black doesn't matter,'' Culpepper said at the NFL
scouting combine of joining an elite group that includes Doug
Williams (1978), Andre Ware (1990) and Steve McNair (1995).
``People know you can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Being good, and having the potential to be even better, does
matter.
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: Free agent WR Sean Dawkins is scheduled to fly to
Seattle Tuesday night and meet with coach Mike Holmgren Wednesday,
which is believed to be the final step in Dawkins signing with the
Seahawks. ... FB Reggie Brown, a restricted free agents who was a
third-round draft choice in 1996, has agreed to a two-year
contract.

EDITORIAL: SAVING NEW YORK'S SHIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 13:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. George Pataki of
New York have long had profound differences over how to run the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. At the moment, they have
an obligation to put those differences aside and conduct themselves
like allies for the sake of the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the need to hang onto the lucrative business
generated by two major ocean cargo carriers, Sea-Land Service and
Maersk, which Maryland and Baltimore are wooing.The two companies
have set today as the deadline for receiving the authority's new
lease arrangements. The carriers have asked for a refurbished
terminal in New Jersey offering better berths, cranes to service
huge cargo carriers, and deeper channels. While the governors have
been bickering, Maryland sweetened its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Unless New York and New Jersey devise a creative
counterproposal, the region could lose two anchors of its maritime
economy that provide more than 80,000 jobs in cargo, freight
handling, rail and other businesses in New Jersey and about the
same number of east-of-Hudson jobs in freight forwarding,
warehousing, trucking, banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has some legitimate gripes. The authority spends at least
$200 million from profitable operations like Newark, Kennedy and La
Guardia airports on subsidizing deficit operations like the PATH
trains and the Port Authority bus terminal, which mainly serves New
Jersey. Cross-subsidies are crucial to financing transit in both
states. But those for PATH and the terminal are too high.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki wants a pool of investment dollars for New York
comparable to the value of the Sea-Land/Maersk improvements in New
Jersey. He would also restructure the authority itself so that
revenue and income from facilities in each state would be invested
in that state. But talks on such issues should not disrupt the
urgent business _ the possible loss of major shipping contracts.

MASTERS? NOT AT AUGUSTA'S MEDIA DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Monday, I forgot my worries and the rainy weather
back home. I stopped and smelled the azaleas. I lived every
golfer's dream. I played Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   In a random draw of media members, 40 of us got an opportunity
to tee it up and hack it up. Masters, we were not.
</P>
<P>
   This was quite the round of golf. A sunny day, temperatures in
the high 70s, scores in the low 100s for many.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta was a bear, but not as grisly as I expected. The
fairways were generous, the rough manageable. The sand was like
fluffy snow. The fairways were mowed so closely that it was hard to
grab any blades to throw in the air to gauge the wind. The greens
were extremely difficult, but putts tracked to the hole if you
started them on line.
</P>
<P>
   I arrived around 7:30 a.m. for my 8:15 tee time, already knowing
the driving range and practice area were off-limits to us
non-member, non-green-jacket-wearin' media types.
</P>
<P>
   We were required to have caddies. When I checked in with the
caddie master, I asked him if I could have a funny caddie, a guy
with a sense of humor who could ease my apprehension on these
hallowed grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses!' he barked, and Moses appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Moses was a 49-year-old from Nigeria who has been in Augusta
since 1978. He once caddied for two-time U.S. Open champion Andy
North. Today, he would caddy for a 12-handicapper with a reverse
pivot problem and a horrendous short game.
</P>
<P>
   When it was my turn to step up to the tee, I wondered if anyone
had ever used an X-out Ultra at Augusta. Today, somebody would. And
I still had that ball when I walked off the course.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the round was getting a feel for what the
professionals faced during the final round. The wind was blowing
and swirling. The pins were in the same difficult Sunday positions.
</P>
<P>
   I am sorry to report that I did not bring Augusta to its knees
or even its calves. I did not have a single birdie. But I did not
have a triple bogey either. The highest score on my card was a 6,
and Tiger Woods and David Duval could not say as much after their
battles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the best player in this group,'' Moses told me, which
frankly was like telling Cheez Whiz it's slightly better than
Velveeta.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight: a par from the back tees at the 455-yard 11th
hole after my 3-iron approach hit a cart to the right of the green
and scattered its occupants. I decided to use a putter from 150
feet on my next shot and knocked it within 10 feet. I sank that
putt for par and hugged Moses.
</P>
<P>
   The lowlight: A double bogey coming in at 17 when I started
thinking about a par-par finish to break 85, causing the inevitable
choke, resulting in a chunked 5-iron and sand wedge that airmailed
the green and nearly came to rest on the 18th tee.
</P>
<P>
   The best hole for everyone was the 155-yard 12th, the par-3 with
the postage-stamp green in a picturesque setting. Groups backed up
there, everyone stopping to snap photos when they weren't dumping
balls into Rae's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I totaled it up: 87 strokes, 44 on the front, 43 on
the back, 30 putts, seven pars and one memorable experience.

DISNEY INTERNET SPINOFF RUMORED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rumors emerged Monday that The Walt Disney Co.
will take advantage of Internet mania and convert its Web holdings
into a separate publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Infoseek, the entertainment giant's Web partner, had
no comment on a Wall Street Journal report that the companies are
exploring the spinoff of an Internet company. But Wall Street
reacted enthusiastically, pushing Disney shares up 93.75 cents to
$35.4375 -- its highest close in nearly a month -- while Infoseek
soared $9.75, or 12 percent, to $87.125.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Sunnyvale-based Infoseek launched the Go Network
portal site in January as a way of luring customers and advertisers
through an easy-to-find ``hub'' for entering the Internet. Disney
bought 43 percent of Infoseek in June for $70 million and $165
million in promotional support when the stock was trading in the
$30 range, but it cannot expand the stake until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors may reflect investor impatience with Disney's stock,
which is 14 percent below May's all-time high. Disney stock rose
slightly after launching Go.com, but Web operations of
conglomerates have generally received lower valuations than
stand-alone Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Anya Sacharow, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said an
Internet spinoff by Disney would not be a surprise in light of
similar moves planned by Time Warner Inc., CBS Corp. and Barnes &AMP;
Noble. ``I would view it as an aggressive way to consolidate and
grow the business,'' she said. ``With Disney's incredible marketing
power, Go will definitely continue to be one of the major sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Butt Jr., a Forrester Corp. analyst, said he was somewhat
skeptical about the report, despite the attraction of soaring
prices on Wall Street for Web properties. He cited Disney's and
Chairman Michael Eisner's reputations for keeping tight control
over assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Splitting it off seems to go against the Disney grain, so
doing it would mean the potential valuation would have to far
outweigh everything else,'' he said. ``If we were talking about
Rupert Murdoch, it would happen in a minute.''

CELTICS BEAT CAVALIERS 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-CELTICS-CAVALIERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their injured list is growing by the day, as their season is
winding down. Undermanned and with payback as the only incentive,
the Celtics Monday night delivered an offensive treat to a crowd
featuring Red Auerbach, Paul Gaston, and a lot of people who looked
like yellow seats.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 103-89 snuffing of the Cleveland Cavaliers, a
team that had a lot more on the line but played like Vancouver
East. The Celtics shot 52 percent (their second straight game over
50), got a magnificent effort from Dana Barros (23 points, 13
assists, 4 steals, 48 minutes), and never trailed in exacting
revenge for one of their more dreadful thumpings of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino basically went with seven players, as Kenny Anderson
(hamstring) and Walter McCarty (groin) were hors de combat. The
only non-center who saw any time off the bench was Greg Minor.
Antoine Walker played 47 minutes and Ron Mercer went 46 _ and this
was a day after they played the Bulls. The Cavaliers didn't play
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No one, least of all the players, seemed to mind. The Celtics
led by at least 16 in every quarter in registering their second
wire-to-wire win of the season before 15,622, the smallest crowd
since Pitino came to town. The other wire-to-wire victory was
against Orlando Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in a while that we've gotten off to a
big lead and kept it,'' said Walker, who had 21 points, 8 rebounds,
and 6 assists. ``We played very unselfish basketball. We got a good
contribution from everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This one was almost like a relay. The Celtics turned to ex-Cav
Vitaly Potapenko to get them out of the blocks _ and did he ever.
He was a steamroller in the first six-plus minutes, scoring 13
points and snaring five rebounds as Boston built a 15-point lead.
Pitino then took him out for a rest and Cleveland got back into the
game. The coach said later he thought Potapenko looked tired and
that he likes taking players out when they are ``on a high.'' You
figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing for us was the way we lost that game in
Cleveland,'' said Potapenko, referring to the 113-86 atrocity on
March 23 during the team's crisis du coeur. ``We played horrible.
It was ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led by 9 after one and by 8 at the half. Then, it
was Mercer's turn. He had gotten off to a slow start _ 0 for 4 and
2 for 10 _ before catching fire in the second half (8 of 11). He
had 14 in the third quarter as the Celtics, as was the case in the
first two periods, blew the lead out and then let the Cavs get a
sniff. Your mother would have called it teasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played really hard,'' said ex-Celt Andrew DeClercq. ``We
didn't even show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Shawn Kemp, who led Cleveland with 23, all in the first
three quarters, ``The game had a lot of meaning, but we didn't play
like there was.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Cleveland this was the proverbial 4-pointer, as they
like to say in Saskatoon, Yellowknife, and Medicine Hat. The Cavs
are in the thick of the playoff fight in the East and need every
win. In addition, they own Boston's first-round pick, so every
Celtic loss gets them closer to Wally Szczerbiak or whomever they
have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   They needed more than Wally World Monday night. The Celtics led
by 13 after three, but everyone expected a final damn-the-torpedoes
assault from Cleveland. It came, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs got within 87-79 with 6:50 to play. Mercer then popped
out, took a Barros pass, and drained a 20-footer. The Cavs couldn't
hit the rim in the following 24 seconds and that led to another
Mercer hoop. Then Barros picked Mitchell Butler's pocket and went
in for the layup. Cleveland called time, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was back to 14 and Cleveland was finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs are in a three-in-three stretch for the second week in
a row, so that may have led to their early surrender. But that
doesn't account for their game-long indifference to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a game that was very meaningful to us, I didn't see what I
wanted,'' coach Mike Fratello said. ``It wasn't the kind of effort
I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly what Pitino has been looking for _ and finally
got.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ All of the many people who've rallied around cancer
survivor Cameron Schmidt _ his family, his friends, his classmates,
thousands of strangers _ are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They were outraged that Schmidt wasn't yet being allowed to walk
across the stage during graduation ceremonies at Mountain Ridge
High School in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   They were incensed that a young man who fought through
chemotherapy and radiation, and still managed to wind up only three
credits short of a diploma, isn't permitted to celebrate with his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   They were infuriated with the bureaucrats of the Deer Valley
Unified School District who won't allow Cameron to participate in
commencement, particularly since he's not asking for a diploma,
just the chance to walk across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   They jammed meetings and staged demonstrations and filled
district phone lines and spewed from talk radio like a spigot
turned up fully to furious.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers joined in. And radio commentators. And television
stations. They were wrong, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one way to describe a brave, determined 18-year-old
who's being discriminated against by idiot pencil-pushers:
</P>
<P>
   Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one word to characterize the parents of a young man
who beat back death only to be knocked down again by two-bit
despots:
</P>
<P>
   Blessed.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one adjective to use for the family, friends and
caring strangers who've watched as a kid who once suffered cancer
is forced to suffer fools:
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate. &QL; 
BEST DAYS OF HIS LIFE &QL; 
These recent days filled with controversy, with uproar, with anger
bordering on frenzy, are the best days of Cameron Schmidt's life.
</P>
<P>
   I know this from experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, I became acquainted with a 17-year-old high school
student named Jon Fladhammer. He was funny. He was smart. He had
dreams of becoming an actor or a lawyer or a politician.
</P>
<P>
   He also had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When I met him, he had only a few months to live and he knew it.
He'd already lost a leg to the disease. He never lost his sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   He never made it to graduation. He never got to appear on NBC's
``Today Show,'' as Schmidt is scheduled to do this morning.
</P>
<P>
   He never got to experience the beautiful, unrestrained luxury of
worrying about something as petty as a commencement ceremony. And
neither did his family.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've met too many others living the same
horror. &QL; 
``THINK OF OTHERS' LOSSES''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, and every state, are families who'll look with
envy at the graduation problems facing Cameron Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the mothers and fathers whose children didn't win their
battles with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the parents of kids from Gilbert, Glendale, Scottsdale
and Mesa who lost sons and daughters Cameron's age to automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Or of the friends and family of the two Apollo High School
students, also Schmidt's age, shot to death while walking to a
pizza party.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Schmidts themselves, less than a year ago worrying
if Cameron would live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he is, on TV, looking young and strong the way a kid
his age is supposed to look.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the knuckleheads at the school district have decided
to let Schmidt take part in commencement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   It's the right thing to do, and it'll make all the people who
raised hell in support of young Cameron feel good about themselves,
as they should.
</P>
<P>
   But as victories go, it's way down on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it doesn't matter at all if Cameron Schmidt walks
across a stage during graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, the glorious thing, the thing worth
celebrating and the only thing that really matters is that, like
other normal HEALTHY kids his age, he walks. &QL;

CANCER SURVIVOR'S GRADUATION WALK EXPECTED TO WIN OK; PALS

   PHOENIX _ ``Schmidt walks.''
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten slogan that catapulted Mountain Ridge High
School senior Cameron Schmidt to national celebrity may become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   As Schmidt was en route to a ``Today'' show taping in New York
on Monday afternoon, Deer Valley Unified School District officials
said that the board is expected to vote tonight to allow the
teenage cancer survivor to walk with his class at commencement May
20.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Gerald Cuendet said board members, who were in
San Francisco attending a national conference over the weekend,
individually told him that they would make an exception to district
policy to let Schmidt participate in graduation, even though he's
three credits short of the 22-credit requirement.
</P>
<P>
   District policy says students must earn the credits required for
graduation to participate in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Susan Burke and Richard Eng said previously that
they support letting Schmidt walk because of his circumstances.
Board members Ted Carpenter, Joan Bennett and David Cantelme could
not be reached for comment Monday. It will only take three votes to
allow the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Cuendet said the board will vote on Schmidt's petition at a
meeting at 7 tonight ( april 13 ) rather than April 27, as
previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of my son,'' Sandi Schmidt said after a Deer
Valley official called to tell her the board plans to let the teen
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He first fought for the hardest thing, his life. Now, his
fight to walk with his class will hopefully help other students in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' show researcher Michele Leone also said she was
notified Monday by district spokeswoman Kim Sharp about the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is scheduled to appear on ``Today'' at 8:15 this
morning. He appeared Monday on ``Inside Edition, '' ``Good Morning
America'' and `` Extra'', and many radio stations have called him
for interviews. A majority of the more than 300 readers who
telephoned or sent e-mail to ``The Arizona Republic''supported
Schmidt, though a small number of readers said the school district
should stick to its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was surprised by the attention his request received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' he said before boarding a plane with his
father and a friend, Melissa Robbins, to New York City for the TV
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, one of the leaders of the student protest, said she was
shocked by the response to Schmidt's fight.
</P>
<P>
   He deserves to walk with his classmates because ``he's the most
courageous person I know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, 18, who managed to keep a ``B'' average at the north
Glendale school, despite having a bone marrow transplant,
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, has promised to finish the
three credits in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, his father, Bill, pleaded with Deer Valley
governing board members on his son's behalf. But it wasn't until
Friday, when other teenagers joined the fight, that Schmidt's
plight captured national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schmidt walks'' was the rallying cry of about 800 Mountain
Ridge students who marched down 67th Avenue to show their support.
It was inscribed on T-shirts being worn by many students and
scrawled on car windows. It was circulated on fliers, in letters
and in e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Many classmates also vowed to boycott commencement. A local
radio station offered to host a graduation ceremony at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got ridiculous, it really did, but it's for a good cause,''
said senior Christopher Cheniae, 17. ``He's a measly three credits
short, and he's fought so hard. He deserves to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, students arriving at Mountain Ridge were
greeted by police cruisers. Glendale police spokesman Matt Brown
said the department sent 10 cars, each manned with two officers, to
patrol the campus after hearing there might be a repeat of Friday's
protest. The officers stayed for less than 30 minutes because only
about 10 youngsters showed up and the scene was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Sean and Tim Meredith, both Mountain Ridge juniors, were among
10 students picketing Monday across from the school, at 22800 N.
67th Ave. Holding ``Schmidt walks'' and ``Honk for Schmidt'' signs,
they vowed to be there every day until the board let Schmidt walk.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Sean Furlong, a friend of Schmidt's since junior high
school, was so certain his friend would not be allowed to walk with
the Class of 1999 that he called his relatives in New York and told
them to stay home. If Schmidt couldn't walk, neither would he.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was ready to call back with some good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Furlong said. ``I'm glad that I can be there
with him and share an important part of his life with him. That's
awesome they finally realized not letting him walk was a
mistake.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX _ All of the many people who've rallied around cancer
survivor Cameron Schmidt _ his family, his friends, his classmates,
thousands of strangers _ are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They were outraged that Schmidt wasn't yet being allowed to walk
across the stage during graduation ceremonies at Mountain Ridge
High School in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   They were incensed that a young man who fought through
chemotherapy and radiation, and still managed to wind up only three
credits short of a diploma, isn't permitted to celebrate with his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   They were infuriated with the bureaucrats of the Deer Valley
Unified School District who won't allow Cameron to participate in
commencement, particularly since he's not asking for a diploma,

NATO warplanes bombed two bridges Monday morning over the Juzna

bright red, white and blue engine, was on the bridge, and the

in cooperation with the PBS program Frontline, has found him to be
less a commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them.
Enemies and supporters alike say he may not be as globally powerful

the natural flow of water that once stretched in a continuous sheet
from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Now, in the nation's most
ambitious attempt at ecological restoration, the Federal and state
governments are about to try to put things right. The idea is to
spend some $8 billion over the next 20 years to re-plumb the
Everglades' water system so that natural conditions can be

years, however, a surge of scientific interest in the mechanisms of
human taste and olfaction has focused new attention on the ways in
which these senses can become disordered, and phantom sensations
are receiving greater scrutiny. A study of 100 cases of taste

   SCI-STAR-TAIL Astronomers at the University of California at

spiral pattern of the dust streaming 18 billion miles out from the
star Wolf-Rayet 104. The star is one of a class of extremely hot,
massive stars many times larger than the Sun. The astronomers
hypothesize that the tail was produced by two stars, which are
engaged in a courtly dance around each other. These orbital motions
make the stars behave like a lawn sprinkler. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-MOLECULES-CANCER (Undated) _ The sophisticated techniques of
a burgeoning field called molecular pathology are suggesting that
cancer comes in countless variations, each with a genetically

STUDIES SAY BEER, PIZZA MAY SLICE HEALTH RISK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's good news for the scores of Americans who
love beer, pizza and pasta drenched in tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Now some doctors say such foods are not only good _ they're good
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate medical stories released Monday found that beer and
wine can ward off ulcers, and that cooked tomatoes can fight
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For 60-year-old Richard Von Zup, the studies made lunch Monday
all that much more enjoyable, as he dug into a plate of fettucine
with mushroom and tomato sauce at a Los Angeles restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a regular tomato eater,'' said Von Zup, who owns a vitamin
manufacturing company. ``I'll eat a few more now knowing that it
will do me some good.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also will feel better about popping open a beer for a
baseball game or sipping a good claret at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in
Philadelphia, researchers announced they have found direct evidence
that a nutrient in tomatoes, called lycopene, can cause prostate
cancer tumors to become ``less aggressive'' and even shrink.
</P>
<P>
   In another study released Monday and published in the journal
Epidemiology, German doctors say new evidence suggests that
drinking a glass or two of beer or wine per day staves off an
ulcer-causing bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   But before college fraternity and city league softball team
members rejoice at the local pizza parlor, they should take heed:
Even the doctors who researched the studies are skeptical that
stuffing your face with tomato products and washing it down with
alcohol is the path to better health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be that easy,'' said Dr. Omer Kucuk, a researcher
on the tomato study at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit who
observed the effects of lycopene among 33 prostate cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Kucuk and his colleagues administered two 15-milligram capsules
of lycopene extract per day _ which is equal to between two and six
pounds of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that would equate to in terms of tomato
sauce or spaghetti or pizza,'' Kucuk said. ``It may not be feasible
in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the research indicates that eating pizza sauce or other
cooked tomato foods, he said, might be even better than taking
tomatoes off the vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lycopene is better absorbed in the gut if it's in cooked
or processed tomatoes, compared to, say, eating fresh tomatoes,''
Kucuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Lycopene has been a popular nutritional supplement for years and
is sold in capsule form without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Kucuk said while his study is the first to offer direct evidence
of the benefits of tomatoes in fighting prostate cancer,
population-based data from the 1990s already had pointed to the
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 Americans contract prostate cancer every year.
Kucuk said there is about a 75 percent survival rate.
</P>
<P>
   For the beer and wine study, German doctors led by Hermann
Brenner from the University of Ulm observed 1,785 men and women 18
to 88, using a breath test to find smaller amounts of (ITAL)
Helicobacter pylori(END ITAL) in the stomachs of beer drinkers,
with even better results for those who indulge in wine.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest that alcohol consumption ``may reduce the
odds'' of (ITAL) H. pylori (END ITAL) infection, Brenner said in
the study.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Bennett Roth, a digestive disease specialist with the
University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, said it would
be wrong to suggest that people combat gastrointestinal diseases by
drinking liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the literature has suggested that large amounts of
beer and wine can damage the stomach lining,'' Roth said. ``There's
no scientific literature that I'm aware of that shows it to be
beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Germans are right, the positive health
effects derived from beer and wine have extended beyond the
stomach. Research has indicated that moderate alcohol consumption
can prevent heart disease and some forms of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   No need to convince Hollywood resident Kimberly Kyle, enjoying a
pasta lunch in Woodland Hills. ``I don't believe beer and wine in
moderation is bad. That convinced me.''

DODGERS ARE KNOCKED OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A week after the Arizona Diamondbacks were ruffled by
Chan Ho Park throwing a pitch behind Matt Williams, they
retaliated.
</P>
<P>
   However, not how one might think the Diamondbacks would do it.
Instead, they did it old-school style. They did it by knocking the
ball out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee's grand slam was the highlight of a five-run third
inning as the Diamondbacks took out an opening-series-sweep worth
of frustrations on the Dodgers with a 12-6 win in their home opener
Monday night at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Lee added a sacrifice fly and tied a club record with a fifth
RBI in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just Park who had a miserable time of it. The
Dodgers bullpen was peppered for seven runs in three innings,
hurting itself with five bases on balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut Arizona's 5-0 lead to 5-4 on back-to-back RBI
singles by pinch-hitter Jose Vizcaino and Eric Young in the sixth,
but Onan Masaoka and Mel Rojas faltered in keeping the Diamondbacks
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The first nine pitches Masaoka threw were balls. Masaoka, who
hadn't yielded a hit in his first two appearances, allowed one hit
in two-thirds of an inning. But his three walks were disastrous.
They led to an RBI single by pinch-hitter Bernard Gilkey and Lee's
sacrifice fly to right as Arizona went ahead 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas was able to bail Masaoka out in the sixth but got into his
own jam in the seventh. Again, it began with a walk to leadoff man
Steve Finley. Four batters later, Damian Miller's bases-loaded
single scored two and Jay Bell capped another five-run inning with
a long three-run homer to left as Arizona went ahead 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's homer was the culmination of a pitcher in classic free
fall for four batters. It began with Park walking his counterpart,
pitcher Andy Benes, to lead off the inning. Tony Womack singled and
Bell walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Park seemingly was ready to take control of the situation when
he got ahead of Lee 1-2, but Arizona's second-year first baseman
lined the next pitch, a hanging curve, over the right-field fence
for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks increased their lead to 5-0 later in the inning
when Tony Batista stole home on the back end of a double steal,
though he could have crawled in from third. Dodgers catcher Todd
Hundley, who's yet to throw out a would-be basestealer this season,
tried to nail Luis Gonzalez at second, but the throw was short and
bounced into the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The five-run inning was payback for last Tuesday at Dodger
Stadium. Williams homered off Park early in the game, and after a
long foul ball, Park threw the next pitch behind Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Park said it was unintentional, but Williams and the
Diamondbacks believe it was done with intent. Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson rebuffs that notion.
</P>
<P>
   With the emotion and thought of retaliation eased for the moment
with Lee's grand slam, the Dodgers tried to cut into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: You know the Dodgers have a chance to score
when they don't have anybody on second or third base. Entering the
game, the Dodgers were 10 for 57 with runners in scoring position,
and they did little to improve that showing.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to advance Hundley after his leadoff double in the
second, Eric Karros continued with that thinking in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi led off with his seventh walk of the season (he
didn't reach that mark until May 15 last year) and after Hundley
lined out, Karros smashed a 1-0 Benes pitch deep over the
left-center field wall for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' second homer of the season pulled the Dodgers within
5-2. Karros also moved past Bill Russell and into fourth on the
Dodgers' all-time RBI list with 628.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers returned to their ways the next inning. Park led
off with a single and moved to second on a wild pitch. Young
walked, but Devon White, Gary Sheffield and Mondesi each failed in
their attempt to score the runner.

CANCER SURVIVOR'S GRADUATION WALK EXPECTED TO WIN OK; PALS
REJOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LORI BAKER AND JENNIFER BARRETT

<P>
   PHOENIX _ ``Schmidt walks.''
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten slogan that catapulted Mountain Ridge High
School senior Cameron Schmidt to national celebrity may become a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   As Schmidt was en route to a ``Today'' show taping in New York
on Monday afternoon, Deer Valley Unified School District officials
said that the board is expected to vote tonight to allow the
teenage cancer survivor to walk with his class at commencement May
20.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Gerald Cuendet said board members, who were in
San Francisco attending a national conference over the weekend,
individually told him that they would make an exception to district
policy to let Schmidt participate in graduation, even though he's
three credits short of the 22-credit requirement.
</P>
<P>
   District policy says students must earn the credits required for
graduation to participate in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Susan Burke and Richard Eng said previously that
they support letting Schmidt walk because of his circumstances.
Board members Ted Carpenter, Joan Bennett and David Cantelme could
not be reached for comment Monday. It will only take three votes to
allow the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Cuendet said the board will vote on Schmidt's petition at a
meeting at 7 tonight ( april 13 ) rather than April 27, as
previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of my son,'' Sandi Schmidt said after a Deer
Valley official called to tell her the board plans to let the teen
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He first fought for the hardest thing, his life. Now, his
fight to walk with his class will hopefully help other students in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' show researcher Michele Leone also said she was
notified Monday by district spokeswoman Kim Sharp about the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt is scheduled to appear on ``Today'' at 8:15 this
morning. He appeared Monday on ``Inside Edition, '' ``Good Morning
America'' and `` Extra'', and many radio stations have called him
for interviews. A majority of the more than 300 readers who
telephoned or sent e-mail to ``The Arizona Republic''supported
Schmidt, though a small number of readers said the school district
should stick to its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was surprised by the attention his request received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' he said before boarding a plane with his
father and a friend, Melissa Robbins, to New York City for the TV
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, one of the leaders of the student protest, said she was
shocked by the response to Schmidt's fight.
</P>
<P>
   He deserves to walk with his classmates because ``he's the most
courageous person I know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, 18, who managed to keep a ``B'' average at the north
Glendale school, despite having a bone marrow transplant,
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, has promised to finish the
three credits in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, his father, Bill, pleaded with Deer Valley
governing board members on his son's behalf. But it wasn't until
Friday, when other teenagers joined the fight, that Schmidt's
plight captured national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schmidt walks'' was the rallying cry of about 800 Mountain
Ridge students who marched down 67th Avenue to show their support.
It was inscribed on T-shirts being worn by many students and
scrawled on car windows. It was circulated on fliers, in letters
and in e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Many classmates also vowed to boycott commencement. A local
radio station offered to host a graduation ceremony at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got ridiculous, it really did, but it's for a good cause,''
said senior Christopher Cheniae, 17. ``He's a measly three credits
short, and he's fought so hard. He deserves to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, students arriving at Mountain Ridge were
greeted by police cruisers. Glendale police spokesman Matt Brown
said the department sent 10 cars, each manned with two officers, to
patrol the campus after hearing there might be a repeat of Friday's
protest. The officers stayed for less than 30 minutes because only
about 10 youngsters showed up and the scene was peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Sean and Tim Meredith, both Mountain Ridge juniors, were among
10 students picketing Monday across from the school, at 22800 N.
67th Ave. Holding ``Schmidt walks'' and ``Honk for Schmidt'' signs,
they vowed to be there every day until the board let Schmidt walk.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Sean Furlong, a friend of Schmidt's since junior high
school, was so certain his friend would not be allowed to walk with
the Class of 1999 that he called his relatives in New York and told
them to stay home. If Schmidt couldn't walk, neither would he.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he was ready to call back with some good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Furlong said. ``I'm glad that I can be there
with him and share an important part of his life with him. That's
awesome they finally realized not letting him walk was a
mistake.'' &QL;

SHOULD ORGANS HELP SICKEST OR STAY IN STATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There's no question in Dani Bonham's mind about
``what'' should be done with her organs after she dies. The
Chandler mother of six has been a card-carrying organ donor ever
since a stranger 12 years ago donated his liver and saved her
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   It's the question of ``where'' her organs and those of other
Arizona donors will go that's being fiercely debated.
</P>
<P>
   Should people on waiting lists in Arizona get first dibs on
them? Or should they go to sicker people in other states?
</P>
<P>
   And should the sickest people in Arizona be at the top of the
list for organs that become available in other states?
</P>
<P>
   A bill in the state Legislature would make sure those on Arizona
waiting lists continue to be first in line for organs donated in
the state. It has drawn fire from doctors, ethicists and transplant
patients who say it is just a ploy to protect Arizona transplant
centers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Under the bill, patients listed at Arizona transplant centers
would be matched first. If there were no matches in Arizona, then
the organ would go to other centers in Region 5 of the federal
transplant network, which includes California, Hawaii, Nevada, New
Mexico and Utah. If it isn't matched regionally, then it is matched
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the current system works _ and many say it does a
disservice to people throughout the United States who need organ
transplants the most.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argues that the system, which has
more than 60 different areas working inside 11 regions, doesn't
work fairly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, liver transplant patients in New York City wait 600
days while those in New Jersey, just across the river but in a
different organ-procurement area, wait an average of 56 days,
according to a 1997 federal report. &QL; 
Not close enough &QL; 
Or consider Fort Worth and Dallas. The cities are only 30 miles
apart but because they are in different areas, they don't easily
share organs. If a heart becomes available in Fort Worth, it is
sent to Houston instead of Dallas because Houston is the same
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous. It's a violation of patients' rights, of
human rights,'' said Pam Silvestri, of the Southwest Transplant
Alliance. Texas is considering legislation similar to Arizona's.
But Silvestri's group, which procures organs in southeastern Texas,
has lobbied hard against it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is expected to revisit the controversial issue of organ
allocation this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona and Texas are two of seven states that have either
passed or considered laws as a response to federal efforts to get
organs to the most needy patients _ whether they are in the
neighborhood or across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In their successful attempt to get Congress to delay any changes
until October, the United Network of Organ Sharing argued that the
system needs more organs, not more federal interference.
</P>
<P>
   If the rules change, only larger transplant centers would
survive and most of Arizona's five transplant centers would suffer,
said Jack Cremin, president and chief executive officer of the
Donor Network of Arizona. The non-profit group coordinates organ
donations for the state. It is part of the United Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran some numbers. If in fact we had to do mandatory
sharing, there would be only one liver from an Arizona donor to
remain in Arizona and that would go to UMC (University Medical
Center in Tucson),'' Cremin said. The center does the most
transplants of any hospital in the state. &QL; 
More fairness &QL; 
Federal officials say Cremin and other members of the United
Network are wrong _ and that the federal government just wants more
equity. It's up to the United Network and its members to come up
with a system that is fairer, said Jon Nelson, director of the
office of special programs for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   But if more organs go to the sickest patients, then larger
hospitals, which tend to be the ones that treat those patients,
will end up doing the bulk of transplants. Under federal rules, a
transplant center must perform 12 transplants a year to receive
organs, Cremin said.
</P>
<P>
   He disputes charges that his group is just trying to protect
transplant centers.
</P>
<P>
   Cremin points to the liver donations as an example of how
Arizona already shares with other states. In 1998, 74 livers _ the
most scarce of transplantable organs and the first that would be
affected by any rule changes _ were donated in Arizona.
Twenty-seven went to people waiting on Arizona transplant lists and
the rest went to people in other states.
</P>
<P>
   But frequently, Arizona is on the receiving end of the organ
chain. In 1997, for example, a third of the hearts were imported
from other states, said Dr. Belton Meyer, the former medical
director of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. Meyer,
an ethicist, was a former committee member of Donor Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The measure being pushed in the state Legislature is not
necessarily in favor of Arizonans: It's in favor of Arizona
transplant centers, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Beyda, director of pediatric critical care and an
ethicist at Phoenix Children's Hospital, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a transplant center and it needs local support,'' he
said. ``You need organs to come into the transplant center, it ends
up becoming a business. This is not a big philosophical issue.
Organs are being made a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about money, and we need to look beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   People should think about the ethics behind the economics, says
Beyda. &QL; 
Tough questions &QL; 
Say you were an organ donor and you have a family member who is a
patient in Pittsburgh with 24 hours to live. Should your kidney be
shipped to that patient, or should it go to someone on an Arizona
waiting list who is out playing golf?
</P>
<P>
   Beyda, Meyer and other ethicists across the country argue that
allocating organs by ZIP code rather than by need is ``ethically
indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are more transplant programs opening up. This
summer, Mayo Clinic Hospital and Good Samaritan Regional Medical
Center will open liver transplant programs. Good Samaritan had a
program two years ago but closed it because of lack of staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Both Samaritan and Mayo are neutral on the bill pending in the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Valley patient groups such as the Arizona chapter of the
American Liver Foundation and the National Kidney Foundation also
said they are remaining neutral because their national groups
haven't weighed in.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual patient advocates have made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Cullison, executive director of the Arizona Liver
Foundation, said she backs the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel the need to rock the boat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But another, Dale Ester, former president of the Arizona
Association of Kidney Patients, said inequities hurt people no
matter what state they live in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill came up too fast and it leaves patients wondering
what is going on out there. The message I got (from the
Legislature) was that they were not going to listen anymore. They
had made up their minds,'' said Ester, who had been on the federal
committee that wrote the 1997 report.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Sue Grace, chairwoman of the health committee and the
bill's sponsor, said she is pushing it because it protects
Arizonans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a donor state now,'' Grace said. ``There are states
that aren't doing as much as our organizations. It seems that we
are penalizing the state for doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Donor Network of Arizona doesn't keep a register of organ
donors. But according to federal statistics, Arizona's rate of
donors per million was 19.6 from 1994 to 1995. It ranks 45th among
the country's 66 organ procurement groups.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said she doesn't understand why this issue has drawn so
much ethical fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, however, predicts the Arizona Legislature will spark
other states to take similar defensive moves.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of curtailing the sharing of organs, the Legislature
should be more concerned with increasing donations, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some suggestions that more families of donors
would approve the donation if they knew where the organs were
headed, said Glenna Shapiro, director of the Arizona Kidney
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the loved one would like them to go to a Baptist in a
certain age group,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said she recently led a focus group of potential organ
donors that demonstrated their diversity. One person in the group
wanted his organs to go to a young person with a full life ahead;
another person in the circle said, ``No, I want them to go to a
middle-age person because I don't know long they (the organs) could
last.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonham, the Chandler mother convinced of the value of donation,
is just as divided as the people in Shapiro's focus group. She's
not enthusiastic about more federal involvement, but she strongly
believes the sickest should get them the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, as for my organs,'' Bonham said, ``they can pack them up
in the Igloo and send them to whoever needs them the most.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX _ All of the many people who've rallied around cancer
survivor Cameron Schmidt _ his family, his friends, his classmates,
thousands of strangers _ are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They were outraged that Schmidt wasn't yet being allowed to walk
across the stage during graduation ceremonies at Mountain Ridge
High School in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   They were incensed that a young man who fought through
chemotherapy and radiation, and still managed to wind up only three
credits short of a diploma, isn't permitted to celebrate with his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   They were infuriated with the bureaucrats of the Deer Valley
Unified School District who won't allow Cameron to participate in
commencement, particularly since he's not asking for a diploma,
just the chance to walk across the stage.
</P>
<P>
   They jammed meetings and staged demonstrations and filled
district phone lines and spewed from talk radio like a spigot
turned up fully to furious.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers joined in. And radio commentators. And television
stations. They were wrong, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one way to describe a brave, determined 18-year-old
who's being discriminated against by idiot pencil-pushers:
</P>
<P>
   Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one word to characterize the parents of a young man
who beat back death only to be knocked down again by two-bit
despots:
</P>
<P>
   Blessed.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one adjective to use for the family, friends and
caring strangers who've watched as a kid who once suffered cancer
is forced to suffer fools:
</P>
<P>
   Fortunate. &QL; 
BEST DAYS OF HIS LIFE &QL; 
These recent days filled with controversy, with uproar, with anger
bordering on frenzy, are the best days of Cameron Schmidt's life.
</P>
<P>
   I know this from experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, I became acquainted with a 17-year-old high school
student named Jon Fladhammer. He was funny. He was smart. He had
dreams of becoming an actor or a lawyer or a politician.
</P>
<P>
   He also had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   When I met him, he had only a few months to live and he knew it.
He'd already lost a leg to the disease. He never lost his sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   He never made it to graduation. He never got to appear on NBC's
``Today Show,'' as Schmidt is scheduled to do this morning.
</P>
<P>
   He never got to experience the beautiful, unrestrained luxury of
worrying about something as petty as a commencement ceremony. And
neither did his family.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've met too many others living the same
horror. &QL; 
``THINK OF OTHERS' LOSSES''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, and every state, are families who'll look with
envy at the graduation problems facing Cameron Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the mothers and fathers whose children didn't win their
battles with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the parents of kids from Gilbert, Glendale, Scottsdale
and Mesa who lost sons and daughters Cameron's age to automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Or of the friends and family of the two Apollo High School
students, also Schmidt's age, shot to death while walking to a
pizza party.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Schmidts themselves, less than a year ago worrying
if Cameron would live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he is, on TV, looking young and strong the way a kid
his age is supposed to look.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the knuckleheads at the school district have decided
to let Schmidt take part in commencement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   It's the right thing to do, and it'll make all the people who
raised hell in support of young Cameron feel good about themselves,
as they should.
</P>
<P>
   But as victories go, it's way down on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, it doesn't matter at all if Cameron Schmidt walks
across a stage during graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, the glorious thing, the thing worth
celebrating and the only thing that really matters is that, like
other normal HEALTHY kids his age, he walks. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The big-media sites, such as ESPN.com, CBS SportsLine,
MSNBCSPORTS.com and ``The Sporting News,'' are standard with

contests, draft history and mock drafts. A few of the more
interesting sites are the homemade pages network resources such as
draft guides and general information in one handy index.
</P>
<P>
   For Jimmy Johnson-wannabes, here are a few recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT CENTRAL (nfldraft.espn.go.com): In this case, the official
word is the best word. ESPN.com and NFL.com have pooled their
resources for draft analysis and coverage that should satiate even
the most avid draftnik.

to allow draft junkies to analyze selections in real time and sort
selections by player, position, NFL or college team.
</P>
<P>

offers detailed analysis and exclusive content.
</P>
<P>
   MIGUEL'S COLLECTION OF 1999 NFL DRAFT LINKS
(w3.nai.net/(tilde)nepats/mydraftlinks.html): The name and address
might be cumbersome, but the research done by Miguel Benzan, a New
England Patriots fan from Hartford, Ct., is tough to match.
</P>
<P>
   Benzan has the standard links, but what sets his site apart is
his detailed review of each link's highlights. He rates the sites
that have general information, mock drafts, draft guides and mock
draft contests.
</P>
<P>
   BS SHEET (members.aol.com/bssheet): James Brylinski of Orchard
Park, N.Y., has put together an impressive collection of links to

HUSKEY TOUCHES OFF MARINER POWER DISPAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Butch Huskey couldn't identify the music that's
sometimes played when he walks to the plate at the Kingdome. When
told recently it was the University of Washington fight song _
Huskey ... Huskies, get it? _ the Mariners' new left fielder broke
into a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess they want people to like me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey had no help from the public-address system Monday night.
The song wasn't played, so he had to win over 24,650 fans himself.
</P>
<P>
   He did it with a run-scoring double and a two-run home run,
powering the M's to a 6-3 win over the Athletics. The Mariners got
their other runs on homers by their revamped double-play
combination: second baseman David Bell connected in the fifth and
shortstop Domingo Cedeno had a two-run shot in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey's was the most impressive. As a New York Met, he had a
knack for prodigious drives. Monday night's blast was his first
Mariner home run, and it sailed 419 feet, deep into the bleachers
in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you've hit a ball good when you don't feel the ball
coming off the bat,'' he said. ``I didn't feel it, I just heard it.
I knew I hit it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer broke a 2-all tie, and was followed two batters later
by Cedeno's blast, just his 13th in more than 1,100 career at-bats.
That was the last of a series of unusual plays in the sixth,
including a stolen base by Edgar Martinez and a pickoff throw to
nobody by Oakland's Jimmy Haynes. The pitcher didn't realize his
first baseman was playing off the bag, and Dan Wilson took two
bases.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most unexpected sight was Huskey corralling a
pop foul by Tony Phillips in the third. Huskey, a former Oklahoma
linebacker recruit listed at 6-foot-3, 244 pounds, sprinted across
the turf for the catch.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who saw Huskey far behind the pack in spring running
drills, it was an eye-catching feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a distance runner, but I can cover some ground in the
outfield,'' Huskey said. ``To be a good outfielder, you have to get
a good jump and you have to be able to run 50-60 feet in either
direction. I'm not going to run to the other foul pole to catch a
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In 15 at-bats, Huskey has seven hits. A career .211 hitter in
April, he's enjoying the controlled atmosphere of the Kingdome _
it's preferable, Huskey said, to ``freezing my tail off in
40-degree weather'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Mariner newcomers had a hand in the win. Rookie
right-hander Freddy Garcia improved to 2-0 with another strong
outing, working 62/3 innings and allowing three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Jose Mesa earned his second save in what was easily his
best outing this year. Mesa, who allowed four runs in one inning on
Saturday, had worked earlier in the day on making his motion more
fluid. His body had been going forward while his arm was going
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets it right, it looks so easy,'' Williams said.
``You wonder how he can throw so hard with such an easy delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa threw in the mid-90s, but his best pitch was a 78-mph
curveball that froze Jason McDonald for the second out of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that curve for a long time, but they took it away from
me in Cleveland,'' Mesa said. ``They wanted me to throw just the
fastball and slider. But now that I'm a little older, I can throw
it.''

 &HT;    In jail, two pieces of O'Hair puzzle
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin and Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On March 24, when Texas investigators knocked on
the door of seven-time felon Gary P. Karr, they already suspected
him as an accessory in the 1995 disappearance of atheist Madalyn
O'Hair and her family.
</P>
<P>
   Karr, it appears, didn't disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators had no warrants, yet an FBI agent later testified
that Karr invited them into his apartment in Novi, Mich., sat
voluntarily for 13 hours and admitted to concealing bodies, hiding
victims' property, acquiring vehicles and playing a key role in
transferring $600,000 to a San Antonio gold coin dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Karr stopped short of confessing to the killings of O'Hair, her
son, John Garth Murray, and the granddaughter she adopted as her
own daughter, Robin Murray- O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Even as investigators listened to Karr, their counterparts in
Austin questioned David Roland Waters, a former O'Hair employee
convicted of stealing $54,000 from American Atheists.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who shared a cell in an Illinois prison in the
mid-1980s, were arrested on weapons charges after federal agents
found pistols in Karr's residence and ammunition in Waters'. It is
illegal for felons to possess either.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three weeks later, both men remain in cells _ Karr in
Detroit, Waters in Austin. Although many questions remain
unanswered, the two arrests have brought to light a series of
events 3 1/2 years ago that authorities believe offer intriguing
clues about the fate of the missing O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' Austin attorney, Patrick Ganne, said he believes federal
authorities are playing them against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect they are waiting for one to break,'' Ganne said
Friday, insisting his client has nothing to tell authorities. ``I
think they thought he'd flip.''
</P>
<P>
   While Waters sat in jail, federal authorities, acting on
information from Karr, dug up portions of a 5,000-acre ranch in a
remote corner of the Hill Country west of San Antonio on Easter
weekend, and refused to say what, if anything, they found. A source
with knowledge of the investigation told the American-Statesman
they were looking for the bodies of the O'Hair family.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1995 disappearance of the O'Hair family, some friends
and authorities have speculated that the aging, ill atheist _ who
once described herself as the most hated woman in America _ sought
refuge overseas. Others, including her estranged son, Bill Murray,
suspected foul play.
</P>
<P>
   At the crux of that growing suspicion are the shared lives of
Waters, Karr and Danny Fry, a friend of Waters whose headless,
handless corpse was found near Dallas just three days after the
O'Hairs disappeared along with $500,000 in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, they left behind $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   To San Antonio jeweler Corey Ticknor, an order for $600,000 in
gold coins is unusual but not unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was O'Hair's son, Jon Garth Murray, who called him in
September of 1995 asking how to covert cash into gold coins. It
took two weeks to negotiate a price, work out the logistics and
make the exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Ticknor, Murray, O'Hair and Murray-O'Hair had left
their Austin home in late August as if in a panic. They left behind
their three dogs, breakfast dishes on the table and O'Hair's
prescription for her diabetes and heart disease. Over the next
month, they stayed in touch with employees at the Austin
headquarters of American Atheists by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 29, Murray, who had wired $600,000 to a bank in
northwest San Antonio from a New Jersey bank, met Ticknor in the
bank's conference room. Ticknor had the gold waiting in safety
deposit boxes. Only $500,000 of the coins had arrived, wrapped in
6-inch-by-6-inch-by-4-inch cardboard boxes. The rest was due in
three days.
</P>
<P>
   On a conference room table, Ticknor said he counted out the gold
as an off-duty police officer watched, then loaded it into larger
cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ticknor said Murray, who had come alone to the bank, appeared
calm as he wheeled out the 100 pounds of gold on a dolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer and I escorted him to the car and put it in the
trunk,'' Ticknor said.
</P>
<P>
   The car, Ticknor said, was a rented Lincoln Towncar, not
Murray's 1988 Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Murray promised to return for the rest of the gold in three
days.
</P>
<P>
   He never did.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ticknor nor the American Atheists heard from him again.
</P>
<P>
   As Ticknor puzzled over Murray's abrupt disappearance,
authorities about 270 miles to the north in Dallas were puzzling
over their own mystery. In what appeared to be an unrelated
homicide, a corpse with its head and hands cleanly severed was
found in Dallas County.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the body was unidentified, and the O'Hair
disappearance remained only a topic for cocktail chatter and
occasional news stories.
</P>
<P>
   When authorities in December 1998 finally identified the body as
Danny Fry, a Florida man and a friend of Waters, it shifted the
spotlight back to Texas, where Fry, Waters and Karr were together
at the time of the O'Hairs' disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, who at age 18 clubbed to death another teen-ager with
the fat end of a pool cue, found himself in the mid-1980s serving
time for another crime with Karr in Vienna Correctional Center in
Illinois. Karr, 50, who had a history of violent felonies from
armed robbery to kidnapping, was in the middle of a 30-year
sentence for the rape of a judge's 16-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, 52, was released from prison in 1987. In the early
1990s, Waters spent time in Naples, Fla., with Fry, and by 1994,
Waters was in Austin working as general office manager for American
Atheists.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, O'Hair, whose caustic personality often led to
disputes with employees, accused Waters of stealing $54,000 while
she was out of town. According to court records, Waters
impersonated Jon Garth Murray and forged his signature to embezzle
money.
</P>
<P>
   Ganne, who represented Waters, said his client was acting under
orders from the O'Hairs. Ganne said the O'Hairs promised Waters a
$15,000 cut to divert money from the atheist organization to them.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, just four months before the O'Hairs disappeared,
Waters pleaded guilty to theft. Ganne said Waters agreed to plead
guilty in exchange for 10 years probation, plus an order to repay
$15,000, rather than risk 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   About that same time, Karr was released from an Illinois prison.
Meanwhile, Fry was leaving Florida to join Waters in Austin. Fry's
family has always contended he said little about what he was doing
in Austin except that he expected to make a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ganne acknowledged that his client, Waters, spent
time with Fry and Karr in Texas in 1995, but, he argued, that
doesn't mean Waters killed anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pointing fingers with empty hands,'' Ganne said of
authorities. So far, authorities have filed no murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   When Karr let authorities into his apartment, they found two
pistols, a crime for a felon. When they executed a search warrant
at Waters' Austin apartment, they found 119 rounds of ammunition,
also a crime for a man on probation.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also seized a half-finished manuscript on Waters' theory
of the O'Hairs' disappearance. Waters has always contended the
O'Hairs orchestrated their disappearance. Ganne said Waters had
paid a ghost writer $2,500 to help write the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Other than weapons violations, Karr is charged with transporting
stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   At Karr's March 26 detention hearing in Detroit, an FBI agent
testified that Karr accompanied one of the O'Hair family members to
a New Jersey bank to wire $600,000 to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how does a seven-time felon, four months out of prison, find
himself flying to New Jersey with the son of America's most famous
atheist?
</P>
<P>
   And if Karr, under an assumed name, felt it necessary to
accompany Jon Garth Murray to the New Jersey bank, why did a
seemingly unnerved Murray show up alone to pick up the gold?
</P>
<P>
   Who, posing as Murray, sold his Mercedes to an unsuspecting San
Antonio resident for a price below the car's value?
</P>
<P>
   Ganne said authorities can only place Karr or Fry, not his
client Waters, on a plane with Murray or selling the Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators refuse to say what they believe happened.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Bill Murray, O'Hair's estranged son who is a born-again
Christian and evangelist, fears he knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wherever they are going to be _ whether that's in
heaven or hell,'' he said. ``Praying over them is not going to
change that.''

 &HT;    Suitcases end up scattered there and yonder
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Tony Bennett left his heart in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   I left my luggage in Orlando. And Atlanta. And points in
between.
</P>
<P>
   I've been on the road most of the past two weeks, attending
company meetings twice in Florida. Tough duty, I know. It's hard to
come back with a Florida tan and say with a straight face what a
long half-month it's been out of town.
</P>
<P>
   But God is a practical joker, and getting there and back, then
there and back again, was no picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling by air to Orlando during Spring Break should qualify
one for the loony bin. The plane was completely full, populated
primarily with young parents and their impatient children headed
for Disney World. I was not going to Disney World. By the time the
plane landed, the children wailed incessantly, and I was ready to
slug Mickey and mug Goofy.
</P>
<P>
   I have a pet peeve. Actually, I have several, being increasingly
curmudgeonly as time passes me by, but this one is relevant to our
conversation. My airline peeve is people who insist on trying to
carry all their luggage on board and stuff it in the overhead bins
rather than check it. The flight to Orlando was scheduled to last
two hours. One hour was spent loading people and unloading people.
At least 50 minutes of that hour was spent standing in the narrow
aisles as passengers attempted to stick suitcases the size of sides
of beef into the overhead compartments, just so they wouldn't have
to head down to baggage claim when the plane landed.
</P>
<P>
   This irritates me. It irritates the airlines too, which have
tried to crack down with little success. I am a good toad, checking
everything except my briefcase even if technically I could fit it
into the overhead bins. I feel morally superior and have been known
to exchange snide comments with other rule-obeyers as we watch some
poor lug try to wrestle his life's belongings out without beaning a
blue-haired lady sitting below.
</P>
<P>
   As Roberto Duran said when Sugar Ray Leonard whupped him in a
classic prize fight some years back, ``No mas.'' No more. If my
luggage is in the bin above me, one of two things are going to
happen. The luggage will depart the plane at the same time I do, or
the plane will crash, and it won't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode really wasn't the airline's fault. My golf
clubs got lost somewhere between the course and the hotel, and I
had to reluctantly leave without them. No big deal. The hotel
assured me they would find and ship them, and besides, they have
insurance. A week later, the clubs showed up on the big brown
truck.
</P>
<P>
   I returned home for two days and then flew to Palm Beach, Fla.
for another meeting. Again, the cattle car was full, the flight
attendants harried, and the plane late. On the trip home, I had to
fly to Atlanta and switch planes to get to Shreveport, La., with a
one-and-a-half-hour layover in Georgia. Plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderboomers hit Atlanta, and we sat on the runway in Palm
Beach for an hour. My window of opportunity was lessening. When we
hit Atlanta, aka the Airport From Hell, we spent another half hour
taxiing to the terminal. I had two minutes to spare before my next
flight. I made the flight, jubilant that I wasn't stuck in Atlanta
for the night, since this was the last flight to Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
   My luggage wasn't so lucky. And that's where stupidity came to
play. I had tossed my car keys in my small bag before I left
Shreveport four days earlier, intending to get them out before I
got back on the plane. I returned to Shreveport at 9 p.m. with no
luggage and no car keys, since I had checked the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The baggage clerk said there was an outside chance my luggage
would make it on a flight from Jackson, Miss., so I hung around the
airport until after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   No luck. I could tell he thought I was an idiot for putting my
keys in my luggage. I couldn't argue the point. The airline sprung
for a hotel room down the street and gave me a toiletry kit and a
voucher for a free breakfast. I spent the night in Shreveport,
resisting the temptation to go to a casino and play blackjack all
night long. Mainly, I was worried they wouldn't let me in, since by
then I had been in the same clothes for nearly 24 hours and smelled
a tad ripe.
</P>
<P>
   I was back in the airport at nine the next morning, awaiting the
red-eye from Atlanta. Funk artist Rick James got off the plane,
resplendent in a green silk outfit, accompanied by a lot of large
people wearing sunglasses and black clothes. He got into a waiting
limo while I sat in the corner fearful that my stinky clothes would
brand me as a vagrant. The cops kept eyeing me, and I just smiled
and tried to keep my eyes focused.
</P>
<P>
   My luggage showed up on the same flight with Rick James, along
with my car keys. I drove home with the window down, vowing to find
a set of collapsible golf clubs and a tiny suitcase before the next
trip.

 &HT;    Not lazy, just an aesthetic personality
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ According to my father, I was born lazy and
then had a relapse. I'm beginning to suspect his diagnosis was
right on.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, my energy seems to wax and wane depending upon the
task at hand. Movement just for the sake of movement not only
leaves me cold but makes me wonder why folks who still have their
wits about them want to abuse themselves so.
</P>
<P>
   In elementary school, a little running around made sense. I had
to hurry out to recess before ``Fat Nancy'' grabbed the best swing
or laid claim to the choicest patch of cinders for a killer game of
hopscotch. Heck, I even had to run all the way home from school
every day so that Arthur Cooper couldn't kiss me.
</P>
<P>
   It made sense to run three blocks to the ice cream store, but a
slow amble was the best I could muster for a trip around the corner
to my piano lesson. Once, when I got a ``U'' in penmanship, it took
all afternoon to drag myself two blocks home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Junior high school was tiring too. Most days I barely had enough
strength to paint my toenails much less memorize 41 prepositions.
Once, Mr. Paige, the mean old civics teacher, yelled at me for
scuffing down the hall. His exact words were: ``Are you too tired
to pick up your lazy feet?''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth grade, just as I was bordering on complete body
shutdown, a miracle happened. I discovered boys and it didn't take
long for me to figure out that the picks of the litter hung around
school every afternoon for track practice.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I was the fastest thing on feet, racing through the
neighborhood, jumping hedges and small children, even frightening
family pets, in my quest for speed and a slot on the girls track
team. My efforts paid off _ for a
</P>
<P>
   while anyway. I earned a place on the team and even snared
myself a boyfriend, but when the romance ended along with the track
season, inertia overtook me once again, bringing with it a torpor
my mother considered serious enough to treat with spoonfuls of
brown glop in a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   High school gym class did little to change my languid approach
to exercise. Learning to do a box step to Glenn Miller's
``Moonlight Serenade'' was okay, but when ``dipping'' gave way to
deep-knee bends, my body refused to make the transition. I tried
deck tennis for a week, but lost interest when I broke a
fingernail.
</P>
<P>
   Physical education was not an elective in our school, and any
excuse to escape its rigors, short of a full-body cast, fell on
deaf ears. Smitty, our barrel-shaped gym teacher, ran a tight ship.
Two blasts on her silver whistle
</P>
<P>
   meant one minute left to finish grippering our baggy-bottomed
gymsuits and line up on the practice field ready to sweat to the
beat of her bongo drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not sweating, you're not working,'' she'd bellow as
fifty or sixty of us fell into an indifferent, arm-flailing
rendition of a jumping jack. ``Up! Down! Three! Four!'' she'd
holler. My best friend Jeanne and I chanted along with our own
version: ``Up! Down! No more!'' We were determined to find a way
out.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Jeanne did. She came to school with a miracle in
her pocket _ a note from her family doctor asking that she be
excused from all physical exertion because she was afflicted with
an ``aesthetic personality.'' We thought that sounded totally
glamorous, even though neither of us knew what it meant. I went
home and asked my mother if I could be aesthetic too. She said she
doubted it.
</P>
<P>
   It's been over 40 years now since Jeanne's diagnosis, but I've
never forgotten those magic words _ ``aesthetic personality'' _ and
even though the context is wrong, they do come in handy every year
about this time. I use them to explain why I'm unable to get on
with my spring cleaning.

 &HT;    There is no end to David Crockett's story
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ My idea of good time is arguing with a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Please allow me to explain. Sometime back, my friend Bob
Perkins, the state district judge, and I had a friendly
disagreement about the veracity of Lt. Col. Jose Enrique de la
Pena's account of David Crockett's final hours. De la Pena claimed
to witness the surrender and subsequent execution of the legendary
frontier politician and adventurer. The account is contained in a
journal penned in 1838-39, while de la Pena was imprisoned on
political charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Crockett passage is brief , but one that propelled the book
into the spotlight that follows the gentleman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   What got the judge stirred up was a passing comment I made one
evening about how the journal rang true. Turns out the judge,
another history buff, has studied Crockett and doesn't believe the
Crockett he knows would surrender.
</P>
<P>
   So we argued. It was so much fun that a couple of months later,
we argued about it again. And the odds are good that we're going to
have at it yet again _ most likely right after Judge Perkins reads
this.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett had an extraordinary gift for self promotion and if he
is in a position to know that he is still making news 163 years
after his death, he is probably beyond tickled by it. He loved
attention.
</P>
<P>
   As we approach San Jacinto Day on April 21, Crockett is a most
appropriate example of a Texas history figure so enshrouded in myth
that it has become impossible to separate the individual from the
legend. He is also a great example of the void that exists in the
study and use of history.
</P>
<P>
   The real Crockett would wince at being called ``Davy'' and used
his gift as a raconteur extraordinaire to both display and mask a
rather broad sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   The Crockett most know, however, was created by Walt Disney and
John Wayne. The powerful images they created are the spark of the
controversy surrounding the de la Pena account of Crockett's death.
</P>
<P>
   It is a controversy that is likely to rage on for some time and
will be revived when Paul Hutton, a historian who is a familiar
face to watchers of the History Channel, finishes his biography of
Crockett to be released next year. Hutton, a professor at the
University of New Mexico, believes the de la Pena diary is
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Hutton is the bearer of bad news to the keepers of the
traditional Crockett flame. And he will be walking into a lion's
den to deliver it. Hutton is scheduled to speak Friday at the
Friends of the Texas Tech University Library/Southwest Collection
banquet in Lubbock _ not the best place in Texas to challenge a
legend. But then, there is no good place in Texas for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biography focuses on the historical authenticity of many
'scholarly' works because many authors have unknowingly combined
historical fact and fiction,'' Hutton wrote. ``As such, future
generations need to know that if the journal is true, as I believe
it is, Crockett was captured and subsequently executed at the
Alamo. That manner of death in no way diminishes Davy Crockett's
sacrifice, though it does contradict the image of Crockett as
popularized by Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hutton laments, Hollywood is where too many
people come by what little knowledge they have of history.
</P>
<P>
   Texans say they revere the Alamo and its gallant defenders, but
whatever they know from whatever source doesn't stick _ at least
according to one study.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, the Dallas Morning News sponsored a test on
Texas history. Of those responding, more than a third couldn't name
a single Alamo defender _ not even Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, more than half of the test takers were native
Texans, according to the Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   That should put a dent in our notions of Texas pride and maybe
stir some long-needed action. History is done a disservice by those
who think teaching it means making kids memorize dates. Dates are
important but their meanings are even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Education is the most popular topic of conversation around the
Capitol these days. People get excited about kids learning math and
science, but rarely does anyone talk about history. History
deserves a seat at any discussion about education and the future.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   People who don't know where they've been can't possibly know
where they are going.
</P>
<P>
   OK, judge, I'm ready.

 &HT;    One week in Peace Corps? Trust me, it's not enough
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``The life I might have lived,'' says
the headline in the newest issue of Marie Claire magazine. ``Ashley
Judd joins the Peace Corps.''
</P>
<P>
   For one week.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd, famous actress, jets down to South America and
spends one week in the rain forests of Suriname.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Peace Corps volunteer in Africa, I can say that one
week is hardly enough time to get a decent case of ``the trots''
(read: gastrointestinal troubles). Much less understand what you've
gotten yourself into.
</P>
<P>
   I read on. Turns out Ashley Judd, like many people, once thought
about joining the Peace Corps. She went into acting instead.
</P>
<P>
   But Marie Claire, noted for its stunts (in one story, guest
editor Susan Sarandon was the recipient of a lap dance; in other,
Gwyneth Paltrow spent a few days on a deserted island), decided to
give Judd a tiny glimpse of what she missed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are photos of Judd toting buckets of water, lying artfully
in a hammock, taking a squat in the woods. She describes how she
falls in love with a ``sexy little'' pail in a local marketplace.
The brightly-colored local clothing is ``Lilly Pulitzer
amplified,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   And the villages she breezed through must be, like, poverty
amplified?
</P>
<P>
   At least Marie Claire bent this story in the right direction.
The magazine let Judd write what she saw, and instead of telling us
where we can buy her cute little tank tops it published the Peace
Corps' phone number and web site address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done it when I was 22, joined the Peace Corps and
flourished, but maybe by telling you about my experience I have
done even greater good,'' Judd writes.
</P>
<P>
   She had her heart in the right place. But a week just doesn't
cut it.
</P>
<P>
   I invite Judd to join the Peace Corps for real. Here's a few
things she might see the next time around:
</P>
<P>
   _ A doctor cutting open a woman's circumcision scars _ without
the luxury of anesthesia _ so she can deliver her baby.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disabled men and women crawling through village streets with
flip-flops attached to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hungry people. Empty-stomach, four-to-a-plate hungry people.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to sound morbid. But sometimes the Peace Corps isn't
pretty _ no matter what you're wearing.

 &HT;    A town can stand out by anounting itself the capital of just
about anything
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paris is the city of lights. New York is
the city that never sleeps. San Francisco is the city by the bay.
Chicago has the Sears Tower, St. Louis has its arch.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you're a sleepy, one-stoplight town that's archless
and far from world-reknown? What if you're ... Okeechobee, Fla.?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you anoint yourself the Speckled Perch Capital of the
World and wear the title with pride. And you have an annual
speckled perch festival that attracts about 12,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter that state law says you can only catch, not eat,
the endangered speckled perch from Lake Okeechobee. Doesn't matter
that the main fish served at the speckled perch festival is the
ever-present catfish. What matters is that the speckled perch has
become an integral part of Okeechobee's identity and folks there
have been mighty proud of their title for going on 31 years now,
thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake itself is very vital to economy of Okeechobee
County,'' said Brenda O'Connor, the Okeechobee Chamber of Commerce
executive director. ``It's the largest festival we have all year
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming to be the world's capital of anything gives a place a
unique claim to fame at a time when towns are becoming homogenized
by chain restaurants and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart can't put ``Sailfish Capital of the World'' on enough
stationary. West Palm Beach is the center of the orchid universe,
Fort Pierce is ``Sunrise City'' and Boca Raton is ... not the condo
capital. It's the world's winter polo playground. (A city official
jokingly anointed Port St. Lucie ``Lizard Capital of the World''
before they chose to be known officially as ``A city for all
ages.'')
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Palm Beach County carries the banner of Golf
Capital of the World. Lots of places have lots of golf course, but
the county has more courses per capita than any place in the world.
Schwing!
</P>
<P>
   As a pure marketing gimmick, crowning a town with a ``world's
finest'' label works like a charm, says Richard Lilliquist,
executive director of the City-County Communication and Marketing
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lilliquist's group gives out it's Savvy Competition award each
year to the town that best capitalizes on its resources to draw
visitors. Places like Monterrey, Calif., which doesn't have a
slogan, but which is known worldwide for it's elaborate aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing awareness of the power of brands in our
society and local governments are discovering that, too,''
Lilliquist says.
</P>
<P>
   The titles are adopted locally and usually related to a major
local agricultural staple, manufacturing product or natural
resource. There is no officially sanctioned body that deals out
official Capital of the World status, but some towns and counties
get serious by trademarking their titles to prevent others from
poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Few duplicates exist. No one but Gilroy, Calif., makes the claim
to being Garlic Capital of the World because no one really can;
Gilroy processes 90 percent of the garlic grown in the U.S. But
there are a couple Christmas tree capitals. A few salmon capitals,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the marketing goals, the capital disctinction helps a
town form an identity, Lilliquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Joe DiMaggio, as part of contract whenever he made
appearances, insisted on being announced as the world's greatest
living baseball player,'' he said. ``It's a part of the times. It's
important for people to feel important.''
</P>
<P>
   As if `The Sunshine State' wasn't enough
</P>
<P>
   Floridians can stand tall.
</P>
<P>
   Along with being known as the tourism capital of the world and
the lightning capital of the world _ and the bad driving and auto
theft capital of America _ towns and cities throughout the state
make their own quirky claims.
</P>
<P>
   Plant City proudly bears the moniker of the world's strawberry
capital. Lake Placid, 30 miles northwest of Lake Okeechobee, is
known for it's broad-leafed, green and pink caladium plants.
</P>
<P>
   Islamorada calls itself the Sportsfishing Capital of the World.
Fort Lauderdale, with it's Intracoastal Waterway nooks and
crannies, is ``the Venice of America.'' The Manatee Capital of the
World can be found amid the clear, warm winter waters of Crystal
River.
</P>
<P>
   Ybor City, east of Tampa, was the Cigar Capital of the World at
the beginning of the century and still brags about it's legacy even
though most of the world's premier cigars are produced in the
Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Dania, near Fort Lauderdale, which backs up its
claim of the Antique Capital of the World by having more than 100
antiques dealers within one square mile selling everything from
small collectibles to the finest antiques. Other cities, like West
Palm Beach, may have their endless rows of antique stores but Dania
wins by saturation.
</P>
<P>
   I scream, you scream, we all scream for Le Mars, Iowa
</P>
<P>
   You'd think a place with sweltering heat and a seaside boardwalk
would pounce on the chance to be ``Ice Cream Capital of the
World.'' But landlocked Le Mars, Iowa, a few miles south of Sioux
City, nabbed the title for itself.
</P>
<P>
   And for good reason. The home of Wells' Dairy Inc., the largest
family-owned dairy in the U.S., almost a third of the town's 9,000
residents are employed making Blue Bunny ice cream, cottage cheese
and other dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Along with building a new $3.5 million visitor's center
dedicated to, of course, ice cream, the town hosts the Ice Cream
Days festival each Fourth of July weekend, during which everyone
wears an upside-down ice cream cone hat. ``The same people who make
those cheese heads for the Green Bay Packers make our ice cream
hats,'' said Angie Watson, the visitor's center manager.
</P>
<P>
   A funny story: The town got its name when railroad baron John
Blair asked the _ count 'em _ six women he was traveling with to
name the place where the rail depot stood. Lucille, Elizabeth,
Mary, Blair's wife Anne, Rebecca and Sara got creative and used the
first letter of all their first names to spell out Le Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of artichoke country
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes all it takes is a big crop or an abundant natural
resource to turn your town into something like the Artichoke
Capital of the World (that would be Castroville, Calif., by the
way.) Here are some others:
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus _ Park Ridge, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Pickle _ Atkins, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Crystals _ Mount Ida, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Catfish _ Wisner, La.
</P>
<P>
   Zinfindel _ Lodi, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Lily _ Neepawa, Manitoba
</P>
<P>
   Furniture _ High Point, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Frog _ Rayne, La.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and duck _ Stuttgart, Ark. (Yes, both. They grow a lot of
rice and a raise a lot of ducks there.)
</P>
<P>
   Garlic capital? you can have it!
</P>
<P>
   How do you find Gilroy, Calif.? Head west until you smell it.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want to say it's a stinky place to live, but it is the
Garlic Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   Just 80 miles south of San Francisco, Gilroy processes 90
percent of the garlic grown in the U.S., well over 100 million
tons. It gets granulated, dehydrated into powder, crushed into a
paste or chalk, pickled and made into toothpaste and deodorant.
(Okay, we made up those last two.) And with a garlic processing
plant in town, the aroma is ever-present.
</P>
<P>
   Each July at the town's Garlic Festival, a bevy of garlic
delights awaits. There is no corresponding Breath Mint Festival,
but two years ago, organizers held a ``kiss off,'' where several
people ate a lunch laced with atomic portions of garlic. Then each
used a separate brand of breath freshener. A volunteer kissed each
participant to judge who had the nicest breath and the winning
freshener was named the festival's official breath mint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met anyone who left town because of the aroma, but
about two years ago, someone wrote to say they were thinking about
moving to Gilroy, but they didn't like the smell of garlic,'' said
festival manager Chris Filice. ``We told them that we were sorry,
but that garlic is the livelihood around here and we weren't likely
to get the processing plant to move for them.''
</P>
<P>
   You say salmon, i say salmon
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone plays nice. Both Ashe County, N.C. and Lunenburg
County, Nova Scotia, claim to be the Christmas Tree Capital of the
World. And when it comes to salmon, Campbell River, British
Columbia, goes gill-to-gill with Ketchikan, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   We called to try and settle the dispute. Campbell River has
claimed it's title since 1982 because of it's enormous salmon fleet
and processing industry. Ketchikan hosts the annual King Salmon
Derby where fish weighing over 100 pounds have been caught.
</P>
<P>
   So we asked them to work it out. It got ugly quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know anything. They're Canadian,'' said Shauna Lee,
Ketchikan's derby organizer.
</P>
<P>
   A Campbell River official who asked to remain anonymous became
snooty when told of Ketchikan's good-natured ribbing. ``For a place
that sponsors a sportsfishing tournament, that's so unsporting.''

 &HT;    Elmore Leonard breaks pattern with `Get Shorty' sequel
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elmore Leonard doesn't ordinarily write sequels to his best
selling novels. I can't think of a single one over the years I have
been an ardent fan of the man I hear is called ``Dutch'' by his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Leonard's ``Get Shorty'' was such an extraordinary hit, as a
book but especially as a movie starring John Travolta, that he
broke a pattern and came up with a sequel to ``Get Shorty'' called
``Be Cool'' (Delacorte Press, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   In this one Leonard picks up ``Get Shorty'' hero, Chili Palmer
(aka Travolta), shortly after his second movie ``Get Lost'' has
bombed. ``Get Lost'' was the sequel to Chili's hit, ``Get Leo.''
But in Hollywood you're only as big as your latest movie, so Chili
is in danger of crashing as a Hollywood big shot producer.
Naturally, Chili doesn't give up easily. He plans to make a big
comeback with a new film about a pop singer. He is writing the
script by following the life and career of Linda Moon, a singer
with dreams of rising above her current gig as one of the group,
Chicks International, who do covers of Spice Girls songs.
</P>
<P>
   As he does time and again, year after year, Leonard moves his
story along as much with dialogue as with narrative. And his
dialogue is famously real and invigorating for the reader. There's
even more dialogue than usual in this Leonard story, and some may
feel it is too much of a good thing, but it certainly does move the
story along at a rapid clip and keep the reader (kept me, anyhow)
turning pages through the night.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't my favorite Elmore Leonard book, but it's not my
least favorite either. I'd put it somewhere in the middle probably,
which means it's more fun to read than most pop fiction.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Chili must deal with Russian mafia hit men as
well as the usual Hollywood hustlers. But he keeps on keeping on in
the entertaining Chili Palmer manner pulling together his new movie
by following Linda Moon around and doing what needs to be done to
save her life and keep her leading him toward a new movie that will
fuel his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Chili also must deal with the devious and often dangerous
presence of Linda's manager, a former pimp named Raji.
</P>
<P>
   What can I say about an Elmore Leonard novel at this point that
I haven't said, or read, before?
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Leonard fan, you'll enjoy this one. As I implied,
it might not be your favorite Leonard book, but it won't offend
you. And the movie might be better than the book, if Travolta
agrees to play Chili again and he's aided and abetted by actors of
the quality of Gene Hackman as he was in ``Get Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Hollywood seemed to be unable to transfer an Elmore
Leonard novel to the screen with real success. That's not the case
in recent years. I'm not sure why, but it's nice that we ardent
Elmore fans can lately look forward to seeing the movie as well as
reading the book.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard has published 35 books now and seems to be rolling right
along, since his books are automatic best sellers and, it seems
lately, automatic movies. ``Out of Sight'' and ``Get Shorty'' and
even the made-for-TV ``Maximum Bob'' have been transferred to the
screen without losing the Elmore Leonard ambiance, or touch, or
however you say it when the movie has a satisfying amount of the
same flavor as the book.

 &HT;    Slip into some slings, slides and sandals
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Take a load off.
</P>
<P>
   Lose the hose until next fall. Bury those heavy heals in the
back of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Lighten up your footfalls this spring by slipping into some
slings, slides and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come spring and summer, women like the freedom of wearing
sandals and no hose,'' said Phil Greenawalt, manager of Nine West
Shoe Store.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about sandals this season? Anything goes _ from
simple flat-soled slides (or mules as they're also called) to
strappy slingback sandals with a good-sized heel for a
sophisticated look.
</P>
<P>
   Brighten up your steps with pale pastel slingbacks or shock 'em
with fuchsia dress slides with slight heels. Liven things up with a
leopard-print, open-toe mule or dressy faux snake-skin sandals in a
variety of colors.
</P>
<P>
   The metallic shade of your choice is out there _ copper, silver,
gold, platinum or even a mix of precious metals shades can be found
in many shapes and styles. Pearly whites, iridescent plastics and
even colored suedes are hits.
</P>
<P>
   Suede for spring? That's right, in limes, oranges, reds,
purples, etc. Just watch out for that rain puddle!
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is getting a little bit more freewheeling with what
they want,'' Greenawalt said of the variety of sandals available
for spring and summer. ``There's not just one thing that
everybody's focusing in on.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer are sandals just meant for the beach, either. ``They
can go with anything _ jeans, shorts, skirts, even a nice summer
dress,'' said Sarah Hill, merchandising assistant in the shoe
department of JC Penney.
</P>
<P>
   Shoe store managers report that brown and black are always the
mainstay colors of choice in sandals. However, more women are
mixing fresh colors into their wardrobe for a casual chic look for
work or play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got navy and black,'' said Brett Bartlett,
operations manager of Texas Shoe Sale. ``I think when the different
colors come out, like the greens and fuchsias, people like those a
little bit more because it gives a little color to their
wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep two key points in mind when coordinating colored sandals
with outfits, Hill says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to match the sandals with the basic color in your
outfit, whatever stands out and is noticed first,'' she said. ``Or
if you have a background color you want to bring out of your
outfit, colored sandals (that match the background color) are going
to bring that color out more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who wears dress shoes and hose to work every day, says she
would live in sandals if she could.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not at work, 90 percent of the time I'm in sandals,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, younger girls are favoring clunkier, thicker soles,
Greenawalt said, while women like anything flat and light or with a
slight heel to it.
</P>
<P>
   When you're out doing a little sole searching this spring,
comfort is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women aren't just buying because it's a trend,'' Greenawalt
said. ``They're looking for something comfortable, but still
fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   The slide with a lower heel or a hin wedge hits a home run in
the comfort zone, followed by thongs, slings and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are going for lightweight, comfort and padding in
sandals,'' Greenawalt said. ``Ladies have a tendency, when they
purchase a dress shoe for a specific function, they'll put up with
less comfort. But sandals, they're really looking for something
that feels good on their feet that they can walk around in.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for thin elastic, crisscrossed-type sandals for a
barely-there feel. Mules made of microfiber material are airy and
quite comfy, too.
</P>
<P>
   When searching for sandals, Pay attention to quality and
workmanship, advises Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more discouraging than buying a great pair of sandals
only to have one of the straps come loose from the sole. Most
sandals' straps are glued into the sole, even top brands, which
means they can pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have a leather sole, a lot of times, they'll have
stitching around them and they hold up a little better,'' Bartlett
said.

   FAMOUS-CITIES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paris is the city of
lights. New York is the city that never sleeps. San Francisco is
the city by the bay. Chicago has the Sears Tower, St. Louis has its
arch. But what if you're a sleepy, one-stoplight town that's
archless and far from world-reknown? What if you're ... Okeechobee,
Fla.? Well, you anoint yourself the Speckled Perch Capital of the
World and wear the title with pride. And you have an annual
speckled perch festival that attracts about 12,000 people a year.
The titles are adopted locally and usually related to a major local
agricultural staple, manufacturing product or natural resource.
There is no officially sanctioned body that deals out official
Capital of the World status, but some towns and counties get
serious by trademarking their titles to prevent others from
poaching. Several ``world-famous'' cities and their claims to fame
are included. (Houck, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Estelle Lawton, a public health nurse supervisor,
is no longer surprised to hear 50-year-old women tell her they've
never done a breast self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The stresses faced by the population Lawton serves help to
explain the trend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women often are working, but in low-wage jobs that have
insufficient health-insurance coverage. They don't do self-exams
and may avoid screening for fear they'll find a costly health
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think if they don't know, they don't have a problem,''
Lawton says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural taboos inhibit them from getting to know, much less
touch, their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is that these obstacles prevent many poor women from
seeking medical help before it's too late. Disparate survival rates
among women who've been diagnosed with breast cancer demonstrate
their folly.
</P>
<P>
   While white women have an 84 percent survival rate after their
diagnosis, Hispanic and African-American women, who make up a
disproportionate share of the nation's poor, respectively have
rates of 70 percent and 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, who works with Adult Health Services of the San Antonio
Metropolitan Health District, says studies show Hispanic and
African-American women tend to be diagnosed after the cancer has
reached an advanced stage. Limited resources to offer preventive,
low-cost screening exacerbate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That's where groups like the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation come in. Events such as the ``Race for the Cure'' raise
money to fund research, prevention and treatment of breast cancer.
The Dallas-based organization then is able to fill in the
health-care gaps as it has in San Antonio by helping the
Metropolitan Health District expand the scope of its low-cost
breast-cancer screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding for the screenings performed under Adult Health
Services programs is limited to women 50 and older, the group most
at risk of developing breast cancer. Women over 65 are covered by
Medicare. Left out are women who are 40 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert Brown, director of the district's Women's Health
Services, says grants from the Komen Foundation have helped fill
the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But key to preventing needless deaths to the silent killer
remains in education and prevention, a hurdle that Lawton believes
the medical community finally, if incrementally, is beginning to
overcome, even in the hard-to-reach low-income community.
</P>
<P>
   Media campaigns that target the group are making inroads, as are
federal programs such as ``Comadres,'' an initiative aimed at
educating women over 65 who are on Medicare about the availability
of low-cost mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton points out, too, that breast cancer diagnosis no longer
means certain disfigurement by mastectomy, a prospect that long has
scared many women away from screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Lawton says the single most motivating factor
that prompts women to perform self-examinations is that knowing
someone who's had breast cancer or who has found a lump in her
breast.
</P>
<P>
   There are greater motivators. The American Cancer Society
reports that 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer
this year; more than 43,000 will die. The Komen Foundation points
to research showing that the mortality rate could decrease by 30
percent if all women age 50 and older in need of a mammogram had
one.
</P>
<P>
   What more motivation do women need?

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ The best college running back in the state
might not be the one just finishing spring drills at Arizona State.
And he might not be the guy preparing to help Arizona prove itself
worthy of an expected top five preseason ranking.
</P>
<P>
   He could be here, at Northern Arizona University, sporting a
baby face, wearing a retainer and unpacking a travel trailer full
of baggage collected on a trip that's taken him from Oxnard,
Calif., to Provo, Utah, and now to Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   Ronney Jenkins' football career has been been filled with
exhilaration and enough anguish to be worthy of daytime television.
Chart his career and you end up with a heartbeat pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Western Athletic Conference freshman of the year in 1996 for
Brigham Young University.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended the next season for violating the school's honor code.
Considered transferring to ASU but decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Married, then divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Rushed for 1,311 yards last year, including 171 against Arizona
State, and scored 15 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Expelled in December for violating the school's honor code
again. Transferred to NAU, a Division I-AA school where he becomes
immediately eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Married again three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, as polite and soft-spoken as a church usher, seems
undisturbed by all the changes he's endured since leaving the
security of his grandmother's home in Oxnard three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I adapt to things pretty well,'' said Jenkins, who turns 22
next month. ``I've been adapting to things all my life.'' &QL; 
Good prospects &QL; 
People at NAU are anxious to help, because rarely, if ever, does a
running back of Jenkins' ability show up on the campus of a Big Sky
Conference school.
</P>
<P>
   And rarely, if ever, has each of Arizona's three
football-playing colleges had a pro prospect at running back at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's J.R. Redmond was an all-Pac-10 choice last year. Arizona's
Trung Canidate is an indispensable part of what could be one of the
nation's best offenses. Both might be considered early Heisman
Trophy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But a case could be made that Jenkins is the best of the three.
As a freshman, he rushed for 733 yards on 128 carries (a 5.7-yard
average) and scored 14 touchdowns. Despite being hampered by minor
injuries last season, Jenkins averaged more than 5 yards a carry
and was a second team all-WAC selection.
</P>
<P>
   He has sprinter's speed and recently was timed in the 40-yard
dash at 4.4 seconds. He says his best time was 4.29 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as good as anybody we've ever had around here,'' said BYU
Coach LaVell Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   NAU Coach Jerome Souers is not given to boastful statements, but
when asked about Jenkins, he can't suppress a dimpled smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be any secret,'' he said, ``he's going to
have the ball in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL scouting services rate Jenkins, a junior next season,
as one of the top running back prospects in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins insists he isn't looking that far ahead. He's
concentrating on trying to fit in with his new teammates, learn a
new offense and adapt to a new environment that's far different
from the one he knew in Provo, which he admits is probably a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   However adaptable Jenkins thinks he is, Provo and BYU were
difficult fits for him, as they are for many African-American and
non-Mormon athletes. It's more than the school's honor code, which
forbids drinking alcohol, sex outside of marriage and substance
abuse, among other things. It's dealing with a mindset that's
radically different from what non-Mormons are accustomed to,
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks the same,'' he said. ``Everybody wants the
same things. It was so different from where I came from. It was
like a whole different country, a whole different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins went to BYU at the urging of his grandmother, Jean
Cobbs, who admired the school's values and thought it would be good
for her grandson to leave California. It's advice that she says she
now regrets giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he can put this behind him, and we'll leave BYU
right where it is _ Provo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who turned down a scholarship offer from Southern
California, assumes responsibility for his mistakes at BYU. He
admitted violating the school's honor code twice by having
premarital sex. He considered transferring after the first time but
stayed because his grandmother thought he should.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also would have stayed after the second violation had
BYU officials decided to suspend him for only a few games. They
didn't, announcing last Christmas Eve that Jenkins had been
expelled.
</P>
<P>
   BYU officials couldn't comment about why Jenkins was dismissed,
but Edwards said Jenkins had never been in trouble with the law and
never had had a problem with alcohol or substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great kid,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Jenkins most about his BYU experience was that
other people went to school officials with numerous accusations, he
said, including one that he was a gang member, which he denies. And
school administrators assumed he was guilty, he said, and wanted
him to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always something,'' he said. ``You never knew what
was going to happen, who was going to say things about you, who was
going to tell on you about this. I always expected something to
happen.'' &QL; 
Honor code confrontations &QL; 
After the 1996 season, Jenkins was suspended for have sexual
relations with another student, Nikki McBride, whom he married just
a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relationship that has survived rocky times, he said.
While sitting out in 1997, Jenkins broke up with McBride and
married another woman, a marriage that lasted just over a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was wrong,'' he said of the marriage. ``I just
wanted to go back to school and try to start all over and stay out
of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did for a while. He showed up to camp last year
admittedly out of shape, and it affected his performance throughout
the year. That thought probably scares Sun Devils fans, who saw
Jenkins overpower ASU's defense last year in BYU's 26-6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jenkins renewed his relationship with McBride, a
Mormon from New Jersey. Allegations followed that Jenkins and
McBride had violated the honor code again, charges made by a few
people who didn't like him, Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins didn't dispute that he and McBride had been intimate.
That was enough to end his BYU career, a result that disturbed his
65-year-old grandmother, a woman who doesn't sit quietly by if she
thinks a family member is being mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to tell people that I'm a lady going in and I'm a lady
coming out, but you may not like what you see in between,'' Cobbs
said from her home in Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   She was particularly upset because she thought BYU officials
were slow to grant Jenkins a release and free him to accept a
scholarship at another school.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbs said she thought BYU officials had waited because they
wanted Jenkins to return to the team after he sat out another
season.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbs, along with her son and Jenkins' uncle, Dwayne Hall, told
them that was unacceptable and demanded that Jenkins be released.
Only then, she said, did BYU oblige.
</P>
<P>
   BYU officials, through a school spokesman, deny those
allegations. Jenkins and his family remain bitter about the events
of last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't throw the baby out with the bathwater in our
culture,'' Cobbs said. ``If you take a child out of his environment
and put him in your environment, it doesn't mean he's amoral or a
bad kid, he just doesn't know your environment.'' &QL; 
Helping non-Mormons &QL; 
BYU officials say they realize they have a problem with non-Mormon
_ and specifically African-American _ athletes coping in a place
that is overwhelmingly White and with a strict Mormon honor code.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a legitimate point there,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' family, as well as some of his Mormon teammates, urged
the school to do more to help non-Mormon students cope.
</P>
<P>
   According to Salt Lake City newspapers, 24 athletes were
suspended for honor code violations in the 1990s. Seventeen of
those were African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one liked what happened last December,'' said Carri
Jenkins, the university's director of media communications and no
relation to Ronney.
</P>
<P>
   The university has established a new student-athlete center,
which will be under the direction of a non-denominational chaplain.
The idea is to give non-Mormon athletes a comfortable place to go
for counseling and other help.
</P>
<P>
   The school is also preparing a video to explain the honor code
to prospective athletes. And all 30,000 students at BYU were
recently sent a letter that made it clear that ``encouraging''
fellow students to follow the honor code didn't mean ``they should
be out there spying,'' Carri said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronney endorses the changes, although they are being made too
late to help him. He is not dwelling on what happened to him at BYU
and has kept a low profile since arriving at NAU, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a talker,'' he said. ``I like to show people what I
can do and then let them talk about me.''
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't take long, said NAU quarterback Travis Brown, who
became a fan of Jenkins' after only a few spring practices. Jenkins
reminds Brown of former NAU running back Archie Amerson, who rushed
for 2,079 yards in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get accused of not carrying out my fakes because I
wanted to watch Archie,'' Brown said. ``That might be the case
again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that Jenkins will stay only one year at NAU
before leaving for the NFL. Jenkins said he would wait to see how
this season goes before making a decision. His family wants him to
stay in school and graduate, and Jenkins doesn't seem in a hurry to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up with money, and I still don't have any
money,'' he said. ``It's nothing to me. I've never been `up.' ''

HIGHER GAS PRICES GIVE ELECTRIC CARS A CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once maligned as slow and bothersome,
electrically powered vehicles _ EVs to those who know and love them
_ are becoming the objects of affection to motorists embittered by
the skyrocketing fuel prices in California.
</P>
<P>
   Gas costs climbed 43.1 cents per gallon in the past three weeks,
bringing the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the
San Francisco area to $1.71, the highest in the nation. The
nationwide average is about $1.10 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Kohenek, who markets the General Motors EV-1 through
Saturn dealerships, said the rise in consumer interest had been
evident. ``In the last two weeks I've been quite busy and getting a
lot more calls,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those inquiring about GM's battery-driven two-seater
have mentioned gas prices as a motive for their sudden interest,
Kohenek added.
</P>
<P>
   EVs are still in the experimental stage and aren't likely to
save money over gas-powered cars, even at the prices drivers in
this car-loving state must pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big picture is that the cost of new electric vehicles will
probably never be competitive with new gasoline cars for the simple
reason that batteries are inherently expensive, heavy and bulky,''
said Daniel Sperling, who directs the Institute of Transportation
Studies at the University of California at Davis. The institute is
preparing a study of electric vehicle operating costs for the
California Air Resources Board.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling said EVs would falter in the marketplace until the
battery system was replaced with fuel cell technology, which can
convert a variety of fuels into electrical energy without
combustion and with no toxic emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Greg West thinks he's getting a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   West, design manager for a San Jose technology company, leases
his EV-1 for $373 per month, which includes a state tax incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a complete bumper-to-bumper warranty for the three
years of the lease,'' West said. ``I don't buy tires, I don't buy
brakes. I figure that's worth about $100 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he said, ``I put about $14 worth of electricity on
the vehicle and drove about 900 miles. It would have cost me $50 to
$60 for my other vehicle, a 10-year-old Volvo wagon. With the price
of gas going up, that savings, of course, gets bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   William Dahlgren pays $485 for his four-seat Honda EV, which has
a similar all-inclusive warranty. He doesn't care about the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who just wanted one,'' he said.
Dahlgren had earlier owned a converted Renault electric car, and
during the early 1970s gas crunch he built his own electric
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   There's a critical difference between gas and electrically
powered automobiles, and that is range.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlgren, who lives on the southern cusp of San Francisco, said
he could drive about 85 miles from one charge on his Honda EV.
</P>
<P>
   When fuel cells technology is perfected, the short-range problem
will disappear, Sperling said. ``The auto industry is looking to
(fuel cell technology) as the Holy Grail to solve all their
problems,'' he said. ``You get all the advantage of battery
electric vehicles without the range problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait won't be long. He said major American car manufacturers
had vowed that ``they're each going to have 100,000 fuel cell
vehicles on the road by 2005.''

HISTORIAN QUESTIONS ALAMO'S BATTLE COUNT IN NEW MANUSCRIPT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The siege of the Alamo took place 163 years ago and we're still
not confident that we know exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lasted 13 days, we're pretty sure of that, and we
know for certain that Santa Anna and his Mexican troops won. We
thought we knew Davy Crockett died while slugging onrushing Mexican
troops with the blunt end of ``Betsy,'' his muzzle loader. But
maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican officer wrote in his diary that Crockett was taken
prisoner and later executed. Some historians debated his claim, but
collectors paid $350,000 for the memoirs anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an Austin historian says there weren't 189 defenders killed
at the Alamo as the monument out front says. In a manuscript being
reviewed by the University of Texas Press, Thomas Ricks Lindley
estimates that there were about 250 defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Tom and he is well respected as an Alamo researcher,''
said Bruce Winders, the staff historian at the Alamo. ``We're just
waiting to see if the manuscript will be published.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindley's research indicates that there were forces from Goliad,
Bastrop and Gonzales at the Alamo that were never counted among the
garrison. There were also a few Tejanos brought in by Juan Seguin.
And it appears that some of the names that are on the list
shouldn't be. There is evidence that some of the men were elsewhere
when the battle took place.
</P>
<P>
   Winders said all of that is probably true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't really a new revelation,'' Winders said of the
conflicting numbers. ``The number of defenders and the number of
attacking troops have always been under question.''
</P>
<P>
   Winders said the Alamo officially agrees that the number of
defenders should be around 200. The staff believes that Santa
Anna's army at the Alamo to have been around 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there were upward of 2,500 Mexican forces in San
Antonio on March 6, 1836,'' he said. ``In the past, Santa Anna's
army was numbered at a little over 6,000 and some people have
placed all of them in San Antonio, which they were not. Some were
on the road to San Antonio, some were east of there, near Goliad.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the question becomes, will the Alamo _ owned by the state,
and operated by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas _ change the
monument to reflect the additional names?
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps, but probably not any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is solid evidence everyone can agree on, I'm sure
the list will be revised,'' Winders said. ``When Lindley's book
comes out, if it does, or any book for that matter, it will be
reviewed and people will judge it on its merits.''
</P>
<P>
   That can take years, and given the sensitive nature of the
Alamo, and what it stands for, the evidence will have to be nearly
irrefutable. The Alamo is not a roadside historical marker; it is
by state law a shrine to the men who died there, and Winders says
that gives it a different set of operating rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list of names is so potentially controversial,'' he said.
``When it comes to removing someone's name, there is an entire
family behind that name that will be upset. If you delete it, or
add someone else's name, you must have more than ample proof.''

 eBAY MOVES UPTOWN WITH NEW AUCTION PARTNER  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A prestigious San Francisco art auction house
will offer high-end goods on the eBay Web site, giving the
everyman's auction an uptown image.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between San Jose-based eBay and the Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield Auctioneer Corp. would be the first permanent alliance
between a real-world auction house and a Web-based auctioneering
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to offer premium items for auction on our site from
Butterfield,'' said Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for eBay.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site usually offers more home-grown items, such as
used computers and ukuleles, which are sold and bought by
individuals. Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield has been holding estate
sales and art auctions since 1865.
</P>
<P>
   According to a prospectus recently filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, eBay said it had signed a ``nonbinding letter
of understanding to create a separate category of premium items on
the eBay Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Those items, the prospectus said, ``would be sourced from
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield and other auction companies.'' A
spokesman for Butterfield declined to comment, citing the company's
current quiet period, a federally mandated period of public silence
following the Feb. 12 notice that Butterfield planned to offer its
shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   On-line auctions, where Web users bid by computer for a range of
goods and services, have been a runaway success on the Internet.
EBay is the most successful of the growing number of such sites.
Its popularity has made it one of the most visited destinations on
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good synergy,'' said Ron Rappaport, an analyst with
Internet market research firm Zona Research. ``EBay is known as the
superstore, and Butterfield has the prestige goods. This lets
Butterfield reach that huge market.''

FINE WAR NOVEL IS A POTENT LEGAL THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Katzenbach's ``Hart's War'' (Ballantine Books, $24.95, 486
pages) is a fascinating and powerful legal suspense novel set in a
prisoner of war camp in Bavaria during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Second Lt. Tommy Hart is the only survivor of a B-25 shot down
over the Mediterranean. Picked up by the Italian Navy, he is handed
over to the Germans and sent to Stalag Luft 13, a camp for
American, British and Canadian airmen. Daily activity includes
baseball and tunnel digging. Hart, a former Harvard law student,
spends his days reading legal texts and once a week bribes his way
into the camp's British compound to argue cases with Barrister
Phillip Pyrce and Hugh Renaday, a former Royal Canadian Mounted
Police constable.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Stalag Luft 13 changes radically when a new prisoner is
brought in _ 1st Lt. Lincoln Scott, a black pilot who is a Tuskegee
airman. He is immediately taunted by Capt. Vincent Bedford, a
racist from Mississippi and the camp's wheeler-dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Hart tries to make friends with Scott, but the very proud
scholar refuses to talk with anyone. When Bedford is found with his
throat slit in the officers' privy, Scott becomes the prime suspect
when blood is found on his flight jacket and boots.
</P>
<P>
   The camp's commandant agrees to let the Americans put Scott on
trial. Ordered to defend Scott, Hart is allowed to enlist the
services of Pyrce and Renaday. Scott admits being in the privy the
night of Bedford's murder but maintains that he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   When Hart and Renaday inspect the murder scene they realize that
Bedford could not have been murdered there because there's no
evidence of blood. The Germans bring in Hauptmann Heinrich Visser
to monitor the investigation and the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking American officer and his aides believe it is an
open-and-shut case. What Hart doesn't know is that the trial is
being timed to coincide with a major escape attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach artfully develops his characters layer by layer. Not
all the Germans are bad _ the commandant is a man of honor, as is
Fritz No. 1, one of the camp's guards. Yet Visser is the epitome of
Gestapo evil. There is honor and duty among the Americans, but
there is also deep-seated racism.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenbach's vivid descriptions of the usually boring routine of
the captured airmen immediately conjure up images from the movie
``Stalag 17.''
</P>
<P>
   As both a war novel and a legal thriller, ``Hart's War'' is a
compelling read. It's also a tribute to the men who served in World
War II, especially the Tuskegee airmen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Biting the Moon'' (Henry Holt &AMP; Co, $25, 301 pages), Martha
Grimes has taken a break from her very popular police procedural
series featuring Scotland Yard Superintendent Richard Jury.
However, her new mystery is a very dark, uneven read.
</P>
<P>
   A very pretty young woman wakes up in a bed-and-breakfast in
Santa Fe, N.M. She doesn't know who she is and has no memories of
the past. The B&AMP;B owner says she was brought in ``dead asleep by
her daddy.'' Knowing the man will soon return, the girl gathers up
her backpack, takes his jacket, his money and his gun and heads for
the mountains. Eventually, she finds a deserted cabin and spends
her time learning how to shoot and rescuing animals from traps.
</P>
<P>
   Because her backpack has the initials AO on it, she names
herself Andi Olivier and begins creating a mythical family and
past.
</P>
<P>
   Andi periodically makes trips back to town to steal medicine for
the injured animals. About four months after she began hiding out,
Andi goes back to town and meets 14-year-old Mary Dark Hope, whose
real past is also tragic. Mary's parents are dead, her only sister
was murdered and Mary now lives with her loving caretaker Rosella.
When Mary takes Andi home, Rosella says Andi can stay.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rosella finds someone to watch over the girls and leaves to
spend 10 days with her family.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Andi's story, Mary agrees to accompany Andi on a
trek to find ``Daddy.'' They learn to drive along the way as they
encounter illegal trapping, white water rafting, illegal big game
hunts, animal abuse, child abuse, child molestation and murder.
</P>
<P>
   What is so unsettling about ``Biting the Moon'' is that adult
after adult accepts the wild stories Mary and Andi tell and then
help them get into more danger. And when the book is over, there
are too many unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   According to a press release, ``Biting the Moon'' ``is the debut
of a new series featuring young heroines which will focus on the
prevention of animal abuse.'' I doubt Grimes fans are going to like
this new series.
</P>
<P>
   Bring back Richard Jury.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAZDA, Macedonia _ The mists of history descend like fog over
the refugee camp here.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the Kosovo refugees seem, at first, like grainy
black-and-white newsreels of World War II horrors, transformed into
Technicolor misery and beamed to the world by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   There are boxcars packed with refugees from Kosovo, stripped of
everything they own. There are children's faces frozen in fear, as
soldiers with black boots and rifles bark orders. There are hands
stamped with identification numbers, as passports and papers are
collected at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes make for casual comparisons between the Serbs'
``ethnic cleansing'' and the Holocaust. But the expulsion of a
half-million ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, as horrifying as it is,
is not the Holocaust. Although a group of men at the barbed-wire
edge of the Stenkovic refugee camp chanted ``Auschwitz, Auschwitz''
in recent days, to compare this to a death camp would be to pervert
history.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of three refugees cut through that fog of history
here Monday, vivid portraits of three people who had to run for
their lives. They are different tales that stretch over a
half-century, but they intersected Monday in the muddy rows of
canvas tents and bread lines in Brazda's refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   In a hospital cot in the Israeli Defense Forces medical corps
tent lay a young woman who had been ordered out of her Kosovo home
last week at gunpoint, and who then was shot by Serb paramilitaries
as she fled down a mountain road. As an Israeli Army doctor
operated on her leg to remove a bullet fragment, he reflected on
his own family's harrowing escape from the Nazi invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1940. In the next tent worked his new friend, a
surgeon with the German Red Cross, who remembered when he, as the
8-year-old son of a German naval officer, also ran for his life
with his family as US planes bombed their home in Berlin and the
Allies closed in on victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mental pictures in this place that bring back
memories to all of us. I think everyone feels it,'' said Dr. Jacob
Adler, 68, wearing Israeli Army fatigues and a surgeon's scrub
suit, and thinking of the people in other camps more than 50 years
ago. ``Of course, there is no real comparison. This is not a death
camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's history, and this is now. And this is a disaster,
and what has happened to these people is quite evil enough,'' Adler
said as he delicately worked long-handled tweezers to remove a
bullet fragment lodged in the back of the young woman's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping off his surgical gloves and moving over to study one
more time the X-ray showing where the fragment was, he said, ``The
point is to focus on the present and on helping people.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``We ran for our lives'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what he was doing in the Israeli medical corps
tent, where a dozen surgeons and 75 medical support staff set up a
makeshift hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Ibandete Dormishi, 21, covered her face in pain as he
worked on her leg. Later, her story unfolded through the aid
workers who helped her as she recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran for our lives,'' she said, still wincing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband were ordered at gunpoint to leave their home
in the village of Mazgit near Pristina on April 3. They were
speeding toward the border when Serbian paramilitaries opened fire,
and both were wounded by what they believe were fragments from
ricocheting bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Bleeding, but not critically wounded, they made it to the border
in their bullet-pocked car. There, they were herded onto a train
and into the squalor of the refugees' encampment in the ``no man's
land'' near the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. Eventually, her
husband, who had a deeper wound, was lifted over the crowd pressing
to get out of the camp and taken to a hospital. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Doctor and patient &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was left behind in the camp. But the pain in her leg grew
worse, and on Saturday she was brought into the Israeli medical
corps unit. The wound had become infected, the piece of shrapnel so
deeply lodged that in the end the surgeon was unable to remove it.
</P>
<P>
   After he prescribed pain killers and antibiotics, she was asked
if she realized that her doctor had also fled for his life as a
refugee more than a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he had been through so much,'' she said, smiling
politely through pain as she was loaded into an ambulance to be
transported back to her tent in the camp. ``I'm just glad he was
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, after she came by for a follow-up visit and for more
antibiotics, Adler, the Jewish doctor, said he and the Albanian
woman had shared a warm moment, a sense that both had survived evil
that targeted them simply because of their ethnicity and their
faith. But Adler said he was uncomfortable talking about it
directly and preferred just to focus on making sure she was cared
for. He insisted that a nurse double-check that the lab was doing a
culture from the wound so he could be sure it was not still
infected. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Four years in hiding &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment of calm afterward, Adler warmed his hands on a
cup of coffee and told his own story. It was 1940 in his native
Czechoslovakia. He was 11 years old when his father, Hugo, also a
physician, led the family to safety in the face of the imminent
Nazi invasion. They made it to Norway, but the Nazis invaded there
as well, and they lived in hiding for four years.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered the night when he, his sister Hannah, and his
parents huddled in the back of a horse-drawn sled as it was driven
over snow-covered roads lined with Nazi troops. They made it to
Sweden through the resistance underground. They lived in Stockholm
until 1949, when they arrived by boat in the newly founded state of
Israel, where he has lived and has raised a family in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After years in the Israeli Army's medical corps, Adler has seen
war and its effects. He has traveled on humanitarian missions to
Rwanda and Cambodia, where massacres have unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors become firefighters in history's worst conflagrations,
and they develop a kinship. On this assignment, Adler has developed
one with Dr. Dieter Jacobi, who set up the German Red Cross tent
next door to the Israelis. Adler was there Monday, helping Jacobi
with the details and offering assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi, 61, has penetrating blue eyes and blond hair peppered
with gray. He was a young boy in Nazi Germany, and his images of
World War II are vivid. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``No comparison'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was 8 years old when the news came that his father had been
taken prisoner of war from a German navy ship. His father's navy
duties were largely administrative, he said, and he was not a
member of the Nazi party.
</P>
<P>
   When American planes bombed Berlin in the final stages of the
war, the family's home was destroyed. His mother, his four
siblings, and he were left homeless and fled to the countryside.
For years, he said, they slept where they could with relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many refugees on the street, and not much
sympathy. I remember begging for food on the street,'' he said amid
rows of cots in the surgical tent.
</P>
<P>
   For him, a German, the refugee camp also evoked powerful
reminders of his country's haunting past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in your mind, and here it is more than ever. You
have to live with your history and the history of your father,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the mounting of evidence of atrocities committed by
Christian Serbs on Muslim Albanian Kosovars could be compared to
the Nazi persecution of Jews, he hesitated. Then he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, exhaling on a Marlboro. ``No, there is no
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nazis were systematically eliminating a race. The Serbs
have been systematic as well, but in expelling the people. What has
happened to the Albanians is horrific, but from what we hear from
the people coming in, the killing has been sporadic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is anyone who has become a refugee knows the
experience,'' he said, ``and knows what it does to you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Holocaust Memorial Day &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday (April 13) was Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, and a
young press officer for the Israeli medical corps posted news of a
ceremony and a press conference to be held in the muddy center of
the field hospital here. That infuriated Adler, the Israeli
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am offended by it, honestly,'' said the corps' only doctor
old enough to have fled the Holocaust. ``It has nothing to do with
why we are here. It only distracts from the focus of what we should
be doing. I am afraid it can end up alienating our colleagues with
whom we have worked very closely, namely the Germans. It is just
not a dignified occasion, which it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly ethnic Albanian refugee limped into the tent in the
drizzle of the late afternoon. Adler rose to his feet and went to
work treating him.

NEW WAYS TO DISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sketchy and skeevy: They could be buddies of Itchy and Scratchy,
the stars of the Simpsons' favorite cartoon show, but no: Both
words are slang in transition, making their way into mainstream
media after years of life on the margins, where most
self-respecting argot prefers to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Sketchy _ meaning dubious, iffy, suspect _ has been standard
among teenagers for at least the past few years; one source traces
it to 1976, calling it campus slang for ``dangerous.'' But only in
the '90s did sketchy catch on widely enough to make its move into
grown-up prose.
</P>
<P>
   I first spotted this sketchy in print _ or, rather, on-screen _
in Slate, the on-line magazine. ``It is the fact that the airline
business is so capital-intensive that makes it such a sketchy
business,'' wrote James Surowiecki in his Moneybox column on April
1. It was no joke, though: Sketchy has been in Surowiecki's
vocabulary since at least 1995, he says. ``Initially my friends and
I used it a lot in reference to people . . . then quickly broadened
that to refer to almost anything that's not quite the way it should
be,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The new sketchy is not much of a stretch, though, from the old.
Colloquially, sketchy was already used to mean cursory, as in ``a
sketchy job of cleaning,'' and just an added dash of disapproval
gives us the current slang.
</P>
<P>
   Skeevy is a harder case. It means sketchy and then some _
repellent, nasty, disgusting _ but my slang dictionaries offered
slim pickings on its history. One called it a '90s word, another
put it in the '50s, spelled skevee and meaning ``a messy person.''
(One who leaves his skivvies on the floor?)
</P>
<P>
   A computer search, though, turned up a clue: A story in which
Denise Flaim, an editor and home columnist at Newsday, called
skeevy ``a word from my Queens youth.''
</P>
<P>
   In reply to a plea for more info, Flaim explained that skeevy is
familiar among colleagues who grew up in New York's outer boroughs.
``One thing our mostly blue-collar immigrant neighborhoods had in
common was a heavy concentration of Italian-Americans,'' she notes.
``So here's my etymological conclusion: It's derived from the
Italian word schifoso, pronounced ski-FO-zoe),'' which means
loathsome or filthy. ``The fact that skeevy is part of the lexicon
of `The Sopranos' cements it for me,'' says Flaim.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origins, skeevy is coming on strong: It's on the
lips of Katie Couric, in the pages of Redbook magazine and
Entertainment Weekly and (of course) People. And if those
endorsements don't persuade you to join the chorus, how about the
Christian Science Monitor, where a recent essay declared, ``There
aren't any skeevy things about God _ He is totally good.'' As a
usage testimonial, that one is hard to top.

CURING MILLENNIUM MALAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Is there a pill, a vaccine, an
anti-inflammatory to ward off or relieve the dreaded plague called
Millennium Malaise?
</P>
<P>
   Here it is only April, and the toll is horrific. Millions, maybe
billions, infected _ sick of thinking, planning, contemplating,
wondering how and where to deal with distant Dec. 31. Could anyone
imagine that Millennium Malaise would be an affliction with its own
theme song? But can't you hear the soupy, aged strains of ``What
are you doing New Year's . . . New Year's Eve?''
</P>
<P>
   With the cosmic odomoter inexorably set to spin all four digits,
revealing 2000, I hear people plotting exotic journeys to places
they believe they ought to be when it happens. What about
safari-ing in Africa . . . trekking to Machu Picchu . . . tuxing it
up with Antarctic penguins . . . sailing a junk out of Taipei . . .
biking the Silk Road . . . listening to Big Ben bong the 12 big
ones? Serious stuff for folks who worry that they'll be
out-tripped.
</P>
<P>
   Was it like this in 1899? Is everybody on edge because we get
only one shot at it? My recommendation is tenting on Boston's
Revere Beach, positioned for a brisk swim as the sun and
millennium's opening daylight sprout from the Atlantic _ followed
by thermal bundling and considerable brandy from a rental St.
Bernard. But I haven't heard of a travel agent offering that one.
Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose there isn't any first light? As you know,
End-of-the-World Millenniacs are out there, doomsinging, primed for
a concluding chorus of ``Fold Lang Syne'' and a farewell shout:
``Happy No Year!''
</P>
<P>
   If you're of like mind, I know a bookmaker in Melbourne, Michael
Eskander, who will lay you 1,000 to 1 against. ``Actually, you can
name your price,'' he advises, ``because if you win there may be a
problem collecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Generous fellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ought to put your malaise to rest today by deciding to
come right back here, to New Zealand at the end of December,''
suggests Maria Sweet, proprietor of an airy hairy salon called
Exhibit A. She is making a diligent scissorly search for remnants
of my locks to trim. ``This is the country of the initial daybreak
of the initial day of the initial millennium that any of us will
ever witness arriving.''
</P>
<P>
   Location is everything, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. And the price is right for you Yanks with your
dollar worth about twice as much as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of many reasons to love Kiwi country.
</P>
<P>
   Maria says that the east coast town of Gisborne will be the
``hot spot'' for those hoping to blink in the virginal light of
2000 _ ``a blink-in drink-in on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Captain Cook landed on New Zealand in 1769, staking real
estate claims for Britain, Gisborne was the place, well southeast
of Auckland. But he called it Poverty Bay, poor pickings, and moved
on. It's our most easterly community, closest to the International
Date Line _ thus the world's `Hello, 2000!' town. You can rent a
car or take an eight-hour bus ride from Auckland. No airport or
train station there.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Mettner of Gisborne's tourist office says her area is
known for excellent wine, ``considered the Chardonnay capital of
New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be enough to go around? You do expect a few visitors,
don't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, a few,'' she is says, chuckling on the phone.
``Perhaps as many as 200,000. But the vineyards won't run dry.
We're putting on extra grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   First light sounds like second thoughts on my part. Or first
fright. Isn't Gisborne a settlement of merely 30,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, but we're planning carefully, and we have a lot
of space,'' Mettner says. There are motel rooms available in the
$50 to $250 range. That's in US dollars. But most people will
probably be camping on the beaches. We're organized, and we believe
visitors will be respectful and orderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have dancing in the streets, concerts, a Maori music
festival, art exhibits, horse races. Plenty to do. There'll be a
bullock drive from Wairoa, a reenactment of pioneer days.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to bring your own bullock?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if you feel like it. TV networks have scouted us for
camera positions. The world will see Gisborne, one way or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fun such as Gisborne has never seen. Even if ``Larry
King Live'' shows up, as rumored. Is Mettler looking forward to
we-are-the-world descending on her precinct?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll take my holidays that week.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria thinks I'd be more comfortable in Auckland, preferably
without a bullock. ``Most hotels wouldn't welcome one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing Jan. 1 sweep in brightly from way up high, the
observation deck of the Sky Tower _ our tallest structure _ should
be exciting. The view is fabulous, and there's a casino. You can
gain a new year while losing your shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a modern outlook. But for a real Kiwi feeling, I like
One Tree Hill. Even though it rises in the center of the city, it's
a very bucolic park and seems remote. A resident flock of sheep
keeps the crest neat, unshaggy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindred barbering spirits, Maria?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way. But not stylists,'' she says, smiling
professionally. ``Karekare Beach on the west coast, a half-hour
drive outside of town, would be a romantic place for a New Year
party. Starkly beautiful. Black sand. Rock formations like drip
castles. Much of that wonderful movie with Holly Hunter and Harvey
Keitel, `The Piano,' was shot there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could also charter a boat and oversee 2000's inauguration
in Huaraki Gulf where the America's Cup races will be held.
Auckland calls itself the `City of Sails' because of our seafaring
heritage. Most tourists would probably prefer it to be the city of
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything to avoid staying home, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   Although Professor Irwin Corey, the late comedian and a roadie,
didn't have to deal with Millennium Malaise, I am comforted by his
profound words: ``Remember, no matter where you go _ there you
are.'' The main idea is _ malaise be damned _ to be somewhere to
greet 2000. Anywhere.

ALLISON NOT BEATEN BY WRIST SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The worst of it came April 3, when the Bruins played
the Philadelphia Flyers at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison had been nursing a wrist injury since March 17,
when he rammed it awkwardly into the boards in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins shut out the Flyers, 3-0, but Allison was in great
distress. He thought the injury was bad enough that he might need
time off to allow it to heal. But Allison has stuck it out,
including a recent stretch of four games in six days, and believes
he has turned the corner _ finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very frustrated during a couple of games, especially
Philly at home,'' said Allison, ``but that was the last time when
it's been a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Bruins off until Thursday, Allison didn't skate at
Monday's practice in Wilmington, and likely will skate only in a
limited way Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to skate but (coach Pat Burns) really didn't want
me to,'' he said. ``Conditioning isn't going to be a problem, so
why even do it? (Tuesday) I'll skate and try to stay away from the
battling and the shots for one more day. Then we still have another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison, the Bruins' leading scorer with 73 points, has played
all 79 games so far and has no intention of missing any when the
regular season winds down with three games in four days beginning
Thursday against the Penguins. He'd rather tough it out to get
tuned up for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up and down for a while, but it's actually felt better
the end of last week,'' he said. ``That was the first encouraging
thing about it. It's no big deal if you get minor pain in it during
a game. It's when it gets to the point where you can't really
perform because you have no grip strength and no feeling in it. It
wasn't like that the end of last week, so it's encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with this little rest here, hopefully it's not as much of
an issue. I'm not expecting it to be a major issue for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Allison came to crying ``uncle'' was after the
Montreal game last Monday. After the pain he had experienced
against the Flyers and the discomfort he went through against the
Canadiens, he thought it might be time for a break. After the game
against Florida Wednesday, he thought it really might be best if he
sat out the next night in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Montreal game, I was like, `I'll see what happens,'
'' he said. ``Then after the first Florida game, it was a little
sore and I was thinking about the next night, but I was like,
`Why?' I've gone this long with two games left and then it didn't
actually feel too bad so there was no question I was going to play
Saturday after the game we lost in Tampa.''
</P>
<P>
   To Burns, Allison is an ironman. The coach said he's rarely seen
a player with the pain threshold of Allison. The major adjustment
the Bruins have had to make is how to use Allison on faceoffs. He
is normally very consistent on draws but has struggled. Burns said
when faceoffs were important, Allison seemed to win them, and when
they weren't, he would lose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of what was happening,'' agreed Allison. ``I'd be
going into draws trying to just do quick ones. I didn't want to get
into tie-ups. I did a couple of games and I'd get other guys to
take the neutral-zone faceoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my forehand, I'm usually pretty good. Most guys are better
on their backhands. I'm pretty even and I just couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said the wrist has improved enough that he expects to be
in top form for the postseason, which the Bruins certainly need.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to sit out, it would've been done before, not
now,'' he said. ``We're going to play three in four nights so it's
a good test anyway to see how it feels. I don't want to make it an
issue. I want to worry about the playoffs and winning games and
going far.''

GIANTS DESPERATELY NEED HELP ON THE OFFENSIVE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SINGELAIS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The tight-lipped New York Giants are as unlikely
to leak their pick in the upcoming NFL draft as the Pentagon is to
tip off its military strategy in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take a spreadsheet and a hard drive full of draft
models to figure out that the Giants are in dire need of help on
the offensive line, a point general manager Ernie Accorsi makes no
effort to dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fortify that,'' he said. ``I won't get any more
specific than that. I'd be less than truthful if I said that wasn't
important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as strong an indication as any that the Giants will enter
the draft on Saturday and Sunday trying to shore up the line. They
could take a lineman as early as their first pick, the 19th overall
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have had little fortune with No. 1 picks this decade.
Only Rodney Hampton, the 24th overall selection in 1990, developed
into a star, becoming New York's career rushing leader.
</P>
<P>
   Fate, however, appears to have dealt the Giants a good hand.
Offensive line depth, especially at tackle, appears to be one of
the strongest areas in this draft.
</P>
<P>
   Various draft pundits project six linemen as first-rounders:
Brigham Young University tackle John Tait; Boston College center
Damien Woody; Wisconsin tackle Aaron Gibson; Georgia tackle Matt
Stinchcomb; Eastern Michigan tackle L.J. Shelton and West Virginia
tackle Solomon Page.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA tackle Kris Farris, BC guard Doug Brzezinski and Penn State
tackle Floyd Wedderburn have been mentioned as high second-round
picks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tackles, like the massive Gibson, who crushes the
scale at 6-foot-6, 380 pounds, might be moved to guard in the NFL
because they don't have the quickness to pass-block on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants take a lineman with their first pick, don't be
surprised if he's plugged into the starting lineup right away. The
Giants have a hole at left guard because starter Greg Bishop, who
wasn't dominating, signed with the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   With little depth behind Bishop, the Giants probably will have
to plug in a rookie at left guard or move right tackle Scott Gragg
over to that position.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi said that other than quarterback, offensive line might
be the hardest position for a rookie to learn. But in this era,
rookies are expected to produce right away because of the money
that's at stake. A team has to find out quickly whether a rookie is
good enough to warrant a long-term extension after his rookie
contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get your value out of them,'' Accorsi said. Though Gibson
seems to be a good risk, Woody could be a smart No. 1 pick because
of his versatility. He can play guard, or he can slide over to
center if Brian Williams fails in his comeback after missing two
seasons with an eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   There is a slight chance the Giants will ignore need in the
first round and go with the best-available-athlete theory. That was
the case last season, when they also needed an offensive lineman
but chose safety Shaun Williams instead. They were stocked at
defensive back, but were stunned when Williams, easily the
highest-rated athlete left on their board, was available when New
York's turn came with the 24th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, used as a nickel back last season, showed promise with
24 tackles and two interceptions. He also had 10 special-teams
tackles. The Giants haven't traded their first-round pick since
1975, a streak that figures to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi said recently that the price to trade up in the first
round probably would be too steep. The Giants aren't willing to
throw in their second-round pick or next year's first-rounder to
move up a few spots. Trading down also is a remote chance, Accorsi
said, unless the Giants get an outstanding offer.

HARVARD TRIES TO CULTIVATE OLD LINK TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIENFUEGOS, Cuba _ A faded carving in the base of a 25-foot palm
tree is the only visible sign of a century-old mystery that
stretches from the sugarcane fields of this Caribbean port to the
ivy-covered halls of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``HARVARD Biological Laboratory,'' the marker reads in sculpted
letters near the entrance to one of the largest botanical gardens
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, these warm, rolling hills on
Cuba's southern coast served as perhaps Harvard's most unique
classrooms. For decades, students came here to do research, while
professors and scientists cross-breeded sugarcane plants or
experimented with rubber trees.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Castro Revolution in 1959, which turned this and
the nearly rest of the country into state-controlled property. That
was followed by a US government embargo against the island, which
strictly limited American access to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harvard is cautiously considering a return to Cienfuegos _
not as the prerevolutionary garden proprietor it once was, but as a
post-Cold War partner in research and cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking at the possibilities of reestablishing
contacts and relationships,'' said John Coatsworth, director of
Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, who
visited the garden last year and has led much of the discussion
about rekindling ties. ``I think it would be great if Harvard could
rebuild its ties to the Cuban scientific community. There's a lot
we could learn from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the garden has grown so much recently that
university officials are planning a workshop with Cuban officials
on future scientific exchanges. And the Massachusetts Historical
Society is planning an exhibit next month to explore the garden's
roots to New England families.
</P>
<P>
   Coatsworth and other Harvard officials insist that the
university has no desire to resume operating the Cienfuegos garden.
</P>
<P>
   But they argue that a new partnership could help refurbish the
200-acre facility, which has suffered from a lack of resources and
battles against the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled between the Sierra Escambray mountains and the
Caribbean, the garden holds more than 2,400 species of plants from
tropical zones native in five continents. It possesses more than
300 species of palms, 89 different types of ficus, 80 varieties of
orchids, and 27 types of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   The garden _ known today as the Jardin Botanico de Soledad _
attracts about 35,000 European and Canadian tourists a year.
Busloads arrive daily for the two-hour tour.
</P>
<P>
   But administrators concede that little research is conducted
now. The laboratories and structures that once teemed with Ivy
League researchers have grown mostly silent. And weeds have become
a new enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we haven't had significant investment,''
said Leonardo Aloma, 68, a former baseball pitcher who has worked
at the garden for the last 30 years. ``More than anything we need
to preserve these collections.''
</P>
<P>
   The garden was begun in 1899 by Edwin F. Atkins, a Massachusetts
businessman whose family owned vast sugar estates near Cienfuegos,
including Pepito Tey, one of the country's largest sugar factories,
across the street from the garden.
</P>
<P>
   With a $2,500 donation, Atkins enlisted Harvard scientists to
study ways to create a stronger species of sugarcane through
cross-breeding, as well as to study pests and diseases that plague
tropical plants. In 1919, a $100,000 endowment was established for
the garden and the university was given a 99-year-lease to run it.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins died in 1926. The university's presence grew. It built
the Harvard House for professors and students and began amassing
its botanical collection. In World War II, the US government
sponsored research at the garden on the use of rubber trees, and
landscaping plants were sent to the US military base to the east at
Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Why Harvard left remains unclear. The Communist Revolution led
by Fidel Castro that came to power in 1959 quickly began taking
over private companies, including the Atkins sugar factory. But
some historians and local residents say the garden was never
formally nationalized.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to the 1962 US embargo, which restricted American
contact with the island. Whatever the reason, the garden stopped
appearing in the university's annual reports by the mid-1960s, and
its operations were taken over by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo was amended four years ago to allow for more
academic and foreign-exchange programs. Since then, about two dozen
American universities have developed programs in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the idea of Harvard returning to Cienfuegos is being
well received by local residents and government officials. Even
among Atkins' descendents _ where there are still some hard
feelings about losing the sugar mill _ there are those who say it's
time to move beyond old Cold War anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely have two countries had such interesting and complex
ties,'' said Chester Atkins, the former Massachusetts congressman
and the patriarch's great-grandson. ``There are enormous
opportunities for collaborative work.''

   MONTREAL _ The call from Canada came in January, telling Eugene
Bowman of Litchfield, Maine, that he'd won a new 1999 Cadillac and
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, the silk-tongued talker said on the other end
of the line, adding that there was just one little bureaucratic
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I needed to pay $2,475.61 for customs and Canadian
taxes,'' said the 67-year-old retired shoe factory worker. ``That
didn't strike me as so unreasonable, with the car coming from a
foreign country. Anyway, all I was really thinking was, `So,
finally I got lucky!' ''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman emptied his meager bank account and got a check right off
to Toronto, as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   He's still waiting for the car, although no longer with any
hope. ``I got hurt bad, lost all the savings I had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When telephone scam artists reach out to put the touch on
someone these days, it's likely to be from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States cracks down hard on phone fraud, Canada
offers a haven for shady operators who bilk hundreds of millions of
dollars each year from thousands of mostly elderly victims in the
United States. The big draw of Canada is that the country's
notoriously soft criminal sentencing standards mean that even
repeat offenders operate almost with impunity, paying small fines
or serving laughable ``community service'' sentences that barely
qualify as wrist slaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an incredible lack of empathy in the court
system, even though lives are devastated and savings wiped out,''
said Staff Sergeant Barry Elliott of the Ontario Provincial Police.
``This is brutal, heartless crime that targets senior citizens. But
it also seems to be the last crime where it's OK to blame the
victims as stupid or greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's other appeal for telemarketing fraud is that the simple
fact of an international boundary makes policing and prosecution
much more difficult. In some cases, Canadian prosecutors have
simply dropped charges against massive fraud rings because of
jurisdictional complications, coupled with the cost and headache of
bringing in victims and witnesses from another country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-border fraud with Americans being targeted from Canada
is absolutely the new trend in telemarketing crime,'' said Bridget
A. Small, a phone crime specialist with the Washington-based
American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every operation they shut down in Quebec or Ontario, four
or five seem to take its place,'' Small said. ``It's just become a
huge, huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Canada take the crime seriously, as do politicians
stung by recent criticisms from the US government and an array of
American consumer groups. But Canadian courts show an extraordinary
tolerance for a breed of criminals preying on the lonely, the
naive, and the vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, a Canadian judge, J.W. Bovard, actually
praised a Quebec fraud artist with a lengthy criminal record for
``creating jobs'' by hiring con men to cheat people out of $364,000
over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bovard also found it a mitigating circumstance that Peter
McMahon had ``paid utility bills and things like that,'' so
sentenced the Quebecer to a few months of house arrest at his
residence in Montreal's upper-crust Westmount district. The
toughest part of the penalty? During that period he was supposed to
inform police when he traveled out of the province or to the United
States on business.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was typical for Canada, and the court, just as
typically, essentially ignored the fact that McMahon had a record
of fraud, assault, and theft convictions stretching over three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is pretty clear that criminals don't have much to
fear from the Canadian justice system,'' said Elliott, who heads
the Ontario-based Phonebusters antifraud unit, which coordinates
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Montreal police, and other
Canadian forces in targeting phone crime.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, police say, Montreal has emerged as
the new capital of telemarketing fraud in North America, with
Toronto and Vancouver closing in behind.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of swindlers still plying their trade in the
United States, of course, but this year, Attorney General Janet
Reno, in an unusual swipe at Canada, decried the ``significant
increase'' in Canadian-based scams that dupe American victims into
thinking they've won some sort of Canadian lottery or sweepstake.
</P>
<P>
   One such scam cost a 62-year-old Marlborough, Mass., woman
$2,111.95. That was the amount she was told had to be paid to cover
``Canadian fees'' after a caller told her she'd won $50,000 in the
nonexistent International Value Sweepstakes. ``The man on the phone
was just so polite, so convincing _ he even said `God bless you'
twice,'' said the Marlborough woman, who asked that her name not be
published. She lives with her disabled husband and used a credit
card to pay Western Union to dispatch the money order. ``It was a
bad mistake trusting that voice on the other end of the line. We
learned an expensive lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Police caution that no legitimate contest will require winners
to pay a fee or tax, and urge Americans who suspect they are being
targeted by a scam to contact the Phonebusters squad toll-free at
888-495-8501.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's relatively easy treatment of criminals has long
astonished US law enforcement officials, and is hardly a secret to
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone has a tremendous urge to commit a crime, they should
definitely do it in Canada,'' one of the country's most prominent
defense lawyers, Edward Greenspan, is quoted as saying in the March
issue of American Lawyer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the haul from cross-border telemarketing scams was
negligible. American con artists mainly worked the United States,
while their Canadian counterparts usually stuck to cheating their
own compatriots. But now police estimate that Canadian fraud rings
are hauling in nearly $500 million a year from tens of thousands of
US victims.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there has been a dramatic stiffening of
penalties for crimes targeting the elderly, especially
telemarketing fraud. Sentences of 5 to 10 years in prison are
routine, especially with repeat offenders or perpetrators who foist
their scams on large numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   But to the north it's another story _ suspended sentences or
fines are the rule. Even when the fine is stiff, it's not much of a
deterrent, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fine of even $100,000 is just a cost of doing business for a
criminal who is pulling in millions,'' Elliott said. ``There's
nothing like jail time to crimp a crook's style. But sentencing for
this kind of crime in Canada is years behind the US.''
</P>
<P>
   As the din of complaints from the United States grows louder _
even President Bill Clinton has raised the issue, in a summit
meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chretien _ Canadian judges may
start to take a somewhat tougher line.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for the first time in Canada, a judge in Quebec
handed down prison sentences to four Montreal-based telemarketers
who had scammed millions of dollars while operating lottery scams
under such company names as American Family Publishers, Publishers
Central, and First Canadian Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The four received prison terms ranging from two to six months, a
sentence so severe for this type of offense that it was front-page
news.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians packed off to prison are eligible for parole after
serving one-third of their sentence, so the four could be back
within a week or two, punching out American area codes from a
telephone ``boiler room'' in Montreal.

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dan Richardson sat in the cramped, green, pre-op
room of a Virginia hospital, an intravenous drip in his arm. Soon,
he would be wheeled him into an operating room for three hours of
spinal surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Then he spotted the telephone. There was still time. He had his
laptop computer. This school headmaster can't leave home without
it. He could e-mail!
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 57, is not alone in his fascination with electronic
mail. The number of adult Internet users in the United States
jumped from 23 million in April 1997 to 53 million last December
_2027 percent of the U.S. adult population _ said Stuart Gibbel,
director of marketing for Cyber Dialogue, an on-line market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Hotmail, the free Web-based e-mail system, boasts 30 million
subscribers. Personal daily messages in North America are expected
to skyrocket from 500 million last year to 1.5 billion in 2002,
said Mike Shirer of Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.,
technology research firm.
</P>
<P>
   E-mailers send messages, from a word or line to a book-size
document, via computer. No paper. No pen. No envelope, stamp or
worrisome time zones. Pour your heart out at 2 a.m. without waking
anyone up.
</P>
<P>
   This quick hit links grandmothers, long-lost friends and, of
course, teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fascinating mixture of letter-writing and
telephoning,'' said John Suler, psychology professor at Rider
University in Lawrenceville, N.J. ``You communicate at your leisure
rather than on demand, and it lacks face-to-face cues, which
encourages people to open up a bit more. It's already as
influential in people's lives as the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Waitt, 64, of Rexford, N.Y., got a garbled telephone
message that a friend had died, but it was unclear who. To get
answers, she got on her computer. Vacationing in Aruba, she plunked
down $5 in a shop to e-mail home and check the condition of a
terminally ill friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons I like this because it gives me so
much information about the folks back home in Massachusetts,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buck Malen, 48, a bassist for the band Susan and the Surftones,
keeps late hours. He catches up with e-mail and a cup of tea in the
late mornings. ``It's like Dad reading the morning paper or opening
the mail,'' he said. ``I've gotten in touch with an awful lot of my
friends who I would never be in contact with due to the cost of
phone bills, in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, New Orleans
people all over the country,'' said Malen, who lives in Troy, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Malen likes jokes, too. He forwards his daily favorites to 40 or
50 friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the jokes. The jokes. Some love 'em. Some hate 'em. Why do
so many people send them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Duh! Because I like jokes!'' said Luis Morales, an
Irvine, Calif., graphic designer and sales manager whose territory
includes Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   He sure does. He sends jokes about five times a day, to about 30
friends, clients and co-workers in English and in Spanish. In the
midst of a national debate over inappropriate office banter,
Morales gleefully forwards sexist and ethnic jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are political (meaning Clinton) jokes, religious jokes,
and I'm sure there isn't a one of them that wouldn't offend someone
somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If bad jokes are bothersome, spam (junk e-mail) is a pestilence,
e-mail users say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears in my in-coming mailbox every day,'' Suler said.
``I find it offensive, since it violates the `personal space' of
e-mail. It also violates the old philosophy of the Internet being
strictly noncommercial.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail use is spiraling upward, Suler said. ``The more you
e-mail, the more relationships you develop, the more you need to
continue e-mailing in order to stay connected to your colleagues
and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, head of school at Cape Henry Collegiate School in
Virginia Beach, admits he's compulsive. Every day he writes his
journal, then e-mails it to family, friends and colleagues. Not
everyone reads it. But many do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny because I kind of look forward to my little daily
message and I get this little glimpse into Dan's life,'' said
Meredith Davies Hadaway, vice president for college relations and
publications at Washington College in Chestertown, Md., a former
student of Richardson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel like one of those people who watches someone on
the Internet. I watch him daily and I know his kids and I know Pat,
so it's great fun. I feel like, as long as he keeps doing that,
we're always going to keep in touch.''

HANCOCK YIELDS TO THE MIGHTY YEN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, the sweet simplicity of modern-day economic morality.
</P>
<P>
   It goes like this: the bigger the economic stake, the stronger
the urge to ignore assorted moral dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   Consider China.
</P>
<P>
   China's Premier Zhu Rongji failed last week to close a deal for
China to enter the World Trade Organization. But don't count him or
a deal out. The reason is obvious in every stop on the Chinese
leader's ongoing six-city tour of America, including Wednesday's
scheduled stop in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's business _ as usual.
</P>
<P>
   For another example, take a look at John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. of Boston. Last week, it joyously joined three
Western insurers in winning approval from Beijing to sell life
insurance in China. ``We are delighted by this news,'' Hancock's
chief executive, Stephen L. Brown, said in a statement. ``China is
the major emerging market for US financial institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   And delighted Brown should be. All those Chinese _ 1.3 billion
of them _ potentially in need of whole life policies! Given the
Chinese government's track record for repression, some of those
lives may be more at risk than others, but surely Hancock's
actuaries can factor fallout from human rights violations into
their longevity tables.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, Raymond L. Flynn, the former Boston
mayor and Clinton's former ambassador to the Vatican, joined
demonstrators who accused the Chinese government of violating
Tibetans' human rights. ``Seems like our foreign policy is more
concerned about trade deals, profits, and multinational
international corporations than it is with human rights and
religious freedom,'' said Flynn, now president of the Catholic
Alliance, a lay organization that mobilizes Catholics to become
politically active.
</P>
<P>
   Wake up and read the fortune cookies, Ray. Of course our foreign
policy is more concerned with trade deals and corporate profits
than it is with human rights, religious freedom, or even the
possible theft of nuclear secrets by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wavered last week and walked away from a
China-WTO deal. Perhaps he was distracted by the human rights
violations in Kosovo, where market expectations are relatively low
and morality concerns are consequently high. Or perhaps he was
worried that a deal with China would give his political opponents a
new reason to raise questions about surreptitious Chinese donations
to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the rationale for Clinton's wariness, business
blanched. As Maurice R. ``Hank'' Greenberg, chairman of American
International Group, told The Wall Street Journal: ``To have missed
that opportunity and to have the prime minister, who went out on a
limb on many of the issues, to go home empty-handed that way is
just not only puzzling; it is hard for anyone who understands
US-China relations to get any kind of a sense of the thought
process on this.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hancock spokesman says Brown, too, has been a consistent
proponent of a WTO deal for China and has written letters to
Congress on China's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's failure to seal a WTO deal has no effect on Hancock's
China venture, the spokesman said. Hancock's plans _ which are
essentially dictated by the Chinese government _ call for it to do
business with a Chinese joint venture partner selected by the
Chinese and to reinvest money from the venture back into China.
They follow months of careful negotiations and courtesy trips to
China; Brown even traveled there with George Bush as his personal
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's top executive walked the walk with the Chinese and he
is not alone. Wednesday, when Zhu is scheduled to land at Logan, a
greeting party ordered up by the Chinese will be on the tarmac to
welcome the Chinese premier. It is expected to include the
governor, the mayor, a Hancock delegation, and other business and
academic representatives.
</P>
<P>
   After addressing an audience at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, the premier will lunch at the Boston Park Plaza. The
luncheon is hosted by the China Forum _ a collaboration of
Boston-area business groups, including the law firm of Foley, Hoag
&AMP; Eliot. It is scheduled to include remarks by Governor Cellucci,
Hancock's Brown and Patrick J. McGovern, head of Boston-based
International Data Group, a worldwide publisher of technology
magazines and newsletters.
</P>
<P>
   The protest movement that began in Tiananmen Square happened 10
years ago this month. In a world based upon the ever-popular theory
of economic morality, that is ancient history. All the writing in
the world cannot force us to honor that still-searing image of a
single student standing up, in the name of democracy, to an armored
tank.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the yen is so much mightier than the pen.

 &HT;    DRUGS COVERAGE COULD DOUBLE MEDICARE PREMIUMS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare
would increase the program's cost by 7 to 13 percent over the next
decade, the non-partisan National Academy of Social Insurance
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug benefit were financed solely out of premiums, it
would roughly double the cost of Medicare for its 38 million
elderly and disabled beneficiaries, said Robert Reischauer of the
Brookings Institution, a leader of the academy's project on
Medicare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the first outside analysis of how much it would
cost for Medicare to cover prescription drugs by a group that does
not have a financial or ideological stake in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at five different ways of providing a drug
benefit using different deductibles, copayments and levels of
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10-year period, a coverage plan with a $200 deductible,
20 percent copayment and $2,000 maximum benefit, adjusted for
inflation, would add about 10 percent to the overall cost of
Medicare, the study indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Plans that paid all drug costs at thresholds over $1,000 to
$3,000 would, over the decade, increase Medicare expenses by about
7 percent to 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The question of a prescription drug benefit may be one of the
most difficult facing lawmakers who want to reform Medicare.
President Clinton has said he wants any Medicare reform to include
prescription drug coverage, but has not indicated how it would be
structured.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan commission on Medicare's future created by Congress
failed to adopt a reform recommendation last month, partly because
of deep divisions over whether _ and how _ to include a
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress are working on Medicare reform
proposals, and most are expected to include some form of drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most private insurance policies, Medicare _ which was
created in 1965 primarily to cover hospital and physician costs _
does not cover prescription drugs. Yet medication frequently is
replacing surgery as a medical procedure, and many Medicare
patients have chronic conditions that require costly drugs that
were not available when the program began.
</P>
<P>
   The average Medicare beneficiary last year paid about $200 in
out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, but a significant portion
pay far more, said Michael E. Gluck, the academy's director of
health policy studies. About 4.5 million beneficiaries paid more
than $1,000, and another 1.3 million beneficiaries paid more than
$2,000 for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study indicated that about 65 percent of retirees have
some form of drug coverage, either through supplementary
``Medigap'' policies, the state-federal Medicaid program for the
poor, or an employer benefit. But Reischauer said that percentage
is rapidly shrinking as employers stop providing health coverage to
former workers and the cost of Medigap insurance rises.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing policy makers is whether prescription drugs
should be covered through social insurance, similar to doctor and
hospital costs, or be left to individuals, Reischauer said. He
argued that drugs should be brought into the Medicare program and
covered nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against a Medicare drug benefit are insurance companies
and the pharmaceutical industry. Both groups fear it would lead to
government control of drug prices.

<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ Don't get Patricia Schena started.
</P>
<P>
   From behind the counter at the Trolley Gift Card Shop on Main
Street, Schena begins a slow boil as she tells how she left
``Taxachusetts'' for New Hampshire, the no-tax state, six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxes up here are outrageous,'' she fumes. ``God knows
what's around the corner. I think we already pay enough.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire has always prided itself on a utilitarian approach
to government. Its bureaucracy is small, its regulations
unobtrusive, and there's no income or sales tax. People here mean
it when they say, ``Live Free or Die.''
</P>
<P>
   But citizens also know that the state's aura of rugged
conservatism is a myth. Taxes abound, in the smallest of places,
from Salem's $10 residence fee to a tax on house buyers and sellers
to a legion of other obscure levies.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers suggested an
entertainment tax on movie tickets, gym memberships, and even video
rentals, all in an effort to fund the public schools without
imposing an income tax.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, New Hampshire residents have the lowest tax burden,
as a percentage of personal income, in the country. But to
taxpayers and homeowners like Schena, the range of taxes, and the
proposals for more, feels like death by a thousand pinpricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, you won't have to pay an income tax or a sales tax, but
they'll nickel-and-dime you to death,'' said John Camobreco, a
political science professor at the University of New Hampshire.
``Don't expect to get anything for free up here. If you go to any
state park, you'll pay. If you go to any state beaches, you pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The current focus on taxes results from the Supreme Court's 1997
ruling that the current system of raising money for education with
local property taxes is unconstitutional. The Legislature and the
governor missed an April 1 deadline the court set on school funding
because of the reluctance of political leaders to enact an income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over whom to tax, how to tax, and what amount to tax
has been dramatic and drawn out.
</P>
<P>
   The latest plan before the Legislature would step up the
scattershot approach to raising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the pending bipartisan proposal would include a new
statewide property tax, a new 8 percent tax on car rentals, a new 2
percent excise tax on car sales and leases, and a new 1 percent
consumption tax on services from lawyers, mechanics, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Existing taxes would go up under the plan. Cigarette taxes would
rise by 25 cents a pack, the real estate transfer tax would
increase to $7.50 per $1,000, and a business-profits tax would rise
from 7 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, New Hampshire has been especially creative at
funding the government without a broad-based tax. More than 40
states use either an income tax or a sales tax. And states that
don't use one of those major taxes usually have another special
income stream.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska, for example, draws money from its gushing oil, forgoing
both an income and a sales tax. Wyoming has no income tax and
Montana has no sales tax, but both tax the extraction of coal from
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire doesn't have oil or coal or other minerals to
enrich its coffers. Instead, the Granite State has used a patchwork
approach to raising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Schena says, is that every time she turns around it
seems like she has to pay another tax. For example, she pays both a
town tax and a fee to the state to register her car. She pays a
gasoline tax at the pump, and her husband pays a tax when he buys
his cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The state adds a communications tax on every telephone bill.
Many highways have tolls.
</P>
<P>
   To go hunting or fishing requires a license from the state,
which costs money. To visit a park there's another fee. Staying in
a hotel or eating at a restaurant means an 8 percent state tax.
</P>
<P>
   The state also collects money from people who save and invest.
Stock dividends and interest are taxed at a 5 percent rate. All
insurance policies are slapped with a 2 percent premium tax.
Inheritances face an unusually high 18 percent estate and legacy
tax, though there is an exemption for lineal descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses have their own set of taxes to pay. There is the
business-profits tax and the business enterprise tax. And companies
that want to sell securities in New Hampshire must pay a securities
tax.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the system has stood the test of time. Doug Scamman, the
former Republican speaker of the House, said the Legislature has
long looked for the least disruptive method of raising money. That
has resulted, he said, in a mix of smaller taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Hampshire is rated amongst the top places to live,'' he
said. ``Part of it is the social ramifications of our tax policy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a public policy, but a mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think the public prefers to be nickel-and-dimed
because you don't pay it out all at once,'' said William Pound, the
executive director of the National Conference of State
Legislatures. ``There's a psychology to it that makes it easier
sometimes to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, New Hampshire's approach has had its advantages. Because
the state is long and narrow and borders Massachusetts, Vermont and
Maine, Scamman said the lack of a sales tax is a boon to retailers.
The system of many small levies also makes it more difficult to
raise tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But the education funding crisis means that taxes, whatever
their form, now must go up. Schena, who used to live in Everett,
says she understands there's no such thing as living tax-free.
Still, she's feeling mighty miffed these days, especially since her
children are grown and out of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we moved from Massachusetts is because the taxes
were too high,'' she explained. ``They used to call it
Taxachusetts, and everyone ran over the state line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do we go from here?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It began as a lover's quarrel. Yolanda Torres accused
her live-in boyfriend Gerardo Ruiz Esposito of sleeping with
another woman. The two argued. He said Torres dug her nails into
his chest. She said he pushed her against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1997, police took a cuffed Ruiz to jail. Both of
them thought he would be out in a day.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly two years later, Ruiz is still in prison, in Unit BN1
of the Plymouth County Correctional Facility, living alongside
convicted rapists, thieves, and sexual predators.
</P>
<P>
   And it is where Ruiz, a Nicaraguan citizen, will stay until he
is granted asylum or deported _ an unlikely possibility in the near
future because Hurricane Mitch ravaged his country.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz represents a growing presence among prison inmates:
Immigration and Naturalization detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The law enables the INS to deport immigrants who commit even
relatively minor crimes. But when the small-time criminals have no
place to go, they end up languishing in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans whom Fidel Castro won't accept. Iranian nationals. People
from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. And immigrants from Honduras and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act, which went into effect in October 1998, also
requires that undocumented immigrants awaiting political asylum
hearings remain in prison _ even if the appeal process takes years.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 16,000 people detained by the INS in prisons
throughout the country, according to INS figures. Within a year,
that number is expected, by some estimates, to reach 24,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS is becoming a sort of new bureau of prisons,'' said Arthur
C. Helton, an immigration and refugee law professor at New York
University. ``It's a senseless policy because it subjects
individuals to arbitrary detention in violation of human rights
laws.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not dangerous criminals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Keber, a Boston immigration attorney, said he has
several Cambodian clients who have been detained in prisons for
more than a year, even though it is clear they cannot return home
because Cambodia will not accept them.
</P>
<P>
   If they were dangerous criminals with long rap sheets, that
would be fine, Keber said. But they're not. One of his clients was
convicted of one offense _ striking his girlfriend, a crime that,
while troubling, does not make him a menace to society, Keber said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these abound, such as the case of a Korean man who
stole a car and might be deported back to a country where he has no
family and does not know the language.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Howard was born Cho Tung Jo in Korea, but came to
America when he was 5 to join his adoptive parents, Karen and
William Howard, in Lakeville.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 23, Howard has been held in prison since June 1995,
awaiting deportation. Auto theft is a deportable offense, but a
state judge later vacated the charge, court records showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basis of this order of deportation has been eliminated,''
his attorney, Hazel Inglis of New Bedford, said. ``I don't know why
they're not releasing him. Immigration is treating everyone the
same, as if they were alien terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Karen Howard, an adjunct professor of Holocaust
studies at Merrimack College, said that sending Timothy to Korea
would be worse than a long prison sentence: It would be like
banishment to another world, because he knows no one there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shattered our family,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Verdean community in Dorchester has been especially
hard hit by INS detainments and deportations. Officials conducted a
morning raid in mid-January, rounding up more than a dozen Cape
Verdean youths with records of street crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men had committed serious felonies, but others had
committed minor crimes, including the case of an 18-year-old whose
only crime was shoplifting a CD. After being detained for about two
weeks, INS let him go, according to the Cape Verdean consulate in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the legislation du jour,'' Jose Macedo, an immigration
attorney of Cape Verdean decent, said of Congressional law that
allows INS to deport people even for relatively minor crimes.
``It's part of an anti-immigrant backlash. Congress has no sympathy
for immigrants.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Toughening the law &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act in 1996, an amendment intended to toughen
immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   The new law redefined the term ``aggravated felony'' to include
any crime dealing with theft, money laundering, violence, or drug
trafficking in which a person is given a one-year sentence, even if
it is a suspended sentence. With one conviction, an immigrant is
deportable, even if that person has lived in the United States for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   It also required INS agencies to incarcerate any illegal
immigrant, even if the person is applying for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Boston district office director of INS says the laws go
too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that some of those provisions are harsh,''
said District Director Steven Farquharson. ``It has harsh
consequences for people who have been here for many years. What's
made it so onerous is that descretion doesn't exist any more. I
would certainly like to have more discretion to look at individuals
on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson said it bothers him that a person can be deported
for committing one minor crime. But his hands are tied by
Congressional law. And, because of the law, he said, INS workers
have to scramble to find places to house the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   There are 416 people being detained in Rhode Island, New
Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, said Paula Grenier, a
spokeswoman for the Boston Regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Although immigrant advocates say there are hundreds of people
who have been in jail for years, Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for INS
in Washington, insisted that just is not true.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said the average number of days a person remains in
detention is 60, which is because most people do not have anything
to base an appeal on _ either they are here illegally, or have
committed serious crimes. He said a majority of those being
detained because they have committed a crime are also here
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   But Helton said the 60-day figure is skewed because it takes
into account people who might have been detained for a couple of
days and requested immediate deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Many detainees are forced to choose among untenable options:
Either accept deportation or remain in prison for however long it
takes to appeal their case. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fearing oppression &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Ruiz Esposito sneaked into the United States from
Nicaragua, where he was a National Guard intelligence officer under
the US-backed Samoza government. After the Sandinistas wrestled
control away from Anastasio Samoza in 1979, Ruiz and scores of
other National Guard officers were put in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz remained in prison for eight years, and was released in in
1987. He fled the country, saying members of the new military
regime had told him to either leave or die. After working in
various Latin American countries, he crossed the US border
illegally in 1990. He said a border patrol officer caught him and
placed him in temporary detention in Harligen, Texas, a place where
people could walk in and out of freely. He left, he said, fearing
what would happen to him. Many Central American specialists say it
is common for people such as Ruiz to flee, because they have come
to associate police with oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz applied for political asylum, nonetheless, and lived in
Washington, DC, for many years, at the address he listed on his
asylum form. Three years ago, he moved to Rhode Island because he
heard there were better paying jobs. His job prospects soured, but
Ruiz met a woman, fell in love, and moved in with her.
</P>
<P>
   In a small conference room at the Plymouth County Correctional
Facility, Ruiz admitted he cheated on his girlfriend, Yolanda
Torres. But he says he never hit her.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a quarrel over his affair that Torres began
punching him, Ruiz said. Torres could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said as he held her arms, to keep her from punching him,
his elbow slipped and hit her in the head.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, a judge gave him a one-year suspended sentence and
a year probation on the simple assault conviction. That is when INS
agents began looking at his case, to see whether it was a
deportable offense. When they found out he was from Nicaragua,
living in the United States without documentation, it made his case
murky. Ruiz cannot be sent back because of a temporary order
banning deportations to Nicaragua, because of the damage caused by
Hurricane Mitch. And his political asylum application had not been
processed in the nine years he has been in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   David McHaffey, an attorney with the Political Asylum
Immigration Representation Project in Boston, said Ruiz could well
be in danger if he is deported back to Nicaragua. Even though the
government is now filled with Samoza party officials, Ruiz could be
tortured or killed by those seeking retribution because he could
have been responsible for the death of Sandinistas.
</P>
<P>
   McHaffey said Ruiz could be in jail for years because of the
backlog. He said he has processed claims for clients going back to
1990 that still have not been heard. ``There's not enough people to
process'' the claims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said someone such as Ruiz should be placed on electronic
monitoring instead of spending thousands of dollars to keep him
incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration laws have to change, he said, otherwise the prison
population will swell. It is costing taxpayers about $500 million
this year, he said, an amount that is expected to increase rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a senseless policy because it subjects individuals to
arbitrary detention in violation of human rights laws,'' Helton
said. ``It's an insult to international rights laws.''

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TROOPS _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. last assessed the
requirements of a ground presence months ago and Pentagon officials
say they haven't been asked to update that proposal, even as a
contingency. Given that the political and military dynamic in
Yugoslavia has changed immeasurably since NATO bombs began falling,
is that original plan still relavant, and if not how long would it
take to develop a new one? Has the question of whether U.S. troops
could reach the Balkan pennisula quickly enough to be effective
already been answered? Developing. (Montgomery, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ TIRANA, Albania _ Staggering toward the
Albanian border, the rag-tag refugee convoy was stopped near the
town of Dakovica by soldiers, who picked out an attractive young
woman, asked her age then ordered her to come with them. Terrified,
she ran and was shot dead, according to eyewitnesses who described
their horrifying encounter in a region where the Pentagon says Serb
forces may be systematically raping women in an army camp where as
many as 20 women are believed to have been killed. Developing.

   MONEYREFORM _ Campaign finance reform advocates kick off a drive
Tuesday to pass reform legislation amid optimism that Republican
opposition to the measure will buckle this year. But reformers are
also divided over how to make a deal with the GOP, with many
Democrats ready to increase federal contribution limits in exchange
for a ban on soft money. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

him as an accessory in the 1995 disappearance of atheist Madalyn
O'Hair and her family. Karr, it appears, didn't disappoint them.
Investigators had no warrants, yet an FBI agent later testified

LEARNING WHILE THEY TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some parts of the United States, they call those fizzy soft
drinks ``soda.'' In other regions, the word is ``pop.'' Thus, when
one girl's family moved to another state, she soon acquired the
nickname of ``Soda Pop'' because she had moved from pop country to
the land of soda. (Good thing she didn't move to Boston _ they'd
have to call her ``Tonic Pop''!)
</P>
<P>
   That anecdote appears in ``Travel Wise with Children: 101
Educational Travel Tips for Families'' by Mary Rodgers Bundren
(Inprint Publishing, $12.95). It's part of Tip 4, which says that
travel is a good way to increase your child's vocabulary while
having fun doing so. Here are a couple of Bundren's suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   --Make a list of new words and phrases your child might
encounter on your trip: historical names, locations, animals,
people, and words like ``spelunker'' and ``catamaran.'' Have the
youngster keep a list of the new words, including regional ones
like the aformentioned ``pop.'' Then on the way home, play games
with the vocabulary. ``What are some synonyms? Rhyming words? What
is the funniest word? Take the longest word and see how many other
words can be made from the word.''
</P>
<P>
   --Every time a child sees a word from her list on a billboard,
or anywhere, give her a bingo chip (known in some areas as a beano
chip). At the end of the trip, perhaps those chips can be exchanged
for a special souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   That's one educational tip. For the other 100, you'll have to
read the book. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel trivia: Let's play a game, kids. If you insert a two-letter
man's name into the name of this country, you get an entirely
different country. What's the man's name and what are the
countries? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``The car trip can draw the family together, as it was in
the days before television when parents and children actually
talked to each other.'' _ Andrew H. Malcolm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: In Australia, Burger Kings are known as Happy Jack
restaurants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tornado watch: This month, the Tennessee Tornado, said to be the
world's first spiral-loop roller coaster, opens at Dolly Parton's
Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., as does the Southern
Gospel Music Hall of Fame and Museum. The grand opening celebration
is to take place April 17 and 18. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis., proudly
calls itself the world's foremost circus history museum. And while
the museum is open year round, from May 8 through Sept. 6, the
50-acre site offers programming and exhibits that should delight
the young, the old, and the in-between. Among them: big-top circus
performances, interactive programming, parades, concerts,
demonstrations, 200 antique circus wagons, and a new $1 million
facility where visitors can watch circus wagons being restored.
There is a nominal charge. For more information, call
608-356-0800. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Freebie: A guide to family fun in 10 North American cities is now
available from Inter-Continental Hotels. The Kids' City Guide has
information on sightseeing, attractions, restaurants, shopping,
baby-sitting, and medical services in New York, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, New Orleans, Dallas, Montreal, Toronto, Miami, Chicago,
and Washington, D.C. Guides are available at Inter-Continental
hotels in those cities or by calling 800-615-6085 or by visiting
www.interconti.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hit the road, toad: The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World has an
attraction coming to Fantasyland this summer called ``The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' and the park promises ``one hunny
of a ride.'' Undoubtedly it will be, with cars shaped like honey
pots that bounce and float. But, alas, the attraction replaces
``Mister Toad's Wild Ride.'' Sure, the special effects in ``Toad''
were primitive by today's theme-park standards, but many parkgoers
held the attraction so dear to their hearts that an Internet
campaign to ``Save the Toad'' drew a response from thousands. But
the ride is gone, and we are among those who shed a tear for the
toad. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Inserting ``al'' into ``Austria'' gets you
``Australia.''

UNIVERSAL'S NEW THEME PARK PROMISES A WILD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Was I really going to do this?
</P>
<P>
   Was I, at the advanced age of 58, going to allow myself to be
strapped in and then sent hurling and whirling on one of the
world's newest, fastest, and high-tech roller coasters?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I was. And it was all in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   I was at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure, a 110-acre,
$2.7 billion theme park that officially opens next month. People
who buy certain combination tickets can now visit, but when I went
in mid-March, the park was open only to employees and the
occasional newsman who never grew up.
</P>
<P>
   The ride that my reporting duty beckoned me to is named the
Incredible Hulk Coaster, after that great, green, gruesome,
superhero of TV and comic-book fame. As I shakily climbed into my
seat, I looked around. I was next to two strapping fellows in their
20s. Behind me and in front of me was a sea of teenagers. All
appeared eager to join in the pretense that we were about to be
shot out of a gamma ray booster.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it didn't take much pretending. Soon after the ride
began, we were blasted from zero to 40 m.p.h. in just two seconds,
with the same thrust as an Air Force fighter-attack jet. Then came
the loops and rolls: I saw the sky. I saw the ground. I went
weightless. I went upside-down. I went sideways. I almost lost my
eyeglasses. I almost lost my lunch. After two minutes and 15
seconds (or was it an eternity?), the ride was over and I literally
staggered off while my fellow passengers shouted things like
``Wow!'', ``Now that's fast!'' and ``That was the coolest! Let's go
on again!''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just as well that I didn't learn until later that
our first complete loop had begun 100 feet from the ground. I
further learned that at night the metal coaster track glows green _
the approximate color of my face right about then. In all, we 32
passengers experienced seven rollovers and plunged into two deep
subterranean enclosures. When I calmed down, I actually took pride
in my accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios likewise is taking pride in its
accomplishment: creating what it proclaims to be the world's most
technologically advanced theme park. Islands of Adventure, in fact,
is a crucial part of a new 840-acre resort complex called Universal
Studios Escape. The other sections are the highly popular Universal
Studios Florida theme park and movie studio, and a new
shopping-dining-entertainment district called CityWalk. All are
within walking distance of the other, and boat shuttles will also
be available. Later this year, the first of the resort's hotels,
Portofino Bay, will open.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Islands of Adventure that will be generating most of
the talk. With the idea of offering something for all ages and
interests, the park consists of five themed islands surrounded by a
lake. Those islands are Seuss Landing, the Lost Continent, Jurassic
Park, Toon Lagoon, and Marvel Super Hero Island, where that Hulk
Coaster looms. There is also an architecturally wild Port of Entry,
where you can get oriented to the attractions, souvenir shops, and
eateries that dot the park.
</P>
<P>
   When I visited Islands of Adventure, the smell of paint was
fresh and the clang of construction was audible. Several key rides
were still being tweaked so I didn't get to go on them. Nor did I
get to watch the live-action shows that will be part of the park.
But I saw enough to opine that if people have the time and money
for yet another Central Florida attraction a few miles from Walt
Disney World, if everything works as it's supposed to, and if the
wait lines for the attractions are tolerable, Universal could have
a hulking hit on its hands. So watch your tail, Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the islands:
</P>
<P>
   Seuss Landing. This one's primarily for the kiddies, but anyone
should get a kick out of the ultra-vibrant colors, music, and
whimsy that bring to life the famous books of Theodor ``Dr. Seuss''
Geisel. If your children aren't familiar with the Seuss books, do
read them to the youngsters before you visit.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively gentle rides include the Cat in the Hat, which
takes riders through the pages of that classic book; the
Caro-Seuss-el, with a marvelous array of Seuss characters to ride
upon; and One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, where you might get
squirted if you don't follow instructions. There are also
interactive play areas such as If I Ran the Zoo and a Green Eggs
and Ham Cafe where, yes, you can have green eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Toon Lagoon. Here, two-dimensional comics characters get a third
dimension, and although some of them might seem some distance from
the cutting edge of comicdom _ Popeye and Beetle Bailey come to
mind _ the lagoon seems like fun. Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls is
a flume ride involving a 40,000-gallon lagoon, a drop through the
roof of a dynamite shack, and a dive 15 feet below water level.
Popeye &AMP; Bluto's Bilge-Rat Barges is a twisting, turning
white-water raft ride with a top speed of 16 feet per second. A
giant octopus and water cannons are also part of it, so count on
getting wet.
</P>
<P>
   Toon Lagoon also has interactive play areas and a Comic Strip
Lane inhabited by the likes of Hagar the Horrible and Krazy Kat _
80 ``classic'' characters in all. You can sate your appetite at
such places as Cathy's Ice Cream Parlor and a sandwich shop called
Blondie's Home of the Dagwood, with one humongous make-believe
sandwich sprouting from the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel's Super Hero Island. The Incredible Hulk Coaster is only
one of three thrill rides on this island. I just missed visiting
the Amazing Adventures of Spiderman before it was closed for the
day for fine-tuning. Boo-hoo: I wish I could have experienced the
mixture of moving ride vehicles, a 3-D film, and special effects.
The attraction has been compared to Universal Studios Florida's
``Back to the Future: The Ride'' but without the jolting and
shaking and with even more effects. Be forewarned, though: One
feature is a ``sensory drop'' 400 feet into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by my Hulk adventure, I did go on Doctor Doom's
Fearfall, which consists of two 200-foot towers of steel. Zoom _
with feet dangling, I was fired to the top at breathtaking speed.
But the ride wasn't operating at full speed yet and the return to
the bottom was nowhere as fast as it's going to be. (I was kind of
glad about that.)
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park. Almost everybody loves dinosaurs, and these
fluidly moving animatronic creatures may be the next best thing to
a living, breathing dino. They will respond to visitors by blinking
their eyes, flinching at their touch, and, in the case of the
spitters, spurting water on unsuspecting guests.
</P>
<P>
   The Jurassic Park River Adventure takes you to the
dinosaur-infested park of book and movie fame. (A similar ride is a
hit at Universal Studios Hollywood). Watch out for Tyrannosaurus
Rex . . . and the 85-foot-plunge down what Universal maintains is
the longest, fastest, steepest water descent ever built.
</P>
<P>
   At Triceratops Encounter, you can actually pet a dino.
Pteranodon Flyers, a relatively mild ride, lets you glide through
the air on the back of one of these flying creatures, providing a
good view of the lush, tropical island. And after the ride, you can
walk in dinosaur footprints, which _ surprise! _ set off a roar.
The island also has an interactive Discovery Center where, among
other things, you can watch a raptor being hatched, and a Camp
Jurassic, where those spitters lurk and where caves and quarries
hold long-ago secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Lost Continent. Are you ready for even more adventures? Then
welcome to the Lost Continent, perhaps the most visually stunning
of the islands, with its mountains and forests and dragons and
mythical gods.
</P>
<P>
   Poseidon's Fury is a multimedia presentation that puts travelers
in a battle between Poseidon (the water guy) and his archenemy Zeus
(the fire man). ``Weapons'' include more than 350,000 gallons of
water and 200 flame effects, not the least of them being exploding
25-foot fireballs.
</P>
<P>
   The Eighth Voyage of Sinbad is a stunt show featuring six water
explosions and 50 pyrotechnical effects, among them a 10-foot-tall
circle of flames.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Dueling Dragons attraction, which even some
hardened roller-coaster riders called speedy and scary. The ride
has two intertwined tracks that speed guests over, under, and
around one another. From the top of a 125-foot lift, the Fire
Dragon drops to the left, reaching 60 m.p.h. The Ice Dragon goes to
the right, hitting 55 m.p.h. Riders' legs dangle as they experience
five inversions and three near misses with riders on the opposite
track. At times, the tracks and their passengers are a scant 12
inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds frightening, but hey, I had conquered the Hulk Coaster.
So I made my way to the ride up a cavernous, winding path, shaped
like a ruined castle and decorated with skeletons and such. I soon
reached the area where you choose which side you want to ride.
``Fire or Ice?'' asked the ride hostess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exit,'' I replied. The heck with the line of duty.

`TOMMY' MARKS A GENERATION'S SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's deaf, dumb, and blind, but he sure plays a mean pinball.
He's a sensation. And he wants you to see him, feel him, and touch
him. One more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Who's Tommy'' _ the rock opera by the Who's Pete
Townshend, first released as a double-album in 1969, made into a
garish Ken Russell movie in 1975, whipped into a $3.5 million
bells-and-whistles, Tony-winning Broadway hit musical in 1993 _
lives again.
</P>
<P>
   This thing has legs. You wonder: Is ``The Who's Tommy'' our
generation's ``Oklahoma!''?
</P>
<P>
   Scot Woolley, the play's musical director and one of the
keyboardists, has a laugh and says, ``I think it definitely a piece
that's representative of a generation, the generation that was
around for the upheavel of the '60s, and there are so many of them,
just by the nature of numbers. It kind of defines the generation in
their searching for answers to questions they maybe posed too young
in their lives. Musically, it is strong and lyrically Pete hit
something. It's not a dated work either. Although it's rock 'n'
roll chord progressions indicative of the British rock of the late
'60s, it doesn't scream'' that it's rooted in that era ``like, say,
the Beach Boys `Good Vibrations.'''
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between this ``Tommy'' and earlier
productions, say Woolley and Michael Seelbach (who plays the lead
role), is that it's tilted more toward a rock 'n' roll experience
and less toward a theatrical one. ``We've stripped it down and
taken away any `numbing' aspect, of people watching things fly
in,'' says Woolley, ``and keep you distracted from the story.'' The
staging includes steel tubing, multi-level risers and screens that
drop down for slide projections. Its actors dress uniformly in
black. The music, say Woolley and Seelbach, rocks. There are seven
musician and 18 singers. The emphasis is on the musical journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great journey,'' says Seelbach, who is 21. ``Every
night it's about going through difficult times in your life, taking
responsability and forgiving peopele. It's about getting to look
out at the audience and sing right to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the musical, Tommy goes from being a severely
disabled, scorned and abused kid to a virtual messiah. The plot
line has always been a somewhat muddled, though when it went to
Broadway Townshend did some rewriting. This includes an ending that
does not focus on Tommy's downfall, but on group bonding. It's
happier now.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have perceived it to be that,'' says Woolley, 41. ``I
never understood `Tommy' as a kid and never made it all the way
through the movie. But for the finale song, I remember hearing
`Listening to you, I gather music . . . ' and in our production
it's kind of an everyman ending. What Tommy represents is: He's one
person who was done great disservices and he offers you an
opportunity for forgiveness, an opportunity to start over and that
involves the audience. He takes the high road by offering an olive
branch. There are so many religious overtones with this piece. It
does become spritutal, it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anyone who tackles the role of Tommy follows in the
Who's Roger Daltrey's footsteps. Is this daunting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sure,'' says Seelbach, who played the role three years
ago on the road for a year. ``I certainly wouldn't compare myself
to Roger Daltrey, but other people went ahead of me (in this role)
luckily. I didn't go back and re-listen (to the Who's version). I
had seen the Broadway show, but I didn't go back and listen until I
was set in this, so I didn't get too much in my head what other
people have done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This production,'' Seelbach continues, ``is very minimalist,
with rock 'n' roll set rigging, not much for set or costume
changes. It's fully staged, but it's more like a concert. The
director wanted people not to be wowed by the set. The Broadway set
was out of this world, but he wanted people to listen to it''
without distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Woolley says his aim for ``Tommy'' was the same as any musical
he's worked with: ``To find _ and this is gonna sound
artsty-fartsty _ but to find the essence of the truth in the song,
find the clarity that informs the muscial choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolley is asked to pick a song from ``Tommy'' and describe what
he tells the musicians and singers. He chooses ``Sensation,'' and
says it's about ``the feelings of someone who ultimately is a good
person and how that how fame can sway one's real meaning about what
they want to do with their lives. It's like Jim and Tammy Faye
Bakker started out with good intentions. `Sensation' is the first
moment where he feels something he's good at, playing pinball, and
is held up as an icon. Given the sycophantic nature of humans, we
get behind people who represent well, whatever. There's this mob
mentality, where people gravitate to him, where, just moments
before this'' he's being abused in ``Cousin Kevin.'' ``Sensation''
``is pivotal in Pete Townshend's view of fame and mankind's ability
to make you unfamous in a moment, which we see in pop music all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The show at times is very dark,'' says Seelbach, ``but the way
it ends up, especiall in this production, he's hugging everyone
who's done him wrong, recognizing them and bringing them back into
his life.

THOMAS HAS BAT, WON'T TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It seems to happen every spring. Summer, fall, and
winter, too. Some lucky major league team is supposed to be the
beneficiary of a blockbuster trade with the White Sox for Frank
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not going to happen unless somebody overwhelms the
White Sox, who are committed to the nine-year veteran who just
happens to be one of the best power hitters in baseball. He is the
centerpiece of the South Siders' ``The Kids Can Play'' campaign, as
Chicago, after a five-year quest to overtake Cleveland in the
American League Central with veteran talent, has gone on a youth
movement. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Thomas is only 30 years old and as light on his feet
as any of his teammates, who average 26.2 years. Still, no one
would have blamed the White Sox had they moved him along after
losing Albert Belle and Robin Ventura in free agency over the
winter. But after listening to offers from several clubs, including
the Red Sox, general manager Ron Schueler decided Thomas was more
valuable to them than anyone he would bring in trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see a rejuvenated Frank,'' said Schueler. ``He knows
what direction we are going. It's true Boston showed some interest,
starting prior to our winter meetings. But basically, we tried to
see if there was a fit and there wasn't. We just felt that in the
past year they've traded away many of the prospects that we really
like. And for what Frank meant to our organization and the kids,
there wasn't enough there for the White Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   His average dropped to .265 last year, but Thomas still had 29
home runs and 109 RBIs for the White Sox, who have finished second
in the AL Central for the last three years. He is a relative
bargain, accounting for only $7 million (plus incentives) of a $24
million payroll. His contract extension, signed in 1996, runs until
2006. Thomas says he wants to stay in Chicago and become a 10-5 man
next year. But first things first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to basics and be the player I've always
been,'' said Thomas. ``That's my job. That's important to me. I
just have to be patient and be the same hitter I've always been.
I'm looking forward to being on this team and playing day in and
day out.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the home opener, Thomas was mobbed by the Chicago
media, largely because he was one of few recognizable faces on the
team. Ray Durham was the other big name. Outfielder Darrin Jackson,
who has played for both Chicago teams, also was no stranger. But
there were plenty of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing to see these young guys,'' said Thomas.
``They're not here just to be here. We're all here to compete and
play to a major league level. The expectations aren't the same. The
last two years we were expected to finish either first or second in
the division. But I think this team will surprise a lot of people.
So far, we fit in very well. We have a very good chemistry in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Trade rumors have followed Thomas since he came up in 1990. Most
clubs admired his enormous build and slugging capability and
ignored his poor fielding. Thomas was a designated hitter in 146
games last year and played first base only 14 times. Manager Jerry
Manuel thinks he'll use Thomas in the field 50-60 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   But things in general are better. His feud with umpires over the
inside strike is over. So, too, are personal problems that affected
his mood from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says he is happy about remaining in Chicago for one good
reason. Trades don't win pennants; players do. For two years he had
Belle as a teammate, and many expected the best 1-2 punch in
baseball to make history. But Belle suffered through the first
season while Thomas hit .347. Last year, Thomas had what he
considered a poor year, while Belle hit .328 with 49 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players set standards,'' said Thomas. ``Last year I didn't
live up to the standards that I have had the last seven years. And
that's mostly regarding my batting average. The power numbers were
there, although I did have fewer home runs. Bottom line is that I
drove in 109 runs last year. I can't be disappointed over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade talks don't bother me at all. It happens to all players.
I understand that players move around a little bit. I've probably
had 150 teammates. Sooner or later it's going to happen to me. I
understand that. I'd love to finish my career in Chicago. If I
start something, I'd like to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel has concerns other than Thomas. His young team opened the
year with two victories but then lost four straight. Pitching and
defense are the current evils. In a weekend sweep, the White Sox
lost to Kansas City by scores of 10-5, 9-4, and 3-1. Makes you
wonder whether a rotation of James Baldwin, Mike Sirotka, Jim
Parque, John Snyder, and Jaime Navarro has the stuff to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is doing his part, though. He is 12 for 19 (.632) with
two homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've seen Frank swing the bat since I've been
here,'' said Manuel. ``Our offense has never been a problem. But
our young hitters are facing veteran pitching, some for the first
time, and it makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says it's nice to be looked upon as a role model and even
a hero. He is not a one-dimensional person, with more civic
commitments than even Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't feel 30,'' said Thomas. ``I feel more like I'm
25. I'm not making a resurgence. I feel like I'm definitely
playing. I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here. I'm looking forward
to a good season.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARWICH, Mass. _ You had to hear the voice to know Johnny Kelley
is okay.
</P>
<P>
   He looks terrific, resplendent in a blue 1999 Marathon jacket
over his white turtleneck. His eyes still have the Kelley twinkle,
and at 91 he looks and speaks strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But when the song swells out of him like the spring sunshine on
a Cape Cod morning -- with Kelley nailing every word and every note
of his trademark, ``Young at Heart'' -- you know that despite his
weekend decision to skip this year's marathon, he means it when he
says adamantly:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there in 2000 and hopefully I'll be myself long before
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley made his decision not to appear this year's race as Grand
Marshal to avoid risking a reoccurrence of the pneumonia he
suffered following abdominal surgery last winter. Thus, after 63
years that have made Johnny ``The Elder'' Kelley a fixture and the
very symbol of the Boston Marathon, this year he says: ``I will be
there in spirit. I wish all the runners good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, Kelley underwent surgery at Cape Cod Hospital to
repair a perforated colon. The operation, described as major by his
doctors, was declared a complete success. But Kelley's road to
recovery was set back when he contracted pneumonia, and he spent
the month of February recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   On March 1st he was released to Cranberry Pointe Rehabilitation
Center in Harwich, where he is making daily progress. From the bed
to a wheelchair last week and, by last weekend, he was walking with
a cane and looking forward to getting outside and moving his body
again.
</P>
<P>
   His overall health, despite the pneumonia, he says is excellent,
adding that a life of running has given him a strong heart. ``My
doctor tells me my heart is stronger than 99 percent of his
patients,'' says Kelley, who thumps his chest with his thumb as
reaches the line in his song, ``and if you can survive to
one-hundred and five . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 6, 1907, John Adelbert Kelley, the oldest of 10
kids who grew up in West Medford, won his first Boston Marathon in
1935 after he finally learned to pace himself and not burn all his
energy in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Though he would go on to win another Marathon 10 years later and
finish as runnerup another seven times, along with three Olympic
appearances, to Kelley that first win was still the sweetest.
Ironically, it was a bottle of sugar pills that nearly cost him the
race.
</P>
<P>
   April 19, 1935 was Good Friday, and some 300,000 spectators _ a
relatively small crowd _ turned out in the ideal running weather as
Kelley took on national marathon champion ``Pat'' Frank Dengis from
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was running with two talismen given him by well-wishers _
a handkerchief from his aunt and a bottle of 15 chocolate glucose
tablets, wihch he popped throughout the race, hoping to gain energy
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   According to race accounts, Kelley, who had lost previous races
by burning out in the late going, paced himself and ran third most
of the way. Dengis ran even more conservatively, staying behind
Kelley until Wellesley, when the toolmaker who had fashioned his
own bronze championship meda,l blew past Kelley only to suffer a
sudden stitch that felt like ``a knife in the heart,'' forcing him
to stop short.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelley streaked into the lead, his win was far from
assured. At Kenmore Square he had to stop and vomit up all the
glucose pills he had been chomping. Meanwhile, Dengis was over his
stitch and coming on at a gallop again, though he never seriously
threatened Kelley's two-minute winning margin. The time: 2:32:07.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Kelley won his second Boston in 2:30:40 _ the
fastest time in the world that year _ and, at 37, Kelley was making
jokes about his impending 40th birthday. ``They say life begins at
40,'' Kelley told a Globe reporter after his second win, ``and I
have three years before I get there.''
</P>
<P>
   With the appearance in the '50s of John J. Kelley, also
representing the Boston Athletic Association and the Boston winner
in 1957, John A. Kelley picked up the ``Johnny The Elder''
appellation, while John J. was of course ``Johnny The Younger.''
With The Elder becoming a symbol of longevity and The Younger
threatening to win several years into the 1960s, the two Kelleys
had become a famous mainstay of the world's most famous footrace.
</P>
<P>
   Long after The Younger stopped running Boston regularly, The
Elder was still hanging in, running every April for the next three
decades until 1992, when he announced _ at age 85 _ that he had run
his last full marathon. But even then, for another two years Kelley
ran the final seven miles, starting at his own landmark statue at
the beginning of the Heartbreak Hills.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1998 Kelley ran no more but rode in a convertible
at the head of the race as grand marshal, a position he would have
held this year and plans to resume in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The long scoresheet of his life of running, beginning when shoes
were sneaker thin, covers eight decades _ so far. He holds New
England championships at every distance from three miles and up.
Nationally, he was champion 11 times in four events, including the
marathon in 1948 and 1950. He was 1937 and 1954 national champion
in 15,000-meters, and in 1943 and 1954 won the 20,000-meter crown.
He won the 25,000-meter national title five times, and made the
Olympic team in 1936, 1940, and 1948. At age 44, he narrowly missed
making it to the 1952 games.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley became the first road runner ever elected to the National
Track and Field Hall of Fame, whose officials had to waive the
retirement rules because, they reasoned, here was a runner who
might never retire.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley recalls that he wanted to be a baseball player, but was
not good enough to play seriously. When he was 12, his father took
him to see his first Boston Marathon finish, and when the top
runners _ Peter Trivoulidas, Arthur Roth, and Carl Linder _ came
sprinting through the finish to cheering throngs, Kelley remembers
he ``fell in love with it then.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, even elite runners had to train on their own
time, and Kelley would work days for Boston Edison while training
evenings. His favorite spots were the Middlesex Woods and the
Medford Fells, running on dirt roads. ``It was a paradise running
in those places then,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed over eight decades _ including the explosion of
women's running and race sponsorship such as Boston benefactor John
Hancock _ but Kelley doesn't pine for the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better now,'' he says, ``much better. We have a lot of
wonderful girl runners. They're better than the boys, and more
honest (he chuckles). For them to run two hours and a half is just
amazing. I don't know how they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And to another Boston Marathon icon who returns this year,
Kelley sends some heartfelt greetings from the Cape where he plans
to watch the race ``on telley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Bill (Rodgers) all the luck because he's a very good
friend of mine and a great athlete.''

AIMING FOR A NEW IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Little Bear stories, written by Else Holmelund Minarik, are
beloved children's classics. So it is certainly a great occasion
when a new tale arrives. You can imagine how pleased I was, as a
father of two, to receive one of the very first copies of an old
favorite, ``Mother Bear's Robin'' _ revised by a consortium of gun
manufacturers and firearms trade groups.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry, as you may have heard, finds itself cornered
by declining sales and a flurry of lawsuits. At least five cities
have sued gun makers for negligence in manufacturing and marketing
handguns. At the same time, Americans are beginning to realize they
don't need to add much more to the nation's current personal
arsenal of 230 million guns. So sales are stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the gun industry is attempting to diversify and to
soften its image. Now you can buy Smith &AMP; Wesson bicycles, Colt
clothing and stuffed animals, and Sturm Ruger golf club heads. The
remaking of the image is backed by new ad campaigns from the
National Shooting Sports Foundation and the National Rifle
Association. The foundation's ads stress safe handling of guns and
the popularity of shooting sports like hunting. As an ad executive
told the Wall Street Journal, the campaign is intended to educate
people about part of America's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The new Little Bear episode was delivered to my door by a child
armed with an M16 rifle claiming to be Little Red Riding Hood on
her way to grandmother's house in search of a wolf. Here's the
tale, ``Mother Bear's Robin,'' in its revised form, intended to
convey a wholesome view of America's gun heritage:
</P>
<P>
   One spring day, when Mother Bear was little, she found a baby
robin in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh how sweet you are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She took the robin in the house, and made a little home for it.
The robin ate. It grew. It sang. Soon it could fly.
</P>
<P>
   But one day it was unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sing a song,'' said Mother Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot,'' said the robin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly about the house,'' said Mother Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot,'' said the robin.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Bear's eyes filled with tears. She took the robin out
into the garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, little robin,'' she said. ``But I want you to be
happy. Fly away, if you wish. You are free.''
</P>
<P>
   The robin flew, far up into the blue sky. It sang a high, sweet
song. Then down it came again, right down to Mother Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must fly out into the world,'' said the robin. ``But I will
come back. Every year I will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it came back, Mother Bear, didn't it?'' said Little Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' said Mother Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``No?'' said Little Bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Mother Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The robin flew up into the air. It was happy. It was free.
</P>
<P>
   A gunshot rang out. The robin fell out of the air. A little boy
shouted hooray. The little boy ran to the robin. The little boy's
father ran to the robin. The little boy and the father stood
proudly over the robin. The robin was dying. It heard the father
speak to the little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our heritage, my son,'' the father said. ``It is good.
We are good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, father. I am good,'' said the little boy. ``I am a good
shot.''

TAKING THE MEASURE OF THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market has divided the world into two camps: new
economy companies and old economy companies. The gulf between them
could not be wider.
</P>
<P>
   New economy companies do technology, including the Internet. Old
economy companies do everything else. The stocks of new economy
companies command tremendous price/earnings ratios, anywhere from
70 for Microsoft to 450 for America Online. Old economy companies
have ordinary multiples in the 10 to 25 range. A higher multiple
reflects greater optimism about a company's future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   New economy companies see nothing but blue skies ahead. Their
future consists of ever-expanding opportunities and technological
breakthroughs. Old economy companies have to worry about all the
traditional problems that have always plagued businesses: interest
rates, weak overseas economies, stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   On some level the gap reflects an underlying reality. The
technology sector is growing much faster than the economy as a
whole. Analysts expect technology giants like Dell, Cisco Systems,
and Intel to increase earnings at a 20 to 25 percent pace;
corporate earnings overall are expected to grow at about 6 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going through a huge historical change,'' says Allen
Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics in Waltham.
``As the rest of the world adopts American technology there are
going to be huge opportunities for these companies. The market's
intuition contains a lot of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hock, portfolio manager of John Hancock's Growth fund, is
another ``new economy'' champion. He points out that in the fourth
quarter of 1998 US spending on technology grew at an annual rate of
21 percent. All businesses must continue to make that investment,
says Hock, if they want to improve their productivity and drive
their costs down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But isn't it possible to accept the basic notion that
technology is changing the world and still be skeptical about the
levels certain technology stocks have reached?
</P>
<P>
   Ned Riley certainly thinks so. Riley, chief investment officer
at BankBoston, recently did a little reality test on Microsoft and
Cisco. He assumed that the companies maintained current growth
rates for the next 20 years and that revenue grew as quickly as
earnings. By the end of the 20 years, says Riley, the two companies
would have sales equal to 22 percent of the gross domestic product
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Illusions and dreams have replaced reality around some of
these stocks,'' says Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said about many of the Internet stocks. In a
matter of months, some of the ``new economy'' companies have
achieved greater market valuations than some of their
well-established ``old economy'' competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: ETrade, an on-line brokerage, has a market value that
far exceeds that of Paine Webber, a traditional brokerage. Never
mind that ETrade didn't make any money last year while Paine Webber
earned more than $400 million. The money-losing Amazon.com, the
on-line retailer, has a greater market value than Sears, Staples,
or TJX. More remarkable still, the market value of Priceline.com,
which sells airline tickets on line, is greater than the market
value of United Airlines. The former lost $112 million last year;
the latter earned better than $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the Internet companies say today's lack of
significant profits is not a sign of weakness, but rather the
result of heavy spending to build up brand names.
</P>
<P>
   Do these staggering valuations make sense?
</P>
<P>
   They don't if you think that the ``new economy'' is not quite as
new as its advocates would like to believe. While technology
companies may be able to ignore certain aspects of the old economy
_ does Priceline.com have to worry about the price of oil? _ other
old-fashioned problems aren't as easy to shake.
</P>
<P>
   Like competition. Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems are two
of the hottest firms in technology. Both stocks sell at huge
multiples to earnings. Yet every business publication is filled
with stories about how the two companies are gearing up to go head
to head in the market for telephone and data equipment. Won't one
of them have to lose? And won't the competition depress profit
margins in the industry?
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet realm, Amazon.com recently announced its
intention of going into the auction business, turf currently
dominated by another Internet success story, eBay. You might have
guessed the news would have depressed eBay's stock price. If so,
you'd have been wrong. The stock has climbed steadily and now has a
market value of $22 billion. Pretty good for a company that earned
$2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   And what about those ``old economy'' companies? Isn't it
possible that some of them won't be content to sit on the sidelines
and watch the upstarts eat their lunch? Might not some of them jump
into the Internet world and fight successfully to protect their
market share?
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time there won't be such a bright line between the
market's winners and losers,'' says David Testa, chief investment
officer for T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund company. ``There will be
shades of success and failure. The world is more complex than the
market currently suggests it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday might have been a day to see a little bit of a shift at
work. Friday after the stock market closed Compaq Computer
announced that its first-quarter earnings would come in well short
of expectations. Compaq's stock got hammered Monday. But after an
early sell-off, most of the major technology stocks finished only
slightly down for the day. Analysts said Compaq's problems don't
necessarily spell trouble for the broader technological sector.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment at least, the two-tier stock market is alive and
well.

EVEN HISTORY CAN BE FAMILY FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family vacations are very much in. And if you think planning one
is difficult or you have no idea what to do, think again. No matter
where you turn, the travel world is ready with ideas and to assist
you.
</P>
<P>
   A few ideas:
</P>
<P>
   Adults may love history, but most kids find it boring, unless
they take the Revolutionary Fun Package to Virginia's ``historic
triangle'' _ Colonial Williamsburg, Jamestown, and Yorktown, plus
Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Water Country USA. Here a family can
mix history, learning, and fun, all in an affordable four-day
package beginning at $663 for a family of four. Included are
accommodations and unlimited admissions to the attractions. The
area is beautiful, fascinating, and within a day's drive or less
from one-third of the country. For information, call 800-400-2851.
</P>
<P>
   For an exotic outing, consider Thomson Safaris. Rick Thomson and
Judi Wineland, who have been in the safari business for years and
have been running their own family outings worldwide, have put
together their first Thomson Family Adventures catalog to some
unique places, from Australia and The Galapagos to Nepal and
Tanzania. The trips run 10-15 days and are limited to groups of
four or five families. Most trips are planned for school vacation
periods. Thomson Safaris is in Cambridge and can be reached at
800-235-0289 or on the Web at www.ThomsonSafaris.com.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, which has been offering luxurious worldwide
adventures, now has a Family Holidays package for all ages. Many of
the programs are designed for multigenerational outings. For
information, call 800-323-7308 or visit www.abercrombiekent.com.
</P>
<P>
   The University of New Hampshire offers Familyhostel, a program
that combines learning with sightseeing and is ideal for families
with children 8-15. These 10-day trips also see grandparents with
grandchildren, single parents, even three generations of families
participating. The program grew out of the university's popular
Interhostel program for adults 50 and older. Most programs are to
Europe, but new this year is one to Costa Rica, and a New England
Sampler that runs from the university campus in Durham. For a
catalog, call 800-733-9753 or visit www.learn.unh.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Outside magazine is offering a summer planner with 117
``kid-approved adventures'' such as hiking, biking, and rafting.
Included are family trips from $640 to $1,580. The magazine is on
sale at newsstands through June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas for family outings, where everyone can vacation,
include cruises, Disney World, and many resorts including Club Med,
which features circus programs at some locations. The best part of
these outings is that adults can find free time while the kids do
their things.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Low-cost flights &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to fly to Europe this summer for just $169
one-way or to the Caribbean for $199 round-trip? If you are
flexible in your travel plans, fares like these are possible. The
fares are through Air Tech, a company that locates empty seats on
planes then sells those seats to its customers. Travelers can fly
within any three-day time period they choose. Air Tech issues a
Flight Pass, which is then exchanged for a ticket an hour before
the flight. Air Tech says travelers know before going to the
airport they will get a seat, and that most easily get the
destination of their choice, especially in off-peak periods. For
other destinations Air Tech says it will locate the lowest fare,
and also offers courier flights and hotel reservations. For more
information, write to Air Tech, 588 Broadway, Suite 204, New York,
NY 10012; telephone 800-575-TECH; or visit www.airtech.com.

internationally, followed by Australia/South Pacific and Asia. For
the fifth year in a row, Italy reigned as the hottest selling
single country worldwide. Tied for second place were China,
Australia, and Spain. Domestically, for the first time Las Vegas
came out on top, unseating perennial favorite Orlando, Fla., which
placed second. The USTOA survey also found that a continued strong

BOSTON MARATHON GETS ON DIGITAL TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It is possible that more people will follow the Boston
Marathon this year from their computer screen than from the race
course or on TV _ and it's almost certain that they'll find out
more about how their friends or relatives are doing by watching on
line rather than up close.
</P>
<P>
   That's because for the first time the marathon's Internet Web
site will provide almost-instantaneous updates on how each of the
12,700 official runners is doing every 3.1 miles of the 26.2-mile
course. If everything works as planned, it will be the most
ambitious computer tracking of runners at any race ever, making the
event a milestone and a model for on-line sports offerings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put out updates every 3 to 5 minutes, which is as close
to real time as we can get it right now,'' says Mitch Romm,
president of KIVEX.com, the official Internet provider for the
April 19 marathon. ``We expect 4 million hits during the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those logging on will be Peter Payack's 11-year-old son in
Cambridge, his mother in New Jersey, and his twin brother in
California. ``My identical twin thinks he's running the marathon
because his genes are running, so he'll want to `watch,' '' says
Payack, 49, who will be running his 20th marathon and 10th
Hopkinton-to-Boston race despite a knee that's missing nearly all
its cartilage and a multiple sclerosis affliction that can kick in
any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom will want to keep track to ensure that I'm alive,''
adds the Cambridge poet, teacher, and coach. ``And my friend Susan
always comes to watch me at about 3 o'clock. Now she'll know
exactly when to come, she'll know if I'm going to do a 4:20 or
something, and she won't have to worry about missing me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real good for people like that to participate, it'll get
more people interested.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Boston Marathon organizers have been hoping for
as they have fine-tuned their electronic tracking network.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the Boston Athletic Association started handing out tiny
computer chips to all official entrants to lace onto their
sneakers. Electronic mats at the start, midpoint, and finish
recorded when each runner passed by with his or her chip, then
beamed the information via radio waves to a computer. The point was
twofold: to give runners accurate information on their times, and
to give race organizers a surer sense that the runners ran the
whole course.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 25-foot-wide maroon rubber mats were laid across the
road at 11 points along the course, giving organizers an even
better way of rooting out alleged cheaters such as John and Suzanne
Murphy, the California couple who in 1997 apparently lied their way
to the top of their age divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The BAA also launched a Web site in 1996, but it didn't have
much information on the marathon and didn't include any information
on how individual runners were doing during the race.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers last year also started transmitting to their Web site
information on individual runners during the actual race, but there
was a 20-minute delay transferring the data and concerns whether
the system would work properly discouraged the BAA from advertising
what it was doing.
</P>
<P>
   This year the association is confident the kinks have been
worked out. New communications circuits will send data 12 times
faster than a year ago. Backup servers will be on hand to prevent
the system from overloading the way it has before. And marathon
fans from around the world will be encouraged to log on as often as
they want while the race is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up will be easy. Users will simply go to the BAA Web
site _ www.bostonmarathon.org _ and feed in the runner's name or
number. If they aren't sure how to spell the name, or there is more
than one person with that name, they can enter the runner's
hometown and they will get a list of all entries from there.
</P>
<P>
   Following the race via computer will seem sterile to some,
devoid of the excitement of the crowds that line the course and the
thrill of watching runners race by or, in the case of
back-of-the-packers, summon the courage to plod on. But the on-line
solution is ideal for those who are unable to see the live TV
broadcast or are anxious to find out how runners they know are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just runners' times that will be available on-line,
but also reams of information on how elite male and female runners
are doing, phoned in by hundreds of human monitors stationed at 19
sites along the course and equipped with digital wireless phones
supplied by Nextel Communications. The BAA site also has historic
information on the race, advice on where to watch from, and other
facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   The BAA isn't the only one offering Boston Marathon coverage on
the Internet. In fact, there are so many companies doing it _ from
the Globe to USA Today, Runner's World, and several Japanese
publications _ that the BAA has started dispensing press
credentials to on-line providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first year we really view people covering the
marathon via the Internet as full-fledged media people,'' says BAA
spokesman Jack Fleming. ``It's obviously not a fad, it's not going
to go away and it's a great source.''
</P>
<P>
   While those providers offer up-to-the-minute information,
Fleming says that timeliness comes at a price: ``Their reporting is
not as good, they're sloppy and often inaccurate. There's no editor
checking it, no safety valve.'' The BAA also limits what the other
providers can do, denying them access to its instantaneous
information on runners and discouraging them from putting the
complete race results on their Web sites until two days after the
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   One reason on-line sites are so popular for the marathon is that
``runners are a particularly wired group. Their demographics are
more highly educated and affluent, which is the same people who
have Internet access,'' explains Eric Bauer, the executive news
editor at Boston.Com who is covering his fifth Boston Marathon via
the Internet. Working previous April classics for other Web sites,
he adds, ``We got e-mail from every continent, including
Antarctica, wanting to see how friends did.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds easy, but assembling the electronic network is
not. Equipment has to be collected from across America and Canada
to ensure there are enough mats and monitors to cover the course.
Then it has to be tested and retested in the days before the race.
``But we know the technology works, it's very accurate, it's the
most accurate thing I've seen out on the market,'' says Phil
Graceffa, the BAA's technology coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as this year's on-line coverage is expected to be,
it may seem anachronistic in a year or two. By then the BAA Web
site hopes to be offering ``video streaming'' that beams out images
from the course.
</P>
<P>
   And over the next five or so years, says Fleming, ``the viewer
may be able to select what he or she wants to view. . . the viewer
would be the director and choose to watch the men's race, the
women's race, the wheelchairs, Heartbreak Hill, or the finish
line.''

CELEBRATING NEGRO LEAGUE BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY _ The story of the Negro Leagues is a fantastic tale
that many feel is bigger than the game of baseball itself. Now you
can relive its history and decide for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The Negro League Museum, on the corner of 18th and Vine, is
evidence of the pain and glory that was an everyday experience for
more than 2,600 black athletes, coaches, managers, and owners over
a 40-year span.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a Hall of Fame. The very best of the Negro Leagues,
from Satchel Paige to Jackie Robinson, can still be found in
Cooperstown, N.Y. That was the goal ever since the league was
founded by Rube Foster in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in more than a trip down memory lane, the
Negro Leagues gives you historic moments and feats of the men whom
museum officials insist were the first group of black entrepreneurs
to build an enterprise. The Negro League was born in a meeting at
the Paseo YMCA, only a block from the museum. It disbanded in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two decades, the Negro Leagues received scant
attention, mostly in the movies. But a series of reunions led to
recognition by Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in 1992.
Since then there has been a revival of the Negro Leagues. The
museum was established in 1995 and moved to its present residence
in 1997. John ``Buck'' O'Neil, a player-manager for the Kansas City
Monarchs from 1937-1955, is chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is located in what was considered the black business
area during that era of segregation. Games were played at Blues
Field at 22nd and Brooklyn. Players stayed at the Streets Hotel and
were well know in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to what Hollywood has depicted, Negro League baseball
was big business,'' says Bob Kendrick, director of marketing and
development. ``The players made a very decent living. Black owners
made a lot of money. They used to draw 50,000 in Comiskey Park in
Chicago. We were playing night games in 1930, almost five years
before they did in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we introduce you to some great Negro athletes, but
we also show you that we were a part of changes that helped this
country. When Rube formed the Negro Leagues in 1920, that was
America's awaking to black empowerment. Collectively, a group of
black entrepreneurs got together to build an enterprises that
thrived for 30-40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to separate the men and the legends. Even today,
most would concede that Paige was the Negro League's most famous
graduate. But it might surprise you that Jackie Robinson, the man
who broke the color barrier, was not included in a special museum
display of lifesize statues they call ``Field of Legends.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Field'' includes only players from the Negro Leagues.
``You have to remember, Jackie was only around us for one year,''
says O'Neil. ``The guys who have statues there were in their prime
when Jackie came along. They deserved to be there. Truthfully,
Jackie wasn't even the best player in our league at that time. But
I will say he had as much potential as anyone who has ever played
baseball. He was one of 40 percent of the players in our league who
had a college education. He was very smart and just the right man
to break the color barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Field'' display includes statues of two managers _ Foster
and O'Neil. Actually, O'Neil should have been among the first
blacks elected to the Hall of Fame. But he is a member of the
Hall's veterans committee and won't be eligible until he resigns,
which O'Neil has refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Negro League museum, which occupies a 10,000-square foot
exhibit space, is part of a state-of-the-art building in which
baseball, jazz, and the Negro culture are all celebrated under one
roof. Located in central Kansas City, the entire complex covers
50,000 square feet. The Jazz Museum and the Horace M. Peterson III
visitor center are aimed at attracting community support, which
planners deem just as important as tourists.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, 85, is a drawing card onto himself. Ever since his
television appearance in the Ken Burns documentary on baseball, he
has become a leading spokesman for the Negro Leagues and is in more
demand than many so-called major league stars. O'Neil takes it all
in stride. ``People need to know about Rube Foster,'' says O'Neil.
``He was far ahead of his time. He was thinking expansion as far
back as in 1920. He thought if he organized the black ballplayers,
the American League and the National League would take a ball club.
It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-three years later, Bill Veeck wanted to buy the
Phillies and stock them with Negro League ball players. Judge
(Kenesaw Mountain) Landis wouldn't let that happen, either. In
fact, if Landis had been the commissioner, Branch Rickey would
never have been able to sign Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibits in the museum are aided by audio visuals in two movie
theaters. Negro League memorabilia from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s
are available. One of the newest exhibits is a jersey worn by
Herbert (Chinck) Holmes, who played for nine seasons with the
Boston Royal-Giants, a regional team that played as far south as
Philadelphia and as far north as Canada. Holmes died in 1993,
according to his grandson, Tracey McDaniels of Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   After failing in his bid to earn recognition in Boston,
specifically from the Red Sox, McDaniels says he contacted the
Negro League Museum, which put his grandfather's jersey on display.
</P>
<P>
   Both McDaniels and the museum say they are seeking further
evidence about a black team that played in New England in the
1930s. ``My grandfather would be proud to know his jersey would be
in a museum,'' said McDaniels. ``I would like one day to see the
Red Sox wearing a Negro League uniform in a game much like the
Royals wore a Monarchs one in Kansas City. For me, just knowing my
grandfather is getting some recognition makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick said the museum is designed to be a reminder of the
good old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 30's and 40's,'' he said, ``The corner of 18th and Vine
was the center of a Black Renaissance. Now we're back to try to
lead another Renaissance of a great Afro-American community. As we
look to the future, we're trying to return this area to a past when
it was alive and well. Naturally, the local community is thrilled
to have three cultural museums available. But we still have some
work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the segregated mandated businesses had a built-in fan
base. All those communities that had a successsful Negro League fan
base also had successful black economies. It's a bittersweet story.
You can almost show that the rise and fall of the NL in this
country runs parallel to the rise and fall of the black economy.
And truthfully, black economy has never recovered. That's why it is
more important for us to tell the story and preserve the story than
for us to duplicate Cooperstown.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Negro League museum resembles the major league shrine
in many ways. The difference is that there are more black faces in
this museum.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil wishes ``that people could have seen that Josh Gibson
really could play major league baseball. Smokey Joe Williams, Cool
Papa Bell, Hilton Smith. Many of the records that are on the books
would have been so different.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Cooperstown, all you see are the Negro League players who
made the Hall of Fame. Here, we have them and something about all
those who played. In 1995, we had our 75th anniversary party and
over 200 ex-players showed up here. We planned another one here
this year but won't expect as many. Our average age is 70.''

OLAZABAL REMASTERED HIS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ These are the lingering images of the 63d
Masters: David Duval, gallantly tring to win his fifth tournment of
the year and first major championship; Davis Love, fighting to hang
tough; Greg Norman, who had shoulder surgery last year, making a
brave run at tournament he dearly wants to win.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Jose Maria Olazabal, tears welling up in his
eyes, his head buried in his hands in the press building, after his
two-stroke victory. He won the Masters in 1994, but foot problems
had threatened to end his career. He was limping when he returned
to defend in 1995, and all he could do in 1996 was watch on
television as Norman squandered a six-shot lead in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   After having surgery on both feet, Olazabal thought his career
was finished. Now, this moment to cherish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me to experess how I feel at this
particular moment,'' he said. ``After what I went through, I'm very
proud of myself. I'm a real happy man at the moment. I feel happy
not just for myself but for all the people that supported me
through the bad times, my family, my friends. When I was at my
lowest, I never thought about this happening again. I thought I
would never play golf again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You all know that. I've said it quite a few times. To be here
standing in front of you with a green jacket is some achievement
that I didn't even dream about when I was so low. So it's great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not comparable to the first one. The first time, it was
my first major event. I didn't have the knowledge or the time to
really enjoy the jacket, the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure I'm going to enjoy this one much more than the
one I had before for several reasons. The most important one was
because of the problems I went through to be here. It's my second
major event. I won my first one, it might have been a lucky week.
When you win two, and especially the way I did it, means a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal was the third-round leader but bogeyed the third,
fourth, and fifth holes on Sunday, and as many as seven players
were squarely in the hunt over the daunting front nine.
</P>
<P>
   The final order was Olazabal (71_280), Love (71_282), and Norman
(73_284), followed at 284 by Bob Estes (72) and Steve Pate (73),
and at 285 by Duval (70), Phil Mickelson (71), Lee Westwood (71),
Nick Price (72), and Carlos Franco (73). The low round of the day
was Duval's 70, which included an eagle on the second.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who had his surgery shortly after last year's Masters
and didn't play again until the end of the year, reawakened the
echoes when he rolled in a 25-foot putt for eagle on the 13th. But
Olazabal followed immediately with a 21-foot birdie putt to stay
tied for the lead. After Norman proceeded to bogey the 14th and
15th, Olazabal virtually salted it away with a birdie on the par-3
16th.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I tried to keep calm and make as many shots as
possible,'' said Olazabal. ``I didn't want to forget 16 and 17. I
made that putt on 16. It was just 3 feet, but it was down the hill
and lightning-quick, left to right. I don't know how the hell I
made that putt. I scrambled for a 4 on 17, and giving myself two
shots was crucial. I died for a 4 on that hole, and when I got that
4, I knew the jacket should be mine.''
</P>
<P>
   His thoughts went back three and four years, to the low and
lonely times in his career. Even his family was at a loss for what
to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't say a word,'' he said. ``The situation was so
bad. Everybody was suffering. There is nothing they can say to you
that can cheer you up. I don't wish that to anybody. Without a
doubt, I just preferred to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most positive thing about my foot problems was that I
appreciate things more in life. I'm not talking about the game
itself. I'm talking about the usual things in life, just being able
to wake up in the mornings and do whatever you want to do. Go out,
enjoy the weather, enjoy the scenery. Just enjoy being on the golf
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal sat with Gary Player at the past champions dinner last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `How are you playing?' '' said Olazabal. ``I
said, `OK, so-so. Not really great, not too bad.' He said, `How is
your confidence?' I said, `It's not really great.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me with those eyes and said to me, You know, you
have a great swing. If you didn't have a great swing, I wouldn't
tell you this. You have to believe in yourself. Look at me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept saying, `You have to believe in yourself. You play 18
holes. If you don't play well, it doesn't matter. You go to the
driving range. You go to the putting green. That's how you achieve
things.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he said it helped me. It helped me to believe in
myself.''

GAMBLING PUT PENDERGAST IN A TERRIBLE FIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was just after noon. Kevin Pendergast stood behind
a Richards Hall lectern, scanning the young faces of the athletes
listening to him. That's the way the best professors do it,
constantly aware of the audience. Except Pendergast is not a
professor. He might tell you about his past days as a Notre Dame
football and soccer player. Or he might tell you about his most
recent days as a felon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I just got out of prison two weeks ago,'' Pendergast
said to a group of Northeastern University athletes Monday. ``I
know, standing in front of you guys, I probably don't look like
someone who has spent time in prison. But as I found out from being
there, it could be anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There was silence for a while. Maybe there is never a good time
to tell someone you've been in prison, but at least you can
sometimes predict when a story is headed toward the dramatic
moment. Not Monday. Pendergast mentioned it casually. That's what
some people do when they cannot find a subtle way to reveal a
serious illness; sometimes they just blurt it out.
</P>
<P>
   But then Pendergast, 28, was in prison because of a serious
illness.
</P>
<P>
   He was a gambler. He was sent to federal prison for two months
after he and two others _ Bryan Irving and basketball player Dion
Lee _ were caught in a Northwestern University basketball
point-shaving scandal in 1995. His punishment could have been 20
years and a $1 million fine. But since he cooperated with the feds,
and agreed to do sports gambling seminars such as Monday's for the
next five years, a plea bargain was reached and the sentence was
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergast talked to the athletes about the January day in 1994
when he made a kick to help Notre Dame win the Cotton Bowl. Later
he would talk about what some people call one of the five greatest
games in college history. It was November 1993, when Boston College
beat the Irish, 41-39. Pendergast was the kicker on that team, but
his friend, BC kicker David Gordon, was responsible for the
decisive points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I had a field goal blocked that game,'' he said,
``but I hasten to point out that a guy missed a block. Somebody
(BC's Daryl Porter) came shooting through the line. That's the
truth. You can watch the highlights. He could have high-fived me he
was so close.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked about his terrible credit, damaged by thousands of
dollars of credit-card debt. He mentioned how, as a convicted
felon, he can never be a doctor, lawyer, or stockbroker. He was
quite candid. So some of the questions he received were imprinted
with candor, too.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)How long was you locked up for?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The question came from an athlete sitting to the right of
Pendergast. There were some tense chuckles, some people had the
no-he-didn't-just-ask-that-question look on their faces. But
Pendergast had no problem with the query.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, bar none, the first thing people want to know is, `What
was prison like?' '' said the man who spent his 28th birthday in an
Otisville, N.Y., federal prison. He laughed at his unintentional
pun. Bar none. ``There's a lot more amenities than I would have
guessed. There's weights, pool tables, books, TV, cable, those type
of things.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nobody messed with me,'' he said. ``Nobody assaulted me or
got in my face. It wasn't like that. There were people there for
murder, people serving life sentences, the whole gamut. There was
still a level of respect. It was a pretty amazing experience, but
not one I would do over again if I had the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have questioned his sincerity. They say he is not
remorseful enough. He doesn't sob when he tells his story. He
doesn't shake his finger at athletes across the country and tell
them to beware of gambling. Some people who have seen the results
of a recent NCAA survey _ that 72 percent of student-athletes
gamble _ would probably like to see more tears for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Pendergast, ``it's tough for me to take a
real moralistic stand on it. It's not what I'm about. My idea is to
get up and talk to the kids, let them know what happened to me and
let them assimilate all the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened is that a National Merit Scholar became addicted
to gambling and went to prison. A young man who scored 780 out of
800 on his Scholastic Aptitude Test found himself in handcuffs. The
kid next door got a knock on his door from the FBI. A
singer-songwriter, a lover of everything from Hendrix to hiphop,
was forced to pause his dream of leading a band that would go big.
</P>
<P>
   He lost $20,000 the last time he bet on sports and said he will
never do it again. He doesn't complain about the hypocrisy of it
all. How the NCAA knows about and silently encourages betting on
basketball tournament brackets. How judgmental writers criticize
him while they work for newspapers that run betting lines. How the
nation seems surprised that he has a criminal record although he
doesn't meet the stereotypical profile of one: He is a young,
intelligent, white male.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the hypocrisy that bothers him. He will tell you
that he is not in a position to ``fill out a tournament bracket, go
play nickel slots, or buy a lotto ticket.'' It was all or nothing
for him and he wants nothing. Six years ago, his mother died of
cancer, so she didn't have to see him in the news. His father,
Paul, had to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wished for him, more than for myself, that I could
undo what I did,'' he said. ``If I can't feel any regret for the
(expletive) I put him through over this, then when would I ever
feel regret?''
</P>
<P>
   It was just before 1:30. An anatomy class was entering Room 202
as Pendergast was leaving. I wish he could have stayed and spoken
with those students, too.

THE PACE IS FAMILIAR IN `COLOR OF NIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE COLOR OF NIGHT 
By David Lindsey 
Warner Books, 496 pp, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've read le Carre or Ludlum, you've met men like Harry
Strand before. He's a suave, middle-aged fellow living in quiet
peace, particularly content because his previous life brought peril
at every turn. Even those closest to him have no idea he was a
secret agent, one of the best and most honorable of them. He knows
too much about too many powerful people, but his skills have
allowed him to stay comfortably hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Until the day the idyll comes to a shattering end.
</P>
<P>
   Then he's on the run again, summoning old allies, resurrecting
old safety schemes, racing across continents. His nemesis is an
evil genius with unlimited henchmen and unlimited money, while he's
only one man. Apart from a comely companion who knew nothing of his
past but stays with him after she learns _ not only because now
she's a target too, but because she believes in him _ he is all
alone, with nothing but his wits.
</P>
<P>
   That, finally, is where ``The Color of Night,'' David Lindsey's
new international thriller, diverges from the well-worn path _
though not explicitly and not altogether successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Harry Strand is witless.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who _ with his wife, Romy, and another accomplice _
figured out how to embezzle more than half a billion dollars from a
money-laundering crime baron without his knowing it and lock it
away in a thicket of trusts and dummy corporations. (He keeps some
of the interest for himself and his team but, ever the saint,
returns most of the money to charities in the regions where the
baron, Wolf Shrade, rules.)
</P>
<P>
   After a few years of quiet bliss, Romy _ Shrade's sister, no
less _ dies in a car accident. We learn later that she's been
rammed from behind and run off the road, but no one notices the
bashed-in back end and it never occurs to him that perhaps Shrade,
whom he knows to be a vicious, vindictive madman, might have been
involved. Gee, Harry, how could a cool breeze like you not think of
that? ``That's incredible, I know. I just didn't,'' he tells an old
henchwoman.
</P>
<P>
   How he learns, and we learn, of this is one of the book's
greatest defects. One day when he's in the garden of the Italian
mansion belonging to his new girlfriend, Mara, he hears a noise
inside. He returns to find the TV on and a tape in the VCR. First
it shows Mara leading a gallery tour, then it cuts abruptly to a
grainy, black-and-white recording of Romy's car being pursued, and
then pushed.
</P>
<P>
   He's in a panic! Mara was involved in Romy's death? Mara's an
agent? How could he not have seen the set-up?
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, this leap to conclusion is unconvincing, and so is
what happens next. He summons an information peddler he used back
in the day _ just happens to live in Rome _ and asks him to run a
check on Mara. After a harrowing, sickening interlude, she comes up
clean, and they can get back to falling into love.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when it turns out she is an agent, there's an explanation
for how she passed the background check, but if Harry had been in
the business for 20 years, he would have known that dodge. First
he's thoroughly convinced that she is running a game on him, then
he's thoroughly relieved that she's not. Where's his radar, the
skepticism that kept him alive through uncounted dicey encounters?
</P>
<P>
   The notion of Mr. International Player finding out, upon being
sucked back into the vortex, that he just doesn't have it anymore
is appealing, a credible twist on the genre. But that's not how
Lindsey presents it. Harry's still as bright as the best, and his
mistakes are tossed off without accumulating any weight. At the
risk of giving away too much, it is fair to say that ``The Color of
Night'' ends on the same familiar ground it started from.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the ending is displeasing. Lindsey chooses
not to drag it out, and doubt remains until the very last sentence.
He's deft in other ways, too, such as when Harry envisions his
revenge on Shrade: Lindsey alludes to a fox, chewing off its paw to
escape a trap, and limping away on a bloody stump to freedom. And
when one avenging attempt is thwarted by a woman's entering their
elevator car, her perfume is ``a saccharine epitaph for the demise
of another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though ultimately it does provide the breathless race readers of
this genre seek, that description could stand for the whole of
Lindsey's story.

INS LAW MEANS LENGTHY SENTENCES FOR CONVICTED IMMIGRANTS

 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It began as a lover's quarrel. Yolanda Torres accused
her live-in boyfriend Gerardo Ruiz Esposito of sleeping with
another woman. The two argued. He said Torres dug her nails into
his chest. She said he pushed her against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, 1997, police took a cuffed Ruiz to jail. Both of
them thought he would be out in a day.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly two years later, Ruiz is still in prison, in Unit BN1
of the Plymouth County Correctional Facility, living alongside
convicted rapists, thieves, and sexual predators.
</P>
<P>
   And it is where Ruiz, a Nicaraguan citizen, will stay until he
is granted asylum or deported _ an unlikely possibility in the near
future because Hurricane Mitch ravaged his country.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz represents a growing presence among prison inmates:
Immigration and Naturalization detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The law enables the INS to deport immigrants who commit even
relatively minor crimes. But when the small-time criminals have no
place to go, they end up languishing in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans whom Fidel Castro won't accept. Iranian nationals. People
from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. And immigrants from Honduras and
Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act, which went into effect in October 1998, also
requires that undocumented immigrants awaiting political asylum
hearings remain in prison _ even if the appeal process takes years.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 16,000 people detained by the INS in prisons
throughout the country, according to INS figures. Within a year,
that number is expected, by some estimates, to reach 24,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS is becoming a sort of new bureau of prisons,'' said Arthur
C. Helton, an immigration and refugee law professor at New York
University. ``It's a senseless policy because it subjects
individuals to arbitrary detention in violation of human rights
laws.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not dangerous criminals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Keber, a Boston immigration attorney, said he has
several Cambodian clients who have been detained in prisons for
more than a year, even though it is clear they cannot return home
because Cambodia will not accept them.
</P>
<P>
   If they were dangerous criminals with long rap sheets, that
would be fine, Keber said. But they're not. One of his clients was
convicted of one offense _ striking his girlfriend, a crime that,
while troubling, does not make him a menace to society, Keber said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these abound, such as the case of a Korean man who
stole a car and might be deported back to a country where he has no
family and does not know the language.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Howard was born Cho Tung Jo in Korea, but came to
America when he was 5 to join his adoptive parents, Karen and
William Howard, in Lakeville.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 23, Howard has been held in prison since June 1995,
awaiting deportation. Auto theft is a deportable offense, but a
state judge later vacated the charge, court records showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basis of this order of deportation has been eliminated,''
his attorney, Hazel Inglis of New Bedford, said. ``I don't know why
they're not releasing him. Immigration is treating everyone the
same, as if they were alien terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Karen Howard, an adjunct professor of Holocaust
studies at Merrimack College, said that sending Timothy to Korea
would be worse than a long prison sentence: It would be like
banishment to another world, because he knows no one there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shattered our family,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Verdean community in Dorchester has been especially
hard hit by INS detainments and deportations. Officials conducted a
morning raid in mid-January, rounding up more than a dozen Cape
Verdean youths with records of street crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men had committed serious felonies, but others had
committed minor crimes, including the case of an 18-year-old whose
only crime was shoplifting a CD. After being detained for about two
weeks, INS let him go, according to the Cape Verdean consulate in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the legislation du jour,'' Jose Macedo, an immigration
attorney of Cape Verdean decent, said of Congressional law that
allows INS to deport people even for relatively minor crimes.
``It's part of an anti-immigrant backlash. Congress has no sympathy
for immigrants.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Toughening the law &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act in 1996, an amendment intended to toughen
immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   The new law redefined the term ``aggravated felony'' to include
any crime dealing with theft, money laundering, violence, or drug
trafficking in which a person is given a one-year sentence, even if
it is a suspended sentence. With one conviction, an immigrant is
deportable, even if that person has lived in the United States for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   It also required INS agencies to incarcerate any illegal
immigrant, even if the person is applying for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Boston district office director of INS says the laws go
too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that some of those provisions are harsh,''
said District Director Steven Farquharson. ``It has harsh
consequences for people who have been here for many years. What's
made it so onerous is that descretion doesn't exist any more. I
would certainly like to have more discretion to look at individuals
on a case-by-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Farquharson said it bothers him that a person can be deported
for committing one minor crime. But his hands are tied by
Congressional law. And, because of the law, he said, INS workers
have to scramble to find places to house the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   There are 416 people being detained in Rhode Island, New
Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, said Paula Grenier, a
spokeswoman for the Boston Regional office.
</P>
<P>
   Although immigrant advocates say there are hundreds of people
who have been in jail for years, Russ Bergeron, a spokesman for INS
in Washington, insisted that just is not true.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said the average number of days a person remains in
detention is 60, which is because most people do not have anything
to base an appeal on _ either they are here illegally, or have
committed serious crimes. He said a majority of those being
detained because they have committed a crime are also here
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   But Helton said the 60-day figure is skewed because it takes
into account people who might have been detained for a couple of
days and requested immediate deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Many detainees are forced to choose among untenable options:
Either accept deportation or remain in prison for however long it
takes to appeal their case. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fearing oppression &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerardo Ruiz Esposito sneaked into the United States from
Nicaragua, where he was a National Guard intelligence officer under
the US-backed Samoza government. After the Sandinistas wrestled
control away from Anastasio Samoza in 1979, Ruiz and scores of
other National Guard officers were put in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz remained in prison for eight years, and was released in in
1987. He fled the country, saying members of the new military
regime had told him to either leave or die. After working in
various Latin American countries, he crossed the US border
illegally in 1990. He said a border patrol officer caught him and
placed him in temporary detention in Harligen, Texas, a place where
people could walk in and out of freely. He left, he said, fearing
what would happen to him. Many Central American specialists say it
is common for people such as Ruiz to flee, because they have come
to associate police with oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz applied for political asylum, nonetheless, and lived in
Washington, DC, for many years, at the address he listed on his
asylum form. Three years ago, he moved to Rhode Island because he
heard there were better paying jobs. His job prospects soured, but
Ruiz met a woman, fell in love, and moved in with her.
</P>
<P>
   In a small conference room at the Plymouth County Correctional
Facility, Ruiz admitted he cheated on his girlfriend, Yolanda
Torres. But he says he never hit her.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a quarrel over his affair that Torres began
punching him, Ruiz said. Torres could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said as he held her arms, to keep her from punching him,
his elbow slipped and hit her in the head.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, a judge gave him a one-year suspended sentence and
a year probation on the simple assault conviction. That is when INS
agents began looking at his case, to see whether it was a
deportable offense. When they found out he was from Nicaragua,
living in the United States without documentation, it made his case
murky. Ruiz cannot be sent back because of a temporary order
banning deportations to Nicaragua, because of the damage caused by
Hurricane Mitch. And his political asylum application had not been
processed in the nine years he has been in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   David McHaffey, an attorney with the Political Asylum
Immigration Representation Project in Boston, said Ruiz could well
be in danger if he is deported back to Nicaragua. Even though the
government is now filled with Samoza party officials, Ruiz could be
tortured or killed by those seeking retribution because he could
have been responsible for the death of Sandinistas.
</P>
<P>
   McHaffey said Ruiz could be in jail for years because of the
backlog. He said he has processed claims for clients going back to
1990 that still have not been heard. ``There's not enough people to
process'' the claims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton said someone such as Ruiz should be placed on electronic
monitoring instead of spending thousands of dollars to keep him
incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration laws have to change, he said, otherwise the prison
population will swell. It is costing taxpayers about $500 million
this year, he said, an amount that is expected to increase rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a senseless policy because it subjects individuals to
arbitrary detention in violation of human rights laws,'' Helton
said. ``It's an insult to international rights laws.''

CANADIAN CON ARTISTS BILKING US RESIDENTS BY PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The call from Canada came in January, telling Eugene
Bowman of Litchfield, Maine, that he'd won a new 1999 Cadillac and
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, the silk-tongued talker said on the other end
of the line, adding that there was just one little bureaucratic
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me I needed to pay $2,475.61 for customs and Canadian
taxes,'' said the 67-year-old retired shoe factory worker. ``That
didn't strike me as so unreasonable, with the car coming from a
foreign country. Anyway, all I was really thinking was, `So,
finally I got lucky!' ''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman emptied his meager bank account and got a check right off
to Toronto, as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   He's still waiting for the car, although no longer with any
hope. ``I got hurt bad, lost all the savings I had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When telephone scam artists reach out to put the touch on
someone these days, it's likely to be from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States cracks down hard on phone fraud, Canada
offers a haven for shady operators who bilk hundreds of millions of
dollars each year from thousands of mostly elderly victims in the
United States. The big draw of Canada is that the country's
notoriously soft criminal sentencing standards mean that even
repeat offenders operate almost with impunity, paying small fines
or serving laughable ``community service'' sentences that barely
qualify as wrist slaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an incredible lack of empathy in the court
system, even though lives are devastated and savings wiped out,''
said Staff Sergeant Barry Elliott of the Ontario Provincial Police.
``This is brutal, heartless crime that targets senior citizens. But
it also seems to be the last crime where it's OK to blame the
victims as stupid or greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's other appeal for telemarketing fraud is that the simple
fact of an international boundary makes policing and prosecution
much more difficult. In some cases, Canadian prosecutors have
simply dropped charges against massive fraud rings because of
jurisdictional complications, coupled with the cost and headache of
bringing in victims and witnesses from another country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-border fraud with Americans being targeted from Canada
is absolutely the new trend in telemarketing crime,'' said Bridget
A. Small, a phone crime specialist with the Washington-based
American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every operation they shut down in Quebec or Ontario, four
or five seem to take its place,'' Small said. ``It's just become a
huge, huge problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Canada take the crime seriously, as do politicians
stung by recent criticisms from the US government and an array of
American consumer groups. But Canadian courts show an extraordinary
tolerance for a breed of criminals preying on the lonely, the
naive, and the vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case, a Canadian judge, J.W. Bovard, actually
praised a Quebec fraud artist with a lengthy criminal record for
``creating jobs'' by hiring con men to cheat people out of $364,000
over two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bovard also found it a mitigating circumstance that Peter
McMahon had ``paid utility bills and things like that,'' so
sentenced the Quebecer to a few months of house arrest at his
residence in Montreal's upper-crust Westmount district. The
toughest part of the penalty? During that period he was supposed to
inform police when he traveled out of the province or to the United
States on business.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was typical for Canada, and the court, just as
typically, essentially ignored the fact that McMahon had a record
of fraud, assault, and theft convictions stretching over three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is pretty clear that criminals don't have much to
fear from the Canadian justice system,'' said Elliott, who heads
the Ontario-based Phonebusters antifraud unit, which coordinates
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Montreal police, and other
Canadian forces in targeting phone crime.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, police say, Montreal has emerged as
the new capital of telemarketing fraud in North America, with
Toronto and Vancouver closing in behind.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of swindlers still plying their trade in the
United States, of course, but this year, Attorney General Janet
Reno, in an unusual swipe at Canada, decried the ``significant
increase'' in Canadian-based scams that dupe American victims into
thinking they've won some sort of Canadian lottery or sweepstake.
</P>
<P>
   One such scam cost a 62-year-old Marlborough, Mass., woman
$2,111.95. That was the amount she was told had to be paid to cover
``Canadian fees'' after a caller told her she'd won $50,000 in the
nonexistent International Value Sweepstakes. ``The man on the phone
was just so polite, so convincing _ he even said `God bless you'
twice,'' said the Marlborough woman, who asked that her name not be
published. She lives with her disabled husband and used a credit
card to pay Western Union to dispatch the money order. ``It was a
bad mistake trusting that voice on the other end of the line. We
learned an expensive lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Police caution that no legitimate contest will require winners
to pay a fee or tax, and urge Americans who suspect they are being
targeted by a scam to contact the Phonebusters squad toll-free at
888-495-8501.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's relatively easy treatment of criminals has long
astonished US law enforcement officials, and is hardly a secret to
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone has a tremendous urge to commit a crime, they should
definitely do it in Canada,'' one of the country's most prominent
defense lawyers, Edward Greenspan, is quoted as saying in the March
issue of American Lawyer magazine.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the haul from cross-border telemarketing scams was
negligible. American con artists mainly worked the United States,
while their Canadian counterparts usually stuck to cheating their
own compatriots. But now police estimate that Canadian fraud rings
are hauling in nearly $500 million a year from tens of thousands of
US victims.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there has been a dramatic stiffening of
penalties for crimes targeting the elderly, especially
telemarketing fraud. Sentences of 5 to 10 years in prison are
routine, especially with repeat offenders or perpetrators who foist
their scams on large numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   But to the north it's another story _ suspended sentences or
fines are the rule. Even when the fine is stiff, it's not much of a
deterrent, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fine of even $100,000 is just a cost of doing business for a
criminal who is pulling in millions,'' Elliott said. ``There's
nothing like jail time to crimp a crook's style. But sentencing for
this kind of crime in Canada is years behind the US.''
</P>
<P>
   As the din of complaints from the United States grows louder _
even President Bill Clinton has raised the issue, in a summit
meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chretien _ Canadian judges may
start to take a somewhat tougher line.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for the first time in Canada, a judge in Quebec
handed down prison sentences to four Montreal-based telemarketers
who had scammed millions of dollars while operating lottery scams
under such company names as American Family Publishers, Publishers
Central, and First Canadian Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The four received prison terms ranging from two to six months, a
sentence so severe for this type of offense that it was front-page
news.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians packed off to prison are eligible for parole after
serving one-third of their sentence, so the four could be back
within a week or two, punching out American area codes from a
telephone ``boiler room'' in Montreal.

`STAR WARS' SCREENING TO BENEFIT CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Star Wars'' director George Lucas is using the
power of the Force to help the charities that help children in 11
North American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm Ltd. announced Monday that it would release ``Star
Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' on May 16 _ three days ahead
of the general release _ in these cities to help raise money for
programs for children: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los
Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto
and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because `Star Wars' has always meant so much to children
around the world, I wanted to provide this opportunity to benefit
children in at least this small way,'' Lucas said in an
announcement made Monday on the film's Web site (www.starwars.com).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit screenings are expected to be a big draw, as well as
a huge boost for donations, because they are scheduled before the
general opening day, and anticipation is already high for the
sci-fi film.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, ``Star Wars'' fans began camping out Thursday in
front of Mann's Chinese Theater in order to be the first to see the
film on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations selected to benefit from the early release
cover a wide range of charitable needs. For example, the Los
Angeles screening will benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation, while proceeds from the New York event will go to the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

   COLLECTOR (Undated) _ Before he died suddenly last year at 81 of

of Citizen Kane-like obsessiveness. He filled almost every inch of
his two-story house in Marblehead, Mass., with things, including
books, guns, model boats, Civil War and World War II paraphernalia
and an old Scottish Bible collection. And in the basement, amid
jewels, old manuscripts and historic letters, was an extraordinary

DUMMY COP LOSES BATTLE WITH IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a dummy takes on the IRS, you can guess the
outcome. The dummy takes it on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Brendan O'Smarty and his alter ego, Officer
Bob Geary of the San Francisco police, they're not taking defeat in
tax court lying down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed but we're going to file an appeal,'' said
Geary, a veteran officer who walks a North Beach beat with his
10-pound wooden sidekick, a querulous ventriloquist's dummy wearing
police blues and a shiny badge numbered ``1/2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan is very upset. In fact, I'm afraid when we appear in
appeals court I might have to tape his mouth. I don't want to go to
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the veteran officer's petition before the U.S. tax
court was a deduction Geary took on his 1993 tax return for the
dummy. He'd put O'Smarty on San Francisco's ballot when the police
brass balked at allowing him to carry O'Smarty on patrol. Geary
formed the Committee to Save Puppet Officer Brendan O'Smarty, and
amused voters gave the dummy a narrow victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then Geary, who has been honored four times for valor, claimed
an advertising expense deduction of $11,465 on his return.
</P>
<P>
   Can't do that, countered the Internal Revenue Service,
explaining that Geary's expenses were for lobbying and political
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Geary decided to fight.
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, more than a year after the trial, Special Trial
Judge Stanley Goldberg sided with the IRS, saying the expenses were
not deductible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expenses incurred to influence the public with respect to
legislative matters, decisions or referendums are nondeductible,''
Goldberg said. Geary ``is not entitled to claim expenses incurred
in putting the Officer O'Smarty issue on the (ballot).''
</P>
<P>
   Geary owes the federal and state governments about $8,500,
including penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out Officer O'Smarty wasn't as smarty as he
thought,'' said IRS spokesman Larry Wright. ``Maybe when it comes
to taxes, Officer O'Smarty is a dummy. The bottom line is he lost
the case, (Geary) wasn't entitled to the deduction. You can't take
a business expense deduction for a public referendum ... It is
really black and white, it is clear in the tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   Geary's tax lawyers, Stephen M. Moskowitz and Rob Goldstein,
said they believed the judge made ``an overly broad reading of the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   They said they would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think what Bob did was under the letter and spirit of the
law,'' Moskowitz said. ``As courts have said, reasonable people can
differ.''
</P>
<P>
   A police officer for 29 years, Geary, 59, came up with the idea
for his pint-size pal after police administrators encouraged
officers to use creative and ingenious ways of communicating with
the public.
</P>
<P>
   He paid $2,000 for Brendan, outfitting the grinning dummy in a
miniature uniform replete with water pistol and business card
printed ``Courageous pathfinders to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to show people that police officers are
human,'' Geary said.

STRONG VOCALS DEFINE ESSENCE OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN SOUND &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
 MUSIC-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two years ago, the Houston International Festival
spotlighted the nations of western Africa. This year, the festival
shifts the cultural focus to southern Africa. The 12 honored
nations are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, the American pop-music audience has
become more knowledgeable about music from other countries. The
growing interest has spawned its own marketing category, world
beat, which can include anything from authentic Third World folk
music to Western pop artists influenced by the music of Africa,
Asia or Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston International Festival has developed a reputation as
one of the leading presenters of world-beat artists. The festival
even sponsors its own annual awards presentation, the American
World Music Awards, voted on by an international panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Houstonians would be hard-pressed to define the
difference between western African music and southern African music
</P>
<P>
   The largest southern African nation is the Republic of South
Africa. American listeners first heard South African music in the
1960s, when Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela toured and recorded in
the West. In the 1980s, Paul Simon used South African musicians on
his landmark ``Graceland'' album, which seamlessly blended Zulu
rhythms and vocal styles with sophisticated pop.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has long had its own thriving record industry,
trailing only North American and European markets in terms of total
sales. The most popular indigenous South African style is probably
mbaqanga, or ``township jive,'' which is the style featured most
prominently on ``Graceland.''
</P>
<P>
   South African music centers more on vocals, rather than the
polyrhythmic percussions of western African music. Ladysmith Black
Mambazo perfected the traditional Zulu a cappella vocal style
called iscathamiya.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, black South African music shows influences of
European church music, as well as the modern Western forms of jazz,
rhythm and blues, rock and reggae.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's music combines regional influences from the Congo and
South Africa with its own indigenous tribal sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The music of Angola and Mozambique sounds similar to Brazilian
music, reflecting centuries of Portuguese colonialism. Madagascar,
the most isolated African nation, boasts a unique Afro-Asian
musical heritage that has only recently been exported to the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Here are brief introductions to the African artists appearing at
this year's Houston International Festival.
</P>
<P>
   __ Angelique Kidjo _ Born in Benin, Kidjo is contemporary
Afro-pop's leading diva. Her latest album, Oremi, mixes funk and
soul grooves with pan-African melodies to create a true form of
world beat.
</P>
<P>
   __ Thomas Mapfumo &AMP; Blacks Unlimited _ Mapfumo's chimurenga
style translates the shimmering textures of the mbira (thumb-piano)
to the electric guitar. During Zimbabwe's war of liberation, he was
jailed for the outspoken political commentary in his songs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Samba Ngo _ Ngo is one of the leading exponents of Zairean
soukous style, which incorporates Afro-Cuban rhumba rhythms with a
distinctively African approach to electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oumou Sangare _ The young singer from Mali updates the
ancient griot tradition _ the African ancestor of Delta blues _
with modern instrumentation. She has become a strong advocate for
the rights of African women.
</P>
<P>
   __ Abdullah Ibrahim _ The pianist is considered to be the Duke
Ellington of South Africa. In 1990, he returned to his homeland
after 14 years in exile. His playing and compositions bring the
sophistication of jazz and classical music to the South African
popular tradition.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stewart Sukuma _ The Mozambican crooner has combined a boyish
pop appeal with South African, Brazilian and North American flavors
to become the unofficial musical ambassador of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hugh Masekela _ The legendary South African trumpeter has
been mixing African rhythm and melody with American jazz for 40
years. His latest album is Black to the Future.

A SPY OUTLIVES THE COLD WAR &HT;     

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   All that brow-furrowing about what spy novelists would do for
material after the Cold War has of course proved needless.
</P>
<P>
   International crime lords substitute nicely for the lords of
international communism in the baddies role. The narrative switch
works especially well, since lots of Russian apparatchiks really
have morphed into Mafia-style dons. Art is never happier than when
it can imitate life.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Color of Night,'' David Lindsey yokes this approach to
villainy with a narrative device well-known to fans of western
movies: The old gunfighter who wants to retire but can't because
his past won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   The result is another stylishly written page-turner from the
Austin-based novelist. ``The Color of Night'' _ Lindsey's 10th
novel _ pits an attractive and plausible hero and heroine against a
predictably cruel, crafty and inescapable criminal mastermind.
Filling out the cast are appropriately colorful minor characters.
Within the conventions of the thriller genre, ``The Color of
Night'' is a satisfying, engaging, intelligent read.
</P>
<P>
   The early chapters are set mostly in Houston, although we don't
remain there long _ the action takes us to Vienna, Geneva, London,
Venice, Rome, and the lovely little town of Bellagio on Lake Como
in northern Italy, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Strand is an art dealer, specializing in drawings. In his
late 40s and widowed a year before, he lives and works in ``a
two-story home in the museum district, an expensive address.''
</P>
<P>
   Strand is competent and strong-willed but also circumspect,
sensitive, emotionally guarded _ a good but hardly perfect man,
capable of making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Called to a Houston town house, he meets an attractive
Asian-American woman, Mara Song, who is getting divorced and wants
to sell a fine set of drawings _ Balthus, Ingres, Klimt, Maillol.
</P>
<P>
   Harry likes the drawings. He also likes their owner. He and Mara
begin seeing each other, their relationship deepening slowly.
</P>
<P>
   They jet off to Rome, where Harry has business to conduct and
Mara has a home. Harry returns one day to discover someone has
slipped into Mara's house and left a tape sticking out of the VCR.
He pushes the tape into the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``God. God. How could he have been wrong about it all,'' ends
the chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The tape shows the final minutes of his wife's life, before her
Land Rover plunged through a bridge railing and into a tidal stream
near Galveston. Harry discovers his wife's death was no accident.
She was murdered. And he knows by whom.
</P>
<P>
   We've sensed from the beginning that Harry is sitting on a pile
of money. Those museum-district houses don't come cheap. Now we
learn it wasn't dealer's markup that filled that fat bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end of the Cold War, Harry had been an American spy,
running a ring of agents in Europe, using art-dealing as a cover.
Naturally, that was a morally murky world full of treachery,
divided loyalties and secrets within secrets. Even the good guys
sometimes had to employ unsavory types.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latter was Wolfram Schrade, a hugely wealthy German
crime baron with a passion for collecting drawings. Before
retiring, Harry organized a team of five agents and embezzled
millions from Schrade.
</P>
<P>
   The viperous Schrade has finally figured out where his money
went and is out for revenge, picking off Harry's friends one at a
time. The first to die was Romy, Harry's wife, who had worked for
Schrade and provided insider knowledge of his financial affairs.
Next is the team's lawyer _ his body discovered absent head and
hands. Then Meret, Harry's assistant and an entirely innocent
party.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in good thriller fashion, the novel becomes a race: Can
Harry, with Mara in tow, stay one step ahead of Schrade, who seems
to have eyes everywhere? How can he get Schrade before Schrade gets
him? Can he protect Mara, who may or may not be what she seems? And
what of the involvement of the American spymasters _ Harry's old
bosses? Whose side are they on?
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the narrative sticks close to Harry's point of
view, we do jump outside and learn things he doesn't yet know. Thus
we see him as fallible, feeling his way forward, in many ways an
ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Harry is no natural-born killer. Although offing Schrade
seems, ultimately, the only solution, Harry doesn't know if he can
do it. Neither do we.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Harry must wrestle with the moral ramifications of his
actions. Is it really OK to steal from a criminal? Didn't he know
in some part of his mind that sooner or later Schrade would come
after his tormentors, and thus doesn't he, Harry Strand, bear
responsibility for their deaths?
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey leavens the novel with these moral quandaries. He also
offers a convincing portrait of Harry and Mara wrestling with their
feelings for each other _ their fears, hopes, doubts. The Color of
Night is a thriller with a human face.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Lindsey's prose is clean and lucid. He peppers the
narrative with neat portraits _ of a very pregnant bomb-maker,
``huge damp splotches of perspiration staining the underarms of her
dress and the material between her distended breasts,'' and of a
South American crime lord reacting to the news he's been betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the novel builds to an explosive climax in which a
second narrative thread, involving one of Harry's former
operatives, weaves into the first.
</P>
<P>
   Readers looking for a satisfying entertainment will savor ``The
Color of Night.''

DIXIE CHICKS HAVE MORE THAN GIRL POWER 
 

</HEADLINE>
 CHICKS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The Dixie Chicks arrived at the Grammy Awards looking
like glamorous biker chicks, in ripped black outfits held together
by safety pins and barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   The hip new threads were a far cry from the campy cowgirl look
they sported when the Chicks were one of the best-kept secrets on
the Texas music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Now the secret's out.
</P>
<P>
   The band _ formed by sisters Martie Seidel and Emily Erwin when
they were teen-agers in Dallas _ spent most of the past 10 years
traveling the Texas club circuit and playing state fairs and music
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until spirited Natalie Maines joined the group as lead
vocalist in 1995 that the Nashville powers that be sat up and took
notice. The Dixie Chicks' 1998 national debut album, ``Wide Open
Spaces,'' landed two No. 1 country singles and has sold some 5
million copies to make the trio by far the hottest new country act
of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable scenes at this year's Grammys was the
trio's accepting the prime-time award for country album of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chicks had picked up an award earlier in the
afternoon for best country vocal-group performance, they weren't
expecting to win in the prestigious album category, where they were
up against crossover queen Shania Twain and perennial Grammy
favorite Vince Gill.
</P>
<P>
   While the others giggled, Erwin blurted out, ``Shania just
performed; we thought that's how you won!''
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not even Twain _ looked more surprised by their
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cowgirl thing was just a gimmick to get people in the
door,'' Maines said. ``This is more who we really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured at the Grammys, we could get a little wild. We're
very girly girls. We love to dress up, and we love hair and makeup.
We're a designer's dream. We'll do whatever they want us to.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Grammy voters knew what they were doing. There's more to
these Chicks than three pretty faces, blond hair and designer
threads. They have the musicianship to back up the image.
</P>
<P>
   Seidel, 29, is a championship-caliber fiddler who's been playing
since she was 5. Erwin, 26, began playing when she was 10 and soon
learned to keep up with her sister on banjo, mandolin and guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Maines, 24, brings a proud Texas country music pedigree to the
band. She's the daughter of Lloyd Maines, longtime pedal steel
guitarist with Joe Ely and Jerry Jeff Walker and a much-in-demand
independent record producer in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice combines an undisguised country twang with a
free-spirited attitude and edgy taste to bring pop's girl-power
revolution into the more conservative world of country music.
</P>
<P>
   Siedel and Erwin were playing with the Dallas kid band Blue
Night Express when bluegrass guitarist/vocalist Robin Macy
recruited them to join the original edition of the Dixie Chicks.
The fourth member of the group was bassist/vocalist Laura Lynch, a
onetime Houston stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the Dixie Chicks mixed basic bluegrass
instrumentation with vintage Texas country styles, including
western swing, honky-tonk and cowboy songs. The group's retro
wardrobe of chaps, vests and square-dance skirts attracted as much
attention as its music.
</P>
<P>
   Macy left in 1992 when the group's sound began to evolve further
from traditional bluegrass. Lynch left, shortly after Maines joined
and began pushing the group in a more contemporary, commercially
viable direction.
</P>
<P>
   Maines was born in Lubbock, where her father and uncles had a
band called the Maines Brothers. She was still a little kid when
she began sitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could tell when she was just 2 or 3 that she had the
natural thing going on,'' Lloyd Maines said. ``When she was in
second grade, she told a second-grade teacher who was trying to
teach her math that she wouldn't need to be knowing that because
she was going to be a star.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Dixie Chicks came through Lubbock, they often had
dinner at the Maines home, which is how Natalie Maines became
friends with the Erwin sisters. (Martie changed her last name to
Seidel when she married a few years ago; Emily is now engaged to
Austin songwriter Charlie Robison.
</P>
<P>
   After she graduated from high school, Maines was awarded a vocal
scholarship to the Berklee School of Music in Boston. She stayed
one semester. Shortly after her return to Texas, the Dixie Chicks
offered her a job.
</P>
<P>
   The group had recorded three independent albums before signing
with Sony/Monument in 1997. At the suggestion of Lloyd Maines, who
had seen firsthand how the Nashville music industry can chew up and
spit out new talent, the Chicks had some stipulations written into
their contract.
</P>
<P>
   One was that they would have an equal say with the producers on
which songs made the album. The other was that Seidel and Erwin
would do all their own picking instead of turning their instruments
over to the usual cast of Nashville session musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chicks appreciate the creative freedom they're
afforded, they still get a kick out of keeping the record-label
folks off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that we're pushing buttons Nashville isn't used to,''
Maines said. ``I think that is the Texas in us. You can't get rid
of that. We just feel like if we can't be ourselves out here and
have fun, then it isn't worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first time Blake Chancey, a Sony Nashville vice
president, heard the Dixie Chicks play live at Austin's Broken
Spoke, he never doubted that Erwin and Seidel would do their own
picking on the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to be thought of as world-class musicians,'' he
said. ``Twenty years from now, when music is in a whole different
place, they'll still be known as great players.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he wondered how country radio would respond to
the old-fashioned sound of a banjo next to the pop-oriented songs
of Shania Twain and Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggested we should still have the banjo on the record, but
we should tone it down some,'' Chancey said. ``Emily went, `You're
crazy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now Erwin is up for instrumentalist of the year at the Academy
of Country Music Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks came along at just the right time, said Steve
Giuttari, music director at a Houston country station. Country
radio was seeking something a little different from the usual
Nashville fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a hip look, and I'd say they sound pretty poppy,''
he said. ``I think the banjo and fiddle are almost beside the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The group appeals to the youth audience, which has drifted away
from the country format since the boom years of the early '90s. But
Giuttari predicted that country radio will take a wait-and-see
attitude toward the Dixie Chicks' next album.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they've been working hard on a follow-up to ``Wide Open
Spaces,'' which they hope to have out by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people want to know what to expect,'' Maines said.
``A lot of people say we should be scared 'cause we have a lot to
live up to. We're approaching this album the same as we approached
the first one. We're even going more out of bounds on this. There's
even more banjo.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it bother Maines when people say the Dixie Chicks aren't
country? Absolutely. As if to prove the point, the group's current
single, ``Tonight the Heartache's on Me,'' is a hard-core Texas
honky-tonk shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``VH-1 wouldn't play our videos unless we took the steel guitar
and fiddle off, and we said no to that,'' Maines said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listen to those other stations, and we're fans of that
music, but we don't ever want anyone to say that we're trying to
not be country. We're trying to do the opposite. We want to bring
country back to country.''

NEWSPAPER EDITORS ARE TALKING ETHICS AND EATING FANCY FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Attention homeless: This week 546 people who
professionally agonize about the poor and the homeless are at the
Fairmont Hotel here talking about ethics and eating fancy food.
Yes, the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention is in
town.
</P>
<P>
   Get those cardboard signs ready: ``Will trade touching human
interest stories for warmer newspapers to sleep under.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and Catholic Church:
Come on, let's have another fight. Rip up each others' good and bad
habits. Show those editors they don't have to look to Kosovo to
find intolerance and religious war.
</P>
<P>
   Attention local citizens: You may have noticed that the San
Francisco Chronicle is running a five-part series you're not
reading on newspaper credibility.
</P>
<P>
   This effort at appearing serious is taking place because the 546
editors, professors and experts on journalistic ethics (something
like musicologists of military music) are the most important
readers in town this week.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of them will be reading anything beyond the
restaurant reviews. Like any other conventioneers, the editors are
here to eat, not listen to seminars like ``covering gays and
lesbians in your town'' and ``private lives and public people _ has
the press gone too far?''
</P>
<P>
   The session on gays is at 7:45 a.m. Friday, a time when no
hard-partying journalist is out of bed, so you can see how
important that is.
</P>
<P>
   And if you really want to hear the press going too far in
talking about public and private lives, and dishing the dirt on
politicians they know, wait until the editors get a good buzz on at
Postrio or Farallon.
</P>
<P>
   And now some words of warning to the visiting editors, besides
``Look twice at all nuns.''
</P>
<P>
   This is San Francisco, and a lot might come out of your
convention. Someone may even come out at your convention.
</P>
<P>
   During the U.S. Conference of Mayors three years ago, a friend
at the Fairmont informed me that a male mayor of a middle-sized
American city went up to his room and came down as a female mayor,
size 16 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen in San Francisco. On Wednesday, during his
keynote speech, Mayor Willie Brown may even talk completely
seriously, telling no outrageous jokes, speaking only the truth
about his doomed stadium-mall, the homeless who never go away, the
transit system that doesn't work, and the downtown parking he's
eliminated so his developer pals can throw up highrises.
</P>
<P>
   Naah. That only happens in ``Bulworth.'' San Francisco isn't
that deep into sharing inner feelings. Brown won't tell you how
much he hates the press. This is a guy who once screamed, ``Shut
up, press!'' during a news conference on his 49ers stadium-mall.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, stadium-mall. Brown wanted to combine football with food
courts and the Gap. It hasn't worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Brown won't yell at you, because only a handful of you are from
papers that regularly cover him. He'll charm most of you because he
is witty, intelligent and perhaps the second-best politician in
America.
</P>
<P>
   To put that in perspective, though, the best politician in
America recently was impeached and is losing a war with a small
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will be speaking to you on Thursday. Unlike
Brown, Clinton does have ex-girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, after I criticized Brown for giving an ex-girlfriend a
$65,000 job and place to live on Treasure Island here, Brown
bragged, ``I have no ex-girlfriends.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as I can tell from talking to his ex-girlfriends, it's
true.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some tips for editors visiting The City. Yes, we put it in
caps because we're so impressed with ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has been reduced to having one newspaper bar, the
M&AMP;M. The food isn't bad, but there's no smoking because this is
California. Newspaper people don't smoke anyway. And you wonder why
newspapers are in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Hanno's around the corner used to be a newspaper bar, but a few
years ago it was renamed the Tempest and became a bike messenger
bar. The bike messengers smoke and now they're unionizing. So it
goes in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   High-paid journalists, like TV anchors, editors and the
occasional columnist, sometimes may be found at Moose's in North
Beach. This is because of Ed Moose, whom all you visiting editors
probably know, because he knows everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The food is far too good for a place where journalists hang out.
On the other hand, nobody gives you an Evian-addled frown if you
order hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   You can fall right out of Moose's into the heart of North Beach,
where the soul and the best of the cholesterol of San Francisco
reside.
</P>
<P>
   We know what you're here for. You're here to eat. Just pick a
place, and you probably won't do too badly. The best bet is to get
away from those seminars and discussions of readers' focus groups
and find a restaurant filled with real newspaper readers, and no
other editors in it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the best smoke-filled rooms are filled with mesquite
smoke.

MARY JANE RATHBUN, MARIJUANA CRUSADER, DIES AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mary Jane Rathbun, the feisty woman whose
marijuana-laced brownies eased the pain of a generation of people
dying of AIDS, died Saturday at Laguna Honda Hospital after a
lengthy illness. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun, who was known as ``Brownie Mary,'' had used a
wheelchair since injuring her spine in a fall in August, according
to Larry Bittner, a longtime friend and the executor of her estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownie Mary was a hero for our time, in a world with few
heroes,'' Bittner said Monday. She was ``selfless, thinking always,
even to the end, about others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun _ one of the earliest and most constant proponents
of using marijuana for medicinal purposes _ gained notoriety in the
1980s for baking and delivering marijuana brownies to patients in
the AIDS ward at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She was arrested twice in San Francisco but, in 1992, city
supervisors honored her with a ``Brownie Mary Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she made 134 dozen a month during the heyday, 1984 to
1994,'' said Dennis Peron, who founded the now-defunct San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club with Ms. Rathbun. ``And you could
smell it all through her building. The old ladies there were all
cool about it. Hey, it's San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun was born in Minnesota, named Mary Jane by her
unwitting, conservative, Irish Catholic mother.
</P>
<P>
   That coincidence vastly amused her, according to Bittner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given my background and reputation and my adopted name,''
Brownie Mary told Bittner recently, ``my poor old mother is surely
turning cartwheels in her grave. It serves her right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun moved to San Francisco after World War II and worked
for many years as a waitress. While she baked brownies for AIDS
patients, she was living on $650-a-month Social Security check. It
pained her, she said, that the lack of money limited the number of
AIDS patients _ whom she called her ``kids'' _ she could help.
</P>
<P>
   Her start in the marijuana brownie business wasn't so
altruistic.
</P>
<P>
   When she was arrested in 1981, she admitted she was in it for
the profit. But when she as arrested a decade later in Sonoma
County, she said, ``This time I wasn't in it for the bucks. This
time I was doing it for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She used marijuana to ease the pain in her own arthritic knees,
she said, but she also never forgot those she helped. ``I get a
little marijuana every once in a while,'' she said in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I save it up until I've got enough to make 20 dozen brownies
for my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun became an activist in her teens when she traveled
with a group in the Midwest supporting the union rights of miners.
She married after moving to San Francisco and she and her late
husband had a daughter, who died in an automobile accident in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   She had no known surviving relatives.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-FUSION (Paris) _ Please don't tell Escoffier, but there
is a dessert in Paris called the wonton kumquat Nutella. Served at
a new Right-Bank restaurant called Cafe Mosaic, it comes in a
bamboo steamer. Its central feature is a very undessert-like
display of three soft wonton envelopes, each containing a whole
kumquat and a small puddle of molten Nutella. The thing is awful.
But in Paris, it may also be the wave of the future. Fusion has
come to France, and it feels funny. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-BISTROS (Paris) _ For generations bistros have been the
soul of Paris, casual neighborhood restaurants where regulars drop
in for local gossip and a reassuringly familiar meal. Almost as
important as the food is the setting, usually small, intimate and
aglow with stained or painted wood, etched glass and mirrors,
bric-a-brac, prints and posters. Lately there is a boom in bistros
that serve traditionally lusty cuisine at prices ranging from $20
to $100 for a complete meal for one, wine included. The concept is
so popular that some now require reservations as long as three
weeks ahead, which really compromises the spontaneous bistro
spirit. By Mimi Sheraton.

<P>
   RAW-EGGS (New York) _ Nothing unusual about the egg yolk staring
up at me from a plate of tagliatelle at Babbo one night last week.
Except that the egg was raw. Totally uncooked. Cold. This was a
little disconcerting at first, but, once mixed in with the buttery
pasta and chunks of cured pork, the egg and the dish warmed up into
an irresistible indulgence, with an aftertaste of danger. Because
raw eggs can kill you. Or so we have been told. By Rick Marin.

JACKSON COURTS SILICON VALLEY, URGES MINORITY HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Rev. Jesse Jackson stormed through Silicon
Valley and kept up his full-court press on technology companies to
hire more minorities and do more business with minority-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In whirlwind meetings from dawn to dusk Monday, the civil rights
leader talked with dozens of power brokers, including executives
from Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone interview between stops, Jackson said an
hour-long meeting with Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple,
was ``productive and positive.'' The two ``share common interests''
and hope to work closely on projects in the near future, Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're setting the foundation for strong, long-term
collaborations with high-tech companies,'' Jackson said. ``We're
moving into the substantive stage.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition have
pressured technology companies to hire more African-Americans and
Hispanics. According to the U.S. Labor Department, blacks and
Hispanics make up 11 percent of the work force in the top 33
companies in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also is encouraging high-tech companies to sign more
contracts with minority vendors, to sell more technology-related
products in minority neighborhoods and to add nonwhites to their
boards.
</P>
<P>
   In order to monitor the companies, Rainbow/PUSH has bought stock
in 50 high-tech companies and will attend shareholders' meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have management teams that look like America,''
Jackson said. ``Management lives in a relatively small world, with
no sense of markets beyond their limited cultural environments. One
company wasn't even aware of the existence of Black Entertainment
Television or Ebony magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson added: ``Let's dispense with the excuses and open the
doors, and you'll see many opportunities to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader also has drawn sharp criticism from some
quarters of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Rodgers, the chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor in
San Jose, recently likened Jackson to ``a sea gull that flies
around leaving droppings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers didn't back off Monday, accusing Jackson of ``shaking
down companies'' for funding on minority projects. Executives who
disagree with Jackson's civil rights agenda are branded as racists,
Rodgers charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this guy needs a punch in the nose. He's offensive,''
Rodgers said. ``What if I walked into the Cuban district of Miami
and made a bunch of generalizations about people? That would be
pretty arrogant of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any other sector in America, Rodgers said, Silicon Valley
has its share of discrimination, but there is no widespread
``economic apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson declined to get into a public spat with Rodgers, saying
only that Rodgers is ``a phantom who doesn't exist, who doesn't
represent Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 report by the National Science Foundation,
blacks and Hispanics make up roughly 3 percent of all scientists
and engineers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies also show that blacks, Hispanics and low-income
communities have much less access to Internet technologies than
others.
</P>
<P>
   Not all is gloomy news, though. Signs are surfacing that blacks
and Hispanics are making greater use of high-tech resources.
</P>
<P>
   About 43 percent of Hispanics and 40 percent of blacks are
expected to sign on to the Internet next year, according to a
report Monday by the technology firm Forrester Research and the
U.S. Internet Council, a private trade group funded by 33 high-tech
companies, including Intel, Microsoft and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Silicon Valley, Jackson has sought more economic clout
for minorities on Wall Street and in the auto industry. He's also
tried to get more black coaches and managers hired in Major League
Baseball and the NCAA.

L.A. PEDIATRIC AIDS FOUNDATION TO HOST EXCLUSIVE PREMIERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Force will be with a Los Angeles-area AIDS
foundation that's been chosen to host one of the first screenings
anywhere of George Lucas' new ``Star Wars'' installment.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation is one of 11
national charities benefiting children that will premiere ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' at 11 May 16 fund-raisers in
the United States and Canada. The movie's official opening is May
19.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Cheryl Cook said Tuesday that the nonprofit, Santa
Monica-based foundation hopes the invitation-only event will raise
$700,000 for its research activities aimed at AIDS/HIV prevention
and treatment. The much-anticipated space saga will screen at 1
p.m. on three screens at the 1,400-seat GCC Avco Cinema Westwood on
Wilshire Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, named for the late wife of actor Paul Michael
Glaser, will begin mailing invitations next week soliciting
potential buyers for three different ticket packages. The most
expensive, ``The Jedi Knight Package,'' costs $25,000 and includes
10 seats to the movie screening, 10 tickets to a post-premiere
party being produced by Along Came Mary, and 10 additional movie
and party tickets for 10 HIV-positive children to attend. The
``Skywalker Package,'' at $10,000, buys eight seats and eight party
tickets and sponsors eight HIV-positive children; and the
``Obi-Wan'' package ($5,000) buys four reserved seats and four
party passes and sponsors four children.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed number of additional tickets are being sold for
$500 apiece on a first-come, first-served basis through Levy,
Pazanti and Associates at (310) 201-5033.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said that Lucasfilm has specified that all tickets to the
fund-raiser must be sold. No complimentary passes will be
available, even to 20th Century Fox, the film's distributor. The
L.A. fund-raiser is being underwritten by Flexjet, a company that
arranges part ownership of corporate and business jets. The company
also will be donating $500 a ticket for 150 HIV-infected children
and their families to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The other charities are in Chicago, Boston, Dallas, Denver, New
York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto and
Washington, D.C.

FREE SPIRIT TURNS LITERACY INTO PASSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (with art) 
 
By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The social swirl is intoxicating. Politicos, captains
of industry, nonprofit heavies, the mayor _ everyone is here,
quaffing coffee and gabbing it up.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Doughty navigates her way through the schmooze-fest.
Two tiny books dangle from her ear lobes. Shake her hand and you
can't help but absorb her effervescence. Maybe it's the crisp
British accent or the zesty, can-do demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Doughty charms, as anyone can attest who attended the Mayor's
Literacy Leadership Awards Breakfast, a thank-you in January to
those furthering the cause. It's by combining this charm with hard
work and near-missionary zeal that the diminutive Doughty has made
literacy Social Cause No. 1 in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Under her leadership, the Houston READ Commission, formed in
1988, has grown into the largest urban literacy coalition in the
United States, one emulated throughout the nation. She oversees an
annual budget of more than $4 million and travels the world to
spread her literacy gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfasts with corporate swells and power elites are not really
Doughty's cup of tea. Her true constituency is the disenfranchised
folks whose inability to read sorely limits their lives. Her true
home is the decidedly less glamorous Houston READ Commission
office, a well-worn former shopping center in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 organizations under the READ umbrella together reach
about 100,000 students a year, most of them adult learners.
</P>
<P>
   Doughty has spent 20 years traveling the world, teaching. Queen
Elizabeth II recently named Doughty a Member of the British Empire,
the most prestigious award for public service her nation can
bestow.
</P>
<P>
   To Doughty, battling illiteracy is part of the ongoing war on
social injustice. It's a key strand in the civil-rights fabric
America continues to weave.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, she is a freedom fighter. Truth be told, a bit of a
rebel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she's not one to throw rocks,'' says Chase Untermeyer, a
computer-industry bigwig who is president of the READ Commission
board. ``She throws bouquets. After you get hit with enough
bouquets, she gets your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Doughty, 50, was born in London but grew up in a tiny English
village, an isolated hamlet of hedgerows and sheep herds. One of
four kids, Doughty is the daughter of a minister father and a
community-minded mother. She attended a Catholic convent school,
where rules were rigid and strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always in trouble,'' she says with a conspiratorial
snicker. ``I often had to stay in school on Saturdays and do
assignments. I didn't like authority one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   She launches into an extended riff on the ills of the English
and American education systems, whose institutions, she says, too
often sacrifice creativity and independence for efficiency and rote
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have that old Victorian concept of creating workers
to fill the mines, the factories,'' she says emphatically.
``Especially in neighborhoods of economic need, where illiteracy
and poverty go hand in hand, we foster that. We talk about giving
people the opportunity to work, but let's keep that minimum wage
low, let's make sure we're feeding that lowest level of the
workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt constricted in the cloistered life of a minister's
child. ``I wanted to be out of school and doing something useful,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   So when she was invited to become a volunteer in an overseas
literacy program after high school, Doughty jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   She was assigned to Nyamandhlovu, a village deep in the African
bush whose name meant ``feet of the elephant,'' referring to the
dust stirred up during elephant stampedes.
</P>
<P>
   She was 17, away from home for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Doughty's job was to teach English, along with two African
teachers, to students at an elementary school where, by government
rule, African children were allowed to continue only through second
grade. The rule was designed to perpetuate a ``two-tier society,''
she says, but the students weren't so easily dissuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had rather a lot of children who had very interesting birth
certificates,'' Doughty says, grinning slyly again. ``We had
students 18, 19, 20 years old who were desperate to get an
education, their parents absolutely adamant they would continue.
Never in my life have I seen such a desire to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year her volunteer stint was up, and she returned to
England, went to college and became a teacher. She took on a class
of at-risk high-school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They walked in the door disheveled, messy, smoking cigarettes,
just challenging the whole time,'' she recalls. ``They were like,
`What ya gonna do, miss? Would ya like a puff, miss?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the slowly growing belief that you must reach people where
they are _ an underpinning philosophy of the READ Commission _
Doughty looked her students in the eye: I have to be here. You have
to be here. What do you want to do? What are you interested in?
</P>
<P>
   War, they said. Terrible diseases. Grotesqueries.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to the library and checked out books on battles and
read them to her class. Slowly the kids started asking questions.
What happened again on that little island in Asia during World War
II? How little do you have to eat to become malnourished?
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to the point where we were actually learning things,''
she says, hooting.
</P>
<P>
   She married a young civil engineer (they're now divorced) and
soon their first of three sons (now all grown) came along. She and
her husband had agreed that, while their children were young, they
would alternate taking jobs in different countries as a way to see
the world. So, through the years, Doughty has taught school in Iran
and the United Arab Emirates, to students of all ages, on all
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband received a job offer from Houston, Doughty
reluctantly agreed to move. The Bayou City seemed less than exotic
after their world travels, but she fell in love with the city the
moment she arrived, she says. She became a writer.
</P>
<P>
   One night, a friend asked whether she'd be interested in
developing computer software for the Houston Independent School
District. Do what? She laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she became a member of the district's technology
department, designing curricula for at-risk kids. Around that time,
Mayor Kathy Whitmire wound up a task force on illiteracy in Houston
by launching a coalition that would lasso federal money and
galvanize corporate support. The school district agreed to lend an
employee, Doughty, to serve as executive director of the new
Houston READ Commission.
</P>
<P>
   An appalling 52 percent of Houston adults are functionally
illiterate, meaning they cannot decipher such routine things as
prescription labels or bus schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Change this statistic, she says, and the quality of life in
Houston would soar. Crime would drop. Likewise drug use. Ditto teen
pregnancy. When people can read, she says, they make better
choices. They get better jobs. They gain hope.
</P>
<P>
   Is the READ Commission, in essence, doing what the schools
couldn't do?
</P>
<P>
   She pauses, smiles. The rebel has learned to rein in her words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider ourselves to be Houston's educational safety
net,'' she says. ``We are the underground school system that helps
to provide opportunities to those folks who fall through the cracks
in the system.''
</P>

FROM HOMEMAKER TO METEOROLOGIST, THESE PIANO COMPETITORS RUN THE
CAREER GAMUT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by PIANO COMPETITION-LIST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Millions of people took piano lessons
somewhere along the way. Most of them will never get to play
Carnegie Hall _ or win the Cliburn gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of 97 amateur pianists will get their taste of
stardom this June, courtesy of the Cliburn Foundation, the same
folks who present the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition
every four years in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs,
these piano aficionados _ who might have made a career of music,
but instead chose it as an avocation _ will compete in a setting
reminiscent of the main Cliburn competition. They will play on the
stage of Ed Landreth Auditorium, where the main Cliburn used to be
held. Wearing concert finery, they'll perform music of Bach,
Chopin, Mozart _ much the same as competitors in the real Cliburn.
</P>
<P>
   A diverse and interesting group, those chosen from a field of
143 applicants include a meteorologist, the chief art critic of The
New York Times, the director of gaming tables at Harrah's Casino in
Reno, Nev., a railroad manager, a hairdresser, a number of
physicians, two flight attendants and a prime-time television
anchor _ who 14 years ago was third runner-up in the Miss America
pageant.
</P>
<P>
   But in some respects, the two Cliburn competitions are
dissimilar. The quadrennial Cliburn competition is aimed at young
professionals, and is limited to 35 of the most advanced and
polished pianists, ages 18-30, in the world. The leading music
competition in the world, it will be held again in Fort Worth in
May and June 2001. The top prize, including cash, engagements,
contracts and perks, is worth around a quarter of a million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur competition, meanwhile, is limited to people who
make their living in something other than music, and who are
``older than'' 30. The top prize is $2,000. How often it will be
held remains to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   But the two competitions have something in common: Both promote
and celebrate the love of the piano and the rich repertoire that
has been written for that instrument.
</P>
<P>
   One area where the amateurs actually excel beyond the pianists
of the main Cliburn is in their remarkable diversity. Competitors
in the amateur competition represent 23 states and 10 countries.
Many were child prodigies who had extensive collegiate or
conservatory level training; many work in technical fields or in
medicine. And many are classic overachievers.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-area competitors include Dr. Maria Fawcett, a staff
physician at North Hills Hospital in Fort Worth; David Hibbard,
manager of locomotive utilization at Burlington Northern &AMP; Santa Fe
Railroad; otolaryngologist John Ponder of Colleyville; homemaker
Judith Sherrard of Grapevine; and registered nurse Cynthia Riley of
Burleson.
</P>
<P>
   At the competition, which will be June 9-13 at Ed Landreth
Auditorium at Texas Christian University, all competitors will play
a 10-minute program in the first round. Up to 18 will be selected
to advance to the semifinal round to perform a 20-minute program.
Six finalists will perform a 30-minute recital. As in the Cliburn
competition, all competitors are free to select repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn Foundation executive director Richard Rodzinski says
that some of the competitors in the amateur competition ``have
unbelievable repertoires. Some of them have been accumulating
pieces for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited one competitor whose list of repertoire _ titles only _
was 21 pages long.
</P>
<P>
   The amateur competition will also provide a try-out ground for
several new ideas that may be incorporated into the next Cliburn
competition. A jury of music critics will select a winner, with the
idea that the main Cliburn competition may have a separate press
jury and press award in 2001. Likewise, there will be an audience
favorite award, which will be selected by a balloting of members of
the audience at the final round.
</P>
<P>
   And a new jury voting system, which is meant to more accurately
reflect the jury's opinions, will be tried out at the amateur
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Symphony music director John Giordano, chairman of
the Cliburn competition jury, also will chair the jury for the
amateur competition, assisted by Gerard Bekerman, founder of the
Grand Amateur Competition of Paris, the only comparable event in
the world. Jurors serving for all three rounds will include John
Ardoin, former chief music critic of the Dallas Morning News; 1997
Cliburn Competition gold medalist Jon Nakamatsu; Germaine Deveze
and Sabine Lacoarret, both of the faculty of the Paris
Conservatory; Jack Roberts of the faculty of the University of
North Texas; Shields-Collins Bray, staff pianist of the Fort Worth
Symphony; and Carol Leone of the faculty of Southern Methodist
University.
</P>
<P>
   For the semifinal and final rounds, the jury also will include
Benedetto Lupo, bronze medalist of the 1989 Cliburn Competition;
Robert Garwell, dean of the School of Fine Arts and Communications
at TCU; pianist John Owings of the TCU faculty; pianist David Karp
of the faculty of Southern Methodist University; pianist Adam
Wodnicki of the faculty of the University of North Texas; pianist
Monte Hill Davis; Paul Pollei, director of the Gina Bachauer
Competition; and Alina Rubinstein, daughter of Arthur Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
   A press jury will include music critics Daniel Cariaga of the
Los Angeles Times, Stephen Wigler of the Baltimore Sun, Richard
Dyer of the Boston Globe, Donald Rosenberg of the Cleveland Plain
Dealer, William Littler of the Toronto Star, Olin Chism of the
Dallas Morning News and Stuart Isacoff, editor of Piano Today.

Somalia, nab a couple of the warlord's lackeys and return to the

were made. Mistakes that led to the worst firefight involving
American soldiers since Vietnam. In ``Black Hawk Down: A Story of
Modern War,'' Mark Bowden tells of the events on the streets of
Mogadishu on Oct. 3, 1993, in visceral detail. It's a lucid,
authoritative account of the raid that's great military history and

   SOMALIA STORY: The idea was for the good guys _ U.S. Army
Rangers and supersecret Delta Force warriors _ to buzz into
Somalia, nab a couple of the warlord's lackeys and return to the
base in time for dinner. A milk run. But mistakes, as they say,
were made. Mistakes that led to the worst firefight involving
American soldiers since Vietnam. In ``Black Hawk Down: A Story of
Modern War,'' Mark Bowden tells of the events on the streets of
Mogadishu on Oct. 3, 1993, in visceral detail. It's a lucid,
authoritative account of the raid that's great military history and
great nonfiction storytelling. (Includes 3-column B&AMP;W photo of

STARK JOURNEY INTO HEROIN ADDICTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In 1995, heroin made a big comeback in San
Francisco. And not just any heroin. It was black tar heroin, cooked
from poppies grown in the Michoacan province of Mexico, a cheap,
minimally processed form of the drug that was widely available and
particularly noxious.
</P>
<P>
   The influx caught the eye of filmmaker Steven Okazaki, who lived
nearby and won an Oscar for his 1991 documentary ``Days of
Waiting.'' He began accompanying needle exchange workers as they
made the rounds of San Francisco's many junkie havens.
</P>
<P>
   After months of handing out muffins to addicts and helping the
workers swap needles, Okazaki parlayed his relationships with the
young addicts into an extraordinary up-close look at their lives,
and their fall into prostitution, petty crime, drug dealing, jail,
physical deterioration, emotional devastation and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a remarkable _ and remarkably painful _
documentary, ``Black Tar Heroin: The Dark End of the Street,''
being shown at 11 tonight on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Okazaki initially followed a dozen of the young addicts, before
settling on five of them during more than two years of shooting
that gives you an intimate sense of what their lives are like.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet them, Jessica, Jake, Oreo, Tracey and Alice are all
young, newly into heroin, still articulate, relatively healthy,
attractive and interested in the world.
</P>
<P>
   They're interested in books (though books by junkie authors such
as William Burroughs and Arthur Rimbaud), they have dreams about
their futures, they don't think heroin is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But during a dismayingly short period, things start to fray for
several of them. Jessica takes up prostitution, soon ending up in
the worst streetwalking neighborhood in the city, and begins taking
crack cocaine and other drugs to help juice up the dream state of
the heroin.
</P>
<P>
   She contracts AIDS, which is diagnosed after she's arrested for
hooking. Another arrest on prostitution and she can be charged with
attempted murder, but Okazaki soon shows her back on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey, after spending six months in jail, falls back into
heroin within eight hours of her release, while her Ohio mother
sends money to try to stabilize her life. Soon enough, she is
dealing to feed her habit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jake and Oreo work as male prostitutes, and Jake also
contracts AIDS and disappears for a time. He later emerges gaunt
and sullen, unwilling to talk. Late in the show, Okazaki shows him
in a hospital, then follows Jake after he runs away with his IV
shunt still embedded in his body. Jake uses the shunt to shoot up
more heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Excruciating scenes like those give the documentary its power.
Okazaki used a tiny digital camera that allowed him amazing access
to the youths he was following, and even into the flophouse hotels
where they lived and where visitors with cameras aren't welcome.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a film for the squeamish. He repeatedly shows the
addicts shooting up, stripping on street corners to stick a spike
in a still-functioning vein, lurching down the street after getting
their fix.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the documentary so powerful is that Okazaki
focuses only on the young junkies. There's not a single word
uttered by a government bureaucrat, a police officer, an anti-drug
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he sketches in the youths' occasional interactions with
welfare agencies, the court system, police and other official types
by quick interstitial frames that update what happens. Mostly,
though, it's the youths themselves, and their lovers, and in
Alice's case, her mother.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this documentary is reminiscent of ``Let's Get
Lost,'' Bruce Weber's excruciating look at the wasted talent of
junkie jazz artist Chet Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Weber contrasted Baker's '50s Adonis-like heyday with
the ruined face of his last days, Okazaki does the same with young
people just starting their own walk toward the dark end of the
street. D.A.R.E. ought to order 1 million copies.

   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares to host his

HEADING FOR THE GREAT OUTDOORS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Grab your gear. We're getting away.
</P>
<P>
   We're going off the interstate. Leaving behind the daily grind.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to get back to nature. Back to basics. Back to fun.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps you already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   Recent surveys show that nature-related trips represent the
fastest-growing segment of the travel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Among findings:
</P>
<P>
   __ Camping is Americans' favorite outdoor activity.
</P>
<P>
   __ Each year, more than 300 million visitors pour into our 56
national parks.
</P>
<P>
   __ About 27 million people rolled away on biking vacations in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   __ One-half of U.S. adults (that's 98 million people) have taken
an adventure vacation during the same period. About 31 million
engaged in a ``hard'' adventure activity, such as white-water
rafting or mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, experts say, an estimated 18 million Texans a year will
participate in nature tourism.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for families, suggests Mark Evans, co-owner of
Texas River Expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``An outdoors adventure is one that eliminates television,
computers, phones and Nintendo,'' he says. ``People get back to
each other with nothing between them. They start talking and
interacting and playing. Then they can begin really enjoying one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about being a stranger to the great outdoors, says
Evans, whose rafting trips in Texas, Colorado and Idaho frequently
include camping novices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently did four family adventures,'' he says. ``Each
six-day trip had 25 guests. Of those 100, 22 had never been camping
before in their lives. Out of those 22, 15 are coming back on
another trip this year with us. They're taking shorter trips, but
they're coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some caveats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're expecting room service in your tent, you won't be
happy,'' Evans says. ``If you expect to be waited on hand and foot,
you won't like it. But if you want to have a new experience
outdoors and have a little adventure with it, you'll enjoy
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important maxim for the outdoors novice, according to
Evans: ``Go with an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Options for a nature-oriented vacation are seemingly endless: a
weekend getaway to one of Texas' 122 state parks, a monthlong trek
in Nepal, a surf holiday in Hawaii, kayaking with whales in Canada,
rock climbing in Nevada, scuba diving in Lake Superior,
photographing giraffes in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you'd just prefer to watch the kids splash in the
shallow waters of a river while lunch sizzles on a grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families today want adventure, but without the hassle,'' says
Andy Alpine, co-publisher of Specialty Travel Index. ``Trips need
to be geared to all ages and interests. Parents also need some
stress-free time alone, as well as quality time shared with the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialty Travel Index is a biannual publication that lists more
than 600 tour operators; it's available at many bookstores and
newsstands or can be accessed online at www.specialtytravel.com.
</P>
<P>
   You can get a good introduction to the gamut of nature
activities at next month's Texas Fly Fishing &AMP; Outdoor Show at
Aquarena Springs in San Marcos, sponsored by the Texas Parks &AMP;
Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   The May 21-23 event promises a variety of activities for all
ages, including hands-on instruction in nature photography,

<P>
   (Undated) Lions, tigers and bears are not your worst enemies
when you venture into the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Think more of sun, bugs and unpreparedness.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about the sun.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just 15 minutes of exposure to cause a bad burn. And
even a cloudy day is not without risk. Short of going nocturnal,
your best defense is covering up and slathering on.
</P>
<P>
   For clothing, invest in a wide-brimmed hat or cap and look for
lightweight and light-colored cottons that will protect from the
sun's rays while still feeling comfortable in heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Your sunscreen should have an SPF (sun protection factor) of 15.
If you are going to be in the sun for prolonged periods, consider a
sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Use sunscreen early and often. Experts recommend applying it 15
to 30 minutes prior to exposure. And reapply sunscreen frequently,
particularly if you're in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Also pay attention to the clock. The sun's rays are at their
most intense from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that some prescription medicines may make you more
vulnerable to sunburns. Antihistamines, sulfa drugs, diuretics and
some oral contraceptives are among those of concern. Consult your
doctor or pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes also can be damaged by overexposure. Wear sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get a sunburn, the best treatments are aspirin and
soaking in cool water. Cortisone cream and other over-the-counter
lotions may provide temporary relief of sunburn pain.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out for for signs of sun allergy, which may appear like a
rash. If your sunburn seems to be getting worse several days after
exposure, you may have a sun allergy. Consult a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Other risks for sun lovers and outdoor enthusiasts are
dehydration and heatstroke. Combat these with water.
</P>
<P>
   Stay hydrated. Drink fluids even when you don't feel thirsty.
Take frequent breaks and get out of the sun. Wearing a brimmed hat
and clothing that allows perspiration to evaporate quickly will
help, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs are the bane of many outdoor adventures. Not only are
mosquitoes and ticks pests, but the creatures also can transmit
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are most active early in the morning and at dusk. Be
prepared. Use a repellent that contains the chemical DEET. But
check with a doctor before applying any repellent on young
children. Often a better way is to apply it to their clothing, not
their skin.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid ticks, wear light-colored clothing as it makes the
blood-suckers easier to spot. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants
and tuck your pants into your socks. Pest repellents that contain
DEET also can help.
</P>
<P>
   When outdoors, make frequent inspections for ticks. If you find
one, remove it carefully using tweezers. For best results, grasp
the pest as close to the skin as possible and pull with a slow,
steady motion. Rather than yanking it off, the goal is for the tick
to let go. Never squeeze the tick's body.
</P>
<P>
   Most important to a good nature-oriented vacation is being
prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you're ready for your holiday with pre-trip
conditioning. Biking, hiking and canoeing are just a few of the
activities that require physical stamina. Sore muscles and injuries
can ruin a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning on hiking and backpacking, start a walking
regimen several weeks before your holiday. As your vacation
approaches, you may want to start carrying a backpack for trial
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a beach holiday or rafting trip? Brush up on your
swimming skills. If you have children, consider taking a
water-safety course.
</P>
<P>
   No matter your destination, pack a first aid kit. You can buy or
customize a kit, and it should include protective gloves; plastic
bandage strips in several sizes; mole skin, gauze and first-aid
tape; antihistamines; aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-fever and
anti-inflammatories; eye wash; tweezers and scissors; Imodium and
antacids.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to pack spare glasses and contact lenses, as well as
extra prescription medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, watch your alcohol intake. Alcohol can
increase your chances of dehydration. And whether you are operating
a recreational vehicle, a boat or bicycle, drinking and driving is
a no-no.
</P>

`STAR WARS' WAS A HARD SELL LONG AGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's inescapable. Whenever you turn on the TV or
look at a magazine or newspaper, ``Star Wars'' is there.
</P>
<P>
   Swanky Vanity Fair gave readers an upfront peek at the upcoming
movie with pages of photos. ``60 Minutes'' recently devoted not
one, but two program segments to George Lucas and his movie
franchise. Even fashionista bible Vogue featured ``Star Wars
Style.'' And that was all several months in advance of the film's
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken this job to an avalanche,'' says Jim Ward, head of
marketing for Lucasfilm. ``We're all just trying to make sure
nobody gets crushed underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   But long, long ago, in ... Van Nuys, where Lucas' Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic was first located, it was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science fiction was considered a very minor genre,'' says
Charles Lippincott, president of Creative Movie Marketing and head
of marketing for Lucas on the first film. Lippincott had met both
Lucas and ``Star Wars'' producer Gary Kurtz at USC's film school
and had done publicity for Alfred Hitchcock before working on
``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than `2001' and `Planet of the Apes,' there hadn't been
any real hits,'' says Lippincott. ``When we showed it to theater
owners (at an event put on by distributor Twentieth Century Fox),
the `big cigars' were like, `What is this? Where's Jacqueline
Bisset in her wet T-shirt?' (referring to 1977's `The Deep').''
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' will
open on about 4,000 screens. Lucas and Fox, which is also
distributing the new movies, reportedly have attached a long list
of conditions to exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's not a theater owner in the country who's not
dying to open ``Phantom''; they're all hoping that they'll be among
those anointed with the honor when theaters are announced (expected
to be this week).
</P>
<P>
   Theater owners in 1977 were so downbeat on ``Star Wars'' that
the movie opened on only 32 screens in the U.S. It had to open in
May, rather than the more competitive month of June, just to get
that many. It was considered de rigueur to open big movies in both
Hollywood and Westwood; Lucas only got his Hollywood theater,
Mann's Chinese, at the 11th hour due to a delay in the release of
the Roy Scheider picture ``Sorcerer.''
</P>
<P>
   Science fiction and comic book fans took to ``Star Wars''
immediately and have kept the movies, books and collectibles in
high demand ever since. The thing that's different this time around
is that the rest of the world has tapped into the geek network now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media world is so different now than it was 22 years
ago,'' says Dale Pollock, author of ``Skywalking: The Life and
Films of George Lucas,'' which is being reissued to coincide with
``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no E! Entertainment channel (22 years ago). There
was no Internet ... Fans discovered the Internet as a way of
communicating between themselves, and now Lucasfilm has learned to
use it, too,'' adds Pollock, now dean of North Carolina School of
the Arts' film school.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Phantom Menace'' movie trailer that started playing in
theaters late last year was instantly so popular that fans were
said to be buying tickets to shows just to see the trailer. Fans
and the media have analyzed every second of the trailer for clues
to the upcoming movie. An apparently stolen copy of the trailer was
auctioned off online for hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the original ``Star Wars'' trailer that started
playing in theaters around Christmas 1976 was laughed off the
screen. In ``Skywalking,'' Pollock writes that the response to the
trailer, in Westwood at least, was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (diminutive robot) R2-D2 fell over, there were giggles
and laughter. At the end, when it said, `Coming to your galaxy this
summer,' the audience groaned,'' recalls Ashley Boone, who was head
of marketing for Fox when ``Star Wars'' came out.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there was no buzz around ``Star Wars'' 22
years ago. Lippincott struck a comic book deal with Marvel for a
series of comics to launch in March 1977. It was very unusual at
that time for a movie to have such a pact prior to release, and
``Fox just thought it was dumb,'' Lippincott recalls. In another
unusual move, he took ``Star Wars'' posters and buttons selling for
$1 apiece to science fiction and comic conventions in the months
leading up to the film's release. Promoting movies at fan
conventions has since become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring, word had started to get out that Lucas might have
a big hit on his hands, though no one could have predicted it would
become the top-grossing film to date at that time. Publicity,
including a six-page layout in Time magazine the week before the
movie opened, resulted in lines around the block at theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The final piece of the puzzle was merchandising and promotions.
Studios considered these areas peripheral in 1977, but merchandise
in particular would end up making Lucas very rich.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola promoted the movie that summer with things like themed
cups at McDonald's. But it was small potatoes compared to today. In
1997, Pepsico announced it would devote a staggering $2 billion in
promotion to the prequels, including extensive TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a very shrewd move, Lucas negotiated to retain the rights to
``Star Wars'' merchandise. While there had been entertainment-tied
merchandise for decades _ from Mickey Mouse to Howdy Doody _ ``Star
Wars'' would create a new benchmark for the merchandising of
live-action films.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1977, there were no ``Star Wars'' toys on the shelves at
all. While millions of posters, T-shirts, books and comic books
flew out of stores that summer, the toy deal with Kenner (since
bought by Hasbro) wasn't finalized until April 1977. All fans could
get for Christmas that year was a certificate guaranteeing them an
action figure when they became available in early 1978.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Phantom Menace,'' there will be dozens of toys on the
shelves by the time the movie opens. Hasbro and Galoob Toys _ which
has since been bought by Hasbro _ gave Lucasfilm a combined $225
million in stock and guarantees of at least tens of millions more
for the rights to make ``Star Wars'' toys. Lego's ``Star Wars''
sets have been best sellers since March, and fans are so eager for
the new batch of action figures that pirated images of the toys
have been circulating on the Internet for weeks in advance of the
toys actually hitting stores.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Lucasfilm maintains it's trying to contain the huge
buildup to the release of ``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of studios would have been promoting this a year and a
half out,'' says Ward. ``They would have been doing things like
advertising on the Super Bowl. We purposely haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Forbes magazine estimated that Lucasfilm, if it
were publicly traded, would be valued at about $5 billion. It's too
bad for investors that the company is private _ but that's exactly
the way George Lucas wants it. He ultimately answers to no one but
moviegoers, which may be the biggest secret to his success. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: My cyber's lost in space
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ If everything had gone according to
plan, I'd be writing to you from somewhere deep in Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, here I am still stuck at home.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but it was a fine plan.
</P>
<P>
   The home office in Atlanta _ the only city in the world where
there are people who can fire me _ had deemed that I should be
newly equipped with a new computer. Never mind I have yet to fully
figure out the one I've been using for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new one would be quicker, faster, better. The idea, I think,
is that they hoped it would make me quicker, faster, better.
</P>
<P>
   They would overnight it to me (can you remember when
``overnight'' wasn't a verb?), I'd piddle with it for a few days
and then I'd bring it with me to Atlanta to be tutored as to its
nits and nuances. After which, I'd be free to go my own way.
</P>
<P>
   My way _ the way I planned it _ was to drive south in the
general direction of Savannah, where I have never been but have
read about in the book ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''
and long to while away long evenings thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for my wife to fly to Savannah from Texas, we would
spend a couple of nights _ maybe even staying up until midnight
just to see what would happen _ then she would fly back home and
I'd drive onward southward, seeing what there was to see and
writing what there was to write.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I planned to end up in Key West to look up whatever
evidence remains of Ernest Hemingway's years as a resident, this
being the 100th anniversary of his birth _ a good place to be and a
good reason to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, my Cousin Bubba was figuring to take off a few days
from the tire store and meet up with me somewhere along the way,
way down there in Florida, to relive one more time a motor trip we
made almost 40 years ago, talking big, eating heartily and drinking
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Never gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   I never got the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between there and here, somebody else got the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   That's what our company cyberman tells me the overnight express
company told him, that the computer was stolen along the way,
probably by one of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Say la vee, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to my trip, said I.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, eventually I'll get another computer. Eventually, I'll go to
Atlanta and have it prayed over. But the rest of the trip is
doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month my wife has a trip of her own. First week of
next month I'm scheduled for minor eye surgery. In June I'm
supposed to be in China. Regardless, Bubba can't just up and leave
the tire store whenever he wants, not with people wanting tires.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever stole the computer stole what would have been a nice
couple of weeks of my life.

 &HT;    INTERNET ACCESS BATTLE REACHES CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In a step toward tackling a battle over high-speed
Internet access, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) will ask regulators to
study whether the technology will benefit all U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee, said
Tuesday he would introduce legislation requiring regulators to
study patterns of high-speed Internet access nationwide. The action
came after a two-and-half-hour hearing that pitted cable companies
against Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The packed hearing focused on the battle between the industries
over whether cable operators should be required to open high-speed
data lines to companies such as America Online and Atlanta-based
MindSpring Enterprises in much the same way telephone companies
must carry traffic of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which has regulatory
power on the issue, has declined to get into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most critical issues that we face today,''
said McCain. ``And it is important to ensure that the enormous
benefits of advanced telecommunications services are accessible to
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, McCain wants the FCC and the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications Infrastructure
Administration to study whether broadband technology deployment
patterns could lead to ``telecom redlining,'' in which companies
avoid investing in low-income, rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Such action would make it nearly impossible for residents in
rural, low-income areas to ride the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and other committee membersalso solicited recommendations
from industry executives about how to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, recommendations ranged from cable operators'
call for a hands-off, market-based approach to Internet service
providers' suggestions for a ``light-touch'' regulatory scheme that
guarantees them access to high-speed cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   James O. Robbins, president and chief executive officer of
Atlanta-based Cox Communications, a publicly traded sister company
to Cox Newspapers, stressed that cable operators are entering a
highly competitive, new marketplace that requires billions of
dollars in investments.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications, for example, has spent $4 billion to date
building a high-speed data network. If Dulles, Va.-based America
Online or other Internet service providers want to use that
network, those deals should be negotiated between companies,
Robbins said. Government intervention ``would dry up investment''
and stall the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Case, America Online's chairman and chief executive
officer, argued that the cable industry maintains a monopoly grip
on high-speed data lines. Today, Internet service providers can
only connect consumers to the Internet by using telephone or cable
lines. Telephone companies are required to allow those providers to
connect to consumers. Cable operators don't have the same
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a country are confronted with a choice: Do we preserve
the open Internet marketplace...or do we move toward a closed
marketplace where success is determined by ownership of the wires
into the home?'' asked Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable is requiring consumers who want a high-speed cable
connection to the Internet to buy the Internet service affiliated
with the local cable company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses included Charles Brewer, chairman and chief
executive officer of MindSpring Enterprises, William L. Schrader,
chairman and chief executive officer of PSINet, Herndon, Va., and
Solomon Trujillo, president and chief executive officer of U.S.
West Communications, Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who supported Case's position, was encouraged by
McCain's plan to introduce legislation. ``There's been a call for
action,'' Brewer said, ``And I see that as positive.''

   BC-KOSOVO-MACEDONIA-NYT (moved on Saturday, Apr. 10)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Saturday, Apr. 10,
about reports from Kosovo refugees who said Serbian troops were
herding Albanians into a town near the Macedonian border referred
incompletely to the availability of confirmation from foreign
journalists in Kosovo. While many foreign journalists were expelled
soon after NATO began its bombing of Serbia on March 24, some
remain. Paul Watson, for example, has been filing dispatches for
The Los Angeles Times from Pristina, the Kosovo capital, but not on
that specific subject.

   BC-MICROSOFT-DIGITAL-MUSIC-NYT (moved on Sunday, Apr. 11)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Apr. 11,
about Microsoft's plan to deliver music files over the Internet
misstated the amount the company invested recently in Reciprocal
Inc., a maker of technology to protect digital copyrights. It was
$15 million, not $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   BC-OBIT-MAYER-NYT (moved on Friday, Apr. 9)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Helen Aberson Mayer, sent by the New York Times
News Service on Friday, Apr. 9, misstated the role of Harold Pearl
in creating the book. Pearl, a journalist who died in 1975, was the
co-author, not the illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   BC-SCI-INTERNET-PRESCRIPTIONS-NYT (moved on Monday, Apr. 5)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Apr. 5,
about the dispensing of drugs on the Internet misidentified the one
ordered on line from a Spanish pharmacy by Keith Lamb of Columbus,
Ohio, who suffers from back pain. It was codeine, not oxycodone.
</P>
<P>
   BC-SCI-CHOOSING-MATES-NYT (moved on Monday, Mar. 29)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Mar. 29,
about evolutionary psychology misstated the affiliation of Dr.
David Buss, a leading researcher in the field. He is at the
University of Texas at Austin, not the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The essay also referred incompletely to his research methods. To
study the mating preferences of human beings, Dr. Buss and his
colleagues distributed questionnaires to some 10,000 people,
ranging in age from 14 to 71, in 37 countries; analyzed personal
ads and marriage statistics, and performed field studies and lab
experiments. The subjects of the questionnaires were not all
college students, and questionnaires were not the sole method used.

 &HT;    INTERNET ACCESS BATTLE REACHES CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - In a step toward tackling a battle over high-speed
Internet access, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) will ask regulators to
study whether the technology will benefit all U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee, said
Tuesday he would introduce legislation requiring regulators to
study patterns of high-speed Internet access nationwide. The action
came after a two-and-half-hour hearing that pitted cable companies
against Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The packed hearing focused on the battle between the industries
over whether cable operators should be required to open high-speed
data lines to companies such as America Online and Atlanta-based
MindSpring Enterprises in much the same way telephone companies
must carry traffic of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which has regulatory
power on the issue, has declined to get into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most critical issues that we face today,''
said McCain. ``And it is important to ensure that the enormous
benefits of advanced telecommunications services are accessible to
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, McCain wants the FCC and the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications Infrastructure
Administration to study whether broadband technology deployment
patterns could lead to ``telecom redlining,'' in which companies
avoid investing in low-income, rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Such action would make it nearly impossible for residents in
rural, low-income areas to ride the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and other committee membersalso solicited recommendations
from industry executives about how to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, recommendations ranged from cable operators'
call for a hands-off, market-based approach to Internet service
providers' suggestions for a ``light-touch'' regulatory scheme that
guarantees them access to high-speed cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   James O. Robbins, president and chief executive officer of
Atlanta-based Cox Communications, a publicly traded sister company
to Cox Newspapers, stressed that cable operators are entering a
highly competitive, new marketplace that requires billions of
dollars in investments.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications, for example, has spent $4 billion to date
building a high-speed data network. If Dulles, Va.-based America
Online or other Internet service providers want to use that
network, those deals should be negotiated between companies,
Robbins said. Government intervention ``would dry up investment''
and stall the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Case, America Online's chairman and chief executive
officer, argued that the cable industry maintains a monopoly grip
on high-speed data lines. Today, Internet service providers can
only connect consumers to the Internet by using telephone or cable
lines. Telephone companies are required to allow those providers to
connect to consumers. Cable operators don't have the same
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a country are confronted with a choice: Do we preserve
the open Internet marketplace...or do we move toward a closed
marketplace where success is determined by ownership of the wires
into the home?'' asked Case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable is requiring consumers who want a high-speed cable
connection to the Internet to buy the Internet service affiliated
with the local cable company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses included Charles Brewer, chairman and chief
executive officer of MindSpring Enterprises, William L. Schrader,
chairman and chief executive officer of PSINet, Herndon, Va., and
Solomon Trujillo, president and chief executive officer of U.S.
West Communications, Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, who supported Case's position, was encouraged by
McCain's plan to introduce legislation. ``There's been a call for
action,'' Brewer said, ``And I see that as positive.''

A BALM FOR SPRING FEVER? MICRO GREENS ARE READY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Union Square Greenmarket shows all the symptoms
of serious spring. There's the fellow stripped to the waist
sunbathing, and there are the young women in pastel sleeveless
shirts eating ice cream as they stroll through on their lunch hour.
And especially, there are the riotous spring flowers: magnolias,
hyacinths, daffodils and tulips.
</P>
<P>
   So, why was there no asparagus in Union Square last Wednesday?
Where was the rhubarb? Why was the spinach still from the
greenhouse?
</P>
<P>
   At supermarkets now, asparagus is the hot seasonal item;
counters are heaped with strawberries, and rhubarb is placed right
next to them, along with ready-made pie shells. Most of us have
become so used to having whatever fruits and vegetables we want
whenever we want them that we have forgotten all about seasonality.
Those under 40 likely never knew it.
</P>
<P>
   The sobering reminder of the limitations of the Middle Atlantic
climate is the Greenmarket, still dominated this week by apples and
root vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are as anxious to rid your menus of root vegetables
as you are to shed your winter coat, if your palate is longing for
something tender instead of hearty, the market does have edible
signs of spring, even though they aren't quite authentic. The Hydro
Garden Farm stall sells mustard flowers, and everything at the
Windfall Farm stand has that tender young green look that comes
with the first leaves on the trees and the earliest blades of
grass.
</P>
<P>
   These sprightly collections of micro greens, the very first
leaves of plants, will certainly make you think of spring, even
though every leaf, with the exception of the chives and garlic
chives, was grown in a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing and matching these micro greens is a wonderful new way to
play with your food. Even though virtually no nutrition information
exists for them, they are vegetables-in-waiting, so likely provide
some of the same nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   I bought all that were available: corn, with an intense raw corn
flavor that finishes with sweetness; crunchy sunflower that tastes
like its seeds; slightly peppery mizuna; broccoli, with the taste
of raw broccoli or cauliflower; arugula with a surprisingly strong
peppery finish; pea shoots that taste like tender raw English peas,
and watercress, the most peppery of all.
</P>
<P>
   I also bought grassy chickweed _ the stuff you thought you
didn't want in your lawn, along with chives, garlic chives and the
mustard flowers, which are like very delicate mustard greens.
</P>
<P>
   I tried dozens of combinations of these micro greens, with and
without olive oil, with and without oil and balsamic vinegar.
Alone, the greens are not that exciting, but a good extra virgin
olive oil brings out the best in them. If you use vinegar at all
you need only a drop for a salad for two; otherwise the flavor of
the greens is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The following combinations for micro green salads were
particularly harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mizuna, broccoli and a very small amount of corn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arugula, sunflower and pea shoots.
</P>
<P>
   _ Broccoli, mustard flowers and chives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chickweed, pea shoots and garlic chives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mustard flowers and a very small amount of corn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mizuna, chickweed and corn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arugula, mizuna and pea shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Right next to the Windfall Farm stand I found another
nutritional windfall. Hawthorne Valley Farm, from the Hudson
Valley, makes wonderful cheese, yogurt and quark, a low-calorie,
low-fat version of cream cheese that is thicker than sour cream and
contains some of its tartness.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed with chives and garlic chives, it makes a delicious
alternative to cream cheese for bagels. Mix two tablespoons of
chopped chives with half a cup of quark, and you'll save 30-plus
calories and half the fat (3.5 grams instead of 7) for each
two-tablespoon serving.

CHOCOLATE TARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the third of eight columns by Claudia Fleming, the pastry
chef at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. Her collaborator on these
columns is Melissa Clark.) 
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every restaurant menu has to have at least one chocolate
dessert. I offer two: a classic ganache cake and, for those who
want a little more fun, a warm, gooey chocolate tart garnished with
a fudgy sorbet. At the end of a long meal, I think most people are
ready for something fun.
</P>
<P>
   The tart, really a potent little chocolate souffle, rests in a
crisp crust of chocolate shortbread. Served warm from the oven, the
tart has a soft and airy texture at the center, but a flavor that
is as deeply chocolate as a dessert can be. The sorbet is an icy
counterpoint, but it's no less intense.
</P>
<P>
   I modeled the sorbet on what I imagine the perfect Fudgsicle
should be: a scoop of frozen fudge. I simmer cocoa, water and sugar
together and reduce it into a thick chocolate syrup. Actually, I
reduce the syrup a little more than it should be; a longer cooking
time eliminates every trace of the grittiness and raw flavor that
uncooked cocoa powder has. It also gives the finished sorbet more
body and a silkier texture. To make up for my over-reduction, I
whisk some water into the viscous syrup (which will allow the
sorbet to freeze more easily). And I pump up the flavor a little
more by adding some chopped extra-bitter chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant I pair all this dark chocolate with a tiny,
frothy chocolate malted shake, served in a shot glass. But for the
home cook, a suitable garnish that is a little more grown-up, and
infinitely more practical, is a dollop of whipped creme fraiche.
Plain whipped cream would be the obvious choice, but creme fraiche
has a sharp flavor and a denser texture that cuts through all that
chocolate better.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: The sorbet and whipped creme fraiche can be made
in advance. And the tarts can be assembled six hours ahead, then
popped into the oven for a final bake. In fact, this is practically
a make-ahead dessert in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE TARTS Time: 1 hour 15 minutes, plus 2 hours' chilling
For the filling:
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   5 ounces chopped extra-bitter chocolate, like Valrhona
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   ~ cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour For the dough:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   \ cup unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   { cup ground almonds
</P>
<P>
   Whipped creme fraiche, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. To prepare the filling, put butter in a double boiler over
simmering water and scatter the chocolate pieces on top of butter.
Let mixture sit until butter and chocolate are melted. Remove
boiler top from heat, and stir contents until well combined.
Transfer mixture to a large bowl, and let cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, briefly beat eggs to break
them up. Add sugar, and beat 5 minutes at high speed, until very
pale and thick. Fold a third of egg mixture into chocolate mixture
to lighten it; then gently fold in the rest, taking care not to
deflate the eggs. Sift the flour over the batter and carefully fold
it in. Cover the filling, and chill 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, to prepare the dough, beat the butter and sugar in
an electric mixer until light and creamy. Add cocoa, and beat until
well combined. Add egg, and beat until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sift the all-purpose flour and almonds into the cocoa
mixture. Beat mixture on low speed until combined. Scrape the dough
onto a sheet of plastic wrap, and form into a disk. Cover, and
chill until firm, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. On a lightly floured surface,
roll the dough to a thickness of three-sixteenths inch. Using a
3{-inch round cutter, cut out 12 circles of dough, and press them
into individual 3-inch tart pans, trimming away any excess dough.
Chill tart shells 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. Line shells with 5-inch squares of foil, and fill with dried
beans or rice as weights. Place shells on a baking pan, and bake 12
to 14 minutes, until set. Remove foil and weights, and cool shells
on a rack.
</P>
<P>
   7. Divide filling among tart shells, and bake until filling is
puffed and slightly cracked on top, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove tarts
from pans, and serve immediately, garnished with the whipped creme
fraiche. Serve with chocolate sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 12 tarts.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing unusual about the egg yolk staring up at me
from a plate of pasta at Babbo one night last week. Except that the
egg was raw. Totally uncooked. Cold. This was a little
disconcerting at first, but, once mixed in with the buttery pasta
and bacony chunks of cured pork, the egg and the dish warmed up
into an irrisistible indulgence, with an aftertaste of danger.
Because raw eggs can kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Or so we have been told.
</P>
<P>
   They have certainly taken a beating over the last decade, ever
since scientists discovered that Salmonella enteritidis, the
food-borne bacteria, could be transmitted from the inside, as well
as the outside, of the eggshell.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Health Department went so far as to order
restaurants not to serve eggs soft-boiled or over easy. California
passed a law prohibiting restaurants from serving them raw or
undercooked. The authorities were cracking down, and home cooks
followed. They deprived themselves of fresh mayonnaise and
hollandaise, regarding them as practically toxic substances, and
forgot all about homemade chocolate mousse, ice cream and eggnog.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, you couldn't even get a proper caesar salad anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year or so, raw eggs have begun showing up on
menus all over the city. As diners have become more adventurous _
consuming seared tuna, the rarest of steaks and salmon tartare
without repercussions _ a little runny egg on the plate stopped
looking so perilous.
</P>
<P>
   And, for most people, it isn't: only 1 in 20,000 eggs is
contaminated with the salmonella bacteria, according to government
statistics. If you are unlucky enough to get that one egg, and you
are a healthy adult, you are risking symptoms much like a stomach
flu.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the menus, and diners' reactions to them, more
people seem willing to take the risk. At Bolivar, on the Upper East
Side, the a lobster stew called chupa contains a poached egg just
waiting to be broken into the hot broth. A touch of the spoon sends
the yolk running bright and liquid into the broth and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Brasserie Julien, also on the Upper East Side, serves its frisee
salad with lardons in the traditional French style, coated with the
liquid of an egg whose fragile flesh has been subjected to boiling
water no more than three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dale DeGroff, who was the bartender at the Rainbow Room and is
now at Blackbird in midtown, will be serving flips _ a 19th-century
pick-me-up mixing raw eggs with whisky, port or brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Blauberg, the chef at the ``21'' Club, reports a revival of
requests for caesar salad and steak tartare, a house specialty.
</P>
<P>
   And a spinach salad with shaved lamb's tongue at Po, Babbo's
sister restaurant in Greenwich Village, came with a lightly poached
egg in the center, before the spring menu put the salad and that
pasta on hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be back,'' said Andy Nusser, the chef at Babbo. Nusser
said he had encountered no squeamishness from customers confronted
with a cold, raw egg in their noodles. ``It's just so perfect,
people can't argue with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some people could, and certainly would have not so long
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Blauberg of ``21'' said: ``Everybody used to ask, `Is there raw
egg in that?' Especially in the caesar, so I did it without the
egg.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the egg is back in the caesar at ``21,'' tossed, as always,
tableside. For the tartare _ a ``twofer'' in terms of gastronomical
promiscuity _ the raw egg is mixed into the raw meat in the
kitchen, before the plate is carried into the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   In August, California, that stringently health-conscious state,
eased up a law enacted in January 1998 that had banned restaurants
from serving raw or undercooked eggs. Under the revised statute,
exceptions can be made if the customer has been informed by the
waiter or with a note on the menu, that a dish contains such an
egg.
</P>
<P>
   If we as diners didn't get safer, did the eggs?
</P>
<P>
   A new study published in the Centers for Disease Control's
Morbidity and Mortality Report shows that between 1996 and 1998,
there has been a 44 percent drop in reported cases of salmonella
poisoning. The last major outbreak was in 1994, when 400 people in
16 states were sickened by Schwann's ice cream, the mix for which
had been transported in tanker trucks that had previously contained
raw eggs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The big scare before that was set off when four residents of a
New Jersey nursing home died after drinking salmonella-infected
eggnog. That was in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a reduction in the number of food-borne illnesses
associated with egg-based consumption,'' said Steven Grover, the
director of technical services and public health at the National
Restaurant Association, and a former public health and safety
regulator for the Virginia State Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Grover said that ``eggs are quite a bit safer than they used to
be,'' thanks to refrigeration (people used to transport and leave
eggs lying around at room temperature) and more scrupulous
screening of the chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to eat them for 20 years to run into one bad egg,''
he said. And then, the symptoms for healthy adults are stomach
aches, maybe diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Small children, the elderly or people with compromised immune
systems are more susceptible, and Grover advises they avoid raw
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The American Egg Board in Park Ridge, Ill., follows Department
of Agriculture guidelines, a more conservative guideline, said
Elisa Maloberti, a spokesperson. ``We don't endorse the consumption
of raw eggs,'' she said. ``They are a perishable protein product,
and they can support bacteria growth.''
</P>
<P>
   That means cooking the eggs until they reach a temperature of at
least 140 degrees to kill any bacteria. At that temperature, the
whites are completely set, and the yolks have begun to thicken (the
center can still be runny).
</P>
<P>
   Many cookbooks, including the new ``Hay Day Country Market
Cookbook,'' by Kim Rizk (Workman, $13.95), take a similarly
cautious line. Suzanne Rafer, an editor at Ms. Rizk's publisher,
Workman, said most of her authors prepared caesar salads either
with hard-boiled eggs or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say if something is made with a raw egg, we always
state it,'' Ms. Rafer said, ``and if a reader is unsure of the
quality of the eggs they buy, they should probably stay away from
that particular recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   The gray, or rather yellow, area between raw and cooked is
something many eaters of eggs seem to ignore. ``I don't know that a
raw egg is any less safe than those sunny-side-up eggs that people
eat every morning,'' Ms. Rafer said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the risk is the same _ if the eggs don't reach 140
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But as for the chances of getting sick, Jill Snowdon, the
director of food-safety programs at the Egg Nutrition Center in
Washington, said, ``It depends on the quality of the egg and the
susceptability of the consumer.'' The odds, as in most of life's
actuarial gambles, favor healthy adults.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind _ along with Oscar Wilde's remark that ``an
egg is always an adventure'' _ I embarked on an egg binge.
Bolivar's chupa, washed down with a pisco saura, the frothy
Peruvian cocktail mixed with Chilean brandy and safely pasteurized
egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   Babbo's haute bacon-and-eggs. The caesar (italics)and(end
italics) the tartare at ``21.'' A raw quail egg on salmon egg sushi
at Next Door Nobu in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   After three days on the raw egg diet, eating everything but
Rocky Balboa's five-egg morning shake, I was unpoisoned, but logy
with a mean cholesterol hangover. I asked DeGroff, the ``master
mixologist,'' for his morning-after remedy of choice, the Prairie
Oyster. Half a teaspoon of Worscestershire sauce, a dash of
Tabasco, one teaspoon of vinager, salt and pepper _ and one raw
egg. Swallow in one gulp. &QL;

A QUICK, INEXPENSIVE VEAL BRISKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few slow-cooked foods are as rewarding as a well-cooked beef
brisket. But getting it tender, juicy and flavorful takes so long _
my favorite recipe is a 12-hour job _ that I'm lucky to do it once
a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I regret not discovering veal brisket sooner. It
occurred to me only recently that one can get a delicious,
relatively quick-cooking form of brisket from a breast of veal with
the bones removed.
</P>
<P>
   The breast is a common cut that can be almost ludicrously cheap
(as little as 89 cents a pound), but it is rarely sold boneless.
And with the bones in, it is difficult to handle: to serve four,
you'll need a piece of meat that is too large to fit in most pots
and that takes forever to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, any butcher, including virtually every supermarket
butcher, can quickly remove the bones and present you with a flat,
relatively compact cut that contains little fat and becomes tender
about twice as fast as the same cut of beef. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ask the butcher to start with a piece of breast that weighs four
to six pounds. Boneless, it weighs about half and will easily fit
in a large skillet. (Take the bones, too _ you're paying for them,
and they are among the best for making stock.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once the shopping is done, the battle is over. This recipe still
requires time, but almost no work or attention.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are no tricks or subtleties here. I use dried mushrooms
because of their convenience and intensity of flavor, but you can
substitute a half pound of fresh mushrooms. And a not-too-dry white
wine, like a riesling, adds a little complexity to the finished
dish. But the real flavor is in the meat.
</P>
<P>
   BRAISED VEAL BREAST WITH MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Time: about 90 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce dried mushrooms: shiitakes, porcinis or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 2- to 3-pound boneless veal breast
</P>
<P>
   { cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Reconstitute the mushrooms by covering them with very hot
water. Strain through a fine sieve to remove any grit. Strain the
liquid, and reserve.
</P>
<P>

IN PAINT-BY-NUMBERS GARDEN, CORN IS RED, CARROTS YELLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners are always searching for the latest vegetable
varieties to brighten the year's crop. Cooks constantly crave the
new ingredient that thrills the taste buds while catching the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners who are cooks, and vice versa, are discovering that
they can have the best of both worlds with superb-tasting
vegetables in startling colors: red sweet corn, yellow carrots,
purple asparagus, even black tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these vegetables are antique heirloom varieties, the
baseball cards of the gardening world, which were swapped among
devotees until the seed companies started developing them for
commercial distribution in recent years. Others are new hybrids,
developed specifically to bring the avant garde to ordinary seed
packets. Either way, they allow you to grow a visual delight not
available at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The splashiest of these novelties is no doubt Burpee's Ruby
Queen hybrid sweet corn. This fire-engine-red corn could easily be
confused with the purely ornamental Ruby Red, which is inedible to
the point of being able to break teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Queen, whose kernels are red inside and out, is wonderfully
tender and, thanks to the tinkering of botanists, is ``sugar
enhanced'': its sugars convert into starch more slowly than older
varieties, so the corn retains its sweetness longer after picking.
</P>
<P>
   Grown in rows like regular sweet corn, Ruby Queen requires no
tricks or special care to yield its colorful bounty. But you cannot
grow it within pollen's throw of some supersweet varieties of corn.
If you do, the kernels will be hard as flint: crossbreeding brings
out the part of its ancestry that was solely ornamental.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Ruby Queen retains its color when steamed or
placed in a microwave oven, but boiling will turn it yellow, with
no loss of flavor. Picked young, just after the ears have turned
from white to pinkish red and before any scarlet develops, the corn
is tender enough to eat raw. Mixed with green tomatoes, it makes a
striking, flavorsome chutney.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tomatoes, how about a nice, sweet, tasty black one?
The fascination with black flowers _ witness the endless search for
a true black orchid or a black rose _ is beyond me, but in the case
of the tomato called Black From Tula, the oddball color is
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd's Garden Seeds decided to bring back this heirloom
simply for its wonderfully sweet flavor. In truth, this tomato is
not quite up to its name, being rather more purplish brown, with
green on the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd's also has a bright-orange tomato that when sliced stem
to tip gives you perfect little heart shapes. Again, this heirloom,
Orange Strawberry, offers, in addition to lots of flavor, the
chance to turn a simple dish into an artful presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these appealing tomatoes can be started from seed
indoors. Planted now through the end of April and transplanted into
the garden come the end of May or the first week in June, when the
soil is warm, they will yield good summer crops.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fence is Burpee's purple asparagus,
which requires patience from a gardener, as a good bed will take
three to five years to yield. If you want a more instant purple for
your table, try Purple Queen, a dark purple stringbean, from
Johnny's Selected Seeds. Excellent sliced raw in salads, this bean,
like the purple asparagus, will revert to green when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Sweet Sunshine, an iridescent, stubby sweet yellow
carrot from Burpee; the glowing Swiss chard called Bright Yellow,
and the two-toned Zephyr squash, both from Johnny's. Although every
year I vow not to grow any more summer squash because there's no
one left in my state to take the overflow, I do think I'll plant
some Zephyr this year.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of what is otherwise a perfectly normal yellow squash
is, in this variety, bright green. It should look great stuffed
with a crab gratin. And anyhow, as a gardener and cook, I just
can't resist the novelty.

FBI PROBES SAN FRANCISCO CONTRACT FOR LIGHT-RAIL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The FBI is investigating the award of a $116
million contract for a light-rail system to move people around the
San Francisco International Airport, City Hall sources say.
</P>
<P>
   A focus of the probe, say people interviewed by the FBI, is how
minority subcontractors were hired for the job under a city
affirmative action program.
</P>
<P>
   It also is exploring a claim by a former city Human Rights
Commission secretary, Donna Rice Mason, that she was ordered by her
supervisor to alter agency documents to benefit one potential
subcontractor in the airport project.
</P>
<P>
   Comer Marshall, who resigned March 29 as the commission's
president, said the FBI had questioned him a day after his
resignation about the airport light-rail project.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the questioning had dealt with how city contracts
at the airport and elsewhere were awarded, and specifically the HRC
staff's work on the airport ``people-mover'' project landed by ABB
Daimler-Benz Transportation, called Adtranz, for $116.6 million in
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall sources said at least three other Human Rights
Commission and airport staffers had been quizzed by FBI agents
since December.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he welcomed the scrutiny of the city's main
affirmative action tool. ``I want a fair program, because if there
is shady stuff going on, it affects the program and other minority
participants,'' said Marshall, who resigned when Mayor Willie Brown
said he would be replaced as commission president in a routine
rotation of panel leaders.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman George Grotz declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Maravic Bamba, HRC executive director, issued a written
statement Monday saying she had not been contacted by any law
enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's affirmative action in contracting law, the
Human Rights Commission establishes which local, economically
disadvantaged, minority and female-owned businesses are eligible to
receive bid preferences and serve as subcontractors on major public
works projects. The city awards these large contracts in part on
the basis of whether bidders promise to use certified minority- and
female-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
   The process came under the spotlight in an epic political and
legal fight for the airport train contract by two multinational
corporations, Adtranz and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The
companies pitted high-powered lobbyist against high-powered
lobbyist, lawyer against lawyer and PR firm against PR firm.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Adtranz hired a private investigator to scrutinize
the qualifications of its competitor's proposed subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   After the city's Airport Commission selected low-bidder
Mitsubishi, Bamba blocked the award, saying Human Rights Commission
staffers had concluded that two of the local firms tapped by the
company weren't bona fide local minority-owned enterprises. And a
female-owned outfit wasn't qualified to perform the tasks
Mitsubishi assigned it, Bamba said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was put back out to bid, and Adtranz submitted the
lower offer: $116.6 million, compared with Mitsubishi's $128.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the matters that has caught the investigators' attention
is an allegation by former commission secretary Mason that she was
ordered to alter documents in the wake of the bidding for the
airport light-rail contract.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, who was fired Feb. 6, 1998, has filed a grievance
protesting her firing, seeking her job and back pay.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed with the city on March 31, 1998, Mason said
Zula Jones, a top-ranking HRC manager, ordered her to change the
date on a letter certifying the Jefferson Co. as eligible for the
airport project. The Jefferson Co., a San Francisco firm owned by
black businessman James D. Jefferson, was in line for a $10 million
share of the project as a proposed subcontractor to Adtranz.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the secretary said, she was ordered by Jones to go into
the office on Saturday, Sept. 27, 1997, to change the date of the
letter from the Jefferson Co. requesting its certification,
according to documents in the grievance case.
</P>
<P>
   The second demand, Mason says, was made because a newspaper
reporter was due in the office on Sept. 29, 1997, to examine
Jefferson's affirmative action file under the California Public
Records Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones was distraught,'' the grievance says. ``Jefferson's
letter requesting certification was later than the date of the
certification letter itself. So on Saturday, Sept. 27, 1997, in the
HRC offices, Donna was directed . . . by Ms. Jones to alter the
date of Jefferson's certification request letter. The electric
date-stamp machine in the HRC office was opened, and the date was
rolled back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, a past president of the San Francisco Black Business
Chamber of Commerce, was an early adviser to the HRC on creation of
the city's affirmative action contracting law. He said he hadn't
been contacted by the FBI and had no knowledge of Mason's
allegations against Jones involving his Human Rights Commission
certification.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN''  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Giuliani now is trying to get the New York City police
to be more courteous. For instance, from now on, police will have
to say, Please, would you get out of your car, Mr. Letterman?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, 911 operators are no longer allowed to say, How'd you
get this number?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to improve the image of the Police Department.
In fact, beginning next week, the cops will actually sing you your
Miranda Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Police Commissioner Howard Safir is getting in on this too.
He's already vowed that next year, he will take a needy inner-city
kid with him to the Academy Awards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned over some New York City traffic records, and
according to these records, more New York City pedestrians are
killed by garbage trucks than any other vehicle. However, New York
City taxi cabs still attract more flies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad news, sad news for Dennis Rodman and Carmen Electra
--they're getting a divorce. So that means now they'll be free to
pursue other idiotic publicity stunts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning more and more about the split. Apparently, now,
trouble began when she, Carmen, came home and found Dennis in bed
with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a very happy man. I just found out now that
John Gotti Jr. is going to prison, I will become the acting head of
the Gambino crime family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good news -- all last week, there was a coyote running loose
in Central Park...Thank God, he was apprehended, they caught him.
He's now in custody. Police used a tranquilizer dart to shoot down
the coyote. It's the same thing they had to do at the Academy
Awards with Roberto Benigni.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The coyote was subdued. The police went after him with some
tranquilizer darts and a net. It's the same technique worked out by
Kathie Lee on Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1999 baseball season has begun. Here's an update: Mark
McGwire has 34 home runs, Sammy Sosa has 31 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Mark McGwire hit his first home run of the season.
A guy caught it -- sold it for $3.2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the
New York Yankees, called Japanese pitcher Hideki Irabu a ``fat
toad.'' Later, George said that his comments were ill-timed --
which brings up an interesting point of etiquette: when exactly is
the correct time to call somebody a fat toad?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are trying to raise money. Here's the deal: they've
got that big Kennedy compound down there in Palm Beach, Fla. For
$100,000, you donate a hundred grand to the Democratic Party, you
can sleep in the Kennedy compound down there in Florida. But, as
always, if you want to sleep with a Kennedy, it's free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today down in Washington, they had the big Easter Egg Hunt.
It's on the East Lawn of the White House, and it's for all the
kids. Not only did they find all of the Easter eggs, they found
$300,000 Chinese cash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is a busy man. On Saturday during his radio
address, he said that no target is off limits. And I thought to
myself, well, that explains Paula Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Sunday was Daylight Savings Time...President
Clinton celebrated in his usual way --at precisely 2 AM Sunday
morning, he moved an intern's hand forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night down in Washington D.C.,, Chinese premier Zho
Rongji had dinner at the White House. And I thought this was nice
-- Clinton, in order to put him in a good mood, served those
fortune cookies containing nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zho Rongji, the Chinese premier, says that he's in Washington,
D.C., for three things. First of all, he wants to get to know
President Clinton a little bit better. Number two, he wants to
clear up misunderstandings between the United States and China. And
number three, he wants to get in on some of that hot intern
action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things in Yugoslavia continue to be very, very tense.
President Clinton, of course, receives the daily briefings on
what's going on in Yugoslavia -- things like, is there a storm
brewing? Is the coast clear? The same kind of briefings he gets
about Hillary.''

</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There is a dessert in Paris called the wonton kumquat
Nutella. It cannot be found in Escoffier, or anywhere else, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Served at a new Right Bank restaurant called Cafe Mosaic, the
kumquat surprise comes in a bamboo steamer that holds a very
undessert-like display of three soft wonton envelopes, each
containing a whole kumquat and a small puddle of molten Nutella,
the commercial chocolate and hazelnut spread. The thing is awful.
But in Paris, it may be the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of bistros, brasseries and three-star shrines, a
new type of restaurant seems to be taking hold: ultradesigned, up
to the minute and emphatically un-French in style and culinary
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The spaces tend to be large and, by French standards, quite
noisy. The waiters and waitresses, who are very young, ply their
trade with an almost American casualness. The food is strange.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion has come to France, and it feels funny. Influences from
Asia, America and _ heaven help us _ even England have been
creeping into one of the world's most rigidly codified cuisines.
Like steam opening a mussel, the cultural pressures of the new
global economy, and the internationalizing of taste, have forced
the inward-looking French to look outward on a peculiar new world.
</P>
<P>
   Classically minded chefs are trying to assimilate concepts like
Afro-Thai cuisine and to accept the idea that patrons care as much
about the setting as they do about the food on the plate. The
result is a new culinary moment in France, one that Gault-Millau
magazine is calling ``the new disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   All this and the euro, too _ it's a lot to swallow. But Paris
seems titillated by the strange new dances that its chefs are
trying out, and the theatrical spaces in which they perform them.
They have mobbed the new Lo Sushi, designed by Andree Putman, where
patrons pick up their sushi plate from a conveyer belt, and Man
Ray, a hip-to-the-hilt Pacific Rim restaurant whose owners include
Johnny Depp and Sean Penn.
</P>
<P>
   The new restaurant wave has attracted a group that Patrick
Derderian, the owner of Zebra Square and Bermuda Onion, recently
called ``the happy few'' _ about 5,000 young and restless diners
who move from address to address, their ranks swelled by well-to-do
young professionals who, like the scene makers, want more than food
from a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the era of the brasserie is over,'' said
Miguel Cancio, a restaurateur and the consultant behind Man Ray,
Barfly and Buddha Bar. ``People want more _ they want to be
transported somewhere else, and to be entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian, barely three weeks old, could stand as an archetype for
the new fussy French fusion restaurant. It is enormous, a 400-seat,
two-level affair that occupies nearly 2,000 square yards of prime
real estate on the swank Avenue George V.
</P>
<P>
   The decor is high-tech teahouse, with an emphasis on dark,
exotic woods that contrast sharply with the polished concrete floor
and a Zen garden of dazzling white sand and bleached rocks that
sends out vibrations conducive to spiritual peace. The sound system
broadcasts a third-world mix of weird animal noises, rain-forest
drips and tribal grunts and chants.
</P>
<P>
   The menu makes more stops than a German tour bus. The dim-sum
cart rolls by, followed by mixed plates of Japanese sushi,
Vietnamese spring rolls and a green salad with sesame dressing.
Dishes bear names like Ming beef, chicken Chitchat, Paradise Lost
salad, and the intriguingly named ``Delta Brochette Pff, Pff,''
which turns out to be chunks of chicken thigh on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   It's a menu to read as much as to eat. Each dish is a statement,
a little like the macaroni and cheese at Spoon, Alain Ducasse's new
restaurant with the cheeky American accent. The dish itself is not
as important as the fact that it's on the menu, like the fish and
chips at Alcazar, Terence Conran's shiny new Left Bank brasserie on
the Rue Mazarine.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar is nothing if not shrewd. Under the direction of
Guillaume Lutard, formerly the senior sous-chef at Taillevent, the
kitchen turns out a carefully calibrated mix of brasserie
standards, seafood platters, pan-Mediterranean fare and the
occasional English dish, like bread and butter pudding, or fish and
chips.
</P>
<P>
   It's world food for young diners who move easily from Los
Angeles to New York to Paris to London and who feel most
comfortable in casual, sleekly designed restaurants that buzz and
hum.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar's design is crisp and clean to the point of being
antiseptic. The large open kitchen, with its gleaming white tiles
and shiny stainless steel fixtures, is so pristine it could serve
as a hospital operating theater, which is, in fact, what it looks
like.
</P>
<P>
   On the blond-wood tables, the salt and pepper, arranged in neat
piles, come in a precision-tooled rectangular steel ashtray
(available for about $15 on the way out), and the American-style
selection of four rolls (plain sourdough, rye sourdough,
black-olive and walnut) is served in what seems to be an oval
Shaker box but on closer inspection turns out to be the lid to a
container of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Alcazar is cute that way. Every touch has been thought through
with one aim in mind: to make diners feel that they are the actors
in a first-class production, with all the right props in place.
</P>
<P>
   It's a set-design approach to dining that was perfected at
Buddha Bar. Some of the heat has cooled at this first of the
mega-restaurants, but when it opened in late 1996, it created a
sensation. It was the Parisian equivalent of Balthazar or Asia de
Cuba in Manhattan, a highly wrought stage set that allowed chic
young Parisians to put on a show for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The scene has since shifted, but the decor remains. Buddha Bar
is a fever dream of tropical elegance, its dense, opium-inspired
interior rich with exotic woods, betasseled chandeliers and lush
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs is a mile-long bar in the form of a dragon ship.
Downstairs, there's the unignorable Buddha, a serene mass of
beatitude seated on a square pedestal large enough to support a
Cadillac. Rising nearly 60 feet to the ceiling, he has the air of a
customer waiting patiently for a very big meal.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes, he will want more spice. The lurid sensibility
that went into the decor evaporated mysteriously at the kitchen
door. The menu, a pan-Asian and French smorgasbord, skips blithely
from Vietnamese spring rolls to Korean-style grilled steak to
miso-glazed turbot, an Asian package tour for the timid.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the desserts, the exotic mask drops entirely.
Except for a blancmange with coconut milk, the line-up is as French
as a cancan. There's nothing wrong with any of the food, exactly,
and the restaurant's excellent hot sauce, served on the side, works
wonders on just about everything except the blancmange, but on the
plate, Asia seems as remote as Buddha's smile.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, chefs have embraced the new ingredients
and spices of Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean with a
sometimes unseemly passion. They may not always love wisely, but
shyness has not been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, however, fusion resolutely refuses to fuse. When it
comes to visual style, and atmosphere, the French cannot be beat.
They seem to have no trouble with the theatrical elements of
dining, or the international design idiom that goes with flashy
fusion cuisine from Sydney to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There are not many New York restaurants, for example, to equal
the drop-dead elegant Telegraphe, recently redone in a blend of
Viennese Secession and Art Nouveau by the design team behind the
three-star Ambroisie.
</P>
<P>
   But the intercultural mingling that energizes American chefs
tends to stump the French, for reasons that are not that hard to
figure out. A cooking tradition as ancient and deeply ingrained as
France's presents every chef with a hundred reasons not to try
anything funny.
</P>
<P>
   America, by contrast, has always been a ``why not?'' culture,
and the national tendency toward experimentation has been
powerfully reinforced by an unending influx of new immigrant groups
and new cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   The example of Jean-Georges Vongerichten shows that a French
sensibility and Asian ingredients can produce spectacular results,
but his brethren here in the old country appear to be struggling a
bit with their spring rolls and their sesame vinaigrettes. They
either pussyfoot or, like a teetotaler who falls off the wagon,
they go wild and shoot up the town.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Mosaic, the Mad Max of Paris restaurants, falls into the
second category. Deceptively, the interior is cool and understated,
with dark wood blinds covering the windows facing the busy Avenue
George V, and a suave semicircular bar, decorated with a vase of
white orchids, off to one side of the room.
</P>
<P>
   All the more shocking, then, to witness the parade of oddities
streaming out of the kitchen. Anis-steamed crayfish whiz by in a
mason jar. The ``salade verte'' turns out to be a half-head of
iceberg lettuce, sitting on the plate like a stooge. Then come the
kumquat wontons a la Nutella, or even better, the ``orange a
l'orange,'' a glistening orb of citrus fruit, preciously situated
in a large gray bowl, that oozes an orange cream when pierced with
a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is thrilling, like the smoky roast pepper, with a
sauce of anchovies, chickpeas and soy, or the ruby-colored pigeon
breast mired in a gooey plum-peanut sauce and surrounded by
kumquats. All of it is cartoonish.
</P>
<P>
   At table after table, French diners, after a scandalized intake
of breath, were laughing as the plates arrived, and who could blame
them? In retrospect, the two mini-baguettes placed on the table at
the beginning of the meal seem like the last word in irony.
</P>
<P>
   Make it official. French cuisine has entered the postmodern
era. &QL;

WINE TALK: AMERICAN DINERS STICK TO AMERICAN WINE LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a survey 10 years ago, Wine &AMP; Spirits magazine discovered
that the wine most frequently ordered in well-known American
restaurants was chardonnay from Sonoma-Cutrer Vineyards in Sonoma
County, Calif. In the magazine's most recent survey, the winner,
once again, was Sonoma-Cutrer's chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that Sonoma-Cutrer is the best chardonnay
producer in the world? It certainly is a fine winery with legions
of fans, but what this survey really indicates is that among
American wine drinkers, loyalty to a certain vineyard _ the
magazine calls it brand loyalty _ is clearly important.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the top 10 wineries in the new survey, taken late last
year, have been among the top 10 in this annual poll since 1989:
Kendall-Jackson Vineyards, Jordan Vineyard and Winery, and Robert
Mondavi, in addition to Sonoma-Cutrer. Of the top 50 wineries this
year, 20 have been on every list.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine did not list specific wines that diners preferred,
but rather the wineries that produced them. This is because a
winery or shipper may have half a dozen or more wines on a given
restaurant's wine list. For example, Sonoma-Cutrer offers three
different chardonnays; some restaurants may carry just one, some
all three.
</P>
<P>
   It is also apparent from this year's survey, which polled 393
restaurants around the country that are listed in the Zagat
Survey's regional editions, that American diners resoundingly
prefer American wines, mostly from California.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 50 wineries, 43 were American. Not one of the top 10,
which include Beringer Vineyards, Ferrari-Carano, Cakebread
Cellars, Chalk Hill, Silver Oak Cellars and Clos du Bois, is in
another country. Two of the top 50 are in Washington state: Chateau
Ste. Michelle, which came in 23d, and Columbia Crest, 37th.
</P>
<P>
   Among the foreign wineries, Santa Margherita, a major producer
in northeast Italy best known for its pinot grigio, ranked the
highest, in 12th place; Veuve Clicquot, the Champagne house, is the
highest-ranking French name to appear, in 17th place. Attesting to
the outrageous prices being asked by the better-known Bordeaux
wines is the fact that not one Bordeaux name is on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Santa Margherita, two other Italian wineries appeared:
Antinori, in 18th place, and Ruffino, 39th. Three other French
wineries _ Louis Jadot, Louis Latour and Joseph Drouhin _ also made
the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   No Spanish wines, no German wines, no wines from South America
and none from Oregon or New York State made the list.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of intense efforts to woo them away, American wine
drinkers prefer California chardonnay, cabernet and, of course,
merlot. The two most preferred brands, Sonoma-Cutrer and
Kendall-Jackson, are known as chardonnay producers; the rest of the
top 10 are known mostly for cabernet, or for both cabernet and
chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   Price is not as much a factor in diners' choices as one might
assume: the average price paid for a bottle of a top 10 wine was
$46.90, with the average price of a Jordan wine at $61.57 and of a
Silver Oak wine at $86.70.
</P>
<P>
   The newest poll probably gives a more accurate indication of
restaurant wine sales than the first one, which drew only 100
responses. Josh Greene, publisher and editor of Wine &AMP; Spirits,
said the enlarged database showed that while many of the leaders
have remained in place over the years, restaurant patrons have
begun to experiment more. Some of the experimentation may be among
those diners who are unwilling to pay the current high prices for
top wines.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay may still be the most popular varietal, but its share
of the market has been dwindling steadily since the poll was begun.
Red wines now account for almost 55 percent of the most popular
wines sold in American restaurants. ``The current restaurant scene
is quite different from 1989, when chardonnay ruled,'' Greene said.
``Today, red wine is what's on order, in many cases _ or what's
sold out or wildly priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of merlot, the star red wine of the last decade, have
slowed, partly because of shortages, Greene said, while pinot noir,
something of a crossover wine for people who want red wine with
fish, has been moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   To me, the poll shows that restaurant wine buying is still
driven as much by snobbishness and insecurity as it is by common
sense. And it gives the lie to the wine country mantra that wine is
food, an integral part of any good meal. At $40 to $80 a bottle,
it's got little to do with eating well; it's mostly a statement
about money recently acquired.
</P>
<P>
   If it is true that the consumer is beginning to look for
alternatives to high-priced wines, restaurateurs should pay heed.
For example, I know for a fact that many restaurateurs have simply
stopped buying Bordeaux wine. ``With the prices I'd have to charge,
my customers would think I'm a crook,'' said John Foy, owner of
Sonoma Grill, in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But are customers complaining about prices? Apparently not
enough. Besides, to restaurant owners it's too tempting to take big
markups while the market for high-priced wines lasts. The fact is
that there are dozens, probably hundreds, of good wines available
at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Barolos retailing at $140 a bottle; there are
countless wines from other parts of Italy, including Sicily and
Sardinia, at astonishingly reasonable prices. There are still
plenty of little-known French wines worth trying and even a few,
but not many, American wines to be found at low prices.
</P>
<P>
   The article in Wine &AMP; Spirits said that many of the restaurant
owners who responded to the survey expressed their uneasiness over
the current inflated market and ``have been steering customers
toward the sort of wine they might enjoy if or when a correction
comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are, but it isn't yet apparent on many wine lists.
One can only hope that more restaurateurs will see things this way
and begin to search out some wine bargains _ and without murmuring
piously, as so many do, ``Ah, but then we'll just have to raise the
food prices.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like many immigrants to the United States, the little
crustaceans known as langoustines have been arriving here in
greater numbers because of bad times elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   These creatures, which look like sawed-off lobsters and taste a
little like lobster and a little like shrimp, have long been a
delicacy in European restaurants but have played second fiddle to
shrimp in the United States. Then along came Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   As it raged along the coasts of Central and South America last
October, the storm wiped out hundreds of shrimp farms that supplied
the North American market. Within months of the devastation,
particularly in Ecuador and Honduras, shrimp from Asia started
filling in the gap. But in the interim, chefs and adventurous home
cooks started asking fish suppliers for langoustines, and that
demand has not abated.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polcano, manager of the fish department at Balducci's in
Greenwich Village, points out that before the hurricane,
langoustines cost $12.99 a pound and were not a big mover. After
the hurricane, when demand jumped, the price rose to $15.99, ``and
I sell more and more every week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like anything unfamiliar that is pushed into the limelight,
langoustines have to battle some misconceptions as to what they
are. They are frequently confused with langoustes, or spiny
lobsters, the slender, tough-shelled cousins of the American
lobster. Langoustines are also often sold as prawns, though
biologically they are only distant cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them that are sold here come from waters off Iceland,
Norway, the Brittany coast of France and New Zealand, though they
are also caught in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean. Usually
about 7 inches long and about as wide as a fat thumb, langoustines
have narrow, elongated claws and shells as thick as hard-shelled
crabs. Their meat, which resides entirely in the 1- to 2-inch-long
tail, is delicate but rich.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike shrimp or lobster, langoustine meat begins to deteriorate
immediately after the creatures die, due to a bacteria underneath
the shells that breaks down the meat and turns it mushy, said Rod
Mitchell, the owner of Browne Trading Co., a seafood and caviar
importer in Portland, Maine. For this reason, whole langoustines
are usually available only by special order; their tails are most
frequently sold cooked and frozen. Happily, the blue and brown
crustaceans, whose shells turn ruby red when cooked, lose little
when frozen.
</P>
<P>
   But because their flesh is extremely fragile and perishable,
langoustines can take only a short blast of high heat in a skillet,
wok or on the grill. They can be treated like crayfish on the
bayou, boiled in a spicy broth, chilled and eaten right from their
shells. They can be sauteed with lots of garlic and tossed with
pasta and parsley, or marinated in olive oil and lemon and broiled
on kebobs.
</P>
<P>
   Brushed with butter or olive oil and quickly turned on a very
hot grill, langoustine tails remain moist and succulent, tasting
sweet, faintly briny and buttery. They make a great warm-weather
meal.
</P>
<P>
   But since langoustines arrived in the United States as a luxury
good, rather than as a huddled mass of cheap food, the crustaceans
are finding a home in more elaborate, highly nuanced dishes. Marc
Murphy, the chef of La Fourchette in Manhattan, balances the
richness of grilled langoustines by serving them with wilted
arugula and a sharp gazpacho sauce. In Boston, Lydia Shire, the
chef and owner of Biba, uses langoustines as a delicate base note
in mildly curried fritters that she serves with a sweet and sour
peach chutney. Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin in New York,
emphasizes the richness of the shellfish by using them in butter
and cream sauces for mild white fish.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, any misunderstanding of langoustines will be
short-lived. Their sweet, succulent, delicate flavor is sure to
make them as much a commodity in the American kitchen as they have
long been in Europe.

 &HT;    MEDICARE BILL WOULD COVER CANCER TRIALS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare ought to cover the routine cost of
clinical trials for cancer treatments, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came at a news conference following the
introduction of a bill to extend Medicare coverage to recognized
cancer clinical trials. President Clinton has offered a similar,
but less encompassing, proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that we will be successful this year,'' said
Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who sponsored the legislation with Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. The two introduced a similar bill during
the last Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller noted that Medicare covers routine patient costs _
hospital and doctor charges _ for cancer treatments that are not
part of clinical trials, but does not cover those same charges if
they are incurred as part of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That discourages people from wanting to be in trials,''
Rockefeller said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George J. Bosl, chairman of the department of medicine at
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the number of
young people participating in cancer clinical trials outnumbers the
number of elderly in those trials by three or four to one.
</P>
<P>
   About one out of five clinical trials results in some form of
change in treatment, Bosl said.

CONGRESS URGED TO SPEND MORE ON CUSTOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With trade in commerce and illegal drugs booming, a
Texas congressman urged a House budget panel Tuesday to hire more
Customs Service agents and pump more money into the agency's
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, told the House Ways and Means
trade subcommittee that the increase is necessary because of the
growing trade across the U.S.-Mexico border and crackdown on
narcotics smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customs is our first line of defense,'' Rodriguez said, whose
congressional district includes the border counties of Starr and
Zapata.
</P>
<P>
   He is calling for 2,000 additional Customs inspectors and agents
nationwide and $1.2 billion over seven years to upgrade the
computer and automation system that processes commercial traffic at
land ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Customs currently employs roughly 20,000 workers and agents at
301 ports of entry. The agency collects about $22 billion annually,
while processing 450 million people who enter the country,
according to the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative
arm.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed a budget of $1.9 billion for the
Customs Service next year, including $163 million for computers.
The Clinton budget proposes no new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Philip Crane, R-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means trade
subcommittee, applauded Customs agents for their diligence against
smugglers but warned against overzealous law enforcement that could
delay legitimate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customs faces enormous challenges, and every day Customs
officers rise to meet these challenges,'' Crane said. ``We believe
that Customs officers should be fairly compensated for their
duties, including overtime duties.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said a 200 percent increase in trade between the
United States and Mexico in recent years has strained resources and
entry ports in Texas, where long lines of traffic and delays have
become routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people living and working on the border see it, the U.S.
Customs Service is part of the underdeveloped infrastructure,''
Rodriguez said. ``Increasing the agency's budget should be natural
in the face of booming trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Salamone, chairman of the American Association of
Exporters and Importers, said U.S. businesses have concerns about
the Customs Service's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Salamone said Clinton's request for $163 million to upgrade the
computers used by the Customs Service ``inadequate.'' At that rate
of funding, the upgraded computer system would not be completed for
eight to 10 years, instead of the proposed four to seven years,
Salamone said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``I'm not leaving anything behind,'' the writer Tobias
Wolff declared. ``I'm just throwing everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big bonfire,'' agreed the novelist Francine Prose.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, scholars and fans gathered over the weekend for the
Hemingway Centennial Conference at the John F. Kennedy Library here
had varying opinions on the wisdom and taste of producing a work
like ``True at First Light,'' the posthumous Ernest Hemingway novel
about an African safari, edited by his son Patrick from a longer
manuscript. The book is to be published by Scribner this summer and
is expected to be the last of his leftover works.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over such posthumous, unrequested efforts _ and over the
possible impact of the book on how Hemingway is viewed _ rumbled
loudly at the conference. Stephen Plotkin, curator of the Hemingway
collection at the library, called the buzz about the book ``a
subtext for everything that happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a consensus among a handful of writers
interviewed on the topic, it was on the moral of the story: the
necessity of writing the authorial equivalent of a living will.
Either that, they said, or leaving nothing at all to be tampered
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson for all writers is, leave explicit instructions
about exactly what you want,'' said Rosina Lippi, a first-time
novelist who was honored at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel laureate Derek Walcott was asked what it would mean if
he were to leave an unpublished manuscript behind, and he
responded, ``It means that I should learn to start burning
everything I own.''
</P>
<P>
   There the consensus ended, however. Writers could all agree on
their dread of having their unfinished works pulled from bureau
drawers and published posthumously. But even after many had heard a
long excerpt from ``True at First Light'' at a group dinner on
Saturday night, they remained split over its merits and the
justification for publishing it.
</P>
<P>
   Some guests at the dinner called the work a barely edited first
draft and said its publication was in poor taste. Others reacted
with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it,'' said Jeffrey Marshall, a retired librarian who
helped underwrite an exhibit of manuscripts at the conference. ``It
sounded like the real Hemingway, the kind of dialogue the narrator
would have with his wife in `The Green Hills of Africa.'''
</P>
<P>
   Walcott said: ``Anybody great, we're all interested in the
relics. If you found an unfinished Gauguin, you'd still want to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Homero Aridjis, the president of International PEN,
cautioned that publishing posthumous works ``is something that can
be very dangerous because it can be against the spirit of the
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even centennials can be dangerous, he added. This conference,
for example, seemed to be intended as a kickoff for a year of
Hemingway celebrations, but it also included a fair amount of just
plain kicking. Of Hemingway, that is, as a racist, sexist,
anti-Semitic, anti-environment, ugly-American relic of the old
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I won't offend with heresy when I say that Hemingway
never had both feet down on Africa, never really was in Africa,''
Nadine Gordimer, the Nobel prize-winning author, said. ``For a
country is its people, Africa is its people,'' and Hemingway
``chose Africa as one of those panoramic three-dimensional
postcards where at first light animals seem to leap out of the
thorn bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Others mentioned the environmental incorrectness of Hemingway's
hunting habits and the misogyny inherent in his portrayal of women.
Such criticisms, popular for years and responsible for a certain
decline in Hemingway's popularity, resounded side by side with
unstinting praise for his style and the progress it represented for
American literature.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers and panelists at the conference also included Saul
Bellow, Peter Matthiessen and Kenzaburo Oe.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Gordimer was tough on Hemingway, she was even tougher on
those who are already trying to read the forthcoming novel for the
light it may cast on the facts of the author's life. She found that
``distasteful to say the least,'' she said, and considers that
whether Hemingway actually slept with a young African woman, as the
narrator does in the book, ``doesn't matter a damn in the
achievements of Ernest Hemingway.'' She added, ``It's an insult
indeed to his lifelong integrity to his art to regard his work in
this shabby, prurient way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On Ernest Hemingway's centennial,'' she concluded, ``too much
will be speculated about him, too much spoken about him, too much
written about him, including my own part in this. When we go home,
let us leave his life alone. It belongs to him, as he lived it. Let
us read his books''

KANSAS CITY AMBULANCE SERVICE RESPONSE TIMES DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PENN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Metropolitan Ambulance Services Trust
failed to meet its required response-time targets in five of six
Kansas City Council districts in February _ the first full month to
be examined since altered response-time records were discovered
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the MAST service provider will be fined for the late
responses. It has already been fined more than $1 million for late
responses over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The February numbers show significantly less success at on-time
performance than do the response times for January, which were
collected before the alterations were discovered and are now being
audited.
</P>
<P>
   MAST has a maximum ``target'' response time on life-threatening
emergencies of 8 minutes and 30 seconds. Every call that takes
longer results in a fine charged to Emergency Providers Inc., the
employee-owned service contractor for MAST. In addition, much
stiffer penalties are imposed whenever fewer than 90 percent of the
citywide response times fail to meet the target within a
three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   January records indicate that 90.2 percent of response times
citywide met contract targets. But in February, citywide on-time
performance dropped to 82.1 percent. The records are arranged by
city council district, and calls in five of the six districts
failed to meet the standard.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp drop in on-time performance is also demonstrated by
comparing February 1999 to February 1998. A year ago, the reported
citywide rate of on-time emergency calls in February was 93.3
percent, compared to this year's 82.1 percent. Four of the six
districts met or exceeded response-time targets in February 1998,
compared with only one in February of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response times are terrible,'' said Jack Campbell, the
physician who oversees the city's emergency medical system, which
includes MAST and the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm appalled at just how low they are,'' Campbell said. ``But
I'm not surprised since they were given inaccurate information
before that to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the manager of communications for Emergency Providers
Inc. resigned after admitting that he altered response times to
make them look more favorable to Emergency Providers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the fine for the January-February-March period has
not been calculated, but MAST Executive Director John Sharp said it
would be ``higher than average.''
</P>
<P>
   Fines have averaged $126,000 per three-month period for the last
two years, a total of more than $1 million, because of slow
response times.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1998 to December 1998, Emergency Providers Inc.
paid $520,157 in fines to MAST. From July 1996 to June 1997 _ when
the organizations used a different fiscal-year calendar _ Emergency
Providers Inc. paid $569,119.
</P>
<P>
   Louie Wright, president of Local 42 of the International
Association of Fire Fighters, said he wasn't surprised by the slow
response times or the level of fines imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Local 42 have been campaigning for the city Fire
Department to take over ambulance service, arguing they can deliver
the service more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's ever been an agency that cries out for a
performance audit, it's MAST,'' Wright said. ``I think MAST
warrants a serious investigation. Frankly, I think the situation
with MAST is much worse that anyone realizes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp said the drop in on-time performance can't be
immediately blamed on the altered records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, response times for February fell far short,'' Sharp
said. ``But response times will vary from month to month. We can't
assume that they're different because of the alterations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said officials will have to wait until the audit is
concluded before knowing for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we conduct the audit, the issue will be crystal clear,''
Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   A committee appointed by the city manager is expected to
consider the merits of a Fire Department-based emergency medical
system in a few weeks. And response times are expected to be an
issue in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Don Pickard, a spokesman for Emergency Providers Inc., said the
response times need lots of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never happy with response times. If we were at 91
percent, we'd want them to be at 92 percent. We do understand that
our primary concern is patient care. And we're going to do
everything we can to get ourselves in compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no excuse will suffice, Pickard said, Kansas City has a
much higher standard for ambulance service than many other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we fell short of the standard this time. We still believe
the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract between Emergency Providers Inc. and MAST requires
separate performance records for each of the six council districts;
the districts will be redrawn and reduced to four later this year.
Even when Emergency Providers Inc. meets the target for on-time
performance in a district, fines are imposed for every emergency
call that does not meet the response-time target. Emergency
Providers Inc. is hit with a $20 penalty for every minute an
ambulance is late in responding to a life-threatening call.
</P>
<P>
   For non-life-threatening calls, the fine is $15 a minute; the
standard for non-life-threatening calls is 9 minutes and 59
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp admitted that the response times for February are poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although EPI's response times in February would be considered
great in most cities, they fall short of what MAST expects,'' Sharp
said. ``Response times for March initially appear to be
significantly better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said he was confident that Emergency Providers Inc.'s
citywide response times in April would come close to meeting MAST
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further improvement in response times may still be needed in
certain areas. Patient care is our first priority. We won't be
satisfied until EPI's response times are fast and reliable in every
part of the metropolitan area that we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Emergency Providers Inc. is armed with the correct
data, it must work quickly to improve service, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought that airing the response-time issue before
the special committee begins its deliberation is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for the system that this issue was discovered,''
Campbell said. He said ambulance and personnel deployments based on
the flawed response times will have to be revised. ``The contractor
is going to start from scratch. We're essentially talking about
creating a whole coverage system.''

NEW SPRINT CAMPUS CLOUDS OFFICE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The only thing Sprint Corp. dominates more
than the local real estate market is Kansas City conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by that people don't ask me about the impact of
Sprint,'' said Don Thompson, managing director of Trammell Crow
Co.'s Kansas City, Mo., office. ``I don't think Sprint even
knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint occupies more than 10 percent of the leased office space
in the Kansas City market, according to figures compiled by Kansas
City real estate firm Colliers Turley Martin Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   That's a huge chunk of real estate. Microsoft doesn't even claim
10 percent of greater Seattle's office market.
</P>
<P>
   But as the company's 247-acre corporate campus in Overland Park,
Kan., prepares to open, people are asking the $700 million
question: What's going to happen to all that space the company
currently occupies?
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, tenants, investors, commuters and the just plain
curious want to know what will happen when Sprint moves.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint executives want to know that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have demands that ebb and flow,'' said Faye Manker,
Sprint's vice president of real estate. ``It is never a static
equation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's ever-changing demands are causing many people to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of another Midwestern city with the same situation,''
said Gregory Swetnam, principal and director of commercial
brokerage for Kessinger//Hunter &AMP; Co. ``You can't. Talk about
putting all your eggs in one basket.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Sprint has been laying baskets of golden eggs for
building owners by gobbling down every inch of space it could get.
</P>
<P>
   Current estimates show that Sprint leases at least 3.7 million
square feet in the Kansas City area. The entire market of leasable
office space in Kansas City is 34.6 million square feet, according
to Colliers.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Sprint will open the campus with 1 million square
feet of office space. The rest of the campus will open in phases.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's current estimates indicate that the company plans to
vacate 2.2 million square feet of office space around town, Manker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company likely will stay in about 500,000 square feet that
it leases and is still uncertain about its continued occupancy in
about 800,000 square feet of leased space. The company also owns
about 1.2 million square feet of office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's consistent with what we know today,'' Manker said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is keeping its options open on so much space because the
telecommunications industry is changing so fast and because the
company itself is growing so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The campus was designed to handle at least 14,500 workers, but
real estate sources said the company plans to have as many as
18,000 or 20,000 local employees within four years.
</P>
<P>
   In calculating space needs, Sprint is assigning about 230 square
feet a person, Manker said. That means the campus could handle
nearly 17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   That calculation and Sprint's projections for future growth,
Sprint's recent leases on additional office space and a deal with
the city of Overland Park to increase worker density on the site
are causing some real estate experts to conclude that Sprint has
outgrown the campus before it even opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously feel they need more space,'' said Ted Murray,
president of Grubb &AMP; Ellis//The Winbury Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the long-term leases as a good sign, said Brad Hakes,
regional vice president for Liberty Property Trust, which owns a
Sprint-occupied building.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint recently signed leases on a former Universal Underwriters
building in Kansas City, a former Mobil credit facility in Lenexa,
Kan., and a former Black &AMP; Veatch office also in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint recently told real estate brokers that it planned to keep
as many as four floors in One Kansas City Place in downtown.
Previously, brokers speculated that the company would keep just one
floor in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the fears are worse than the reality will turn
out to be,'' said R. Lee Harris, president of Cohen-Esrey Real
Estate Services Inc. ``Sprint has an appetite for space and most of
the space either won't come or stay on the market very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Some landowners said Sprint hasn't said what they plan to do
with the space they are leasing.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett Brady, senior vice president for Highwoods Properties
Inc., said Sprint hasn't notified his company about imminent plans
to vacate properties it leases from Highwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Such signals are encouraging some developers to proceed with
construction plans, even though some lenders are keeping a tight
grip on money for projects that don't have tenants signed before
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This uncertainty is not good for Kansas City,'' said Natalie
Wolfe, vice president of CB Richard Ellis Inc. ``None of this helps
secure long-term financing from lenders who want to know what's
going to happen in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe should know because she recently tested the appetite of
lenders with a plan to build a $13 million, 85,000-square-foot
office building near the Sprint campus.
</P>
<P>
   As construction of new speculative buildings proceeds and Sprint
pull-outs loom, most experts don't expect buildings to sit empty
for long.
</P>
<P>
   MC Real Estate Services estimates that vacancy in the entire
real estate market could rise from about 8 percent to about 12
percent to 14 percent, based on current construction and
employment-growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see it peaking in 2001 to 2002,'' said Ned O'Connor,
president of MC Real Estate. ``The gap will close, but it will take
about 24 months to close. We expect vacancy to be 5 to 8 percent in
2004.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty caused by the looming Sprint vacancies has other
effects on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Some large institutional investors aren't even looking at Kansas
City for investment properties. The city is already too small to
attract the huge real estate investment trusts, but the Sprint
vacancies are an extra warning signal.
</P>
<P>
   Investment purchases haven't completely disappeared. Des
Moines-based insurer Principal Financial Group bought a property
not occupied by Sprint in the last 18 months and Liberty Property
Trust of Malvern, Penn., took the plunge with a fully occupied
Sprint property.
</P>
<P>
   Rent wars are getting tougher. Tenants want to delay rent
negotiations until the Sprint vacancies hit the market and
landlords are demanding premiums for short-term leases.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, rental rates grew nearly three times
faster than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have taken the supply element out of the equation,''
Swetnam said.
</P>
<P>
   By renting so much space itself, Sprint forced other tenants to
consider pricier class-A space because lower-cost space wasn't a
choice, Swetnam said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said average rates increased as much as 15 percent in
the last three years, more than twice the historical rate. For
example, a building that rented for $16 a square foot now costs in
excess of $20 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Land prices shot up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Tomahawk Creek Parkway, land prices shot up from about
$4 a square foot to $10 a square foot in the last 18 months, said
D. Michael Posten, principal and vice president at Colliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bubble in demand created by Sprint has given people a
false sense of the value of their land,'' Posten said.
</P>
<P>
   Some market observers warn focusing on building-vacancy rates
and rent prices could distract people from other key questions for
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question isn't about rental rates or absorption rates,''
said Lawrence Glaze, president of Glaze Commercial Real Estate
Advisors. ``The question is can the demand for workers be
staffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Low unemployment rates suggest that there aren't many workers to
recruit for job openings. If a company can't hire workers, it can't
put people in the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder if the eat-or-be-eaten telecommunications industry
will change Sprint. Some think the campus could be a poison pill
that protects against a takeover, but others see the $700 million
campus as little more than a rounding error in a
multibillion-dollar merger equation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the phone industry, Sprint will be
withdrawing from as much as 2.2 million square feet and some
landlords are bracing for the Sprint exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never like to lose a tenant that you have,'' said Charles
Hunter, president of Kessinger//Hunter and trustee of EHMD
Properties LP Trust, which owns the most property leased by
Sprint.``But we all lose tenants when companies move or
consolidate. That's part of the risk. To put it bluntly, this goes
with the territory.''

TAX HEADACHES FROM KANSAS CITY GET U.S. SENATE HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Complaining about all those tax forms as April 15
nears?
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect much sympathy from people like Brian Gloe of Kansas
City, Mo., who told a U.S. Senate committee Monday that every year
his printing business has to file more than 180 IRS forms and
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a strong background in accounting and I don't even
try to do the taxes myself,'' said Gloe, co-chief executive officer
of Rosse Lithographing in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Gloe testified before the Senate Committee on Small Business at
the request of the chairman, Republican Kit Bond of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Bond wants to streamline tax regulations for small businesses,
which account for 40 percent of all taxes collected by the IRS.
Metropolitan Kansas City alone has more than 62,000 businesses with
250 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When small business owners say the tax filing and
record-keeping is too much, we ought to listen and start making
some changes,'' Bond said. ``How's a small-business owner supposed
to know which forms are necessary, much less how to complete them
accurately?''
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti testified at the hearing
Monday and agreed there is a large burden on small business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not focused on this enormously large and important
part of our economy before,'' Rossotti acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's staff surrounded Rossotti and other witnesses with large
charts and graphs illustrating more than 200 tax forms and 700
pages of instructions that confront small-business owners and the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong here,'' Bond said, holding up a stack of
forms as thick as a big-city phone book. ``We need to take most of
these forms and get rid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the senator dropped the stack in a round trash barrel
in the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Gloe could only hope that isn't what happened to some of the
forms his company has filed during the 10 years his family has
owned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you get everything filed correctly, it seems to get
lost here (in Washington) and you have to refile it,'' Gloe told
the committee. ``It would be nice if you only had to file once and
that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloe said his company's tax filings include 33 forms, schedules
and supporting schedules and 120 W-2 forms, even though he only has
62 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses have to file forms on credits, expenses,
depreciation, appreciation, debts, assets, interest, benefits and
many other matters. Often, they also have to file forms verifying
that they filed forms, Gloe said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloe said he has four full-time employees in accounting but has
to hire outside help to file tax forms. The company spends about
$72,000, or 16 percent of its net income, preparing for and
reporting taxes, Gloe said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of small business owners share Gloe's frustration, said
Matt Gunther, small business advocate for the Greater Kansas City
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just highly time-constraining,'' Gunther said, with
businesses commonly spending 5 to 10 percent of their revenue on
accounting and tax matters. The chamber has encouraged Bond to seek
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said he knows first-hand the tax preparation challenges
for small business because he started one himself in 1970 and his
father ran a printing business not unlike Gloe's.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said the IRS has to change misguided regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was to meet the needs of specific internal
groups inside the IRS,'' Rossotti said. ``They were not designed to
the point of view of a participating taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti said plans are under way to make filing and paying
easier, and that he liked Bond's idea of having a committee of
small business owners review proposed changes in forms and
regulations to help simplify them.
</P>
<P>
   He said the IRS is establishing a system of educating and
helping small businesses and self-employed taxpayers. A special
``taxpayer advocate'' for those persons will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new approach,'' Rossotti stated, ``will provide small
businesses and the self-employed taxpayers with a clearer voice and
a helping hand within the IRS.''

NEXT CONFLICT FOR BOARD OF EDUCATION: EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS _ The honeymoon could be over for the Kansas Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, disagreement over math curriculum standards resulted
in a 5-5 vote and deepened a moderate-conservative rift on the
board.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the board, with five new members but the same
moderate-conservative split, announced an effort to avoid such
deadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   But new science standards that the board will receive Tuesday
could disturb the peace, pitting board members' beliefs against
what they want Kansas students to learn, and putting the state in
the middle of a national debate over what constitutes science.
</P>
<P>
   The problem can be summed up in one word: Evolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the new science curriculum standards, evolution is presented
as one of five unifying concepts that cut across the scientific
disciplines. The standards are important because they will spell
out what students in Kansas public schools learn and are tested on.
</P>
<P>
   Some Kansans have urged the board to reject the standards
because evolution goes against their beliefs that God alone created
Earth and its creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Celtie Johnson of Prairie Village, Kan., says evolution is the
belief of a religion called humanism that seeks to glorify man. The
fact that it is taught in public schools shows how pervasive the
religion is, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice if we got to a point where both theories could be
equally investigated, and let the chips fall where they may,'' said
Johnson, who spoke to the state board in March.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists and teachers have asked the board to focus on
the overwhelming consensus among scientists that biology, and other
aspects of science, cannot be understood without first
understanding evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as an attack on science in general, not just on
biology. And that sort of worries me,'' said Adrian Melott, a
University of Kansas physics professor who also spoke to the board
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The board may discuss the standards during its meeting Tuesday
in Garden City, Kan., but members won't vote on them until May at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members have said they won't vote for the revised
science standards, which would require that students understand
evolution regardless of their religious beliefs. Others think
compromise could come quickly if the board agrees to leave
evolution out of the standards and allow school districts to settle
the debate as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   But cutting and pasting science to keep everyone happy creates
its own set of problems, said Steve Case, director of the Kansas
Collaborative Research Network at KU and a member of the committee
that wrote the science standards. ``It's pointless to have
standards because it wouldn't reflect science,'' he said.
More than 70 years after Tennessee science teacher John Scopes was
convicted of violating the state's law against teaching evolution,
the debate over the theory continues across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The science community says evolution is the common thread
running through the life sciences. The National Academy of Sciences
said last year that evolution must be taught in public schools if
children are to understand biology.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last five years, the National Center for Science
Education in Berkeley, Calif., has logged scores of complaints from
parents and educators worried about attacks on evolution education.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Melvindale-Northern Allen Park School
Board in suburban Detroit decided to supply some of its libraries
with books that raise questions about the validity of evolutionary
theory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Alabama Board of Education approved a plan to place
disclaimer labels inside science textbooks. The labels explain that
evolution is a theory and that text statements about the origins of
life should be considered as such.
</P>
<P>
   A Christian publisher's textbook called Of Pandas and People has
grown in popularity. The book, and others like it, subscribe to the
theory that the world and its living creatures came about by
``intelligent design.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. courts have repeatedly struck down state laws requiring
that the theory of evolution and stories of how God created the
universe be presented on an equal footing in science classes.
</P>
<P>
   Science is a constantly changing body of information, and
theories are frameworks for more research, Case said. Scientists
can't know exactly what happened in the past, but they can look at
what's going on now and extrapolate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want absolute answers, and science doesn't provide
them,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Willis, president of the Creation Science Association of
Mid-America, spends his time away from his Cass County blueberry
farm speaking out against evolution. He and a group called the
National Committee for Excellence in Science Education are trying
to help the Kansas board rewrite its science standards to exclude
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Willis said evolution can't be repeated or tested as other
scientific theories are. Evolution is based on the supposition of
what happened many years ago, so it's not provable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that history is only available to us in detail if
you have a reliable witness,'' Willis said. ``If you believe a
reliable witness, then there's no evolution. The testimony in the
Bible goes against it.''
State board members received a draft of the standards in January.
Later that month, public hearings were held across the state. In
some locales, such as Salina, Kan., the hearings were packed with
evolution opponents. Turnout was lower in other places.
</P>
<P>
   Board members Scott Hill of Abilene and John Bacon of Olathe,
Kan., both conservatives, said they can't agree to the standards as
they're written. Hill said the standards focus too much attention
on evolution. Bacon wants to include other theories of how life
began, and moderate member Sonny Rundell of Syracuse has said he
would consider that.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative board member Steve Abrams of Arkansas City, Kan.,
believes evolution should be included in the standards but not in
the way it's presented in the revised standards.
</P>
<P>
   The strong feelings over evolution have surprised Janet Waugh, a
moderate board member elected in November from Kansas City, Kan.
She said she thought the court cases striking creationism from
public schools and supporting evolution had settled the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Val De Fever, a former teacher and moderate board member from
Independence, Kan., said she believes evolution is valid because it
is based on a theory that is observable.
</P>
<P>
   But as she considers the views of her more conservative
colleagues, she believes a compromise might prevent the standards
from becoming hostage to a political battle with religious
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Douglass Brown, a conservative from Wichita, Kan., said she
could go for a compromise, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I sure don't want it to come down to a donnybrook over
it,'' she said.

track on the jail's roof, the government says, for fear that he
will be killed by a sniper so he can never reveal information about
terrorist groups around the world. Life for El Hage _ a father of
seven who lived with his family near the University of Texas at
Arlington campus _ has changed dramatically since he was accused of

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A high wind warning for gusts as high as 70 mph was issued
Tuesday for Guadalupe Pass in west Texas as a potent low pressure
system approached from New Mexico. Wednesday, the low will arrive
over the western Gulf States, setting the stage for volleys of
volatile weather.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will develop early Wednesday across
parts of eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana as
humid air streaming northward from the Gulf of Mexico is lifted
along and ahead of a cold front associated with the potent low.
Then, later in the day, a second round of showers and thunderstorms
will erupt as a potent jet stream disturbance trailing the cold
front renews the lifting of humid Gulf air with vigor. Some of
these storms will approach severe levels, with large hail, damaging
straight-line winds and tornadoes possible in a few storms.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the low, chilly air will invade northwest Texas
on strong winds from the north. Farther west, the cool spell along
the southern California Coast will end today as a warm ridge of
high pressure arrives aloft from the Pacific and developing
offshore breezes push low clouds and cool maritime air out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds circulating around a low pressure system stalled over the
Canadian Maritimes will cover parts of northern New England as far
south as Boston. A few snow showers and flurries will dust the
mountains of northern New England. Winds from the northwest will
average 15 to 25 mph with higher gusts along much of the Northeast
Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wet Caboose
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the rainiest April day on record at the Los Angeles
airport as 1.35 inches of rain were measured. The city's previous
wettest April day was April 27, 1960, when 1.26 inches of rain
fell. The disturbance that produced the deluge was the caboose in a
train of Pacific disturbances the past two weeks that caused
mountain snows, coastal rains, thunder and high desert winds over
the Western States. The potent disturbances then moved east and
spawned a few severe thunderstorms over the Middle West. Wednesday,
the caboose will raise the risk of severe storms across the western
Gulf States.

`ANOTHER WORLD' LEAVES ORBIT  
 ENEMIES TRY TO EXPLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When NBC decided to cancel its soap opera ``Another World'' this
week, some heavy considerations came into play.
</P>
<P>
   Only one NBC entertainment show had been on the air longer than
the 35-year run of ``Another World.'' That's the ``Tonight'' show.
All told, only two other NBC shows are older: ``Today'' and ``Meet
the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not as if the show was holding onto its longtime fans. In
most cases any time a network interferes with a soap opera, even on
days when war breaks out or a president is impeached, soap fans
react with a venom now seldom seen in a world of 100-plus channels.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, as news of the cancellation of ``Another World''
reached its remaining fans, the outcry was more like an
out-whimper. NBC said its offices in Burbank, Calif., received
fewer than 50 calls about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of interest has been reflected in the ratings, which
have been among the lowest for network soaps. This season ``Another
World'' lost almost a quarter of the young women viewers that soaps
use as their selling base to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   It ranked 10th among the 11 network soaps among women aged 18 to
49.``Sunset Beach,'' also on NBC, was 11th.
</P>
<P>
   That did not make the cancellation any easier for the cast.
Linda Dano, who has played Felicia Gallant for 17 years, said
Tuesday: ``It's painful. I also think it's tragic for the soap
industry when a show goes off after 35 years. That's not a good day
for network television.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, given the recent ratings, the news was hardly a
shock. ``I knew when I signed my contract for this year that it
might be the last,'' Ms. Dano said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem has been that many of the show's stations
around the country have been moving ``Another World'' around their
schedules, even postponing it for days at a stretch to create time
for local programming. That made it next to impossible for NBC to
promote its prime-time shows during ``Another World.''
</P>
<P>
   So NBC used the cancellation as part of a strategy to remake its
daytime schedule. NBC ceded a two-hour block from 5 to 7 a.m., to
its affiliates as a way to get them to agree to broadcast its new
soap ``Passions'' at 2 p.m. daily, after NBC's one hit soap, ``Days
of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC executives expressed regret at having to drop
``Another World.'' As one put it, ``I remember my grandmother
watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carter &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enemies Try to Explain
</P>
<P>
   At a time when India and Pakistan are worrying the world's
diplomats with contradictory signals _ one moment scheduling
tit-for-tat nuclear tests, the next having their prime ministers
embrace at the border _ an unheralded public television program in
New York managed to bring the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors in
the United States together last week to be interviewed. It is
believed to be the first time officials of the two countries have
appeared on one program.
</P>
<P>
   The program, ``Asian America,'' is seen on WNYE, the New York
City Board of Education's public television station and syndicated
nationally by PBS. It appears on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Although they arrived at the same time and even shook hands, the
two ambassadors, Naresh Chandra of India and Riaz H. Khokhar of
Pakistan, refused to be interviewed together. Each spent 15 minutes
being questioned by William J. Holstein, a senior writer for U.S.
News &AMP; World Report and a veteran reporter on Asian affairs who
also serves as a guest host for ``Asian America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The depth of their antagonism is so great, they can barely
speak to each other,'' Holstein said. ``Although the prime
ministers have exchanged visits now, there are five decades of
hostility at work here and three wars fought in the last 51 years.
This is one of the world's most dangerous conflicts, and very few
Americans understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is how he persuaded the two ambassadors to appear on the
program, Holstein said.

   ``They both want the U.S. to understand they are capable of
rational discourse and aren't nuclear hot-heads ready to shoot off
missiles,'' he said, although India did test fire a missile just
last Sunday, angering Pakistan. ``The one thing they both agreed to
was the need for Americans to develop a deeper understanding of the
subcontinent.''
</P>
<P>
   Holstein said ``Asian America'' contributed to that
understanding, being the only American television program on Asian
issues that is broadcast in English. It is produced by two
Korean-American sisters, Jung Sook Koh and Hwi-sook Taylor, who
started it five years ago and still work unpaid, raising money for
the program from grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to do something on a shoestring budget that is
very valuable,'' Holstein said. ``That's why I got involved.''

<P>
   PARIS _ For generations, bistros have been the culinary soul of
Paris, casual neighborhood restaurants where regulars drop in for
local gossip and a reassuringly familiar meal. Almost as important
as the food is the setting _ usually small, intimate and aglow with
stained or painted wood, etched glass and mirrors, bric-a-brac,
prints and posters, all against the rippling hum of voices and the
tinkle of glass and silver that signify contentment.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the French embrace culinary exotica, the appeal of the
classic bistro, for a taste of Paris past, is undiminished. Lately,
in fact, there is a boom in bistros, new and old, that serve
traditionally lusty cuisine at prices starting at $20 for a
complete meal for one, wine included.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is so popular that some new-old bistros now require
reservations as long as three weeks ahead, which really compromises
the spontaneous bistro spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Such bistros produce dishes in varying degrees of excellence,
from the meticulously superb to the comfortably homey. Bistros are
so popular that many new ones, like La Regalade and Le Villaret,
have opened in the last seven or eight years. Like their
100-year-old forerunners, they offer thoroughly French fare, albeit
with a few lightened, stylish variations.
</P>
<P>
   As much as I value culinary creativity, given only three or four
days in Paris, I play it safe and opt for the old. On just such a
schedule last November, I searched out the traditional, earthy,
bistro flavors and aromas that have defined French cooking for me
since my first visit, in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   My quintessential bistro is the Restaurant des Beaux-Arts in
Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Admittedly, nostalgia is always the plat du
jour, since I had my first Paris meal in this snugly cozy place
with some impecunious painters who were almost nightly patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, this bistro caters to art
students and neighborhood antiquarian book dealers and up until the
1960s used to save regulars the 25-cent charge for napkins by
storing each for a week in a chest of 56 small drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Only drawer No. 4 remains active, accommodating a 40-year client
who hates the modern paper napkins and dines there every Sunday on
that bistro classic, boeuf bourguignon. The present owner, Laurent
Bargeau, who took over from his father, says that the restaurant is
about 100 years old and that Oscar Wilde as well as Picasso were
among the regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing well for the price is the trick here, where a
two-course prix-fixe is about $10 for lunch (figuring 5.8 francs to
the dollar) and where a thoroughly satisfying three-course dinner
with wine runs about $22. The appetizers are classic _ escargots;
nicely burnished onion soup; jambon persille, the fork-size chunks
of ham set in its green-gold aspic, and a salad of slim haricots
verts with bacon topped with a poached egg and tomatoes (though
sometimes unripe).
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite main courses is the nurturing pot-au-feu, a
restorative dark brew of broth-softened leeks, carrots, turnips,
potatoes, spoon-tender beef and a marrow bone served with coarse
salt. That, or the boeuf bourguignon or the entrecote topped with
marrow, along with frites (not always as crisp as they might be) is
a great buy anywhere at $15.
</P>
<P>
   With these prices, one does not dally, either in the snug
ground-floor room with its green walls and mirrors on which daily
specials are painted, or in the more private low-ceilinged
upstairs. But I have never felt unduly rushed, and the memories,
charm and soul-warming fare, plus the house wine, Touraine rouge
(about $3.50 for a two-glass carafe), inevitably lure me back.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, regulars at Chez Catherine _ business clientele at
lunch, local residents for dinner _ are as thoroughly bourgeois as
the neighborhood. This is a set-piece of a local bistro, hidden
away on a quiet street near the Galeries Lafayette department store
on Boulevard Haussmann.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Guerraz took over the former Le Poitou and now offers
engaging starters like ravioli with cepes in a smoky cream sauce
that owes more to France than to Italy. Even better was the gateau
des foies de volaille, a hot mousse of chicken livers that is a
classic of French cooking. Silky, bean-size chicken kidneys and
crunches of cockscombs enliven a light tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Braised squab with tiny, oniony green peas is a quintessential
bistro dish, rendered soft and mellow in a way that might seem
overcooked to nouvelle palates but that develops the richest, most
sensual flavors. Slightly chewy steak aux poivre has its proper
mantle of black peppercorns, cream and a hint of Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Other benchmark dishes are cassoulet and confit of duck.
Satisfying desserts include tarte Tatin, the apples and crust
nicely firm although insufficiently caramelized, and a creme brulee
accented by pistachios and pears. There is a long, tantalizing wine
list with very decent buys like a 1995 Gigondas, Domaine des
Espiers, for about $24. My three-course meal came to about $33.
</P>
<P>
   The most convincing new-old bistro is La Regalade (a bit out of
the way, near the Porte d'Orleans) even though this is hardly a
neighborhood hangout, what with reservations made weeks in advance
by habitues from all quarters of Paris, the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Owned by the chef, Yves Camdeborde, and his wife, Claudine, who
efficiently runs the convivially noisy dining room, this handsomely
rustic place opened in 1992 but looks as though it has been there
forever. Seating is elbow to elbow, as might be expected where a
truly excellent three-course meal is offered for about $32.
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as the other appetizers are, I can never resist the
incomparable cochonnaille, the huge basket of homemade sausages
well cured to taste antique along with a terrine or two of
delightfully unctuous pates, complete with cutting board and knife
for all-you-can-eat self-service.
</P>
<P>
   I always hope they'll take the basket away while I still have
room for the hearty main courses like beef braised with carrots and
red wine or the lightly salt-cured pigeon with lentils. From fall
to winter, I go for the properly crusted cassoulet or the dark and
spicy blood sausage, boudin, nested on buttery mashed potatoes, or
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts like the individual Grand Marnier souffle and the
vanilla pot-de-creme are much better than the bland rice pudding
and the omelette norvegienne (French for baked Alaska). The modest
wine list is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Another bistro of the 1992 vintage is Le Villaret, a crowded and
young-spirited spot that feels genuine despite its atypical,
half-timbered brick walls.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrations at finding it in the hectic whirl around the Place
de la Republique disappeared as we tucked into a meal of old
flavors in new guises, for about $32 a person, without wine.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers like consomme of hare with wild mushrooms, or
fricasse of asparagus and artichokes in a peppery sauce fleshed out
with a flaky phyllo packet of boned calves' feet can be followed by
andouillette sausage of boneless pigs' feet with cepes, braised
lamb's tongue fragrant with sherry, and game in season. Pain perdu
(French toast) with warm clementines made a lovely dessert, as did
the vanilla pot-de-creme with madeleines.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Oliver Gaslain and Joel Homel, are so proud of their
limited but well-chosen wine list that they serve no water. But it
is available, self-service, from a tap near the bar. Schtick,
French style.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: OLD MOVIES EVERYWHERE, BUT NOT A ONE TO WATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along with other customers or prisoners of Cablevision who
reside in lower Westchester County, N.Y., and have a taste for old
movies, I am a member of a deprived class. For amid the dozens of
channels that cater to viewers who want to hear about the weather
or meet cheery chefs or keep up to the minute on lacrosse or buy
something they didn't know they needed from earnest hucksters,
there is a gap that strikes at the heart of movie fans: you will
not find Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there is no shortage of old movies, notably on American
Movie Classics (AMC), where you can catch the occasional golden
oldie, like ``A Foreign Affair'' and presentable perennials like
``Gypsy'' and ``Indiscreet'' and then catch them again and again
and again. But the offerings there or on the hit-and-miss Movie
Channel only make one thirst for what is regularly available to
Manhattan residents on Time-Warner's cable system.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday TMC, not to be confused with TCM, will offer its
premium, pay-extra subscribers a shot at such forgettables as
``Under Fire,'' ``Black Scorpion'' and ``Dead Tides.'' On the down
market TBS, Tuesday night's double feature consisted of ``Die Hard
2: Die Harder'' and ``Delta Force II: The Colombian Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   This Saturday evening in prime time, for example, AMC occupies
itself with ``Three Coins in the Fountain, ``The Prince and the
Showgirl'' and ``Teen-Age Caveman,'' by no means its limpest or
most familiar lineup, but not a bubbling fount of excitement; TNT
resorts to ``Rocky IV'' and ``The Road Warrior''; TMC catches up
with ``Jerry Maguire,'' which has been making the cable rounds for
quite a while, and TBS dredges up something called ``Mortal
Kombat.'' Meanwhile, Turner Classic Movies will run ``The Time
Machine'' (1960) and ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1945). It's
not that these are, strictly speaking, classics, but they are
high-quality efforts that haven't long since worn out their
welcome. And if you're really into what must be called classics,
you can revel after midnight in ``Dr. Jekyll and Hyde'' (1932),
``Treasure Island'' (1934) and ``Tarzan, the Ape Man'' (1932).
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of nights when Turner Classics succumbs to
programming desperation (a double bill Tuesday starred Dennis
Morgan), but sprinkled in are some real oldies that have at least
curiosity value and may stir memories in viewers of a certain age,
like Monday's lineup of ``The Nuisance'' with Lee Tracy (1933),
``Solitaire Man'' with Herbert Marhall and Mary Boland (1933) and
``Arsene Lupin'' with John Barrymore (1932).
</P>
<P>
   All right, I know that ``The Fighting 69th'' is not one of the
great Warner Brothers efforts, but I would settle for watching
James Cagney and Pat O'Brien do the fighting this Friday, only I
won't find it on my screen. And what more could a fan ask of a
Sunday night that consisted of ``Ninotchka,'' ``The Whole Town's
Talking'' and ``The Informer,'' while on AMC, I was stuck with
``The Green Berets''?
</P>
<P>
   Generations that have been watching television since they were
in cribs are unlikely to share the warm feelings of those of us who
grew up with Cagney, O'Brien and the gang, which may be why
Cablevision has decided it is not worth the investment to find a
place for Turner Classic Movies on its schedule. There's doubtless
more profit in running ``Antz'' as a pay-per-view treat for the
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Cable customers don't have a lot of say in what is imposed on
them, but at the least the nostalgia-driven among us and those of a
younger set who have somehow succumbed to the charms of the old
movies can let their local monopoly know that they feel deprived.
There must be a movie buff of a lawyer around in search of a
class-action suit.

 &HT;    Magician Blaine leaves the public speechless
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a busy New York sidewalk at dusk, magician David Blaine stops
a woman out for a walk and asks her to think of the name of someone
important to her. While she's thinking, a yellow taxi drives by on
the street behind them with the name ``Dawn'' scrawled on the side,
graffiti-style. Blaine points it out to her, and she freaks.
</P>
<P>
   And so will most viewers of Blaine's magic act tonight on ABC.
It's a magic show for people who don't like magic shows _ no
spangle-bedecked assistants, no white tigers, no sawing anybody in
half, no bombastic music. In short, no Vegas. Just Blaine, walking
around city streets in Manhattan and Memphis, accosting passers-by
and pulling off simple but astonishing tricks that leave them
open-mouthed in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   He does a card trick, and makes the chosen card appear inside
his victim's shoe. He swallows a long black thread, then lifts his
shirt and appears to pull it directly out of the skin over his
stomach.
</P>

   Other professional magicians say Blaine doesn't bring anything
new to the craft, that it's all just packaging. But so much of
magic is packaging, and Blaine's is just flat-out funkier than
anybody else's. Working completely outdoors in public with regular
people makes his act seem street-savvy. And then there's the magic
man himself: hip black T-shirt and jeans, Marine buzz cut, swarthy,
handsome, charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if Blaine has taken a misstep in his careful
image-crafting lately, it was that publicity stunt of being buried
under a New York sidewalk for seven days. It seemed so hokey, so
Copperfieldian, compared to the millennial coolness Blaine has
cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, ABC ran Blaine's first special. It wasn't a
blockbuster in the ratings, but everyone who saw it was obsessed
with talking about it the next day. Don't be fooled: Watch Blaine
tonight, and get ready to catch your jaw.

PHOTOGRAPHER DOCUMENTS JEWISH ENCLAVE IN HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ It nearly came apart over the red jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Brenner, a documentary photographer at work on an epic
project about the Jewish Diaspora, wanted all 600 of his
strong-minded subjects to slip on matching Chinese silk jackets for
a group portrait in front of the compact synagogue that nestles in
a forest of skyscrapers here.
</P>
<P>
   But Brenner was dealing with Hong Kong's Jews, a collection of
1,600 or so people about as fractious as any Jews he had
photographed in his travels through 42 countries. Uncompromisingly
devout or determinedly secular, Hong Kong's Jews rarely agree on
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Some people complained that the jackets were reminiscent of Mao
and sent the wrong signal for a people used to oppression. Others
said Hong Kong's Jews should wear symbols of their own heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after relentless cajoling and no little bullying, Brenner
persuaded most to put on the jackets. And on a slate-grey morning,
the 40-year-old photographer snapped a vivid record of a Jewish
enclave in a capitalist bastion on the edge of the world's last
communist empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong photograph and another group portrait taken in
front of Mao's portrait facing Tiananmen Square in Beijing are the
penultimate chapter in Brenner's own Odyssean journey. For 20 years
this French-born photographer has documented Jews in alien
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The project, called ``Chronicle of Exile,'' has yielded five
coffee-table books and been exhibited in New York, Paris, Tel Aviv
and Buenos Aires. It is to be completed in 2001 after Brenner
returns to home ground to produce a final chapter on Jews in
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project started with an intuition,'' said Brenner, an
intense, dark-haired man who speaks fervently and with the sort of
ready-made quotations that find their way into art books and
newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a highly assimilated Jewish family in Paris, Brenner
traveled to Israel at the age of 20 to take pictures. He said he
realized that Jews in Israel had recreated an Eastern European
shtetl, an identity that was fading elsewhere. So he set off for
remote corners of the world in a kind of race to memorialize Jewish
enclaves before they vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only after 8 or 10 years was it clear that I was piecing
together the fragments of a puzzle,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle is how Jews at once embrace and stand apart from
their adopted lands. He has explored that paradox with elaborate,
meticulously staged photographs that are striking for their
incongruous images.
</P>
<P>
   In one shot from his essay on American Jews, women celebrate a
Passover seder in a maximum-security prison. In another, called
``Jews With Hogs,'' the members of a Jewish motorcycle gang glower
from their Harley-Davidsons (known as hogs) in front of a Miami
Beach synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   To Brenner's delight, China provided rich possibilities for his
brand of odd juxtaposition. In the Hong Kong photo, people spill
out of a synagogue, while behind them a banner with Chinese
characters flutters from a typical Hong Kong high-rise. The banner
celebrates the Jewish holiday Purim.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Brenner won rare permission from the city to use the
giant portrait of Mao in Tiananmen Square as the backdrop for a
picture of the 180 Jews in the city. Some of them are wearing the
controversial silk jackets, and several are posed with bicycles.
Standing on a table directly beneath Mao's visage is a Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe this?'' Brenner says, pointing gleefully at
the photo of the Torah. ``This is the most subversive image you
could imagine in front of one of the most potent symbols of
socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a project about outsiders, the Jews in Brenner's China
portraits seem disconnected from their environment. There are
precious few Chinese faces in the photos, though slightly more in
the Beijing portrait. It is clear from the photos that the Jews of
China are not assimilated into this vast country. They exist as an
expatriate subculture, a ripple in the sea of 1.2 billion Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   So why make five long trips, bicker over red jackets and
negotiate with truculent Chinese bureaucrats to photograph them?
</P>
<P>
   ``China is the ultimate `other' that the Jews will never be,''
Brenner said. ``It is the ultimate expression of the Diaspora. Jews
don't define themselves as being in a place. They define themselves
as being on a journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Brenner was keen to evoke a sense of place. The
red silk jackets were supplied by David Tang, the flamboyant owner
of Shanghai Tang, which specializes in what could be called Mao
retro chic. To Brenner, they captured Hong Kong's style and
obsession with status.
</P>
<P>
   Such allusions were not lost on the would-be photo subjects.
Some objected that Brenner was going to make Hong Kong's Jews seem
like shallow materialists. He listened patiently to their
objections but did not give an inch. When a handful of people
balked at putting on the jackets the day of the shooting, Brenner
shunted them to the fringes of the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an artist; far be it from me to try to get into his
mind,'' said Rabbi Mordechai Avtzon of the Chabad congregation
here, who stayed out of the photo rather than wear a jacket.
</P>
<P>
   For all the grumbling, Brenner attracted people from all four
Jewish congregations in Hong Kong, although before the shoot some
liberal Jews refused to enter the synagogue that was the backdrop
for the picture because it is controlled by Hong Kong's Orthodox
Ohel Leah congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My project was the first that brought this community
together,'' Brenner said with endearing immodesty. ``It was like
mixing mayonnaise; sometimes it mixes well and sometimes it
doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   For Brenner, coming to Hong Kong was the logical culmination of
a journey that began in Israel. With its thrusting skyscrapers,
frenzied financial markets and jet-set populace, Brenner sees Hong
Kong as the perfect home for a transient people on the cusp of a
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews,'' he noted, ``have lived in a global village for
4,000 years, ever since God spoke to Abraham.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: My cyber's lost in space
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ If everything had gone according to
plan, I'd be writing to you from somewhere deep in Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, here I am still stuck at home.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but it was a fine plan.
</P>
<P>
   The home office in Atlanta _ the only city in the world where
there are people who can fire me _ had deemed that I should be
newly equipped with a new computer. Never mind I have yet to fully
figure out the one I've been using for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new one would be quicker, faster, better. The idea, I think,
is that they hoped it would make me quicker, faster, better.
</P>
<P>
   They would overnight it to me (can you remember when
``overnight'' wasn't a verb?), I'd piddle with it for a few days
and then I'd bring it with me to Atlanta to be tutored as to its
nits and nuances. After which, I'd be free to go my own way.
</P>
<P>
   My way _ the way I planned it _ was to drive south in the
general direction of Savannah, where I have never been but have
read about in the book ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil''
and long to while away long evenings thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for my wife to fly to Savannah from Texas, we would
spend a couple of nights _ maybe even staying up until midnight
just to see what would happen _ then she would fly back home and
I'd drive onward southward, seeing what there was to see and
writing what there was to write.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I planned to end up in Key West to look up whatever
evidence remains of Ernest Hemingway's years as a resident, this
being the 100th anniversary of his birth _ a good place to be and a
good reason to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, my Cousin Bubba was figuring to take off a few days
from the tire store and meet up with me somewhere along the way,
way down there in Florida, to relive one more time a motor trip we
made almost 40 years ago, talking big, eating heartily and drinking
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Never gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   I never got the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between there and here, somebody else got the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   That's what our company cyberman tells me the overnight express
company told him, that the computer was stolen along the way,
probably by one of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Say la vee, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to my trip, said I.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, eventually I'll get another computer. Eventually, I'll go to
Atlanta and have it prayed over. But the rest of the trip is
doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month my wife has a trip of her own. First week of
next month I'm scheduled for minor eye surgery. In June I'm
supposed to be in China. Regardless, Bubba can't just up and leave
the tire store whenever he wants, not with people wanting tires.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever stole the computer stole what would have been a nice
couple of weeks of my life.

THE PHOTOGRAPHIC TREASURES OF A SECRET COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Mo., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before he died suddenly last year at 81 of a heart attack, David
Feigenbaum led the secret life of a collector of Citizen Kane-like
obsessiveness. He filled almost every inch of his two-story house
in Marblehead, Mass., with things, including books, guns, model
boats, Civil War and World War II paraphernalia and an old Scottish
Bible collection.
</P>
<P>
   In the basement, together with old manuscripts, historic
letters, coins and jewelry, was an extraordinary cache of
mid-19th-century daguerreotypes, including more than 200 made by
Southworth &AMP; Hawes of Boston, a recognized master of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Most daguerreotypes come in small sizes, but 70 of the pieces in
the Feigenbaum collection are extremely hard to find whole plates,
measuring 6{ by 8{ inches. The studio's partners, Albert S.
Southworth and Josiah J. Hawes, were famous for making portraits
marked by a radiant naturalness and artistry. And their studio drew
Boston's cultured elite, much as Nadar's in Paris became the
gathering place for that city's intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades specialists in daguerreotypes have seldom come
across an unknown whole-plate Southworth &AMP; Hawes, making the
discovery of the Feigenbaum photographic collection, which will be
offered at Sotheby's in Manhattan on April 27, even more unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Daguerreotypes, each of which is an in-camera positive image on
a polished silvered metal plate, were very popular in the United
States of the 1840s and 50s. They were by and large portraits, but
in the Feigenbaum collection are several cityscapes, including a
whole-plate modernist study of a glorious cloud-filled sky above a
roof line, its roofing tiles and a skylight nicely detailed.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-19th century it was technically difficult to take
such a picture. The risk was that the sky would be overexposed to
get the details in the roof line or that the roof line would be
underexposed, reducing it to a silhouette, to get the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century French landscape photographer Gustave Le Gray
resolved the problem by combining a paper negative of the sky with
that of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   David Feigenbaum was born in 1917, the only child of Abraham
Feigenbaum, founder of the Tremont Camera Exchange, a
carriage-trade camera store in Boston. After his father died in the
1950s, David Feigenbaum managed the store for some years. He closed
the camera shop in 1957 and worked as an X-ray technologist in the
radiology department of Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   His surviving relatives knew he was a collector of sorts, but he
never talked about it. A niece, who asked not to be identified by
name, recalled a few hints of her uncle's acquisitiveness. One time
she told him that she didn't know what to throw out during a spring
cleaning. ``Why would you even think of throwing anything out?''
she remembers him asking.
</P>
<P>
   Feigenbaum enjoyed the frequent company of friends and such
pastimes as sailing and walking. He was also something of an
eccentric. Early in the 1990s, a few years after his wife's death,
when friends and relatives arranged to have a meal with him or an
outing, he would wait for them outside his house, his niece said.
Afterward they would deposit him outside his house. He never
invited anyone in, and the windows were always closed, the curtains
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   After Feigenbaum's death, his sister-in-law made the funeral
arrangements. She finally got to see the mind-boggling interior of
his house. A few weeks later she went with her two children and
son-in-law to Marblehead and with a crew and began to clear the
house.
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup squad initially assumed they were dealing with
wall-to-wall junk. ``I said, `Let's take a match to this place
because there's so much junk,''' recalled the niece. Her husband's
first thought on seeing the inside of the house was the warehouse
scene at the end of ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, 32 tons of trash _ old newspapers, old
cans of food, jars, bottle caps _ were pitched into Dumpsters. But
then the surprises emerged: 16th-century manuscripts, 1865 tickets
to the Ford Theater, a letter from a family member in Custer's
army. Inside two safes in the basement were coins, jewelry, Patek
Philippe watches and unset sapphires and rubies.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the cleanup, a relative spotted crates marked
``Eastman Kodak Co.'' He opened one, picked up a few daguerreotypes
in their original slatted plate boxes, and knew he was looking at
something out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Most daguerreotypes unearthed from America's attics are
unexceptional. Under the process, which was developed in France by
Louis J.M. Daguerre in the 1830s, a daguerreotypist makes an image
by exposing a painstakingly polished plate in the camera. The
process also requires the sitter to hold still for as long as 30
seconds, which led to exceedingly stiff portraits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a select group, including Thomas M. Easterly of St. Louis,
and Southworth &AMP; Hawes, produced images that have the fluidity of
photographs taken by later artists using faster lenses and film.
Southworth &AMP; Hawes, in particular, knew how to make the kind of
technical improvements that would allow for shorter exposure times
and greater clarity, depth and tonal range.
</P>
<P>
   George Romer, director of conservation and museum studies at the
George Eastman House in Rochester, said the Feigenbaum trove can be
traced to a sale by Holman's Print Shop of Boston, which
represented the Hawes family, in the 1930s and 40s. At the time a
few collectors bought sizable numbers of the pieces, which were
subsequently given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the George Eastman House.
</P>
<P>
   Feigenbaum's heirs have already sold his house and much of its
contents. None of them are collectors. &QL;

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI with GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever so quietly the Metropolitan Museum of Art has
raised its suggested admission price to $10, from $8. Visitors to
the museum have been learning of that 25 percent increase only
after they climb the granite steps and read signs above the ticket
booths inside.
</P>
<P>
   The price jump, which went into effect March 1, is necessary to
shore up the museum's finances, Met officials say. Even with the
new fee, the museum expects to close the books for its current
fiscal year, which ends June 30, deeper in the red than last year,
when the deficit totaled $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both the ticket increase and the deficit are legacies, in part,
of the fix the Met has been in since mid-1997, when the Reader's
Digest Association, the magazine and book company, woke up to
stagnant sales and faltering expansion efforts and began a
retrenchment that included a cut in its stock dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, Lila Acheson Wallace, the philanthropic grande
dame and co-founder of Reader's Digest who died in 1984, had
established an organization that made the museum the beneficiary of
dividends from a chunk of Reader's Digest Association stock and
other assets. The handsome annuity from the company's dividends
reached more than $16 million in 1996, or nearly 15 percent of the
Met's operating budget, which then was about $110 million and is
now about $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Reader's Digest has slashed its quarterly dividend to 5 cents
a share from 45 cents a share in 1997, the payout to the Met's
Wallace fund dropped to $2.6 million this year from $6 million in
fiscal 1998 and $12.2 million in 1997. Unless the company's board
reverses course and raises the dividend rate, next year's
contribution will be $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Met, makes no
apologies for raising admissions to help make up the shortfall.
``It is without any embarrassment that we do this,'' he said. ``We
are not cutting programs or services, and we are keeping galleries
open. And it is not a fixed price of admission.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met's policy says that people may pay what they wish, though
they must pay something. And many do pay less than the suggested
amount. With the Met's previous suggested price of $8, individual
contributions averaged between $5 and $6.
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello said he did not think visitors would stay away
because of the increase: ``Why should they? It's still
`suggested.''' He continued, ``And it's a bargain compared to other
institutions around town.'' The Met maintains that attendance has
not been affected.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles at Reader's Digest have also hurt other cultural
institutions that were favorites of Lila Wallace and her husband,
DeWitt Wallace, who died in 1981: Lincoln Center; the Wildlife
Conservation Society, whose flagship is the Bronx Zoo, and Colonial
Williamsburg in Virginia are all beneficiaries of organizations
that hold Reader's Digest stock. So are two Hudson River basin
preservation groups, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan and Macalester College in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Wallaces created a separate fund for each
institution, each has different assets, grant policies and
trustees. So each organization can decide how to cope for itself.
So far, only the Met has taken an action that touches consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Wallace fund,
for example, have chosen to dig into the rising value of its stock
assets, including Reader's Digest stock, which has rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done with the support of the Wallace board is to
choose to spend 5 percent of the total market value of the fund,
which has put us on the prior level of funding,'' said John Hoare,
the controller. ``This year our grant will be $7.2 million. Last
year it was $6.6 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center has also offset the dividend loss by using some
stock gains. ``Our first cut would come in the next fiscal year,''
said Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center
Theater, one of the center's seven arts groups. ``And it will be
about $500,000, while our budget is expected to be about $28
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Schneiderman, co-chairman of the New York City Opera, said
that the opera's first cut would come in June. ``We are trying to
raise more money,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise Colonial Williamsburg plans to make up for dividend
declines with a new policy that bases its annual grant on the
capital appreciation and dividends of the assets in its fund
instead of solely on dividends. ``We are hoping the policy shift
will be in place by 2000,'' said Kathy Whitehead, the chief
financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Met has tapped into a reserve fund, money from previous
Wallace grants that went unspent, to help make up for the dividend
cut. But between 1997 and fiscal year 2000, it will suffer a drop
of nearly $11 million from the Wallace fund.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Wallace beneficiaries, the Met is spending money
carefully and trying to replace lost money with new donations.
``You can assume that all departments and individuals at the museum
are looking at every possible option,'' de Montebello said. ``We
want to stabilize the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Met is also asking more from visitors because it has
more leeway with them. Theater and opera tickets are already steep,
and movies, the barometer used by many museums as a guide in
setting admission fees, typically cost $9.50 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As for rival Manhattan museums, general admission at the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Museum is $12 _ no ``suggested'' about it _ to see a
far less comprehensive collection. Tickets for the Museum of Modern
Art are $9.50, and for the Whitney Museum of American Art, $9.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster exhibitions cost more: $15 at the Guggenheim, $12.50
at the Modern and $12.50 for the Whitney's coming ``American
Century'' show. But the Met never asks more for them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the Met been as aggressive as others at raising prices.
The last increase was in July 1996. Since 1992 the Met's suggested
donation has risen 67 percent from $6, while the Guggenheim's
admission fee has climbed 71 percent, from $7, in the same period,
and the Whitney's has jumped 80 percent since 1992, when it was $5.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney also sneaked through something of an increase last
November, when it quietly eliminated its free hours on Thursday
evenings. Instead, visitors must pay something. Thursday evening
revenues have since jumped from $80, or about 10 cents a person, to
$800, or about $1.18 a person, the museum said. And beginning May
6, only the first Thursday evening of the month will be pay as you
wish; for the rest of the month visitors will have to pay the usual
admission.
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello said he would not follow the course of some large
museums, which mount a blockbuster every year, often of Monet or
other Impressionists, specifically to draw crowds. ``I still have
integrity,'' he said. ``We won't do an exhibition just for the
gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``those exhibitions take three or four years
to organize. It's not like the opera, where if you want to do
`Aida,' I suppose you can scramble and get sets from downstairs.
Loan exhibitions take years to do the scholarship and to arrange.''
</P>
<P>
   The deficit is real now. For the fiscal year that ends in June,
``there's no question it will be up'' from last year's $1.5 million
total, said Deborah Winschel, the Met's chief financial officer,
``but it won't be a huge jump.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the deficit will largely depend on the popularity of
the Met's next big exhibition, ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The
Collection of Dr. Gachet,'' which opens May 25, a look at the
paintings collected by and painted by van Gogh's last doctor.
</P>
<P>
   And another problem looms. The Met has been getting about $16
million a year from New York City, but as usual, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has proposed a budget cut, this year of about $2.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it happens every spring. But this year City Council members
have been saying they will not mount their usual fight to restore
cuts to cultural programs, leaving the Met and other institutions
in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   De Montebello declined to discuss that prospect and its
potential impact. ``I'd rather not think about that melancholy
thought,'' he said. ``I don't want to contemplate it. It's
unimaginable.''

TOYOTA NAMES NEW PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Toyota Motor Corp. on Tuesday ended months of
speculation about who would succeed Hiroshi Okuda as its president,
appointing a close aide of the Japanese automaker's founding family
to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda, a darling of the media and investment communities, will
become chairman, which in Japan is considered a less responsible
position than president. He will replace Shoichiro Toyoda, a
third-generation scion of the family that created the company, who
will become honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Okuda will be Fujio Cho, 62, who most recently served
as right-hand man to Toyoda when he was chairman of the Keidanren,
Japan's leading business association. Cho also is known for his
ties to the Toyoda family, whose influence at the company is far
out of proportion to the tiny percentage of shares it still owns.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Cho enjoys widespread popularity among
Toyota's vast network of suppliers, who were mistrustful of Okuda's
cost-cutting efforts. So he is well positioned to assure a smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will take effect after the annual shareholders'
meeting in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had anticipated Cho's appointment ever since Okuda
stunned corporate Japan in January by announcing that he intended
to vacate his Toyota post to take charge of the Japan Federation of
Employers' Associations, or Nikkeiren.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement raised speculation that Okuda's management of
the company had been called into question. One rumor suggested that
the changes Okuda had made at Toyota _ many of them imposed quickly
and with little deference to tradition and convention _ had upset
Eiji Toyoda, Shoichiro's cousin and the family patriarch.
</P>
<P>
   Okuda himself said he thought the job required more energy than
he, at 66 years old, could provide. But that explanation was not
widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing of the ``Okuda ouster'' theories _ and the
one given the most credence by analysts and executives at other
Japanese auto companies _ suggests that he ran afoul of Toyota's
``home boys,'' the insular community of parts manufacturers,
dealers and service providers situated in and around the company's
headquarters in Toyota City on the outskirts of Nagoya.
</P>
<P>
   Those vendors, having seen Okuda's success in cutting costs
inside Toyota, anticipated that he would soon try to reduce costs
associated with them. Toyota makes more than 70 percent of the
vehicles it produces in Japan, buying the parts for those cars
largely in Japan from suppliers in which it often holds ownership
stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Those suppliers have high costs and charge more than competitors
abroad. That means Toyota pays more for most parts than its rivals
pay, a problem it must solve.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in March, Okuda, the first non-family member to
run the company, laughed at the suggestion of tension between him
and the Toyoda family. He also refused to comment about his future
at the Nikkeiren but said he looked forward to doing something new.
</P>
<P>
   During his four years as Toyota's president, he reduced costs,
expanded the company's product lineup and ushered it into what he
calls the ``5 Million Club,'' the group of automakers that produce
more than 5 million cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   His penchant for blunt off-the-cuff remarks and his broad smile
are traits not usually displayed by senior Japanese executives. He
was well liked by foreign journalists and helped give Toyota a
human face _ and his public-relations staff ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   Tetsuo Kitagawa, Toyota's spokesman in charge of the foreign
press, is known for chain-smoking through interviews and briefings
conducted by Okuda.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent moment of unusual candor, he complained about his
appointment to the Prime Minister's Economic Strategy Council,
saying it wouldn't accomplish anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't being outspoken supposed to be a good thing?'' he asked,
when questioned about the remark. Later he conceded: ``It is true
that in Japan, we have had a saying that silence is golden and
eloquence is, well, I'm not sure exactly what, but something bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But the very things that endeared him to foreign investors and
reporters may have led to an abbreviated tenure as Toyota's top
executive. Comparing his situation to that of Nobuyuki Idei, the
president of Sony, another high-profile and controversial Japanese
corporate leader, Okuda said, ``our personalities may have been
criticized for wanting or suggesting change.''
</P>
<P>
   Okuda said he thought more people like him and Idei would
continue to gain top jobs in Japan, not only in business but
politics. He denied speculation, though, that he has considered a
political career.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to identify his best achievement, he said, ``If there is
one thing I can be proud of, it is that we needed to change and in
driving that message home, we did change.''
</P>
<P>
   Many feel he paid a high price for that achievement, that it may
have cost him his job, but Okuda said no. ``As you know, salarymen
don't make so much money, so I could not afford a high price,'' he
answered and smiled one of his characteristic grins.

KOREA FIRST BANK SALE TO FOREIGN CONSORTIUM UNRAVELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A financial deal widely interpreted as a sign that South
Korea was recovering from its economic malaise is in danger of
coming undone.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement by the South Korean government to sell the ailing
Korea First Bank to a consortium led by Newbridge Capital Ltd., a
private equity fund backed by the American investors Richard Blum
and David Bonderman, has foundered over a disagreement about how to
value the bank's assets and establish a sale price, people involved
in the dispute said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are differences,'' said Sandy Park, a spokeswoman for
the Financial Supervisory Commission, which is overseeing the
overhaul of South Korea's battered banking system.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was impossible to say whether those differences
would prove insurmountable. ``It's hard to tell at this time
whether the investors want more time to try to work on coming to
agreement or whether we have to find another buyer,'' Ms. Park
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Newbridge official said the consortium was committed to
completing the deal as it was described in a memorandum of
understanding between the group and the government. ``We continue
to believe that deal is in the best interests of Korea First Bank,
Newbridge and the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium, which includes GE Capital, signed a deal Dec. 31
to buy 51 percent of Korea First, one of two banks nationalized to
help satisfy concerns of the International Monetary Fund when it
extended a $57 billion economic rescue package in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the disagreement between Newbridge and the
government has been brewing for some time in the South Korean
press, and the publicity could merely be posturing aimed at winning
better terms for the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
   But many deals have fallen apart in South Korea since the
country committed itself to eliminating barriers to foreign
investment, which it needs to repair its economy. Buyers and
sellers have vastly different ideas about how Korean assets should
be priced and what constitutes liability.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge itself canceled plans to buy Haitai Beverage, a unit
of South Korea's bankrupt Haitai group, and in general, the flood
of foreign investment that had been expected has instead been a
trickle, despite legions of investment bankers camped out in
Seoul's five-star hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the government and Newbridge seemed to
symbolize the end of South Korea's deep economic decline and the
beginning of the surge of foreign investment that the country had
been awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   It was seen as the first large vote of confidence in the South
Korean government's promises to embrace market forces, improve
financial disclosure requirements and eliminate inappropriately
close relations between government and business, and it underscored
the speed with which the government was moving to repair a
debt-burdened financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the government has agreed to sell 70 percent of
Seoul Bank, the other bank it nationalized, to HSBC Holdings. And
on Monday a group of investors led by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. said it
had agreed to pay $500 million for a 17 percent stake in Kookmin
Bank, one of South Korea's largest and soundest banks.
</P>
<P>
   That investment, Goldman's largest in Asia, along with the
general sense that South Korea is well down the path to economic
recovery, may have made the government reconsider its deal with the
Newbridge consortium, which is focused on the price it will pay and
how much risk it will assume.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment has definitely changed there since the
beginning of the year,'' said one financial buyer who has been
scouting in South Korea for deals. ``There's a political drift away
from pushing ahead hard and opening the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Newbridge has apparently foundered on the
issue of how to value the assets that will remain on Korea First's
books. The value of those assets will establish the price Newbridge
will pay.
</P>
<P>
   Newbridge has apparently priced those assets at what it regards
as fair market value based on Western methods of evaluating bank
loans, known as mark-to-market accounting, while the government is
using book values, which are probably somewhere near the face value
of the loans.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean banks typically did not write loans down much below
face value; if they had, more loans would have been thrown into the
non-performing category, requiring banks to increase their reserves
against potential losses. Thus the book value of Korea First's
loans may not reflect what they are actually worth today.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Newbridge's use of market pricing is an effort to
ensure that it gets the best price possible.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government has pledged to adopt mark-to-market
accounting, but Ms. Park said the shift would have to be gradual.
``It's hard for us just in one day to completely change our
system,'' she said.

SINN FEIN'S OBJECTION DEEPENS PESSIMISM AROUND BELFAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The political wing of the Irish Republican Army said
Tuesday at peace talks in Belfast that it had rejected a proposal
by the British and Irish governments to resolve the impasse on
disarmament that is blocking the formation of a new Northern
Ireland government.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA, deepened the growing pessimism
around the talks. The negotiations resumed Tuesday after a 12-day
suspension to examine the two governments' framework declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The action also isolated Sinn Fein as the sole objector among
the parties to the document. Those parties include the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, made up mostly of moderate Catholics,
and the Irish government in Dublin _ two delegations that share
Sinn Fein's long-term goal of unifying the predominantly Protestant
North with the largely Catholic Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The talks broke off inconclusively April 1 on the eve of a Good
Friday deadline, despite the presence of the British and Irish
prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern
</P>
<P>
   The accord promising the return of home rule to Northern Ireland
and seeking an end to three decades of sectarian violence was
reached on Good Friday a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing urgency to put the full settlement into effect,
because of the imminence of the most politically volatile period in
Northern Ireland's year, the Protestant Orange Order marching
season, which has sparked provincewide violence in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The process for an accord has faced many hurdles and 11th-hour
crises. But the dispute over disarming, called ``decommissioning''
in the parlance of the negotiations, is proving to be the most
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a demand by the Ulster Unionists, the largest
Protestant party in the province, that the IRA make a ``credible
start'' at decommissioning before Sinn Fein is permitted to occupy
the two executive seats to which it is entitled in the new
power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature is the centerpiece of the Good Friday agreement
and becomes effective only on the transfer of home-rule powers from
the British Parliament here. That defining move, in turn, awaits
the creation of the executive branch of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The original accord set no obligation for disarmament before the
Assembly and other agencies were set up. Sinn Fein is adamant that
it will not allow such a ``precondition'' to be created now. It has
repeatedly said that it cannot ``deliver'' such action from the
IRA, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The party further points out that it has met all the demands set
out in the accord and that the vote it attracted in the elections
last June to the new body gives it an absolute right to the two
Cabinet seats.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament provokes deep-seated opposition among republicans,
or those who seek closer ties with the Irish Republic, because they
see it as an act of surrender. And they are not convinced that the
Catholic minority in Northern Ireland will never again have to use
physical force to protect itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists have contended that even if the accord does
not specifically demand disarmament now, it is unacceptable to let
a party participate in legislative politics ``with arms under the
table.'' That argument has become such a powerful and broadly
accepted one in the overall debate that if the impasse causes the
failure of the peace settlement, almost all the blame will be laid
on Sinn Fein.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the end of the marathon talks on April 1 at Hillsborough
Castle, outside Belfast, the two prime ministers brought forth
their document, which painstakingly sought to marry the two
antagonistic positions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a precondition, disarmament would be only an
``obligation,'' and a ``voluntary'' one at that. Guns would not
actually be ``decommissioned.'' They would be ``put beyond use.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the executive would not be ``named'' at first, but
``nominated'' with a month before officially occupying their
positions. In that time, some arms would be put beyond use in a way
that would be verifiable by Gen. John de Chastelain, chairman of
the independent disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable Sinn Fein to say it was in the executive
without having had to agree to a precondition on disarmament, and
the Ulster Unionists could say a disarmament demand had been met
before Sinn Fein's Cabinet rank was official.
</P>
<P>
   The British Secretary for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, said
Tuesday that despite the Sinn Fein disparagement of the
Hillsborough Declaration, as the proposal has been called, it would
remain the basis for seeking a final agreement. Blair and Ahern are
expected to return to Belfast this week to try to rescue the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- ``When it comes to computers,'' said Michael
Dertouzos, ``people should be able to do more with less.''
</P>
<P>
   As David Clark, Dertouzos' colleague at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, sees it: ``Everything is going to have a
computer in it. Everything will be connected to the network.
Tomorrow's networks must be consumer friendly and cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another MIT computer scientist, Victor Zue, believes the
machines of the future will be addressed and reply with the spoken
word, when, for example, a user says: ``Let me know when Microsoft
stock is over $160 a share'' or ``call me a half-hour before I must
leave for the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing on Tuesday to these 21st century cyber-visions
was Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who told scientists on the MIT
campus: ``In the future, all your personal and professional
information will be stored in a 'cloud' on the Internet. But
retrieval and privacy still pose a challenge. These are tough
questions that we have not yet answered.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion that brought Gates to Cambridge was the 35th
anniversary of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, a
cutting-edge facility Dertouzos has directed since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   MIT marked the event by announcing a new home for the lab, to be
built after Gates sent a check to the university from his family
foundation for $20 million to underwrite construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new home should be ready in 2003, well into a fresh
five-year research project, also announced on Tuesday, aimed at
decoupling personal computers from their traditional desktop
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Dertouzos has dubbed that effort Oxygen. He and his MIT staff at
the lab spent much of the day explaining is goals, which are to be
met through a tax-payer funded $38 million grant from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, an arm of the Pentagon
that brought the Internet into being in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of 'going to
the computer,' Dertouzos said.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oxygenated future, users will carry a universal portable
device that looks something like a cell phone but also has a small
display screen. Dubbed ``Handy 21,'' it will include a digital
video camera, a global positioning system receiver and an infrared
detector, all under the control of a tiny but powerful computer,
which will also be designed at the MIT lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a chameleon,'' Dertouzos said, ``the unit can change at
the flip of a (software command) from a cell phone to a two-way
radio a TV, a beeper, a handheld computer, a pointing device and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the Handy 21 will be the Enviro 21, a sensory
network to be placed in office walls, homes and cars. These units
would bear the same relationship to the portable devices as do
power sockets to batteries, offering much greater storage capacity,
communication speed and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology will link all Oxygen devices to each other and
offer speech-recognition, making the system easy to use as a
natural part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   The lab plans to build on the Oxygen project by providing four
user services:
</P>
<P>
   -- A friendly, knowledge-access system that helps you find data
you need while you work in your own familiar way and that remembers
all prior forays onto the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   -- An automation technology that lets you tell the machine what
routine work it should off-load from human shoulders -- for
instance, how and when to interrupt you.
</P>
<P>
   -- A collaborative scheme that helps groups work together by
tracing discussions and keeping track of issues, documents and even
snippets of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   -- A customization approach that adapts Oxygen to the needs of
individual users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no more shrink-wrapped software,'' Dertouzos
said. ``Everything will be downloadable.''

</P>
<P>
   The occasion that brought Gates to Cambridge was the 35th
anniversary of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, a
cutting-edge facility Dertouzos has directed since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   MIT marked the event by announcing a new home for the lab, to be
built after Gates sent a check to the university from his family
foundation for $20 million to underwrite construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new home should be ready in 2003, well into a fresh
five-year research project, also announced on Tuesday, aimed at
decoupling personal computers from their traditional desktop
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Dertouzos has dubbed that effort Oxygen. He and his MIT staff at
the lab spent much of the day explaining is goals, which are to be
met through a tax-payer funded $38 million grant from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, an arm of the Pentagon
that brought the Internet into being in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of 'going to
the computer,' Dertouzos said.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oxygenated future, users will carry a universal portable
device that looks something like a cell phone but also has a small
display screen. Dubbed ``Handy 21,'' it will include a digital
video camera, a global positioning system receiver and an infrared
detector, all under the control of a tiny but powerful computer,
which will also be designed at the MIT lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a chameleon,'' Dertouzos said, ``the unit can change at
the flip of a (software command) from a cell phone to a two-way
radio a TV, a beeper, a handheld computer, a pointing device and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the Handy 21 will be the Enviro 21, a sensory
network to be placed in office walls, homes and cars. These units
would bear the same relationship to the portable devices as do
power sockets to batteries, offering much greater storage capacity,
communication speed and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology will link all Oxygen devices to each other and
offer speech-recognition, making the system easy to use as a
natural part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   The lab plans to build on the Oxygen project by providing four
user services:
</P>
<P>
   -- A friendly, knowledge-access system that helps you find data
you need while you work in your own familiar way and that remembers
all prior forays onto the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   -- An automation technology that lets you tell the machine what
routine work it should off-load from human shoulders -- for
instance, how and when to interrupt you.
</P>
<P>
   -- A collaborative scheme that helps groups work together by
tracing discussions and keeping track of issues, documents and even
snippets of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   -- A customization approach that adapts Oxygen to the needs of
individual users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no more shrink-wrapped software,'' Dertouzos
said. ``Everything will be downloadable.''

SOME KEY SENATORS URGE PREPARATIONS FOR GROUND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN and MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although Congress remains split on the use of
ground forces in Kosovo, leading senators of both parties said
Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should start
preparing for an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee, said congressional leaders continue to support the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I would make it very clear we are
prepared to use anything necessary to achieve our goal,'' he said
after an hour-long meeting that President Clinton held with him and
57 other members of Congress, most of them from committees dealing
with national security.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a member of the Senate
Appropriations defense subcommittee, said a ``widespread opinion''
among members is that the president should not rule out the use of
ground troops and that ``obviously, the way to keep the ground
option available would be to do some pre-positioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who also serves on the subcommittee,
said ``infrastructure'' such as landing strips, fuel depots and
communication centers would have to be built before any large
contingent of troops could be sent to the Balkans from U.S.
military bases in Ramstein, Germany, or Aviano, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thinking that it would be a realistic thing to do
because this is not simply flying out of Ramstein or Aviano and
saying, `Here we come,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that a troop buildup might entice Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to sign a peace agreement, Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said,
``We have to be prepared to fight this to the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Military experts have worried that without significant
preparation by NATO engineers, any invasion by NATO troops would
bog down because of poor road, rail, port and communications
systems in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Lt. Gen. William Odom, a former director of the
National Security Agency, has said that any assault on Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the dominant state in Yugoslavia, could take
several weeks or longer to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Clinton and lawmakers came as NATO's
military commander, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, was requesting some 300
more U.S. planes and helicopters as well as more air power from
NATO allies, although he did not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to approve the
request quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The reinforcements would be supplement the 500 U.S. aircraft
that are already part of NATO's 700-plane force. The additional
planes would include ground-attack jets such as Air Force F-15s and
F-16s, radar-jamming planes such as Navy EA-6Bs to disrupt and
attack Serb air defenses, and refueling tankers such as Air Force
KC-135s to allow allied pilots to stay aloft longer.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a GOP presidential contender, said
the request for new planes demonstrates a lack of success in the
air campaign. ``To request an additional 300 aircraft three weeks
into the war is not an indication that everything is on track,'' he
said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would ask Congress soon for an emergency
supplemental appropriation to finance the war. Administration and
congressional officials have estimated the cost at $3 billion to $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, referring to questions about funding the war, said the
Pentagon would get the money. But he added that he was ``very
concerned about how we handle this total operation.'' He was
referring to a debate over paying for the war from the expected
federal budget surplus or from spending cutbacks in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., a member of the House
International Relations Committee, said at a news conference here
that the air offensive is unconstitutional because ``we are engaged
in a war that has not been declared.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Campbell introduced two resolutions _ one to formally
declare war on Yugoslavia and the other to order the troops
withdrawn. He said he was invoking the War Powers Act of 1973,
which requires both chambers of Congress to vote on a military
action 60 days after it has begun. In this case, the chambers would
have to vote on the two measures next month. If Congress refuses to
declare war, Campbell said he will go to federal court seeking a
ruling that Clinton's military actions in the Balkans are
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   However, House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, said he
had reservations about Campbell's resolutions and is considering
asking the Californian to withdraw the measures.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk with lawmakers, Clinton emphasized that the air
bombardment of Iraq leading up to the use of ground forces in the
Persian Gulf War in 1991 took 44 days _ and urged lawmakers not to
rush to judgment.

   KOVOSO-CONGRESS (Washington) _ President Clinton's national
security team fanned out across Congress today trying to sell the
Balkan air campaign to a divided Congress just back from a two-week
recess; Republican leaders worked to head off lawmakers seeking
early votes on ground troops. Opinion was sharply split with some
members of Congress urging Clinton to began preparing for ground
troops and others vowing to vote against a deployment that they
charged would keep the United States in the Balkans for a decade.

Angeles' lucrative television market, which is bigger than many
states. But there's a catch: Los Angeles, the town that couldn't

   TECH-PRODUCTIVITY (Undated) _ For years, as the computer
revolutionized the workplace, productivity _ the output of goods
and services per worker _ stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a
year. Yet today, skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy are having second thoughts.
Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996, capped by a
surge in the second half of last year, after eight years of
economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past upward
swings in productivity typically occurred early in a recovery as
economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased hiring, it
slowed again. But something seems fundamentally different this
time, something apparently having a lot to do with the increased
speed and efficiency that the Internet and other pervasive
information-technology advances are bringing to the mundane
day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses. By Steve Lohr.

his wife's plate in a fancy restaurant, he never expected what

one little shellfish. And Walton's not alone. Chefs report

 ALLERGIC TO YOUR DINNER? Food sensitivities can make dining out 
 a nightmare  
   
   
   
 By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO  &LR; _ Tom Walton and Debby Fortune were having dinner at
Cafe Beaujolais in Mendocino when Walton, in timeless spousal
tradition, snitched a scallop from his wife's plate. Two minutes
later, he was on the floor, staring up at a crowd of concerned
faces.
<P>
   ``One advantage of having a problem in a well-to-do restaurant
is that I apparently collapsed backwards onto two doctors and a
dentist,'' recalls Walton, a Berkeley public relations
professional. The doctors sent his wife out for an antihistamine,
and Walton quickly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   His frightening faint 10 years ago was Walton's first clue that
he might have a serious food allergy, an unwarranted immune system
reaction to a harmless substance. Without testing, Walton can't be
sure that scallops are his nemesis, but he has steered clear of
them since.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor said if I wanted to experiment, I could get some
scallops and go to the emergency room and tell them why I was
there. But he thought it maybe made more sense to forgo the
scallops,'' Walton says.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts aren't sure that food allergies are on the
rise, life-threatening reactions apparently are. With Americans
debating proposed peanut bans in airplanes and schools, researchers
announced last month that they're on the verge of a treatment
breakthrough. In the meantime, those who suffer these
hypersensitive reactions say they still face too much skepticism
and ignorance _ especially in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think you'll get a sniffle or a sneeze, that it's no
big deal,` says Cherie Fehrman, a San Francisco interior designer
who is allergic to milk products and some chemical food additives.
``They don't realize you could be dead in 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs who don't understand her problem or don't take it
seriously have made restaurant-going a nightmare, Fehrman says.
``They say, `I just added a pat of butter. I couldn't believe that
could make a difference,' or `There was no butter in the dish, but
I put just a little cream.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified to eat out,'' Fehrman admits. ``I just take food
with me. I'm the one there with a glass of water and my salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Krahling, chef-owner of Insalata's in San Anselmo, admits
she erred years ago when a customer asked if a pasta sauce
contained basil. Preoccupied with orders, Krahling mistakenly said
no. The customer, who became ill, demanded compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine someone being allergic to an herb,''
Krahling says.
</P>
<P>
   A basil allergy would be unlikely but not impossible, doctors
say. ``There's not a whole lot that's unheard of,'' says Russell
Leong, M.D., a San Francisco allergist. At least 160 foods _
including kiwi fruit, caraway seeds and tomatoes _ have been
implicated in allergic reactions, but the numbers of those
reactions is exceedingly low. A mere eight foods _ milk, soy, eggs,
wheat, fish, shellfish, peanuts and tree nuts _ account for 90
percent of allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that perhaps 5 percent of children suffer from
food allergies, which they often outgrow; estimates of adult food
allergy drop to 1 percent to 2 percent. But for these unlucky few,
even a taste of the problem food can be life-threatening. One
peanut-allergic college freshman died after eating two bites of
chili that _ surprise _ contained peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   As uncommon as food allergies are, a surprisingly large number
of people believe they have them. One peer-reviewed study suggests
that more than 15 million Americans think they have food allergies,
three times the actual number. The discrepancy, experts say,
derives in part from mistaking intolerance for allergy.
</P>
<P>
   True allergic reactions involve the immune system. Exposed to a
substance it mistakenly perceives as a threat, the body makes
immunoglobulin E, or IgE, antibodies. When the person is exposed to
the food again, the antibodies attack, causing symptoms that may
range from sneezing to anaphylaxis _ a collection of severe
symptoms such as shock that can cause death in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Allergists use skin tests and blood tests to verify food
allergies. In skin testing, they scratch or prick the skin with a
liquid extract of the food in question and look for welts or hives.
In blood testing, they look for IgE antibodies to the food. Both
methods can give false positives, so a firm diagnosis may require a
double-blind food challenge, in which neither patient nor doctor
knows whether the patient is getting a placebo or the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians not trained to diagnose allergies often miss them,
allergists say. Jim Dodge, former pastry chef at the Stanford Court
hotel in San Francisco, never went back to the doctor who looked at
his severely irritated throat and accused him of having a cocaine
habit. ``How could I do cocaine with all these allergies?'' asks
Dodge, whose gradually worsening symptoms ranged from hives and
bloodshot eyes to uncontrollable sneezing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the baker took a sample of bread flour to an allergist
who performed a skin test. Dodge's skin swelled immediately. He no
longer can bake professionally and is now the food and beverage
director at a Boston museum.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dodge, allergists see many patients who suffer from food
intolerance or food idiosyncrasy, not allergy. Intolerances, such
as lactose intolerance, usually affect digestion or metabolism,
although John Scharffenberger has a different response.
</P>
<P>
   A former sparkling-wine producer in Mendocino County,
Scharffenberger can drink sparkling wine, white wine and aged red
Burgundy with impunity, but other red wines give him headaches and
acute sinusitis. His problem, an allergist told him, was
intolerance of an amino acid in red wine; Pinot Noir, the grape
used in Burgundy, has less of the amino acid than other red wines
and the acid dissipates with time.
</P>
<P>
   How many people truly suffer from wine allergy, a common
complaint? ``By the academic definition, probably none,'' says
Herbert Kaufman, M.D., a San Francisco allergist who has studied
red-wine headache.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse reactions to wine aren't uncommon, the physician says,
but they aren't allergies because they don't involve antibodies.
Kaufman theorizes the headaches are caused by wine components that
activate prostaglandins; taking a prostaglandin inhibitor such as
aspirin before drinking can prevent the headache.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are countless people who believe they are allergic to
sulfites in wine. In truth, only about 150,000 Americans are
sulfite-sensitive, researchers say. They may sneeze, wheeze or have
even more severe reactions to wine, beer, dried fruit, fruit drinks
or the many other sulfite-containing foods. According to literature
from the International Food Information Council, people who respond
adversely to sulfites or, like Fehrman, to monosodium glutamate and
food dyes, are experiencing a food idiosyncrasy, not an allergy.
</P>
<P>
   As for true food allergies, there's no proof they are on the
rise but many allergists and allergy educators believe they are.
``Schools used to have one or two students with food allergies. Now
it's not uncommon to have one or two per class,'' says Anne
Munoz-Furlong, founder of the Food Allergy Network, a nonprofit
group in Fairfax, Va. Hugh Sampson, M.D., a leading allergy
researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, says
colleagues who used to see one peanut-allergic patient in three
months now may see three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Better diagnosis may partly explain why food allergies appear to
be growing. But Munoz-Furlong believes our changing diet also plays
a role. Just one generation ago, she argues, people ate more simple
food: Dinner was a potato, another vegetable, some meat. Now, at an
early age, children consume nuts, for example, in packaged cookies,
salad toppings, trail mixes and cereals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the immune system is too immature,'' says
Munoz-Furlong, a theory Leong and other allergists echo. Especially
in families with a history of allergy, parents might be wise, they
say, to withhold peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish for a
child's first two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles allergist Gary Rachelefsky, M.D., isn't so sure food
allergies are growing, although he is definitely seeing more
patients who complain of them. In most cases, Rachelefsky says,
food is not causing the fatigue, headaches, joint pain and
discomfort that send these people in for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this story will dispel the myth that food allergies are
causing a lot of people's symptoms and that they're easy to
diagnose and treat,'' he says. ``There are a lot of doctors who do
manipulation in diets and for naught, especially in children.
They'll take kids off foods and (the kids) don't grow well. They
don't use science to evaluate them properly.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with true food allergies, the only effective
treatment is avoidance. Pollen and animal allergies often can be
moderated with desensitization shots _ injecting the patient with
ever-increasing amounts of the allergen _ but food desensitization
shots are too dangerous. The treatment itself can prompt
anaphylaxis.
</P>
<P>
   But in a medical breakthrough, Sampson and colleagues are
nearing human trials of a peanut vaccine that could be a prototype
for tackling other food allergens. Using recombinant DNA
techniques, they have identified and isolated the protein in the
peanut responsible for the reaction and altered the protein so IgE
antibodies can't bind to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to inject the responsible protein without the
possibility of anaphylactic reaction,'' Sampson says.
</P>
<P>
   Until these vaccines are approved, however, food allergy
sufferers will have to continue the avoidance routines that for
many have become second nature: the label reading, questioning and
second-guessing. Heidi Mackie, the Los Gatos mother of a 6-year-old
with tree nut allergy, calls manufacturers constantly. Do they
process their almond butter on the same line as the peanut butter?
Do they make the peanut M&AMP;M's with the same equipment as the almond
M&AMP;M's?
</P>
<P>
   When she buys cookies, cereals or canned soups, Mackie says, ``I
have to read the label each time, because they can't guarantee
they're not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   People with milk allergies avoid buying lunch meat in
delicatessens, where it may be sliced on the same machine as the
cheese. Others with allergies allow themselves to patronize only a
handful of ``safe'' restaurants, but even then they encounter
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   When Teri Stewart, a Petaluma resident allergic to peanuts,
reacted to the refried beans at a favorite restaurant, she was
stunned. ``We had gone there so many times before,'' Stewart says.
She discovered the kitchen had put peanut butter in the beans.
``They said they were experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area restaurateurs uniformly insist they want to be
accommodating, but it isn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman said we had to cut her meat on a clean cutting board
that had not been used that day,'' recalls Lissa cq &LR; Doumani of
Terra in St. Helena. ``The steak couldn't be grilled because other
things had been on the grill. The knives had to be cleaned.
Everything had to be uncontaminated by everything else. She came
here thinking, `With the reputation you have, you will take care of
me.' I don't know who I would trust if I was that allergic.''
</P>
<P>
   Doumani herself can't eat cilantro and regularly has frustrating
encounters with waiters. Still, she believes some customers abuse
the allergy excuse just to get their way. ``They'll say, `I can't
eat any fats,' so you struggle to make up a tasty dish, and then
they order chocolate mousse for dessert. Did I miss something
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs agree that allergy claims are on the rise in their
restaurants, and that the special requests frequently don't make
sense. ``Oh, yes,'' says Hubert Keller, chef at Fleur de Lys in San
Francisco. ``People have developed some complicated and strange
allergies over the last few years.'' Recently, a customer who said
she was extremely allergic to olive oil objected when the waiter
said the kitchen would leave the olives off her dish. No need for
that, she said; she loves olives.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Doumani added a line to the menu asking diners to
advise waiters of food restrictions before ordering. ``They never
tell you until they get the food,'' fumes Doumani, citing a recent
customer who failed to announce her allergy to sesame seeds until
her sesame seed-sprinkled sea bass arrived. ``Whatever profit you
make on a dish, you've just lost. When I go to a restaurant, I say
to the waiter, `If I order anything with cilantro, stop me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz-Furlong would like to see restaurateurs do a better job of
training their staffs to take food allergies seriously. Waiters and
cooks should know that a reaction can be deadly, that ``just a
little'' of a problem ingredient isn't OK and that it's much better
to admit they don't know what's in a dish than to say it's probably
safe. Chefs, for their part, should be aware of the most common
allergens and avoid using them unannounced in unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   If more food-service professionals and manufacturers understood
food allergies better, their allergic customers might be able to
eat with less fear. As it is, mealtimes are often anxious moments.
``For someone who had not had to restrict his diet in any way, it
was a different perspective,'' Walton says of his adult-onset
allergy. ``Now you have to second-guess what you put in your
mouth.''

 AT THE SOURCE: A Cuke of a Special Stripe  
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The Ferry Plaza cucumber guy. That's what some
people call Nick Atallah.
 &HT;    At this farmers' market in San Francisco _ and at nine other
markets in the Bay Area and around Sacramento, the Lebanese-born
Atallah and his wife, Jane, sell a top-quality edible-skin cucumber
he has dubbed ``Mediterranean''.
 &HT;    ``This is the cucumber I grew up with,'' Atallah says of the
inch-wide, 5-to-6-inch-long seedless cuke. ``When I came here,
Jordanians called it the Jordanian cucumber, Egyptians called it
the Egyptian cucumber, Israelis called it the Israeli cucumber, and
Iranians said, `No, no, no, this is the Persian cucumber.' So I
decided to call it the Mediterranean cucumber to please everyone.''
 &HT;    Not only is he a culinary diplomat, but when it comes to cukes,
Atallah _ who holds a doctorate in water resources engineering from
the University of California at Davis and has raised cucumbers
since 1986 _ is also an agricultural perfectionist.
 &HT;    Atallah grows his Mediterranean cucumbers in greenhouses at his
farm, Madison Growers, in Yolo County. The greenhouse extends the
season and controls the environment so the cucumbers mature with
optimum flavor, crispness and shape.
 &HT;    He trellises the vines and trains them to grow seven feet up. As
the cucumbers develop, they dangle down through the foliage,
growing straight _ not crooked. He harvests 75,000 pounds of cukes
a season, which he claims is small in the commercial scheme of
things.
 &HT;    Come harvest time _ now through October, with peak from June
through September _ Atallah and four workers hand pick the cukes
``at the exact point of ripeness,'' he says. ``We pick them today
and sell them tomorrow.''.
 &HT;    At 5 to 6 inches long, ``crispness and texture are best. When
the cucumber is longer than 6 inches, you can cut a cross section
and see the center start to hollow. This means the cucumber is
starting to overmature,'' he says.
 &HT;    Atallah's cucumbers are not organic according to state
regulations because he uses a commercial fertilizer. But he forgos
all pesticides, relying instead on beneficial insects in the
greenhouse environment to control pests.
 &HT;    Atallah's Mediterranean cucumber has a thin, medium to dark
green skin, which, unlike some other cucumbers, isn't washed,
treated with chemicals or waxed after harvest. ``Because the skin
is so thin, you can eat this cucumber whole. You can pick one up at
the market and eat it right there,'' he says, laughing.
 &HT;    Want to? You'll find Jane Atallah at a stand at the Ferry Plaza
Farmers' Market in San Francisco on Saturdays, and at the Thursday
and Saturday farmers' markets at the Marin Civic Center.
 &HT;    Atallah's Mediterranean cucumber is also sold at Monterey Market
(1550 Hopkins St., Berkeley) and Hatam (821 B St., San Rafael). The
Atallahs also grow greenhouse tomatoes, peppers, Japanese
cucumbers, pot basil and French Charentais melons, which they sell
at their stand in season.
 &HT;      
  
 
 HOT TIPS ON COOL CUCUMBERS  
 
Here are some tips for handling and using Mediterranean cucumbers. &HT;    Five or six Mediterranean cucumbers make up a pound. To store
them, wrap them in paper towels (which absorb the cucumbers'
moisture), then in plastic bags, and refrigerate them up to 10
days.
 &HT;    Nick Atallah's Mediterranean cucumber is ideal for cutting into
spears for dipping as an hors d'oeuvre and for slicing and chopping
in salads. Because the skins are edible, they're perfect for Greek
salads.

 GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN: Try These Appealing Cucumber Recipes  
   
 By Georgeanne Brennan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Here are a few intriguing ways to use Mediterranean cucumbers. The
recipes also will work with hothouse (English) or regular
cucumbers.
<P>
   &UR; Braised Cucumbers with Dill.  &LR; Peel cucumbers, if desired, and
halve them lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds, then cut the cucumbers
into thin slices. Saute in melted butter for about 1 minute. Add a
little chicken broth and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer. Sprinkle
with minced dill. Serve warm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cucumber and Onion Salad.  &LR; Peel cucumbers if desired, and
thinly slice. Add thinly sliced onion. Put the cucumbers and onions
in a bowl of ice water and let soak for 20 minutes. Drain and pat
dry. Place in a bowl and add rice wine vinegar, a little salt and
chopped cilantro. Chill before serving..
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cucumbers with Goat Cheese and Tapenade.  &LR; Cut cucumbers into
thin slices. Spread each slice with a little tapenade, top with a
dollop of soft goat cheese and garnish with minced red onion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cucumber, Dried Tomato and Yogurt Salad.  &LR; Cut a cucumber in
half lengthwise. Peel (if desired) and seed it. Sprinkle with a
little salt and place the halves face-down on paper towels. Wipe
off the salt with more paper towels, then grate the cucumber.
</P>
<P>
   Mince about 1 tablespoon dried tomatoes. Roast a little cumin
seed in a frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the grated cucumber, tomatoes, cumin, 1 cup plain
yogurt, about 1 tablespoon minced fresh mint, a dash of cayenne and
salt to taste. Cover and refrigerate for an hour. Serve chilled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cucumbers with Tomato and Stilton.  &LR; Peel cucumbers, if desired,
then cube them. Cut tomatoes into wedges. Mince red onions.
</P>
<P>
   Combine about 2 or 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil with an
ounce or so of Stilton cheese, a little red wine vinegar and
pepper. Mash together, but leave the cheese still a little lumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Put the cucumbers, tomatoes and a little onion in a bowl. Pour
the olive oil mixture over them and turn to coat.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange red leaf or other lettuce leaves on a platter; add the
cucumber mixture, crumble more Stilton over the top and sprinkle
with the remaining red onion.

 &HT;    OFFICIALS: LOOTERS MAKE DROPPING FOOD AID IN DIFFICULT
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REFUGEES-0414; KOSOVO-STRIKES-0414.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ In a sign of how difficult it is to coordinate
a refugee crisis on a foggy day, two U.S. Navy helicopters on
Tuesday unloaded six tons of food aid at the wrong airstrip -- only
to have it looted by enterprising mountain people in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen boxes of food weighed about six tons -- enough to
feed about 10,000 of the roughly 95,000 refugees in this border
town for one day. UN officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the theft will not cause hunger in the refugee
camps because they have sufficient stockpiles of other food, at
least for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials confirmed Tuesday that the helicopters were
sent from the USS Inchon, a mine countermeasures ship stationed in
the Adriatic Sea that has been running humanitarian supplies into
Albania over the last two days. Since early Tuesday morning, they
said the ship had delivered more than 66,000 pounds of daily
rations in over two dozen helicopter flights.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials had no information on Tuesday's specific
incident of looting supplies, but no one ruled it out as
implausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of looters in that area,'' Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth H. Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   UN aid officials here learned of the episode Tuesday when the
American pilots of the two Navy helicopters made their way to the
office of the UN's World Food Program on the fourth floor of the
Hotel Turizmi, asking to use a satellite phone to call their
commanding officers.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots told a UN duty officer that they landed on this
drizzly day at an Albanian military airstrip located about two
miles south of this refugee-packed border town.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots said they had flown from an American carrier in the
Adriatic and had been directed where to bring the food by air
controllers at the Rinas Air Field in the Albanian capital of
Tirana, whose control tower has come under the direction of U.S.
Air Force air controllers within the last 48 hours. The pilots
didn't give the name of the carrier on which they are based.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials said they were told that one Navy chopper set down
just inside the boundaries of the Albanian base and the other
landed in a field just outside the boundaries. The site is known as
the Meteor Air Base, according to Albanians interviewed on the
scene.

   Navy personnel aboard the copters managed to unload about six
tons of food. But there were no security guards to protect the
cargo, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, many people showed up and began carting away the
food, the Navy pilots told UN officials. UN World Food Program
officials said the cardboard boxes of food never reached the
agency's warehouses in Kukes, although some of it may have reached
Kosovo refugees.

 EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with  enough
leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes 
 plus suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow, plus 
 suggestions in optional trim.   THE WEEKEND COOK: Pass Up the Loin Chops and Go for the Shoulder  
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ A request for pork chops for this column led the
Food Department down an interesting path of collaboration. As often
happens when people brainstorm an idea, no one can predict the
results and what does come up in the end can be a happy surprise
for all. It happened to us with today's Quick Cook.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pork chops are versatile, relatively inexpensive and popular.
But they present a problem for developing recipes that result in
leftovers. Because modern pork is so lean, saving leftovers for use
throughout the week could result in overly dry meat.
</P>
<P>
   My challenge: Choose the most suitable pork chop and cooking
method to make the request work.
</P>
<P>
   My solution: Bypass the lean and lovely loin chops, and choose a
fattier chop to keep the meat tender. Use a moist heat cooking
method to further minimize the danger of drying out the meat.
</P>
<P>
   I chose a shoulder chop (also called a bone-in shoulder blade
steak), which the butcher cut an inch thick for me. Then I braised
the chops in Zinfandel, which pairs well with pork.
Serendipitously, the richly flavored liquid that resulted has many
other uses.
</P>
<P>
   With spring here, I decided to serve the chops with a rhubarb
compote. But the color of the available variety of rhubarb was a
psychedelic purple-pink when cooked, so a staff member suggested
taming the tone with apples. That worked _ I used just enough apple
to mute the color but keep the integrity of the rhubarb's flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Another co-worker suggested serving the chops with polenta to
soak up the deeply flavored braising sauce. Extra polenta could
also be used later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   For the polenta, we used a recipe from `'The San Francisco
Chronicle Cookbook.'' This oven-baked soft polenta, devised by chef
Gary Danko, cooks almost by itself.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, a Food Section intern developed the recipe for the
weeknight baked polenta.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the pieces of one idea building upon others gelled into a
whole. What's more, leftover pork, polenta, rhubarb compote and
fragrant braising liquid are wonderful in easy combinations to use
during the week.

 &UR; MASTER RECIPE: PORK CHOPS BRAISED IN ZINFANDEL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   8 pork shoulder blade steaks, each about 1-11/4 pounds and 1
inch thick
</P>
<P>
   13/4 teaspoons salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 large onions, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 (750ml) bottles Zinfandel
</P>
<P>
   12 small sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the pork steaks in half. (One half will contain the bone,
the other will be boneless.) Season lightly with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large Dutch oven over high
heat until the oil ripples. Add the onions and 1/4 teaspoon salt;
saute, stirring constantly for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and
saute, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden, about 20
minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Return the pan to the heat. Deglaze with 1 cup of the wine,
scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan, then add to
the onions.
</P>
<P>
   Wipe out the pan and return it to high heat. Add the remaining
tablespoon oil. When it ripples, add the chops (work in batches)
and saute until golden, 11/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the
chops to a bowl as they are browned and continue with the remaining
chops.
</P>
<P>
   When all the pork has been browned, discard any excess fat and
return the pan to high heat. Deglaze with 1 cup wine; boil for 30
seconds. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Spread half of the onions in the pan. Add two layers of chops,
and half of the thyme. Spread the remaining onions over the chops.
Layer in the remaining chops and top with the remaining thyme. Pour
in any accumulated pork juices and the remaining wine. The wine
should just cover the chops. Add 11/4 teaspoons salt. Cover and
bring to a boil over high heat, skim the fat and froth, cover,
reduce heat and simmer until the meat is cooked through and tender,
30 to 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the meat to a bowl; cover and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the cooking liquid, pressing gently on the onions.
Discard the thyme. Reserve the onions. Degrease the liquid. There
should be about 7 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Return 3 cups of the liquid and half of the onions to the pan.
Simmer for 3 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper, if
necessary. Add 4 to 6 pieces of pork, depending on size; baste the
meat with the liquid, reduce heat and simmer for 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Portion the meat onto plates. Ladle some of the
liquid and onions around the meat. Add spoonfuls of Rhubarb-Apple
Compote and Soft Polenta (see recipes)
</P>
<P>
   Cool the remaining liquid to room temperature, cover and
refrigerate for use throughout the week. (If there is chilled fat
on top, remove and discard it before using.) Let the onions and
remaining pork cool to room temperature, pack into separate
containers, cover tightly and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4, with leftovers.

 &UR; WEEKEND RECIPE: RHUBARB-APPLE COMPOTE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds rhubarb, trimmed, cut into 3/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound red-skinned baking apples (such as Rome Beauty),
cored, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat, stirring
occasionally, until the sugar melts. Stir in the rhubarb, apples
and salt. Cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 2 minutes. Uncover
and boil hard for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high. Simmer the
mixture briskly, stirring once or twice, until the fruit is
thickened and the bubbles breaking on the surface have a
``heaving'' sound, about 15 minutes. Stir in the cayenne pepper. If
desired, break up the apple chunks a little with a wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Serve about 1/2 cup of the warm compote with the pork chops. Let
the remaining compote cool to room temperature, then cover and
refrigerate it for use throughout the week.

 &UR; More Ideas for Leftovers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Leftover pork and its braising liquid pave the way for numerous
weekday dishes:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stewed Pork and Pinto Beans. &LR;  Saute chopped onions, garlic and
green pepper for 5 minutes. Season with chile powder; saute for 30
seconds. Add some pork braising liquid and a generous amount of
chopped braised pork. Simmer for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add a can of drained, rinsed pinto beans. Simmer for 10 minutes.
Season to taste. Mixture should be slightly soupy. Serve with rice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Meaty Onion Soup. &LR;  The pork braising liquid makes fabulous
onion soup. Heat a few cups of it and as much onion as possible in
a medium-size saucepan.
</P>
<P>
   Toast thick sourdough croutons topped with grated Swiss cheese
until the cheese melts and is bubbly. Place 1 or 2 croutons in each
soup bowl. Ladle the braising liquid over the croutons. Sprinkle
with freshly ground pepper. Serve with additional grated cheese, if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Double-Duty Sauce &LR; . Make double the amount of Pork-Zinfandel
Sauce (Master Recipe). Save half of it to toss with pasta or to
spoon over twice-baked potatoes, rice pilaf or mashed sweet
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pork and Beet Salad with Zinfandel Vinaigrette. &LR;  Reduce 1/2 cup
of the pork braising liquid to 3 tablespoons over high heat. Cool
briefly. Combine the reduction with 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar.
Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in 6 tablespoons olive oil. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Dice some braised pork, then combine it with double the amount
of diced beets, some thinly sliced celery and chopped scallions.
Toss with most of the dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the remaining dressing with frisee lettuce. Arrange the
frisee on plates and pile the pork mixture on top. Garnish with
chopped pecans and crumbled blue cheese.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Never-Too-Much Rhubarb. &LR;  Use the leftover rhubarb for dessert:
Heat it and spoon over vanilla ice cream; serve cold topped with
sour cream or spoon it over rice pudding; fold together equal
amounts of rhubarb and vanilla-scented whipped cream, then layer
with ladyfingers in parfait glasses.

 Cliff House Still Charms Guests and Ghosts  
   
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO  &LR; _ We often hear that a restaurant can create a
certain mood. At the Cliff House in San Francisco, the mood is as
mercurial as the weather.
<P>
   When the sun shines on the Pacific Ocean and the water sparkles
a picture-postcard blue, the view from a window table of the Cliff
House, perched 100 feet above the ocean, can make even the most
desolate soul feel happy.
</P>
<P>
   But when a storm rages and wind and rain thrash its rocky perch,
the Cliff House feels like an excitingly dangerous bastion on the
western edge of a foggy gray continent. One can almost see ghosts
of the Cliff House's past rising with the whitecaps below _ and
there are many ghosts who could tell a tale of this restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Cliff House has perched in the same location for 136 years.
In 1863, the first Cliff House was built as a dining establishment
for well-to-do travelers, among them prominent San Francisco
families and three U.S. presidents. In 1881, wealthy businessman
and later San Francisco mayor Adolph Sutro bought the property and
the adjacent 80 acres to develop a seaside attraction: ocean-fed
public swimming pools called Sutro Baths.
</P>
<P>
   The Cliff House burned down on Christmas Day, 1894, so Sutro
rebuilt _ this time a haughty eight-story French chateau-style
structure crowned with an observatory. In 1907, it, too, met its
demise by fire. Two years later, Sutro's daughter, Emma Sutro
Merritt, rebuilt it, choosing a smaller, sturdier, more modest
structure of neoclassic design. This third incarnation stands today
as the central part of the Cliff House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Emma's son sold the Cliff House to George Whitney, a
developer who, in turn, sold it to the National Park Service in
1977. The ruins of the adjoining Sutro Baths, which burned in 1966,
became part of the Park Service property in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The public considered Sutro's chateau ``an eyesore, too
grandiose. The Park Service has accounts of people clapping when
they saw it burn to the ground,'' says Michael Hountalas, general
manager of the Cliff House and vice president of the concessionaire
for the establishment's two restaurants, gift shop and other food
and beverage outlets. Hountalas assumed the day-to-day operations
in 1993 from his father and stepmother, Dan and Mary, who had run
the Cliff House for the previous 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cliff House was rebuilt in 1907, public reaction was
mixed, says Hountalas. ``Some people liked it. Some people said it
looked like a pill box.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cliff House has always operated as a restaurant. ``It was
never a hotel. That's a common misconception. Although there were
some rooms that could be leased. With a lady friend. Whom one might
have just met,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really a bordello out here. There were just some
seedy times for the Cliff House before 1881. Sutro cleaned all that
up. He was speculating that the whole area could be turned into a
destination for San Franciscans and visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the entry level dining room (named the Sea Food and
Beverage Co.), with huge windows overlooking the Pacific, a dark
wood and green color scheme, framed photos of celebrity guests and
Art Deco accents); two adjoining bars (the Phineas T. Barnacle and
the Ben Butler); and a more modest restaurant upstairs are the main
dining and drinking establishments.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as Hountalas can remember, the Cliff House has been
known for its seafood and steak menu sporting some classic San
Francisco dishes. Crab is an especially strong seller. ``We can't
take the Crab Louis off the menu,'' says Hountalas, who claims a
customer even called his father at home when they tried to.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the kitchen has updated the menu, cutting
back the fried fish dishes, increasing the use of fresh herbs,
sauteed and broiled fish preparations and giving an Asian influence
to some dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Come 2001, the Cliff House will undergo even more changes _ an
$8 million to $10 million renovation to restore the property to its
1909 appearance. The two-year renovation will affect every part of
the structure, proceeding in stages so the restaurants can remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that won't be renovated is the view. On a clear day,
it extends due west past conical-shaped Arch Rock _ seemingly at
arm's reach from the dining room windows _ to the Farallon Islands,
south beyond the sweep of Ocean Beach and north to the round of
mainland called Land's End.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get whales and wild sea lions coming between us and Arch
Rock. We can't turn the window tables,'' Hountalassays. ``Customers
stay forever.''

 TASTER'S CHOICE: The Best Blueberry Waffles Skimp on Fat  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  On recent trips to grocery stores, we noticed
seven different frozen blueberry waffles. The panel has tasted
waffles (Kellogg's Eggo brand took top honors in 1995) but never
the blueberry variety.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's tasting included one low-fat and one wheat-free.
Surprisingly, the low-fat waffle was the panel's favorite, and the
wheat-free came in third, over perhaps the best-known brand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway Select Healthy Advantage &LR;  (eight waffles in the
10.2-ounce box for $2.49 at Safeway) significantly outscored the
other waffles. These have 3 grams of fat per serving vs. the 7 to 9
grams in most of the other brands. Three tasters commented on the
good blueberry flavor, and one liked the crisp but moist texture.
Others found the waffle bland and mushy. Four would buy it; one
might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The only organic brand came in second:  &UR; Van's  &LR; (six waffles in
the 8-ounce box for $2.59 at Whole Foods). Two panelists wanted
more blueberry flavor, while two others liked the amount of
blueberry. One panelist particularly liked the texture. Three would
buy it, one might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to &UR; Waffle Heaven &LR;  (six waffles in the 11-ounce
box for $2.59 at Real Foods), the only wheat-free, gluten-free,
dairy-free waffle the panel sampled. Two panelists liked the
crunchy texture, but others thought it was too hard. Three disliked
the artificial blueberry flavor. One would buy it, one might buy
it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were divided on  &UR; Kellogg's Eggo  &LR; (10 waffles in the
12.3-ounce box for $2.29-$2.39 at many supermarkets), which scored
only one point lower than Waffle Heaven. Panelists thought the
waffle was too crunchy; one described it as tasting like a waffle
ice cream cone. Others disliked the artificial yellow color, but
two liked the flavor. One would buy it, two might buy it, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (eight waffles in the 11-ounce box for $1.69 at
Trader Joe's) came in fifth. Panelists liked the appearance but
described the flavor as strange and fake. Two might buy it; three
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Two waffles scored too low to rate: Krusteaz and Safeway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: 4 Divine Layers Build This Chocolate Cake  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  German chocolate cake is a classic, but Mary Jo
Thoresen, who oversees the pastry kitchens at both Enrico's and
U.S. Restaurant, has improved this ever-popular cake.
<TEXT>
<P>
   She creates four layers of moist, finely textured cake and
spreads each with a rum glaze and the gooey coconut pecan mixture.
Then, when she finishes assembling the layers, she caps it all with
rich chocolate icing.
</P>
<P>
   With all these layers, she gives people what they crave: the
buttery, candylike filling. It's so delicious, you simply can't
stop eating it.
</P>
<P>
   This classic cake is part of the dessert offerings at U.S.
Restaurant, a 100-year-old North Beach institution that was revived
and remodeled last year by the partners who also run Enrico's. At
U.S. _ which stands for Unione Sportivo _ the aim is to serve
hearty Italian/American food to a local crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The standard pastas and main courses are always on the menu, but
there are also two regular daily specials, and loyal customers know
when their favorites will appear, like pot roast every Wednesday.
But whether it's pot roast, lamb shanks or roast lemon chicken, the
highlight of the meal will be Thoresen's desserts.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  U.S. Restaurant, 431 Columbus Ave. (at Stockton), San &LR;

   3 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pecans, toasted and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   11/3 cups unsweetened shredded coconut, lightly toasted
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Syrup &LR;
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   Rum to taste
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chocolate Icing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   11/2 ounces unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   Instructions: &QL; 
 &UR; To make the cake:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter two
9-inch cake pans and line them with baker's parchment, including a
collar around the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the unsweetened and semi-sweet chocolates and the water
in the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water. Stir
occasionally until the chocolate melts. Let cool.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and 11/4 cups of the
sugar until light and fluffy. Slowly mix in the melted chocolate.
Add the egg yolks 1 at a time, mixing thoroughly after each
addition.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk and
vanilla to the chocolate mixture.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate bowl and using clean beaters, beat the egg whites
until foamy. Add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a
time, beating until the whites hold medium-firm peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the egg whites into the batter. Pour the batter into the
cake pans.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the
cakes comes out clean. Place the pans on a rack and let cool
completely.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the filling:  &LR; Combine the heavy cream, sugar and egg
yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir
constantly until the mixture reaches 170 degrees F (approximately
10 minutes). Remove from heat and pour through a fine strainer into
a bowl. Stir in the butter, salt, toasted pecans and coconut. Cool
to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the syrup:  &LR; Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan
and heat just until the sugar dissolves. Let cool to room
temperature, then stir in rum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the icing:  &LR; Place the chocolate in a heat-proof bowl.
Heat the cream and pour it over the chocolate. Add the corn syrup
and butter and stir (not whisk) until smooth. Cool to a spreadable
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble the cake:  &LR; Turn the cooled cakes out of their pans.
Carefully peel off the parchment. Using a long, serrated knife,
carefully cut each cake into two layers. Divide the filling into 4
equal parts. Place the bottom layer on a plate, brush lightly with
the rum syrup. Spread one quarter of the filling on the layer,
spreading it all the way to the edges of the cake. Place a second
layer on top and repeat the process. Continue until all 4 layers
are stacked and frosted. Spread the chocolate icing on the sides of
the cake.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, put some icing in a pastry bag fitted with a tip of
your choice and pipe a border around the perimeter of the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate until chilled before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 to 10.

AIR FORCE SEEKS TO BOOST CRUISE MISSILE INVENTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Air Force's inventory of cruise missiles has
been so depleted by the Kosovo crisis and operations in Iraq that
the service will soon start a $52 million program to convert some
of its fleet of nuclear-capable cruise missiles into conventional
weapons, military officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has given a high priority to boosting stocks of the
Air Launched Cruise Missile following recent military operations in
which over half the inventory was depleted, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has fired hundreds of Tomahawks _ cruise missiles
launched from ships and submarines _ in attacks on Iraq and
Yugoslavia, but has a large inventory of about 2,000 missiles
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Office of Management and Budget recently
approved an Air Force proposal to remove the nuclear warhead from
92 cruise missiles and fit them with conventional explosives. The
cost of converting the missiles is about $565,000 per missile, half
the price of a new version.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force hasn't purchased a new Air Launched Cruise Missile
since the late 1980s and converted nuclear variants through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But any additional converted missiles wouldn't be available for
more than a year because Seattle-based Boeing Co., the missile's
manufacturer, would require at least that much time to reopen a
shuttered assembly line. Once up and running, the production line
would yield about 12 refurbished missiles per month, the Air Force
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Kennett, a spokesman for Boeing, said the company was
``working closely with Air Force officials on this issue and stands
ready to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the shortage is stepped-up military operations.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of allied aerial attacks against Iraq in December,
the Air Force had about 240 Air Force cruise missiles but fired 90
during four days of raids, said an Air Force official who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   By the time NATO began attacks against Yugoslavia on March 24,
the Air Force was down to 150 missiles, which are fired by B-52H
bombers. It is unclear how many the Air Force has launched thus far
in the conflict, but estimates are that the inventory has dipped
well below 100 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Among military planners and political leaders, satellite- or
computer-guided cruise missiles are a favored weapon for attacking
heavily defended targets because they are highly accurate but don't
put pilots and costly aircraft into harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   David Ochmanek, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corp.,
which has performed numerous in-depth studies for the Air Force on
air power, said experts long have advised the service to buy more
of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take long to run through an inventory of a couple
hundred cruise missiles against a country like Yugoslavia,''
Ochmanek said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Bacon, the senior Pentagon spokesman, acknowledged
earlier this month that the Air Force inventory was low.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we do worry about. We have a supply now, but
it won't last forever,'' he said. ``We certainly have enough to
continue striking important targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Air Force expends all of its cruise missiles in
Yugoslavia, Ochmanek said the Navy has sufficient numbers of
Tomahawks that can perform similar duties, although those missiles
have a shorter range and less punch.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Meaghan Mariman, a Navy spokeswoman, said the service fired
from ships 330 Tomahawks against Iraq in December, more than 100
against targets in Yugoslavia and still has about 2,000 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to see a cruise missile shortage as
necessarily having a big impact on this operation,'' Ochmanek said.
``It may, however, have negative implications for the next
operation, wherever that may be fought.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is considering a program to upgrade older-model
Tomahawks with more accurate guidance systems and more powerful
warheads, but no new missiles are planned until at least 2003.

 ALLERGIC TO YOUR DINNER? Food sensitivities can make dining out 
 a nightmare  
   
   
   
 By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO  &LR; _ Tom Walton and Debby Fortune were having dinner at
Cafe Beaujolais in Mendocino when Walton, in timeless spousal
tradition, snitched a scallop from his wife's plate. Two minutes
later, he was on the floor, staring up at a crowd of concerned
faces.
<P>
   ``One advantage of having a problem in a well-to-do restaurant
is that I apparently collapsed backwards onto two doctors and a
dentist,'' recalls Walton, a Berkeley public relations
professional. The doctors sent his wife out for an antihistamine,
and Walton quickly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   His frightening faint 10 years ago was Walton's first clue that
he might have a serious food allergy, an unwarranted immune system
reaction to a harmless substance. Without testing, Walton can't be
sure that scallops are his nemesis, but he has steered clear of
them since.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor said if I wanted to experiment, I could get some
scallops and go to the emergency room and tell them why I was
there. But he thought it maybe made more sense to forgo the
scallops,'' Walton says.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts aren't sure that food allergies are on the
rise, life-threatening reactions apparently are. With Americans
debating proposed peanut bans in airplanes and schools, researchers
announced last month that they're on the verge of a treatment
breakthrough. In the meantime, those who suffer these
hypersensitive reactions say they still face too much skepticism
and ignorance _ especially in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think you'll get a sniffle or a sneeze, that it's no
big deal,` says Cherie Fehrman, a San Francisco interior designer
who is allergic to milk products and some chemical food additives.
``They don't realize you could be dead in 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs who don't understand her problem or don't take it
seriously have made restaurant-going a nightmare, Fehrman says.
``They say, `I just added a pat of butter. I couldn't believe that
could make a difference,' or `There was no butter in the dish, but
I put just a little cream.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terrified to eat out,'' Fehrman admits. ``I just take food
with me. I'm the one there with a glass of water and my salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Krahling, chef-owner of Insalata's in San Anselmo, admits
she erred years ago when a customer asked if a pasta sauce
contained basil. Preoccupied with orders, Krahling mistakenly said
no. The customer, who became ill, demanded compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine someone being allergic to an herb,''
Krahling says.
</P>
<P>
   A basil allergy would be unlikely but not impossible, doctors
say. ``There's not a whole lot that's unheard of,'' says Russell
Leong, M.D., a San Francisco allergist. At least 160 foods _
including kiwi fruit, caraway seeds and tomatoes _ have been
implicated in allergic reactions, but the numbers of those
reactions is exceedingly low. A mere eight foods _ milk, soy, eggs,
wheat, fish, shellfish, peanuts and tree nuts _ account for 90
percent of allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that perhaps 5 percent of children suffer from
food allergies, which they often outgrow; estimates of adult food
allergy drop to 1 percent to 2 percent. But for these unlucky few,
even a taste of the problem food can be life-threatening. One
peanut-allergic college freshman died after eating two bites of
chili that _ surprise _ contained peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   As uncommon as food allergies are, a surprisingly large number
of people believe they have them. One peer-reviewed study suggests
that more than 15 million Americans think they have food allergies,
three times the actual number. The discrepancy, experts say,
derives in part from mistaking intolerance for allergy.
</P>
<P>
   True allergic reactions involve the immune system. Exposed to a
substance it mistakenly perceives as a threat, the body makes
immunoglobulin E, or IgE, antibodies. When the person is exposed to
the food again, the antibodies attack, causing symptoms that may
range from sneezing to anaphylaxis _ a collection of severe
symptoms such as shock that can cause death in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Allergists use skin tests and blood tests to verify food
allergies. In skin testing, they scratch or prick the skin with a
liquid extract of the food in question and look for welts or hives.
In blood testing, they look for IgE antibodies to the food. Both
methods can give false positives, so a firm diagnosis may require a
double-blind food challenge, in which neither patient nor doctor
knows whether the patient is getting a placebo or the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians not trained to diagnose allergies often miss them,
allergists say. Jim Dodge, former pastry chef at the Stanford Court
hotel in San Francisco, never went back to the doctor who looked at
his severely irritated throat and accused him of having a cocaine
habit. ``How could I do cocaine with all these allergies?'' asks
Dodge, whose gradually worsening symptoms ranged from hives and
bloodshot eyes to uncontrollable sneezing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the baker took a sample of bread flour to an allergist
who performed a skin test. Dodge's skin swelled immediately. He no
longer can bake professionally and is now the food and beverage
director at a Boston museum.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dodge, allergists see many patients who suffer from food
intolerance or food idiosyncrasy, not allergy. Intolerances, such
as lactose intolerance, usually affect digestion or metabolism,
although John Scharffenberger has a different response.
</P>
<P>
   A former sparkling-wine producer in Mendocino County,
Scharffenberger can drink sparkling wine, white wine and aged red
Burgundy with impunity, but other red wines give him headaches and
acute sinusitis. His problem, an allergist told him, was
intolerance of an amino acid in red wine; Pinot Noir, the grape
used in Burgundy, has less of the amino acid than other red wines
and the acid dissipates with time.
</P>
<P>
   How many people truly suffer from wine allergy, a common
complaint? ``By the academic definition, probably none,'' says
Herbert Kaufman, M.D., a San Francisco allergist who has studied
red-wine headache.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse reactions to wine aren't uncommon, the physician says,
but they aren't allergies because they don't involve antibodies.
Kaufman theorizes the headaches are caused by wine components that
activate prostaglandins; taking a prostaglandin inhibitor such as
aspirin before drinking can prevent the headache.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are countless people who believe they are allergic to
sulfites in wine. In truth, only about 150,000 Americans are
sulfite-sensitive, researchers say. They may sneeze, wheeze or have
even more severe reactions to wine, beer, dried fruit, fruit drinks
or the many other sulfite-containing foods. According to literature
from the International Food Information Council, people who respond
adversely to sulfites or, like Fehrman, to monosodium glutamate and
food dyes, are experiencing a food idiosyncrasy, not an allergy.
</P>
<P>
   As for true food allergies, there's no proof they are on the
rise but many allergists and allergy educators believe they are.
``Schools used to have one or two students with food allergies. Now
it's not uncommon to have one or two per class,'' says Anne
Munoz-Furlong, founder of the Food Allergy Network, a nonprofit
group in Fairfax, Va. Hugh Sampson, M.D., a leading allergy
researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, says
colleagues who used to see one peanut-allergic patient in three
months now may see three a day.
</P>
<P>
   Better diagnosis may partly explain why food allergies appear to
be growing. But Munoz-Furlong believes our changing diet also plays
a role. Just one generation ago, she argues, people ate more simple
food: Dinner was a potato, another vegetable, some meat. Now, at an
early age, children consume nuts, for example, in packaged cookies,
salad toppings, trail mixes and cereals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the immune system is too immature,'' says
Munoz-Furlong, a theory Leong and other allergists echo. Especially
in families with a history of allergy, parents might be wise, they
say, to withhold peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish for a
child's first two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles allergist Gary Rachelefsky, M.D., isn't so sure food
allergies are growing, although he is definitely seeing more
patients who complain of them. In most cases, Rachelefsky says,
food is not causing the fatigue, headaches, joint pain and
discomfort that send these people in for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this story will dispel the myth that food allergies are
causing a lot of people's symptoms and that they're easy to
diagnose and treat,'' he says. ``There are a lot of doctors who do
manipulation in diets and for naught, especially in children.
They'll take kids off foods and (the kids) don't grow well. They
don't use science to evaluate them properly.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with true food allergies, the only effective
treatment is avoidance. Pollen and animal allergies often can be
moderated with desensitization shots _ injecting the patient with
ever-increasing amounts of the allergen _ but food desensitization
shots are too dangerous. The treatment itself can prompt
anaphylaxis.
</P>
<P>
   But in a medical breakthrough, Sampson and colleagues are
nearing human trials of a peanut vaccine that could be a prototype
for tackling other food allergens. Using recombinant DNA
techniques, they have identified and isolated the protein in the
peanut responsible for the reaction and altered the protein so IgE
antibodies can't bind to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to inject the responsible protein without the
possibility of anaphylactic reaction,'' Sampson says.
</P>
<P>
   Until these vaccines are approved, however, food allergy
sufferers will have to continue the avoidance routines that for
many have become second nature: the label reading, questioning and
second-guessing. Heidi Mackie, the Los Gatos mother of a 6-year-old
with tree nut allergy, calls manufacturers constantly. Do they
process their almond butter on the same line as the peanut butter?
Do they make the peanut M&AMP;M's with the same equipment as the almond
M&AMP;M's?

   When she buys cookies, cereals or canned soups, Mackie says, ``I
have to read the label each time, because they can't guarantee
they're not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   People with milk allergies avoid buying lunch meat in
delicatessens, where it may be sliced on the same machine as the
cheese. Others with allergies allow themselves to patronize only a
handful of ``safe'' restaurants, but even then they encounter
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   When Teri Stewart, a Petaluma resident allergic to peanuts,
reacted to the refried beans at a favorite restaurant, she was
stunned. ``We had gone there so many times before,'' Stewart says.
She discovered the kitchen had put peanut butter in the beans.
``They said they were experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area restaurateurs uniformly insist they want to be
accommodating, but it isn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman said we had to cut her meat on a clean cutting board
that had not been used that day,'' recalls Lissa cq &LR; Doumani of
Terra in St. Helena. ``The steak couldn't be grilled because other
things had been on the grill. The knives had to be cleaned.
Everything had to be uncontaminated by everything else. She came
here thinking, `With the reputation you have, you will take care of
me.' I don't know who I would trust if I was that allergic.''
</P>
<P>
   Doumani herself can't eat cilantro and regularly has frustrating
encounters with waiters. Still, she believes some customers abuse
the allergy excuse just to get their way. ``They'll say, `I can't
eat any fats,' so you struggle to make up a tasty dish, and then
they order chocolate mousse for dessert. Did I miss something
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Other chefs agree that allergy claims are on the rise in their
restaurants, and that the special requests frequently don't make
sense. ``Oh, yes,'' says Hubert Keller, chef at Fleur de Lys in San
Francisco. ``People have developed some complicated and strange
allergies over the last few years.'' Recently, a customer who said
she was extremely allergic to olive oil objected when the waiter
said the kitchen would leave the olives off her dish. No need for
that, she said; she loves olives.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Doumani added a line to the menu asking diners to
advise waiters of food restrictions before ordering. ``They never
tell you until they get the food,'' fumes Doumani, citing a recent
customer who failed to announce her allergy to sesame seeds until
her sesame seed-sprinkled sea bass arrived. ``Whatever profit you
make on a dish, you've just lost. When I go to a restaurant, I say
to the waiter, `If I order anything with cilantro, stop me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz-Furlong would like to see restaurateurs do a better job of
training their staffs to take food allergies seriously. Waiters and
cooks should know that a reaction can be deadly, that ``just a
little'' of a problem ingredient isn't OK and that it's much better
to admit they don't know what's in a dish than to say it's probably
safe. Chefs, for their part, should be aware of the most common
allergens and avoid using them unannounced in unexpected places.
</P>
<P>
   If more food-service professionals and manufacturers understood
food allergies better, their allergic customers might be able to
eat with less fear. As it is, mealtimes are often anxious moments.
``For someone who had not had to restrict his diet in any way, it
was a different perspective,'' Walton says of his adult-onset
allergy. ``Now you have to second-guess what you put in your
mouth.''

TWO GOOD DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finally, a Little Rock judge finds President
Clinton guilty of obstructing justice and a Little Rock jury finds
Susan McDougal NOT guilty of obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   About time, too. Both decisions are legally sound an culturally
important.
</P>
<P>
   Judges need not tolerate blatant lies, from presidents or anyone
else. And juries need not buy legalistic swill from independent
counsels who harass defendants out of malice and frustration,
persecuting rather than prosecuting their targets.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a great country or what?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright held Clinton in civil
contempt of court for making ``intentionally false'' statements
under oath in the Paula Jones case and thereby undermining ``the
integrity of the judicial system.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect is more annoying than alarming. It will hit
him in the pocketbook for more court costs, jeopardize his standing
to practice law and further tarnish his reputation in the eyes of
history.
</P>
<P>
   It is an appropriate sanction that fits the fibs, unlike the
partisan impeachment circus that made fools of both the perpetrator
and his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said she was ruling in part because she wished to deter
others ``who might themselves consider emulating the president of
the United States by willfully violating discovery orders of this
and other courts ... '' Bottom line: Clinton set a bad example,
which could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But although the judge was clearly ticked off, she was properly
concerned about the constitutionality of being so tough on Clinton
that he could no longer adequately carry out his official duties.
In other words: No possibility of criminal contempt charges and
potential jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Wright pointed specifically to the president's statements during
his Jones deposition that he did not remember ever being alone with
Monica Lewinsky and never had sexual relations with her. Seven
months later he admitted before a grand jury to being alone with
her ``from time to time'' and having had an ``inappropriate
intimate relationship'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is a surprise. Everybody already knows the
president lied about Lewinsky. And thank goodness it comes too late
to have any political impact on Congress. We've been there, done
that. The hideous impeachment game is over.
</P>
<P>
   (The House of Representatives impeached Clinton for perjury
before the grand jury and for obstruction of justice but rejected a
proposal to cite him for false statements in the Jones case. The
Senate acquitted him of the charges in February.)
</P>
<P>
   There is no appetite to revive that act. Too much damage has
already been done to both parties. Even Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga, who
had demanded Clinton be impeached before the world ever heard of
Lewinsky, conceded in a CNN interview that there is no political
will to reopen the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible to get anywhere (with that) now,'' Barr
said. The conservative congressman added that he also agreed with
those who felt Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr made a mistake in
imprisoning McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   She is a far more sympathetic figure than the president, a
victim rather than a predator, a little fish rather than a powerful
shark.
</P>
<P>
   She is certainly uncommonly stubborn. But there is no evidence
that this youthful woman is lying when she says she knows nothing
that would incriminate the president in the failed 1980s Whitewater
real estate venture. And the Little Rock jury found entirely
credible her stated fear that if she did not make up some evil
charge against Clinton, Starr's implacable hostility had made it
clear he would indict her for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had her sent to prison in shackles for civil contempt for
18 months because she had refused to testify before a grand jury
against Clinton. When she continued to resist testifying after that
sentence expired, Starr additionally charged her with criminal
obstruction of justice, a stupid tactic that smelled of revenge and
vindictive prosecutorial overkill.
</P>
<P>
   She did tell the Arkansas federal jury what little she says she
knew, which indeed did not harm Clinton and was not what Starr
wanted to hear. After the jury acquitted her of obstructing justice
and deadlocked on two counts of criminal contempt, Starr refused to
accept reality and give up. Incredibly, his office announced that
retrying her on the two mistrial charges was ``definitely an
option''.
</P>
<P>
   It is an option only a legal madman would pursue. Starr's
campaign to break McDougal is over, just as the impeachment crusade
is over.
</P>
<P>
   Our judicial system is not perfect. But in these two instances
it has proved that neither presidents nor independent counsels may
arrogantly defy basic legal principles and common sense with
impunity. This is good indeed.

CHINA'S YANGSHAN STONE TABLET: A RELIC OF IMPERIAL ASPIRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 18)  
 (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three local Chinese tourists were harrumphing their way down the
mountain, indignantly complaining about what they had seen. I was
heading up and paused to let them pass on the trail, so one of them
advised me helpfully, ``No point in going on. There's nothing there
but a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Well, yes. But what a rock!
</P>
<P>
   The Yangshan Stone Tablet, in the hills outside the old capital
of Nanjing in southeastern China, is not on most tourist
itineraries, and even many Chinese living in Nanjing do not know
about it. And yes, I suppose it is just a rock.
</P>
<P>
   The site is an old imperial quarry, nestled in a series of
rolling green hills, covered with forests and occasional tombs of
Chinese notables. The Emperor Yongle, who ruled in the early 15th
century, wanted to have the grandest monument imaginable for the
tomb of his father, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. So he ordered
the construction in this quarry of a headstone in three parts _
base, stele and cap. It was to be the biggest memorial in the
world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Court engineers found an appropriate spot in the quarry and
designed a tablet that would have been 256 feet high. Thousands of
workers spent years clearing the hillside and carving the stone
from the mountain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After huge expense and unimaginable labor, the three parts were
chiseled almost entirely free from the mountain. Then the engineers
began to think of how they were going to move the tablet to the
gravesite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tablet weighs 31,000 tons, and even today there is probably
no way it could be budged. It would be far too heavy for trucks,
even if there were roads to the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the emperor's advisers explained to Yongle that while the
work was mostly completed, the tablet was unmovable. It is not
known how he reacted, but it seems unlikely he took the news well.
Yongle was one of China's great emperors, but like most of the
great ones he was also exceptionally brutal, torturing and killing
not only his critics but even their extended families and neighbors
and friends. He was particularly fond of execution by an
excruciating method known as death by a thousand cuts, causing
opponents to bleed to death very slowly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yongle had become emperor in 1402 by staging a rebellion and
deposing his nephew. When one of China's great Confucian scholars,
Fang Xiaoru, declined to express loyalty to the new regime, Yongle
cut him to pieces in the city square and executed more than 900
people who had had some connection with him. I have not found any
record of whether heads also rolled among those who planned the
stone tablet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In any case, work simply stopped on the headstone. The three
parts of the tablet were left where they lay, and the centuries
passed. But people with an interest in Chinese history periodically
visited the spot to gasp at the size of the stones and to wonder at
Yongle's vision and foolishness. And in recent years the local
authorities have tried to turn it into a tourist site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those plans seem to have failed. There is a gate, and when I
arrived for my visit this past February three people inside were
standing guard and charging a bit more than $1 a person for
admission. I asked how many people visited, and one said airily
``maybe 200 or 300 hundred a day,'' but that seems a huge
exaggeration. In the two hours that I was on the grounds, there
were only a few other visitors around, and when I left the ticket
takers were gone and anyone could have walked in free. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the grounds from the ticket booth is a large area
set up years ago for souvenir booths, but none are in operation. A
small teahouse is open, but it was empty during my visit. I suspect
that reality caught up with the authorities and forced them to
abandon plans for a major tourist development. The bottom line is
that far fewer people will come to see a historical site that
represents failure than one that was a triumph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the ticket booth, one must hike about half a mile up the
hill to the quarry. It is a pleasant walk, with occasional old
tombs to explore on each side, and would make a pleasant place for
a picnic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then you see the intended tablet base _ a rock as big as a house
_ and after climbing up a set of stone stairs and past the
teahouse, you emerge in a flat area with a round cylinder jutting
out, also house-sized. That was supposed to be the cap on top of
the tablet. Just beyond that is the centerpiece of the tablet: a
huge rectangular rock lying on its side and mostly cut out from the
hillside around it. Only at one end does it remain fused with the
hillside; everywhere else the workers carefully hacked it free and
carved it into shape. Even the bottom is mostly detached from the
ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are a few trails around, and I climbed onto the hillside
and then onto the tablet itself. There are no rails and it is a
thrill to walk out on the tablet and peek down over the edge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only other people around were a young couple, at the end of
the tablet where it merged with the mountain, and they seemed to be
having a lovers' quarrel and were heedless of the rest of the
world.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tablet is a glimpse into Chinese history, offering a lesson
in both outsize imperial aspirations and supreme foolishness. It
was the same Yongle who organized a great naval armada of 300 ships
and 28,000 sailors that made seven great journeys to the Indian
Ocean between 1405 and 1433, eventually reaching as far as East
Africa. It was he who moved the capital of China to Beijing, built
the Forbidden City, invaded Vietnam and periodically warred with
the Mongols. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yongle, in short, never did anything in a small way. He employed
more than 1 million people to build the Forbidden City and its
800-room palace (China then had a total population of 60 million),
and he forced 120,000 households to move to the new capital.
</P>
<P>
   During his frequent trips back and forth between Nanjing and
Beijing, Yongle traveled with an entourage of government officials
and courtiers and logistical personnel that make U.S. presidential
trips look puny _ and the emperor also always took with him 10,000
cavalry soldiers and 40,000 foot soldiers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yongle did some great things for China _ it was also he who
ordered the repairs of the Grand Canal that connected northern and
southern China _ but ultimately his grand projects bled the country
dry. And in that sense, the great stone tablet is the perfect
symbol of his reign.
</P>
<P>
   There is something poignant about a project so grand and yet so
foolish. I couldn't help thinking that it was because of projects
on this gargantuan scale that China is no longer run by emperors,
and that in that sense the tablet is more evocative of Chinese
history than much better-known sites like the imperial tombs.
</P>
<P>
   The most efficient way to get to the tablet is to hire a taxi in
Nanjing and ask it to wait for you. Negotiate the fare first; you
can hire a taxi for $25 for four hours, which is enough to take you
to the tablet and another, more famous site, the Ming tomb, where
the tablet was supposed to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Chinese, the tablet is known as the Yangshan Beicai, and most
taxi drivers seem to know vaguely of its existence and can find it
by asking around. The telephone number of the ticket booth is
410-7582. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yongle is a fascinating emperor, but little known in the West.
One book that discusses his life (although it is not a biography
but a history of the armada that Yongle assembled) is ``When China
Ruled the Seas,'' by Louise Levathes (Oxford University Press).

FBI BELIEVES THAT TEXAS MAN WAS CRUCIAL TERRORIST LINK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
and KIMBERLY DURNAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He sits in isolation, behind the razor wire and thick,
smoked-glass windows of a federal jail in New York, far from the
Fort Worth tire shop and Arlington apartment where he worked and
lived.
</P>
<P>
   In the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, Wadih El
Hage is allowed to see only his defense lawyers and the guards who
surround him. He is able to make just three phone calls a month,
and only to people such as his wife who have been approved by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   He is not allowed to use the exercise track on the jail's roof,
the government says, for fear that he will be killed by a sniper so
he can never reveal information about terrorist groups around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Life for El Hage _ a father of seven who lived with his family
near the University of Texas at Arlington campus _ has changed
dramatically since he was accused of being an international
terrorist. In September, he was charged with ``conspiracy to kill
United States nationals'' in the Aug. 7, 1998, bombings of U.S.
embassy buildings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
More than 250 people were killed, 12 of them Americans; thousands
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, 38, has also been charged with lying to FBI agents and
to a federal grand jury in New York about what the government
alleges are his close association with Osama bin Laden, the wealthy
Saudi exile accused of masterminding the bombings. Bin Laden, the
government says, ``is as dangerous to American interests as any man
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage and three other co-defendants in an ongoing, worldwide
criminal investigation are scheduled to appear for a hearing in a
New York courtroom this week. If convicted, he could receive life
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Tarrant County, El Hage was known as a man who spent time
with his young children and as a member of an Arlington mosque. He
managed Lone Star Wheels and Tires in the 3500 block of East
Lancaster in Fort Worth, where his boss recalls him as a
responsible employee.
</P>
<P>
   Moataz Al-Hallak, the spiritual leader of the Islamic Society of
Arlington, said he knew El Hage only as a member of his mosque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nice, soft-spoken person, helpful and very friendly,''
Al-Hallak said. ``Anybody who came to know him, liked him. This is
the impression that he left in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   But within bin Laden's circle, prosecutors say, El Hage was
known as ``Norman'' _ the chief accountant, records keeper and
administrator for bin Laden's dispatches of death and destruction
for American ``infidels.'' El Hage, government documents assert,
was bin Laden's ``personal secretary'' in terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the government's case against El Hage remain
secret, barred from public view in sealed files. But federal court
documents that are open to the public in New York reveal that the
Arlington man was the focus of federal investigators a year before
the embassy bombings, and is suspected of being connected with
crimes in locations ranging from Somalia to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the same month El Hage moved to Arlington, he
came under the watch of federal authorities who began to suspect
that he had close ties to bin Laden, according to court documents.
He was called to testify before a New York grand jury investigating
the bin Laden organization, and he was later linked to the embassy
bombings when his name was connected with a suspect arrested in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, El Hage was denied a request to telephone
Al-Hallak from jail. Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald
expressed concerns in a court hearing that if the two communicated,
they might use ``coded correspondence'' and ``cryptic references''
to plan future acts of terrorism, including ``murder and conspiracy
to murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moataz Al-Hallak has served as a contact between members of
the bin Laden organization,'' Fitzgerald added.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak, in a rare interview, adamantly denied the
allegations, saying he has nothing to do with bin Laden. He said he
preaches a religion that abhors terrorism or any other form of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really shocking and surprising. I really do not know
what they are talking about. This is absolutely false,'' Al-Hallak
said. The 38-year-old cleric said that no one with the federal
government has ever tried to question him. He learned of the
allegations from a reporter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal official, who did not want to be identified, said
Fitzgerald's comments about Al-Hallak were based on undercover
intelligence work that has not yet warranted an interrogation. The
mosque he leads is not under investigation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A native Syrian whose wife is from America, Al-Hallak said
``there are a lot of good things I can learn'' from people in this
country. In return, he said, he can ``offer something to this
society.''

 &HT;    Despite slow start, Braves batters getting job done
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Braves are feeling a little lucky to be 5-3
at this point. How else do you explain winning five of eight games
while your team is hitting .238?
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are ranked 12th in that category out of 16 National
League teams, puzzling for a team that hit the ball so well during
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively we're not doing what we're capable of,'' said
Brian Jordan, who at .423 is one of only three regulars in the
lineup hitting over .250. ``Pitching is still ahead of hitting
right now. Everybody is being anxious, trying to do too much,
making the big hit instead of just relaxing and doing what you're
capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko (.423) and Javy Lopez (.261) are the other two over
.250. Chipper Jones is barely above .200 (.206). Bret Boone needed
two hits on Monday to raise his average to .222. Then you've got
Otis Nixon (.148), Andruw Jones (.172) and Walt Weiss (.190)
bringing up the rear.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters who are getting the most at-bats, and charged with
getting the offense rolling, are doing the least with them. The top
three hitters in the order _ Nixon, Boone and Chipper Jones _ are a
combined 17 for 88 (.193). When Nixon singled and scored in the
first inning Tuesday, it was the first time a Braves leadoff hitter
had scored this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top three guys ain't swinging the bat, ain't getting on
base, ain't doing nothing,'' Chipper Jones said. ``We've just got
to be patient. It'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows that starts with him. Outside of his three-hit game
against the Phillies on April 6, Jones is hitting .138 (4 for 29)
including his 0-for-5 on Monday,
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I touched in spring training was golden,'' Jones
said. ``Now it's like mud. I can't buy one. My mom could have been
lobbing them to me (Monday), and I couldn't have hit one. You just
have to laugh it off and hope somebody else gets a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has been doing his share. He leads the team in home runs
(two), RBIs (seven) and runs scored (nine). He also has scored both
winning runs in the two Braves last at-bat wins over the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was one of the hitters struggling the most _
Andruw Jones (nine strikeouts in 29 at-bats) _ who drove him in
both times. There's a lesson there for Jones and the rest of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's focused in only those at-bats,'' hitting coach Don Baylor
said. ``Let's get focused in for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two wins that give the Braves reason to believe that can
and will do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those wins, they build character,'' Chipper Jones said. ``They
build chemistry. They give you a feeling of invincibility _ that no
matter how far down you are, you can come back.

 &HT;    Falcons' Robinson wants arrest incident to be 'a reminder'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eugene Robinson rejoined the Falcons on Tuesday, a lot
little lighter in the wallet and ``humbled'' since his arrest on
the eve of Super Bowl XXXIII for attempting to solicit oral sex in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While joking with teammates about their golf games, and often
talking as fast as ever, the free safety seemed at times unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to signing a new contract to reduce his 1999
salary from $1.8 million to $1 million, he acknowledged that he
will be branded forever by the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wrong; I stand before everybody,'' said Robinson, who
missed the first two-plus weeks of the team's offseason workout
program. ``I am deeply humbled, and (grateful) for this
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to get away from it,'' he said. ``I want it to
be . . . a scar I will always remember. I don't want it to affect
what I do as a football player, but as Eugene Robinson the person,
I want it to be a reminder to stay next to the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 35, was third on the Falcons last season with 92 total
tackles, second with four interceptions and made the Pro Bowl for
the third time in his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   But his speed and tackling skills appear to be in decline, and
his salary was to increase from $750,000 last year to $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons re-signed cornerback Ronnie Bradford last
month, coach Dan Reeves said Bradford might move to free safety.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing that, along with league-wide rumors Atlanta was
going to waive him, Robinson called Reeves last week from his home
outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves told Robinson he needed to be in the workout program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have anything to do with (Robinson's arrest),''
Reeves said. ``It was because he had such a slow start last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach also told Robinson that he would have to take a pay
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had to justify letting our leading tackler (linebacker
Cornelius Bennett) go,'' Reeves said. ``We just had to look at what
would be most fair to the team, and the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson could earn more with incentives, but he's got to make
the team to earn a cent other than the $70 per workout as mandated
by the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a money thing. I've got money,'' he said. ``I want to
. . . do something that's right. This is . . . a new beginning. I
have goals. I want to get back to the Super Bowl and do it right. I
want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Bradford still will work at free safety in training
camp, and Robinson concedes that he could still be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always a very real possibility,'' he said. ``If I get
cut on the basis of my performance, that's different. I can take
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has maintained a low profile since the Super Bowl,
screening calls to his home and declining interviews on ABC's''
20/20,'' ESPN's ``Up Close,'' CNN-SI and ``The Oprah Winfrey
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   He was high profile in the locker room Tuesday before and after
an 8 a.m. workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked to me a little bit,'' starting center Robbie Tobeck
said. ``There's things we got to talk about and work out, but we're
glad to see him in here and working out. There's a lot of guys that
wonder, `What if? What if?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, you . . . wonder if the game would have been
different. 'Bitterness' is a strong word. I think it is more
'wonder.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson will participate in the final 12 1/2 weeks of the
program. ``It's important for me to lock arms with the guys and
sweat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no record of Robinson's arrest on the misdemeanor
charge because he entered a pre-trial diversion program that called
for him to take an HIV test and an AIDS awareness course.
</P>
<P>
   He knows, however, that he can never erase the question whether
his misdeed influenced a 34-19 loss in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it have? Yes. No. Maybe,'' he said. ``The thing is, when
they look at the Super Bowl . . . it's in the history books. I
can't do anything about it, not one iota, and that's why I was
hoping for the chance to do this again with this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a new beginning. I will not be held hostage by
the past. I got my entire life ahead of me.

 &HT;    Companies get creative when searching for employees
 &HT;    EDS: This is the first of a new Atlanta Journal-Constitution
feature called Tech Jobs that will focus on careers in high tech
industries.
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the ongoing war for workers, Tommy Rainwater may be
the high tech industry's secret weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old is a former designer of trade show exhibits and
knows what it takes to get people to notice a product. He's now
putting that know-how to work for Macquarium Intelligent
Communications, an Atlanta firm that helps companies design
websites, kiosks and other interactive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same techniques used to guide a person through various
points in an exhibit booth apply to someone using a website or
CD-Rom,'' said Rainwater who now makes between $10,000 and $15,000
more as a communications specialist at Macquarium. Last fall,
Rainwater created a deck of large 3-D game cards using a Jack, King
and Queen as part of a sales pitch to an online entertainment
company. Rainwater's work helped Macquarium land the account to
build a website.
</P>
<P>
   Rainwater along with five architects Macquarium has hired in the
last few years are becoming the company's ``first line of
defense,'' in helping Macquarium determine what clients need ,
president Marc Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   The fast growth of technology and the Internet have created an
enormous need for people who can create, build, run and manage
computers as well as the software that goes in them. The heaviest
demand is in the field of information technology where companies
are desperate for computer programmers, database administrators,
systems analysts, software developers, web designers and countless
other jobs - many of which didn't exist a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the nation's universities are only able to churn out
a fraction (40,000 to 50,000 IT students a year) of the prospects
needed for the estimated half million unfilled IT jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Promises of cushy perks, fat paychecks and bonuses only offer
short-term solutions because a prized IT catch can often be lured
away with better benefits by competitors. Competition has sent IT
salaries into the stratosphere making it even harder for companies
to compete in a field where products and demand change rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for highly specialized, rapidly changing IT skills ``puts
a lot of pressure on the job market that traditional avenues aren't
able to fill,'' said Walker Smith, an Atlanta-based trend tracker
for market research firm Yankelovich Partners. ``If you have five
years working on the Internet, you are ancient. There is not a
premium on experience and more education. You're really forced to
go outside (normal channels). You don't advertise for people with
lots of experience. You have an odd phenomena.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of high tech jobs in Georgia has
surged. High tech employment in Georgia grew 54 percent between
1990 and 1997, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show. Such rapid
growth has helped propel the state into the top 10 states in high
tech employment, according to the American Electronics Association
recently reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of available workers hasn't kept pace with the
demand. The worker shortage is particularly pronounced in Metro
Atlanta, the Southeast's second largest high tech market, behind
Northern Virginia and could become a critical issue for Atlanta
which according to DRI McGraw Hill is expected to lead the nation
in job growth through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by KPMG for Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce
estimates there are about 20,000 unfilled IT jobs in the state.
About 75 percent of those jobs are in the Atlanta area, says
William J. Todd, president of the Georgia Research Alliance, a
technology development partnership of universities, business and
state government. In response, Georgia Tech this Spring plans to
enlist its graduates to help recruit IT prospects _ particularly
software engineers _ to Georgia from places like California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Metro Atlanta ) chamber and Department of Industry Trade
and Tourism have an excellent reputation for recruiting companies
to move to Georgia,'' said Todd, who plans to help recruit IT
workers. ``This (recruiting) effort is a variation on that theme.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the IT shortage is so great that it's forced
companies like Macquarium, Microsoft and Manhattan to get creative
in filling jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just thinking outside the box,'' Adler said of his
decision to add Rainwater and the architects to the staff. ``You
have to choose nontraditional methods in a competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started thinking of character traits of individuals. You
hire skill sets. You don't hire positions. If you're hiring skills
sets you can think about who understands designs, who understands
communication of a brand.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the architects, ``You're talking about screen
real estate versus physical real estate,'' Adler said. ``There's a
lot of parallels.''
</P>
<P>
   For their parts, Microsoft and Manhattan Associates of Atlanta
are even financing the creation of their future workforces,
capitalizing on the rampant job-hopping and career-switching that
is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. is at an alltime low for unemployment. So it's not
like there's a lot of people out there,'' said Nancy Lewis, general
manager for training and certification worldwide at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Dubberly of Alpharetta, Ga. is switching to computers
after nine years as a pharmacist, with the help of an $8,000 loan
from a Microsoft program aimed at getting more people into the
field of IT.
</P>
<P>
   Dubberly used the money to buy a new computer and pay the
program's $5,000 tuition. She started working part time in December
so she could focus on the training which has often meant 40 hours a
week in class.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, Dubberly says she's learned how computer
networks run and different ways computers talk to each other. She
expects to get her certification in the next couple of months.
Participants are not guaranteed a job once they complete the
program.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually wants to work on developing a computer network
that would link hospitals, doctors' offices and pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to use my certification to mesh the health industry
and computer world,'' said Dubberly. ``There's a huge gap for
health care workers. A doctor's office can't talk to a pharmacy.
There should be some way that we in the health care field should be
able to talk to each other over the various networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubberly is just one of thousands of non-IT people Microsoft has
helped trained since starting its Microsoft Skills 2000 in May
1997. Last year, for instance, the 2000 program introduced 125,000
new people into the industry. In addition, about $115 million in
loans was disbursed during the first year of Microsoft's Skills
2000 IT Career Loan program, which is administered by Servus
Financial. That number is expected to double in the second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft 2000 program has drawn all sorts of people into
IT,'' Lewis said. ``People are coming from all professions. There
are policewomen, bank tellers, cab drivers, engineers and doctors
who are moving into IT careers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, Manhattan Associates has hired industrial
engineers and people with MBAs and trained them to become software
designers, engineers and programmers. The company's workforce has
grown from 25 when it moved to the Atlanta area from California in
1995 to nearly 600 today. Many of the hires have come from Georgia
Tech, where the company has built a strong working relationship
with the faculty there and given $1.5 million to the endowment of a
chair to build a supply chain studies program. Manhattan Associates
helps clients, which range from Nordstrom to Sports Authority to
Polo, organize their warehouse and distribution systems with
software that provides logistics, distribution and transportation
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shortage of software developers due especially to
the Year 2000 problem,'' said Alan Dabbiere, Manhattan Associates
president and chief executive. ``We've very much been able to
leverage engineering skills _ from mechanical electrical, civil ,
chemical, aeronautical and industrial engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   So can an architect or trade booth builder become an information
technology whiz?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great for us,'' said Adler, MacQuarium's 26-year-old
wunderkind of the 50-employee company, who admits the transition
has been relatively smooth. It generally takes about six months for
the nontraditional IT people to make the adjustment, Adler said.
The company also has designers on staff with fine arts backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The architects, for example, ``have 3D skills. They're not just
theorists. They have practical hands-on knowledge how to use
high-end software,'' Adler said. They can quickly grasp concepts
because ``they have the spatial understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's worked well for the company which creates everything
from kiosks in malls and movie theaters to satellite communications
and CD-Roms as well as intranet and e-commerce systems.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a nation of technophiles, where Internet millionaires are
minted daily, it seems heresy to question the economic payoff from
information technology _ the billions upon billions spent each year
by companies and households on everything from computers to
software to cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a decade, most of the nation's leading
economists have been heretics. They have not been much impressed by
the high-tech dogma _ embraced by corporate executives, business
school professors and Wall Street alike _ that regards the
transformation of the economy through the magic of information
technology as a self-evident truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the Computer Age everywhere,'' Robert Solow, a
Nobel prizewinner from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
wrote a few years ago, ``but in the productivity statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, even as the computer revolutionized the workplace,
productivity _ the output of goods and services per worker _
stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a year. So it is easy to see
how Solow's pithy comment became the favorite punchline of the
economic naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, even renowned skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy, like Solow, are having second
thoughts. Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996,
capped by a surge in the second half of last year, after eight
years of economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past
upward swings in productivity typically occurred early in a
recovery as economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased
hiring, it slowed again.
</P>
<P>
   But something seems fundamentally different this time, something
apparently having a lot to do with the increased speed and
efficiency that the Internet and other pervasive
information-technology advances are bringing to the mundane
day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The question, posed by economists, is whether the higher
productivity growth, averaging about 2 percent in the last three
years, roughly double the pace from 1973 to 1995, is the
long-awaited confirmation that the nation's steadily rising
investment in computers and communications is finally paying off.
The evidence is starting to point in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beliefs are shifting on this subject,'' said Solow. ``I am
still far from certain. But the story always was that it took a
long time for people to use information technology and truly become
more efficient. That story sounds a lot more convincing today than
it did a year or two ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pillar in the pessimist camp was Daniel Sichel, an
economist at the Federal Reserve. His work, along with another Fed
economist, Stephen Oliner, in 1994, and on his own in 1997, found
that computers contributed little to productivity growth. But
recently, Sichel ran similar calculations for the last few years
and came to a different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper that has just been published in the quarterly
``Business Economics,'' Sichel wrote that his new work points to
``a striking step up in the contribution of computers to output
growth.'' And the nation's improved productivity performance, he
noted, is ``raising the possibility that businesses are finally
reaping the benefits of information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of information technology on the economy is more than
an academic debate. If, as some experts assert, the technology
dividend is a key reason for the nation's extraordinary run of high
growth, rising wages and low inflation, there are significant
policy implications. If the recent gains are not just a temporary
blip, it suggests that the Federal Reserve can be less fearful of
inflation and keep interest rates stable rather than be forced to
raise them to cool off what would otherwise be considered an
overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the other Fed
governors are scheduled to hear presentations on information
technology's effect on the economy from several academics during a
private meeting in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, for one, seems to believe a fundamental change is
under way. He told Congress early this year that the economy was
enjoying ``higher, technology-driven productivity growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed governors will hear a forceful case for technological
optimism from Erik Brynjolfsson, an associate professor at the MIT
Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   Brynjolfsson asserts that the economic value of speed, quality
improvements, customer service and new products are often not
captured by government statistics. ``These are the competitive
advantages of information technology,'' he said. ``We need a
broader definition of output in this new economy, which goes beyond
the industrial-era concept of widgets coming off the assembly
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, after years of defending its figures, conceded
two weeks ago that productivity growth may be understated. The core
of the problem, government economists say, is the increasingly
complex challenge of defining and measuring output in much of the
economy's fast-growing service sector, which includes the vast
reaches of banking, finance, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official statistics, a bank today is only about
80 percent as productive as a bank in 1977. Yet that seems to take
scant account of, say, 24-hour automated teller machines, which
clearly benefit customers who no longer have to wait in lines to be
served by human tellers during regular ``bankers' hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Dean, chief of the productivity division of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, wrote in a new research paper that the agency was
increasingly concerned that its measurements did not ``fully
reflect changes in the quality of goods and services'' or ``capture
the full impact of new technology on economic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government's methods of measurement will not be
overhauled anytime soon. ``These are tough, tough questions and we
are not going to get instant solutions,'' Dean explained in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations long ago made up their minds, voting for
technology with their dollars. Investment in information technology
_ computing and telecommunications gear _ has quadrupled over the
last decade, rising as a share of all business spending on
equipment from 29 percent to 53 percent, according to the Commerce
Department. And that is only the hardware. There have been similar
surges in corporate spending on software, consulting, technical
support and training related to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The payoff from information technology is unquestionably there
with individual companies and we're seeing it over and over
again,'' said Chuck Rieger, a senior consultant at IBM's services
division.

   Of course, anecdotal evidence from individual companies is no
proof of broad-based benefits in an $8.5-trillion economy. But what
many experts find encouraging is that the rapid introduction of
low-cost Internet technology means most companies can now afford to
set up electronic links with customers and suppliers. For example,
a recent survey of 2,500 manufacturing companies, conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, found that the number of factories with
Internet links to customers and suppliers doubled last year.
</P>
<P>
   At more and more companies, these Internet-based networks are
already streamlining the mundane chores of business life like
invoicing, purchasing and inventory control. This is not the
glamorous side of Internet commerce, occupied by Amazon.com and
others selling consumer products. Yet if a technology dividend in
productivity is at hand, the place to look is in the back offices
of business. ``That is where it will be,'' Solow, the MIT
economists, said, ``in the wholesale automation of corporate
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   This business-to-business commerce over the Internet is
projected to jump from $48 billion in 1998 to $1.5 trillion by
2003, according to Forrester Research Inc. During the same period,
the research firm estimates that consumer sales over Internet will
rise from $3.9 billion to $108 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The service sector of the economy is where productivity gains
appear to have been especially sluggish and where experts are
looking most closely for evidence of an efficiency payoff from
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Michael Rushmore, a banker, speaks of how Internet
computing has ``fundamentally changed the way we do business'' over
the last three or four years. Take the way corporate loans are
syndicated among many banks, notes Rushmore, a managing director of
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the securities arm of
BankAmerica Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Until about two years ago, syndicating a large corporate bank
loan meant distributing a lengthy offering document, often running
more than 200 pages, to 50 to 100 banks. It was, Rushmore recalled,
a nightmarish, inefficient process that involved waves of overnight
mail, constant faxing and armies of messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of that process is handled over the Internet on bank
Web sites that other banks tap into to read and download the
offering document, ask questions and exchange views. Rushmore
estimates that the Internet-based system trims 25 percent from the
time it takes to close a deal, not just improving the ease of the
transaction but also saving an immense amount of hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton began using the Internet
to bill several federal agencies that are its clients. Booz Allen
estimates that it has saved $150,000 a year by eliminating the
paper handling on its $10 million in monthly billings to the
government. The greater speed and efficiency of the electronic
billing also means that the consulting firm is being paid 30
percent, or six days, faster than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting that money into the bank much more quickly is probably
the biggest benefit,'' said Mark Arnsberger, an assistant
controller for Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid spread of Internet-based computing, experts say,
promises to compress the time it takes for any new technology to
enhance economic welfare in general. The classic study of the
phenomenon, ``The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical
Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox,'' by Paul David, an
economic historian at Stanford University, was published in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The electric motor, David noted, was introduced in the early
1880s but did not generate discernible productivity gains until the
1920s. It took that long, he wrote, not only for the technology to
be widely distributed but also for businesses to reorganize work
around the industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough
of its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process takes longer than people think, but I still
believe that we will get a revival of productivity growth led by
the spread of computing,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   His is a misplaced faith, according to the dwindling band of
techno-pessimists whose own beliefs remain unshaken. Sure, they
concede, there has been surprisingly strong productivity growth for
the last three years. Could this represent a break in the trend?
Possibly, they grudgingly admit, but only a tiny shift at best,
they insist.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, they explain, lies in the composition of the
nation's vast service economy. More than half of all white-collar
workers are what they term ``knowledge workers'' _ managers,
executives and professionals like doctors, lawyers, teachers, even
economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work they do does not lend itself to technology-driven
improvements in productivity, and any gains are really difficult to
eke out and are glacial,'' said Stephen Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Paul David's electrical motor has
nothing to do with the knowledge-intensive process of work in a
service economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The real technology cynic at the Fed meeting on Thursday will be
Paul Strassmann, a former chief information officer of Xerox and
the Pentagon. Strassmann, author of ``The Squandered Computer,''
published in 1997, believes that corporate America's spending spree
on information technology amounts to an ``economic arms race,''
fueled by misguided management theories.
</P>
<P>
   The recent improvement in productivity, according to Strassmann,
is mainly attributable to the lower cost of capital because of low
interest rates. His summary view, though at odds with those of
technology optimists like Brynjolfsson of MIT, may also be received
warmly by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explanation for the productivity improvement is interest
rates, not information technology,'' Strassmann said. ``The hero
here is not Bill Gates. It's Alan Greenspan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Strassmann finds the technology undeniably useful, if
not a productivity elixir. When asked a detailed question, he
replied, ``Just look it up on my Web site. It's a lot more
efficient that way.''

`THE FASCIST REVOLUTION': GRASPING THE APPEAL OF FASCISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ethnic cleansing being carried out by the Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo makes this enlightening volume on the
nature of fascism by George Mosse especially timely. As Lawrence
Wechsler noted in The New Yorker last week, Milosevic is a classic
fascist. His appeal is to a kind of fanatical Serbian nationalism;
he is popular; he has fused the historic sense of Serbian
victimhood with a cult of blood vengeance against non-Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Mosse, a distinguished student of European and especially German
history who taught for many years at the University of Wisconsin,
does not speak specifically of Milosevic. But his new book, ``The
Fascist Revolution,'' certainly brings the Serb dictator to mind.
Mosse rejects the view of fascism as a kind of thin veneer imposed
by force and terror and maintained there by a manipulative leader
glorified by a huge and monolithic propaganda machine.
</P>
<P>
   In Mosse's view, fascism, as his title suggests, was a genuine
revolutionary movement, comparable in this sense to communism.
Fascism (in this sense unlike Communism) was constructed on the
basis of popular consensus and arose out of deeply ingrained values
and traditions. Far from being a thin veneer, a sort of
nonideological terror that merely manipulated nationalist and
racist emotions, it profoundly changed the societies in which it
came to power and imposed a complete world view, a different vision
of history and its meaning on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fascist myth was based upon the national mystique, its own
revolutionary and dynamic traditions,'' Mosse writes. ``It also
encompassed remnants of previous ideologies and political
attitudes, many of them paradoxically hostile to fascist
traditions. It was a scavenger which attempted to co-opt all that
had appealed to people in the 19th- and 20th-century past;
romanticism, liberalism and socialism as well as Darwinism and
modern technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosse is a serious scholar who treats some of these matters as
if he were leaping into the middle of an ongoing discussion among
other scholars, and that makes the going a bit tough sometimes for
lay readers. The early chapters are especially demanding in this
regard, with Mosse not always clear about the theme he is meaning
to pursue. But as the book continues, the tone becomes more
impassioned, the argument more vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   Having rejected the argument that fascism came to power on the
basis of terror alone, Mosse wants to explain the reasons for
fascism's appeal, and to do so he delves deeply into such subjects
as racism and nationalism, the fascist manipulation of images of
masculine beauty, the conjunction of what he calls ``the occult''
and the fascist revolt against the ordinariness of urban,
capitalist life.
</P>
<P>
   Racism and, of course, hatred of Jews, was so important a part
of German fascism that many probably believe that racism itself,
and the concomitant belief in Aryan superiority, are practically
synonymous with fascism. Not so, Mosse contends. A nonracist
fascism is imaginable, he argues, and such a fascism did exist for
more than a decade in Italy (until Mussolini turned officially to
anti-Semitism in 1938). ``Nationalism did not have to be racist,''
Mosse writes. ``Racism was just one among several alternatives from
which nationalism could choose.'' Nationalism did rely on the
racist alternative in Germany, where the creation of a
``countertype,'' supposedly a kind of opposite to the Germanic
ideal, provided an ``eternal enemy'' on which the country's
historic grievances could focus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most illuminating of Mosse's chapters has to do with
the heritage of the French Revolution, an event that was formally
repudiated by fascism but that, in Mosse's view, actually created
the mass politics that later enabled fascism to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Revolution and fascism rested on the concept of the
``general will,'' the idea of the mass of people acting together
for a transcendent national purpose. Both fascism and the
Revolution evoked utopias, perfect societies for which the
individual could be sacrificed. Both organized vast public
festivals of fealty to the new order. In both, Mosse writes,
``popular sovereignty was affirmed and controlled through giving
the people a means of participation in the political process _ not
in reality, but through a feeling of participating, of belonging to
a true and meaningful community.''
</P>
<P>
   The central point is that fascism did not spring full grown out
of the heads of a few theorists or even out of the condition of
Europe after World War I. As a ``scavenger'' doctrine, it used what
it could to give itself substance, but what it used was deeply
entrenched in European culture and tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In a probing chapter describing the appeal of fascism to French,
German and Italian intellectuals, Mosse argues that fascism was
not, as it is often proclaimed, ``an aberration from the dominant
current of European history and thought.'' Nor was it ``a
pragmatic, activist response to the immediate historical
situation.'' Many intellectuals, like the once-celebrated French
writer Louis-Ferdinand Celine, saw fascism as a means to realize
values that they had long prized.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, too, certain strains of occult belief, a
mysticism of blood and soil, contributed to fascism's appeal. Mosse
draws a complex set of links among nationalism, anti-Semitism, the
cult of the leader and late-19th-century mysticism. Like fascism
itself, he argues, the occult is a reaction against bourgeois
society with its rational calculation, its belief in progress
through science. Mysticism enabled the Germans to ``be artists,''
as Mosse puts it, ``to recognize that their true soul was an
expression of the cosmic spirit of the world based upon nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosse develops other themes, including the role of the theater
in Germany in fostering Nazi ideals, and the homoerotic nature of
the cult of beautiful youth. His arguments are not always easy to
grasp, but they come from long consideration of a vexing
phenomenon, which is given a full and many-sided explication in
these pages.

   NEW YORK _ Very young dancers bring an extra verve and emotional
wholeheartedness to performing that is seldom sustained as they
mature and become full-fledged professionals. Those qualities are
celebrated in the Kids Dance matinee programs presented by Eliot
Feld's Ballet Tech company on Saturdays and Sundays at the Joyce
Theater, in a season that ends May 9. The programs, performed for
the most part by children training in the company school, also
offer the chance to see interesting new commissions as well as
highlights of the senior repertory, danced with a special twist.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel of the Kids Dance matinee Saturday was ``Joggers,'' a
trio choreographed for student dancers by Feld in 1997 to goofy,
bouncy music by Dick Koomans that perfectly fits the dance.
``Joggers'' adroitly mixes relaxed jogging with ballet and stylized
bits of other track moves. But its greatest charm is the way it
uses its young dancers' freshness and innocent intensity of focus.
So tall and skinny they looked like colorful string beans in Frank
Krenz's sleek sports outfits, Christopher Osborne, Emmanuel
Robinson and Jonathan Sulaiman managed to be elegant, sporty and
amusingly competitive in the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Red, white and blue pompons are everywhere in Feld's ``Half
Time,'' a fast-paced suite of seven dances set to music by Morton
Gould. The costumes are covered with stars and stripes, so that the
dancers often look like small abstractions of the American flag.
But for all its rah-rah spirit, the choreography demands a
practiced technique and savvy performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half Time'' got both from its lead dancers, Amon Bey, Melissa
Urrutia, Jabin Waterman and Tiffany Smile. Ms. Smile stood out for
her serene embodiment of the Statue of Liberty, moving slowly in
front of a wall of pompons jiggling in witty syncopation in the
sweet and tart ``Old Glory'' number.
</P>
<P>
   The racial composition of the student company mirrors that of
New York City, a rarity in dance today, helping to give the dances
an extra edge of urban energy. To see that rainbow of skin tones
represented in the closing dance in ``Half Time,'' set to ``The
Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' was a doubly affecting experience at
a time when New Yorkers have been forced to confront racial
stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   The program opened with Feld's 1998 ``Simon Sez,'' set to a
score by Steve Maitland, a work for jiggling senior dancers,
bead-stringing junior dancers and stagehands who build a high
platform for the cast to stretch on. Nothing happens in the piece,
choreographically or musically, at excruciating length. One aim of
the ``Kids Dance'' programs must be to engage young audiences in
the stimulating art of dance. ``Simon Sez'' could well send them
racing back to their participatory video games.

 &HT;    Lawmakers meet with Clinton over crisis in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), an early opponent of
the U.S. bombing campaign in Kosovo, emerged from a meeting with
President Clinton Tuesday saying he expects Congress to quickly
adopt a massive emergency spending bill to fund the operation
through October.
</P>
<P>
   That ``should be a signal to the nation and our adversaries that
no one over here is thinking short term,'' said Coverdell, a member
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said he expects the cost of the operation to be at
least $2 billion and as much as $4 billion. ``I think the number
will be larger rather than smaller,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress back in session after the two-week Easter recess,
the Clinton administration waged a full-court press among members
of Congress to head off any sudden groundswell of opposition to the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell was one of about 60 lawmakers who met with Clinton
privately at the White House. Secretary of Defense William Cohen
and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, scurried
between briefings on Capitol Hill, laying out the impact of the
bombing campaign to caucus meetings of both Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The outreach appeared to be effective. The president and his
advisors asked for more time to let the bombing campaign to inflict
damage on Serbia and bring the Slavic nation to the negotiating
table. Coverdell, for one, said he was willing to give it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better than I have anytime up to now,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) attended one of the briefings and
emerged saying he was more opposed than ever to the use of U.S.
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't anointed or appointed to carve up Kosovo,'' Cleland
said. ``I'm heavily opposed to the use of ground troops at all.''

 &HT;    'Blue Dog' democrats call for campaign reform
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the stampede for campaign cash in the 2000
elections already at full tilt, Congressional Democrats today
launch a new effort to reform the way elections are financed.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Democrats, known as the Blue Dogs, will begin
collecting the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on a sweeping
campaign finance reform measure, which House Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.) has so far declined to schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get this bill passed out of the House by Memorial
Day and over to the Senate if we have any hope of passing it and
having it be effective for the next round of elections,'' said Rep.
Jim Turner (D-Texas), who is leading the petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt, even among opponents of campaign finance
reform, that House Democrats, joined by some moderate Republicans,
will succeed. A similar petition drive last year forced former
Speaker Newt Gingrich to bring the bill to the floor, and the
reform measure passed overwhelmingly with 252 votes.
</P>
<P>
   But reform advocates once again face the prospect of a Senate
filibuster led by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has
successfully defeated campaign finance reform in the Senate nearly
every year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly not going to allow a bill supported by every
single Democrat to pass in the Republican Senate,'' McConnell
declared Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the political dynamics of campaign finance reform have
changed somewhat since McConnell led a successful filibuster
against campaign finance reform last September.
</P>
<P>
   Reform proponents began their effort last year toward the end of
the 105th Congress, when it was quickly buried by President
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, reformers are beginning early. ``The House acting
earlier gives us more time,'' said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the
chief Republican sponsor of campaign finance reform in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are also several new Republican senators who
have indicated more of a willingness to vote for reform. Sen.
George Voinovich (R-Ohio), for example, said he is committed to
reform but hasn't endorsed any particular measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans have an obligation to come back with
meaningful campaign finance reform,'' Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that several GOP senators have told him privately
that they recognize the need to act on a bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Congress, calls for reform continue to mount.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a coalition of major businesses has put forward a
reform proposal that would ban so-called soft money donations to
the political parties by corporations, unions and individuals. The
soft-money ban, along with several other reforms, were needed to
restore voter confidence in politics, said Edward Kangas, chairman
of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and a member of the task force that
developed the proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund-raising arms race is taking its toll on everyone,''
Kangas said. ``Businesses feel mounting pressure to give to
campaigns because their competitors do.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill that is likely to pass this year would ban soft
money and thus cut off the major source of money that parties have
used to evade the contribution limits to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also expand the definition of ``express
advocacy,'' forcing groups that run independent political
advertisements during a campaign to raise their money according the
federal contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on soft money and new rules relating to express advocacy
are the most controversial elements of the bill, sponsored by Reps.
Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) and Chris Shays (R-Conn.).
</P>
<P>
   McConnell and many other Republicans argue that both provisions
would violate the First Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell has sent some recent signals that he might be open to
deal-making on campaign finance if the bill also increased the
contribution limits to candidates, which have been frozen at $1,000
per election since 1975. He and others have tossed out new limits
of $3,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell called an absolute ban on soft money an
``unacceptable deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That ends up putting the parties of being unable to engage in
issue advocacy, which every group in America exercises as their
constitutional right to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, however, are open to the idea of raising
contribution limits as part of a larger reform package. Meehan, the
Democratic sponsor of the House bill, said he would look at raising
contribution limits as a ``last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see soft money made illegal,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk has alienated the campaign finance reform purists, who
argue that candidates already have access to too much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ... are desperate for campaign finance reform at any
cost and that is what is most worrisome,'' said Ellen Miller of
Public Campaign, which advocates federally financed elections.
``They have lost sight of what reform is all about.''

 &HT;    Firefighters say wind helped flames spread quickly in Atlanta
mill
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first three firefighters to arrive at the scene of
a reported trash fire in the old Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill had
called for a hose to put it out when flames suddenly surged up
around them, forcing them to flee for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mill No. 1 at the Cabbagetown landmark was five stories high,
and each floor was supported by massive, age-dried wooden pillars
and beams, some perhaps a foot square, Atlanta Fire Battalion Chief
Bill Brockman said Tuesday. The heavy oak floors were permeated
with oil from the mill machines used over the years.
</P>
<P>
   None of the huge windows had glass in them, and the wind was
gusting through at 30 to 40 miles an hour. A veteran firefighter
working the scene Tuesday said wind and oily wood can turn a little
fire into a furnace in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, Brockman said, firefighting efforts at the mill
were scaled back to three engines, two ladder trucks and 18
firefighters. Crews were still pouring water onto hot spots within
the old building's walls, which were still standing for the most
part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably go on for a couple of days'' before it can be
declared safe, Brockman said. The section of Boulevard around the
entrance to the mill remained blocked off to autos creating massive
rush-hour traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   But even as fire hoses played streams of water on the wreckage,
workmen continued gutting other buildings on the old mill grounds,
scheduled to be turned into loft apartments. The sound of
jackhammers played a staccato counterpoint to the rumble of fire
engines pumping water.
</P>
<P>
   The other buildings, one already renovated and occupied, were
saved from the spectacular fire by the wind, which instead blew
flames onto tinderbox wooden houses in Cabbagetown, destroying or
damaging half a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   What started the trash fire on the fifth floor is still under
investigation, Lt. Roy Awana, chief of fire investigation, said.
Contrary to earlier reports, Awana said, there was no indication
that cutting torches were in use on the fifth floor or the roof.
Initial investigation indicated the only power tools in the general
area were circular saws being used by workmen to cut away a section
of the roof, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brockman said three engines and two trucks responded to the
trash fire call _ ``our normal assignment for a building of that
size.''
</P>
<P>
   Its three firefighters ran up to the fifth floor, Brockman said,
and called for a ladder truck to extend its aerial ladder up to a
fifth-floor window. The ladders carry hoses and connections, and
it's much quicker to use them than to try to lay hose up stairs in
such a building, Brockman said.
</P>
<P>
   But before the ladder could be set up, the trash fire turned
into an inferno.
</P>
<P>
   The roof and four floors collapsed to the bottom of the
building, and Brockman said the smouldering debris within the walls
is at least several feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   Brockman compared the mill fire to a 1981 fire at the abandoned
Westco Hat building on Trinity Avenue. The first three firefighters
to enter that building found only a small fire on the third floor.
The next thing anyone knew, all three came leaping out of a third
floor window _ two of them on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie firefighter Scott Duncan, 21, was killed, and two
veterans were permanently disabled. That fire was ruled arson, set
by a vagrant who lived in and around the building.

 &HT;    Hero firefighter thrust into spotlight
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Being heroic is easy, Atlanta firefighter Matt Moseley
found. It's what comes next that is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted to see him, thank him, touch him. The TV network
morning shows successfully sought individual predawn interviews.
The media in England called. Of course, local reporters were
clamoring constantly for his attention.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the elected officials. Vice President Al Gore
called. Mayor Bill Campbell, who has fought with the firefighters
union in which Moseley is a key player, wanted to talk to him. The
governor expected him at noon even though his shift should have
ended five hours earlier and it had been more than 30 hours since
he slept.
</P>
<P>
   Today it continues at City Hall with another ceremony to thank
him for pulling a construction worker off a crane 220 feet above a
roaring fire Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to getting my anonymity back, hopefully by
the end of the week,'' Moseley said as he was swarmed by reporters
at the Capitol when Gov. Roy Barnes recognized Moseley for this
role in the daring rescue of Ivers Sims at the Fulton Bag and
Cotton Mill.
</P>
<P>
   A state pilot maneuvered the helicopter while Moseley dangled in
high winds and smoke at the end of 50-foot-long nylon cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few things in modern life that excite us,''
Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   This was certainly one of them, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley's marathon work day started rather routinely at 7 a.m.
Monday. He expected it to be just like most other days he's had
since joining the Atlanta Fire Department in 1996 after spending
two years with the Fayette County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley, 30, of Locust Grove south of Atlanta, went to a
chemical spill in the morning, then ate lunch at Fire Station No. 4
on Ellis Street. He planned to spend the afternoon training, but
``it turned out I had something else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first crew called to the 120-year-old Cabbagetown mill,
Moseley headed to the top of the building with another firefighter,
expecting to ``get some hoes and knock it down.'' but the pair met
``Mr. fire and made a hasty retreat to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, Moseley was hooked to a harness in a rescue
broadcast around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The hours that followed were a whirlwind of cameras, interviews
and more firefighting. The media calls came until 2 a.m. Tuesday
when he was sent to a house fire that took two hours to put out.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the station house, Moseley had 30 minutes before he had
to get ready for a round of appearances on ``MSNBC,'' the ``Today
Show'' and ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many,'' he said, ``I can't remember them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Moseley met with Campbell followed by the governor. He
stood impassively at the foot of the Capitol steps, his hands
clasped in front of him, as Barnes praised him for demonstrating
``extreme courage, consideration'' in a ``dangerous and delicate
rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously exhausted but still graceful, Moseley shook the hands
of children and tourists, softly thanking them for their praise
while politely tolerating more questions from reporters armed with
cameras and microphones.
</P>
<P>
   What next, they wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go to the house and relax,'' Moseley said with no
hint of sarcasm. ``I think I'd much rather be up in the helicopter
than doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   He's back for another 24-hour shift Thursday.

   AMERICAN-ART-CENTURY (New York) _ Art-wise, was this really the
American century? We take the cliche for granted because, well,
because we are so arrogant. Never mind that its just a catch phrase
cooked up in 1941 by Henry Luce, the most thoroughly
unreconstructed of American chauvinists, partly out of missionary
zeal and partly to sell his magazine. The American Century is the
title of what looks to be an immense two-part survey at the Whitney
Museum of American Art, the first part of which, covering the years
1900 to 1950, will open Friday. It's one of several century-ending
extravaganzas (the Modern is planning another). And no doubt they
all, to some degree, will confront the cliche of American
predominance in visual art, deciding what it means and whether it
really makes sense. By Michael Kimmelman. Photo.

   60s-FILMS (Undated) _ A whiff of incense mixed with marijuana

<P>
   JUDSON-DANCE (New York) _ In the not too distant past it was my
good fortune to chance upon the performance of an arresting,
unconventional work. A luminous fabric comprising music both vocal
and instrumental, literary fragments from varied centuries and
civilizations, and everyday movement functioning as dance, it
projected an irresistible aura of good will and celebrated the
wonderful power of artistic persuasion. And, for the best of
reasons, it reminded me instantly of the Judson Dance Theater, that
whirlpool of restless creative spirits performing at Judson
Memorial Church at Washington Square in the 1960s. Now, 37 years
after they first began enjoying Judson's hospitality, a group of
those formerly young would-be creators, who found performance and
exhibition space when they needed it most, are expressing their
gratitude in ``No Limits _ A Celebration of Freedom and Art to
Benefit Judson Memorial Church.'' Some 75 dancers/choreographers,
poets, painters and sculptors are expected to participate in events
that began at the church last Friday and will run through this
Saturday. By Allen Hughes.

<P>
   NOBREGA-DANCE (Undated) _ Antonio Nobrega, a Brazilian performer
who will be making his United States debut at the Kennedy Center's
American Dance Festival April 27 through 29, trots out a variety of
characters in ``Figural,'' the one-man show he will use to greet
North American audiences. The figures he conjures, through mime,
dance, music and acrobatics, are not simply creatures of the
artist's fancy but a string of types meant as a showcase for
Brazil's culturally rich northeast. By Diana Jean Schemo.

   THEATER-NIGHTCLUB (New York) _ Coaxing nightclubs from
legitimate theaters is not unheard of. Florenz Ziegfeld found room
for one in 1915 atop his New Amsterdam Theater on West 42d Street.
Throughout the life span of Ziegfeld's ``Follies,'' the New
Amsterdam roof was the toniest nightspot in New York. But Joe's Pub
on Lafayette Street, is a much less lofty enterprise, carved as it
is from ground-floor back-office space at the theater. The $2.35
million club is the result, in part, of a construction and
renovation grant to the Public from city capital funds that
includes refurbishment of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
There were some doubters when the Pub opened in October about
whether the Public Theater could make a theater-night life alliance
work. Six months later, according to George C. Wolfe, the producer
of the Public Theater, Joe's Pub ``is actually doing better than I
thought it would.'' By Barry Singer.

   HISTORIC-RELEASES (Undated) _ Anyone who gets anywhere near a
record store or catalogue knows that ``historic'' releases are
coming from every direction. Legitimate enterprises like Nimbus's
``Grand Piano'' series and Philips's giant new survey of the
century's best pianists compete with pirate tapes of murky
legitimacy. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMER-COMPOSERS (Undated) _ Going to a contemporary-music
concert in the 1970s to hear new works by young Americans could
often be a discombobulating experience. The composers were
baby-boomers who had grown up with Motown, rhythm-and-blues and 60s
rock. Yet from some of the music they composed, you would have
thought that they had been living in gas-lit garrets in Vienna
during the 1920s, completely in thrall to the radical 12-tone works
of Schoenberg, Webern and Berg. By Anthony Tommasini.

<P>
   NY-ARTISTS (New York) _ What defines a New York artist at the
end of the 20th century? The question surfaced with the
announcement that the works to be exhibited at the next Whitney
Biennial would be chosen by a team of art professionals who neither
work at the museum nor live in New York. Maxwell L. Anderson, the
museum's director, spoke of giving the show a ``national
perspective.'' After 25 years of having New Yorkers select the
show, it could be interesting to reverse the gaze, as theorists
might say, and see what non-New Yorkers come up with. By Roberta
Smith.

   BROADWAY-THEATER-ARCHIVE (New York) _ A venture called the

some 40 years of the best of the American stage. WNET will
rebroadcast some of the productions as ``Treasures From the

Saturday. By Ralph Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   TV-WILL-AND-GRACE (Los Angeles) _ Last fall, when ``Will and
Grace'' had its premiere, television pundits took up column space
debating whether America was ready for a show about the sometimes
touching and always complicated intimacy between best-friend
roommates, one of whom is openly homosexual (Will) and the other, a
love-hungry heterosexual career gal (Debra Messing's Grace). But
viewers pronounced the discussion moot by declaring their love for
Sean Hayes's role as Jack McFarland. After three episodes, the NBC
promotions department decided to use Hayes's breakout status to
hype the show by broadcasting a 30-second Jack spot, complete with
a fever-pitch montage of Jack footage and a goofy Jack theme song.
By Margy Rochlin.

<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHANDELIER-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The Age of Reason was also the
Age of Reflection. Chandeliers dripped with cut-glass lusters,
moldings glimmered with gold leaf. Mirrors were placed behind
blazing candles and opposite sunny, full-length windows. And
surprisingly, at least some chimney pieces of the day were
literally architectural jewels, studded, paved and highlighted with
paste diamonds (in other words, rhinestones). ``There was such a
need to magnify the light candles gave out,'' said William Jay
Iselin, a former Christie's associate who now works with the
eminent Paris antiquary Ariane Dandois. ``Anything that could
refract light, to up the candle power, so to speak, was embraced.''
Recently exhibited at the Palm Beach International Art and Antiques
Fair, one of Iselin and Ms. Dandois's most spectacular finds is a
formally carved, rhinestone-studded chimney piece, circa 1790. The
chandelier, which is about 12 feet high and 14 feet wide, is for
sale at $95,000. By Mitchell Owens.

   KUKES, Albania _ As her family fled their decimated village, a
young bride exchanged jackets with her brother-in-law to protect
him from Serbs hunting down Kosovar men. Little thought did the
beautiful 22-year-old Shpresa Halimi give to becoming prey herself.
</P>
<P>
   But just after dark Monday, the young woman was spotted by a
helmeted Serb militiaman as her refugee caravan rumbled into the
town of Dakovica. It is the place the Pentagon reported last week
that Serb forces had been systematically rounding up young refugee
women to rape and sometimes to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Four Kosovar eyewitnesses told Cox Newspapers Tuesday that the
Serbian paramilitary soldier grabbed the tall, dark-haired woman
from the tractor wagon to keep for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, her father-in-law Ferhat Halimi related, the soldier
turned his head, looking for other women.
</P>
<P>
   Shpresa took the moment to try to escape, but the Serbian saw
her and riddled her back with Kalashnikov bullets from her head to
the base of her spine, said Halimi, who was inches from her when
she was shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely destroyed now,'' the bereaved husband Rasim
Halimi, 29, said just hours after the family crossed the border
into Albania on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of the Halimi family of Slatina is the latest crest in
the tide of tragic stories the Kosovar refugee population has lived
in recent weeks, as NATO warplanes bomb Serb military targets in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of refugees into countries neighboring Kosovo has
slowed since the Serb-run government of Yugoslavia apparently began
intermittently closing the border and turning back fleeing Kosovar
Albanians last week.
</P>
<P>
   But descriptions of life inside Kosovo, given by some of these
more than 4,000 refugees who were allowed to cross the border
overnight Monday, suggests that ethnic Albanians remaining in
Kosovo remain in hellish conditions.
</P>
<P>
   While impossible to confirm, details of the more than two-week
odyssey of the people from the Kosovo village of Slatina were told
with no deviation by more than a dozen people. Their story lends
credence -- and chilling reality -- to the Pentagon accusations
given at a Washington briefing last week and repeated Tuesday by
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our evidence ... comes from the women who have been taken to
that camp and are now in the refugee camps inside Albania,'' Cook
told reporters at the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``a number of aid workers'' -- including Americans in
the area -- ``have heard the same story from a number of women.''.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Halimi family and others from Slatina, a
strategically critical village overlooking the Pristina airport in
Kosovo, had gathered their tractors and wagons on the muddy edge of
this Albanian border city and were grieving losses that embraced
not just one beautiful woman.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before that killing, they said, a 13-year-old boy was
shot dead and his mother fatally wounded when Serb forces sprayed
gunfire into the makeshift plastic sheet covering their wagon as
they travelled. The reason? Their tractor had stalled.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   And a 16-year-old and his grandfather also were shot, the
refugees said, when the Serb troops first came to their village
late last month and told them to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was stolen -- the chickens, bread, televisions.
They burned the books,'' said Arta Berisha, 19. ``We left our
houses because they shot at us. We went into the mountains to live.
(Monday) they told us to leave the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   They spent 13 days in the open, often under rain. Early
mornings, villagers sometimes would sneak into town to retrieve
food or clothes when the Serb militia weren't in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Rahim Imeri, 60, said that on Monday morning a messenger came
from the Serbian forces at the airport down the mountain and
demanded the villagers send two envoys to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Imeri and two villagers descended to meet the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, 'If you don't get out in two hours we will kill you
all,''' related Imeri, a town leader. ``At about 12:10 (p.m. local
time) they came and attacked us. There was fear and panic.''
</P>
<P>
   A Serb unit shot over the heads of the villagers, who rushed
onto their wagons and left for refuge in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they said, Serb militia threw stones and shot at
the tires of their wagons. They saw not a single unscarred village.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling about 45 miles, the Slatina villagers were
stunned by the shooting of the boy and his mother. More bloodshed
would follow.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Four people in the wagon with Shpresa Halimi told separately
what happened next.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half an hour after the shooting, their wagon was
stopped by Serbia militiamen lining both sides of the road, said
Ferhat Halimi, the father-in-law of Shpresa.
</P>
<P>
   Halimi said one Serb came up close to the wagon, looked at the
girl and asked in Albanian, ``How old are you?''
</P>
<P>
   She answered that she was 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, Get down.''' He grasped her by the arm and forced her
onto the ground, said Halimi and three other relatives who related
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Serb turned his attention to another woman in the
wagon, Zahida Hahdini, a niece of Ferhat Halimi.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Hey you. You come down,' he said. I didn't move,'' remembered
Hahdini, a blonde-haired 32-year-old mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, I thought, 'If they ask me my age, I would say
more -- maybe that I am 40 -- so they wouldn't take me''' said
Hahdini.
</P>
<P>
   But then Shpresa, already out of the wagon, ran to the back of
it where her father-in-law was sitting. She crouched behind the
wooden cart, four eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her to come to me, and I grabbed her hand,'' said
Ferhat Halimi.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian militiaman saw Shpresa had fled, abandoned the
notion of finding another woman, then ran round the back of the
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   He opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was killed in my hand,'' said her father-in-law Ferhat
Halimi, weeping.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs told them to get out, to move on immediately, and
beckoned the next tractor in the caravan to come ahead, too, never
mind the body in the street.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the following tractor refused to ride over
Shpresa, so the paramilitary shooter grabbed the woman's body and
pulled it off to the side of the road, the family related.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning Tuesday, after the caravan had crossed out of
Serb-controlled territory to the safety of Albania, Shpresa
Halimi's death was sinking in.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother-in-law Arsim Halimi, 25, was wearing Shpresa's black
parka, sitting on the edge of the wagon with his face in his hands,
heaving with sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, more composed, he told how she had traded
her coat for his black leather jacket, so he would be less
noticeable to Serbian militias who think the leather jacket is a
favorite of Kosovo independence fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried to cover me, to protect me. She was a little afraid
to go on this trip, but she was more worried about us,'' said Arsim
Halimi, referring to himself and to his brother - Shpresa's husband
of less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   What the husband Rasim Halimi lost perhaps is embodied in the
name of the woman who died. Shpresa means ``hope'' in English.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what could he envision ahead in life, Rasim Halimi
bowed his head and was silent for a long moment. Finally he
answered through tears: ``Just to live free.''

UNDATED: to this society.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it is proven that El Hage participated in the embassy
bombings, Al-Hallak says he will be ``the first one to condemn his
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the imam says he is skeptical that prosecutors have a strong
case against his friend, ``based on the fact that they made such
allegations against a person like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Hallak said that in the past he has not cared about American
politics. But based on how federal authorities have handled the El
Hage case, ``I don't have trust in the government, to be honest
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   El Hage was not available to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Schmidt, who became El Hage's new defense attorney after
another lawyer was fired in March, said he believes that the
government is being too hard on him in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still perplexed by the restrictions placed on my client
and how his contacting the imam (in Arlington) would be a danger,''
Schmidt said in an interview in his Manhattan office, where 11
boxes of files on the government's case sit on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said he believes that authorities are overstating what
they consider evidence simply because of El Hage's race and faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about what seems to be a feeling of anti-Muslim
sentiment in the United States. ... It seems to breed hysteria,''
said Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   In the court documents, the government depicts El Hage as a
globe-trotting terrorist with indirect links to murders in New York
and Arizona and to the World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Lebanon, he was born a Christian and converted to
the Muslim faith. He became a citizen of the United States after he
married an American woman named April Ray.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in north Fort Worth in the mid-1980s and later spent
time in Afghanistan, Sudan and Kenya, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage first met with the FBI in New York on Sept. 23, 1997,
nearly a year before the embassy bombings and just after returning
to Arlington. He was asked about his involvement in bin Laden's
organization, known as ``al Qaeda,'' Arabic for ``the Base.'' An
FBI affidavit said El Hage lied about whether he knew that one of
bin Laden's top military commanders, Abu Ubaidah al Banshari, had
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, El Hage went before a federal grand jury which,
according to documents, was interested in the ``tactical goals and
corresponding terrorism targets'' of al Qaeda. The grand jury also
wanted to know whether El Hage, among others, provided ``logistical
support and training'' to terrorist forces who attacked American
and United Nations forces in Somalia in 1993 and early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage was asked at the time whether he still worked for bin
Laden. The panel also wanted to know about his relationship with
Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, nicknamed ``Harun,'' who the government
said was El Hage's ``deputy'' in Kenya, and a suspected terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, the FBI and other law enforcement officers
approached El Hage twice in Arlington, and each time El Hage lied
about what he knew of al Qaeda operatives, government documents
say.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the embassy bombings, authorities in Kenya arrested a
suspect, identified as Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, who said he was a
``close friend of El Hage.'' Odeh described the Arlington man's
``background in accurate detail,'' an FBI agent wrote. But when
agents later interviewed El Hage, he denied knowing Odeh and said
he did not recognize the man's picture.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury, jolted by the embassy bombings, stepped up its
investigation of El Hage, and questions were asked about his
efforts to obtain ``chemical weapons,'' a federal indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also said documents were found in Kenya that
``bore the name and code name'' of El Hage, and mentioned his
international travels ``to procure chemical weapons and their
components'' for the bin Laden organization.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents in New York show that the government also
suspects that El Hage, while living in Texas, tried to purchase
firearms for Mahmoud Abouhalima, who was later convicted in the
World Trade Center bombing. Abouhalima never picked up the guns
obtained by El Hage, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also linked El Hage to Rashad Khalifa,
described as a ``radical'' Islamic preacher who was murdered in the
late 1980s in Tucson, Ariz., at a time when El Hage lived there.
Court transcripts say El Hage ``entertained'' an unidentified
``tall man from New York'' who tailed Khalifa several months before
he was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they also want to know more about El Hage's trip
to Brooklyn in 1991 to take temporary control of the Alkifah
Refugee Center, a now-closed storefront on Atlantic Avenue that
once recruited rebels to fight the Soviets during the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   A day after El Hage's arrival, according to court records, the
center's founder, Mustafa Shalabi, disappeared. He was found slain
a week later in his apartment, which contained literature on
terrorism, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're not saying that this defendant (El Hage) physically
carried out that murder,'' Fitzgerald told a judge in September.
But the prosecutor said it was suspicious that El Hage seemed to be
around when the killings occurred in Arizona and in New York, and
that he tried to buy guns for a person who later helped bomb the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   But it was El Hage's movements in Afghanistan, Sudan and Kenya
that established him as a terrorism suspect _ and a player in the
embassy bombings, Fitzgerald said in a packed courtroom in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around him were principally responsible for the
bombing,'' he said, adding: ``His role is not to put a bomb down.
His role is to set up logistics, engage in coded correspondence,
move money and give false stories.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, 1998, while living in Arlington, El Hage was
subpoenaed to reappear before the grand jury in New York. He
boarded a plane by himself, but undercover FBI agents were close
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he knows it or not, he did not come alone,''
Fitzgerald told a U.S. magistrate several days later, after El Hage
had been taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was surveilled from the moment he was subpoenaed, 24 hours
a day, around the clock, until he got to the grand jury; to make
sure he didn't go anywhere. ... the government didn't trust him,''
Fitzgerald said.

NFL'S L.A. SEQUEL THREATENED BY OWNERSHIP SQUABBLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Conn.)  (nk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This metropolis unblushingly bills itself as the
entertainment capital of the world, and from Hollywood studios to
thrill-ride theme parks, oxygen bars and big Pacific rollers, it
can back up the boast. But when it comes to professional football,
the most popular sport in the country, Los Angeles has been stuck
in its own end-zone.
</P>
<P>
   Now that is about to change. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Football League announced that Los
Angeles was its first choice to receive the league's as yet unnamed
32nd franchise, bypassing a firm bid of $200 million in public
financing from Houston in favor of Los Angeles' lucrative
television market, which is bigger than many states and could help
the league's slipping TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch: Los Angeles, the town that couldn't keep a
team, now has not one but two competing proposed stadiums and owner
groups, each of them featuring ``guys with egos the size of
Montana,'' in the words of one City Hall aide. The league gave L.A.
until September to meet a range of demands, including a strong show
of support from the local business community, or lose the franchise
to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' quest says much about the difficulty of uniting
this disparate city of semiconnected suburbs around any idea, and
about its boosters' determination not to accept any status that
could be seen as second-class. It also bespeaks the tremendous
economic power of professional sports teams and their attraction
for wealthy owners, if not for municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is the No. 1 sport in America,'' said Michael Ovitz,
the onetime super-agent and current entertainment manager who is
leading a bid to build a new Spanish-style stadium and shopping
complex called the Hacienda on a vacant site in the suburb of
Carson, south of Los Angeles International Airport, with towering
mission bells that would ring on a home-team touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you not have football in this city? It doesn't make any
sense,'' Ovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The other proposal is led by the billionaire insurance and
construction executive Eli Broad and Edward P. Roski Jr., a real
estate developer who co-owns the NHL's Kings and the NBA's Lakers
and helped develop the new Staples Arena where those teams will
play downtown. Their plan would dramatically revamp the Coliseum
into a state-of-the art stadium, topping its famed peristyle facade
with bat-wing canopies and luxury suites.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither side has moved to compromise, though the city
establishment has shown a clear preference for reviving the
Coliseum as part of its efforts to revitalize the greater downtown
area. But unlike Houston, or Hartford, Conn., which recently lured
the New England Patriots with a pledge to build a $375 million
stadium, Los Angeles has shown no willingness to spend direct
public money on a new stadium, except for tax breaks on the revenue
a team might generate and freeway improvements already completed
near the Coliseum. Carson has offered a $150 million bond issue,
plus $30 million in cash, but the site there is a former dump that
would have to be cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   League officials make it quietly clear that their preference
would be for a unified proposal from the two groups. But both sides
here, while pledging cooperation, are waiting for the next move by
the league, perhaps as soon as next week when its expansion
committee arrives for a two-day tour of the sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's still a bit of confusion owing to the lack of
specifics from the league, in terms of a concrete choice,'' said
City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district surrounds the
Coliseum site and who has spent three years promoting it. ``The
league will have to make the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles's relationship with football has not been easy.
First the Rams decamped to Anaheim, in nearby Orange County, and
then, in 1995, to St. Louis. That same year, the Raiders abandoned
a star-crossed 12-year sojourn at the Coliseum and returned to
Oakland, leaving the nation's second-largest city without an NFL
team _ outclassed by the likes of Charlotte, N.C., Green Bay, Wis.,
and Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Angelenos did not care about football, the argument went. The
Coliseum, on the edge of the South-Central neighborhood torn by the
1992 riots, was not safe, the skeptics said. Too much traffic, too
little parking, too little vacant land and a lack of public
investment seemed to doom the city's hopes of attracting another
team.
</P>
<P>
   As the would-be owners jockey for advantage, plenty of skeptics
remain unpersuaded of the need for a team. A Los Angeles Times poll
last year found that only 38 percent of respondents considered it
at least ``somewhat important'' to have a team in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're economic boons for the region,'' Joel
Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute of Public
Policy in Malibu said of sports franchises. ``They may be economic
boons for people who have downtown real estate. Something like a
Staples Arena, which will be full a great deal of the time, and
bring in groups, yes. But football teams?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Basically a bunch of rich white guys go to the
games. I can't figure out how that makes much of a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   John Macks, a former political consultant who now writes for
``The Tonight Show,'' said: ``I grew up in Philadelphia and worked
in Washington. There it was the Eagles and the Redskins and it
defined your existence. Here nobody cares. First of all, it's not
raining and snowing on a Sunday in November. There are other things
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski acknowledged that rampant rowdyism at Raiders' games at
the Coliseum had left him unable to persuade his wife to go to
games there, adding: ``I could get my son-in-law; he had no
choice.'' But he said that since the Raiders left, the University
of Southern California has continued to play at the Coliseum _ the
site of the 1932 and 1984 Olympics _ without incident, ``and I'm
very hopeful that a team can get started and grow here.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has made it clear that it does not want the choice of a
site to dictate the choice of owners. Because Roski holds the
exclusive rights for the state-owned Coliseum site, that could be a
stumbling block, and he has offered to give up those rights if
necessary. Similarly, Ovitz said that if his rival bid at Carson,
which is backed by the billionaire grocery magnate Ron Burkle and a
bevy of movie stars like Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner, is seen as
an impediment to returning a franchise to Los Angeles, he would
step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selling L.A. first and selling location second,'' Ovitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the league made its announcement last month, civic leaders
were quick to float a scenario in which Ovitz would give up his
bid, and join Roski's group as a minority owner. But so far,
neither side is giving up, and league officials suggest the league
may simply select a site, then auction ownership rights to the
highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're all flying a little bit blind and waiting for
some direction,'' Roski said. ``We've done everything that the
league has asked us to do along the way. It would really be a shame
for this thing not to go through, so I think everybody's going to
work very hard to get it done.''

GATES GIVES $20 MILLION TO MIT COMPUTER LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Laboratory for Computer Science received a $20 million gift from
Microsoft Corp. chief executive Bill Gates, the latest donation to
the school toward the construction of a new technology center.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, from the William H. Gates Foundation, was announced
Tuesday at a ceremony marking the 35th anniversary of the lab, one
of the main centers for software development at the university.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Michael Dertouzos, the lab's director, also disclosed
details of a five-year research initiative called ``Oxygen.'' It
will focus on research designed to make access to computer networks
simpler, partly through advances in handheld, wireless computers
that can tap into larger information-storage devices. The project,
to be based at MIT's new technology center, will be funded
primarily through the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gates's latest gift follows a donation of $25 million that he
and fellow Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer made to Harvard
University in 1996 to fund computer science work there. Gates
attended Harvard as an undergraduate in the 1970s before dropping
out to start the Redmond, Wash., software giant he still heads.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's ongoing computer research also deserved significant
support, Gates said in a press conference Tuesday at MIT.
Researchers at the lab make up ``one of the few groups that has the
power to make the breakthroughs'' in software research, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such advances are needed in areas such as software testing and
design, said Gates in a speech earlier in the day at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, he added, about 5 percent of the United States
population is ``leading the Web lifestyle'' _ in other words, using
on-line sources and e-mail on a regular basis. Nearly 29 percent of
the country uses the Internet at least occasionally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for both those numbers to increase quickly, Gates said,
computer hardware and software must become easier to access from
remote locations. Ultimately, he said, people should be able to
``take the Web for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make it simpler, cheaper, and more relevant,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For MIT, Gates's gift is the third donation toward the
development of a facility designed by noted architect Frank O.
Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   The building, to be known as the William H. Gates Building, will
be part of the Ray &AMP; Maria Stata Center, named after the founder
and chairman of Analog Devices Inc. of Norwood. Stata and his wife
donated $25 million toward the project in late 1997. In addition,
MIT last year received $15 million toward the center from Alexander
W. Dreyfoos Jr., founder of Photo Electronics Corp., a maker of
color-photography equipment.
</P>
<P>
   With a scheduled completion date of 2003, the Stata Center's
total cost is estimated at $104 million. It will replace the
school's historic ``Building 20,'' which has housed research
projects on everything from radar to artificial intelligence.

   KUKES, Albania _ Yugoslav troops briefly took over an Albanian
border post Tuesday afternoon, lobbing mortar shells onto Albanian
territory and setting five houses ablaze, international observers
and Albanian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bold daylight raid heightened tension along Yugoslavia's
Kosovo border with Albania and provoked warnings from American
officials against widening the scope of the Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly armed Albanian border police withdrew from the remote
border post in Kamenica, (pronounced Kah-meh-NEE-tsah), in northern
Albania, as the Serbian troops advanced. Albanian officials said
that as the police forces retreated, regular army units advanced to
resist the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Angeli, spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the border, said the raid
started at around 1 p.m. and lasted for just over an hour. The
Serbian troops advanced about half a mile before stopping and
returning across the border into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any evidence that Yugoslav forces wanted to go
deeper inside Albania,'' Angeli said.
</P>
<P>
   No casualties were reported on either side, Angeli said. He had
no information on whether forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
separatist Albanian rebels in Kosovo, had been engaged as the Serbs
returned to their base.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to have bases in Albania near the area
where the raid took place. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is
the major republic in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Although brief, the raid is considered among the most serious in
a series of attacks on the border that observers say have been
escalating since the NATO allies began bombing Yugoslavia three
weeks ago,
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials quickly denied Western reports that it had
sent troops into Albania or had intended to draw Albania into the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Serbian state television, Milivoje Novkovic,
director of the Yugoslav Army Information Center, called the
reports of an attack a ``heinous lie,'' spread by terrorists in
Albania who want to make it seem like ``an alleged Yugoslav Army
invasion of Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albanian officials have reported numerous border attacks
from Yugoslavia during recent weeks. They accuse Yugoslavia of
attempting to provoke Albania, where thousands of troops from the
NATO allies are already stationed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Albanian government gave the allies access to
Albanian air space and military bases. Twenty-four Apache attack
helicopters from the United States are expected to arrive in
Albania shortly, where a special base is being set up to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said Tuesday that the
reports of an incursion by Serbian forces were being thoroughly
checked. But she made it clear that the United States and the
allies will not tolerate such provocations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said very clearly that we condemn Serbian efforts to
try to widen this conflict and NATO has made very clear it would
consider with the utmost seriousness any attempt by the Serbs to
act beyond their borders,'' she said at a news conference in Oslo,
where she was meeting with Russian officials to discuss the
conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from the European group stationed in the Kamenica area
_ in the rugged mountains of northern Albania, about 70 miles north
of the capital, Tirana _ said that the intensity of incidents at
the border has increased recently. But Tuesday's was the first in
which Serbian troops actually crossed the border and entered
Albanian national territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our monitors were able to see the houses in flames,'' said
Angeli, the group's spokesman. ``And we also know what happened
because when the border police withdrew from their post they
informed us immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to their posts later this afternoon, the border police
found several unexploded mortar shells that had to be cleared away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the fifth consecutive day of confrontation along the
border,'' Angeli said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the attack at Kamenica might have been staged in
retaliation for some earlier incident, but he had no details.
</P>
<P>
   The European group also reported another attack in Albania on
Tuesday, about six miles from the Albanian border. Two rockets
landed in the countryside, just north of the refugee camps set up
here in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   Observers reported hearing deafening explosions. When they
checked, they found that no one had been injured, but that the
force of the explosion killed five cows.
</P>
<P>
   The European group said it believes the rockets were launched in
Yugoslavia, not an errant firing from a rebel camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot confirm that but it is obvious it came from the
other side,'' Angeli said. ``That is what our monitors told us.''

   TECH-PRODUCTIVITY (Undated) _ For years, as the computer
revolutionized the workplace, productivity _ the output of goods
and services per worker _ stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a
year. Yet today, skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy are having second thoughts.
Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996, capped by a
surge in the second half of last year, after eight years of
economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past upward
swings in productivity typically occurred early in a recovery as
economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased hiring, it
slowed again. But something seems fundamentally different this
time, something apparently having a lot to do with the increased
speed and efficiency that the Internet and other pervasive
information-technology advances are bringing to the mundane
day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses. By Steve Lohr.

WRITING ABOUT TRAUMA IS SEEN TO EASE ILLNESS IN SOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Colo., Calif., N.D.)   (bl)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a powerful demonstration of how intimately mind and body are
linked, researchers have shown that writing about traumatic
experiences measurably improves the health of some patients
suffering from chronic asthma or rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma patients who wrote about ``the most stressful event they
had ever undergone'' for 20 minutes on three consecutive days, the
researchers found, showed significant improvements in lung function
four months later, compared with patients who spent the same amount
of time writing about neutral topics. Similarly, four months after
finishing the writing exercise, rheumatoid arthritis patients
showed less overall severity in their disease.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears in Wednesday's issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Association, is notable both for its size and
its scientific rigor. It included 107 patients with mild to
moderately severe asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, and the health of
the patients was monitored using objective physiological measures.
Doctors who took part in the study did not know whether or not the
patients they were examining had received the writing
``treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings add to increasing evidence that attention to
patients' psychological needs can play an important role in the
treatment of many physical illnesses, a view shared by many doctors
and nurses but one that has only recently begun to draw the
attention of the medical establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the journal report, Dr. David
Spiegel, professor and associate chairman of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at Stanford University, wrote, ``We have been
closet Cartesians in modern medicine, treating the mind as though
it were reactive to but otherwise disconnected from disease in the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients in the ``treatment'' group were instructed to write
down their ``deepest thoughts and feelings'' about the traumatic
experience, while control subjects wrote about their plans for the
day. Subjects in both groups were instructed to write continuously
for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy task,'' said Dr. Joshua Smyth, an
assistant professor of psychology at North Dakota State University
and the lead author of the study. ``The time goes very quickly and
you feel there's a lot more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients who wrote about traumatic experiences became very
involved in the task, Smyth said. Some cried or showed other signs
of emotional distress while writing. Few chose to write about their
illnesses. Instead, most wrote about the death of a loved one,
problems in a close relationship or disturbing events in childhood.
A few wrote of witnessing or being involved in a disastrous
incident like a train wreck or an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that of the 70 patients who wrote about
traumatic events, 47.1 percent showed significant improvement in
their health at the end of four months, 48.6 percent showed no
change and 4.3 percent got worse. In the control group, 24.3
percent showed improvement, 54.1 percent showed no change and 21.6
percent got worse.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth, who conducted the research with colleagues while at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook School of Medicine,
said the results were meaningful not only because significantly
more patients who wrote about stressful experiences improved but
also because many patients whose conditions might have been
expected to worsen instead showed no change.
</P>
<P>
   Why writing about traumatic experiences works remains unclear,
Smyth said. Nor is it known how long-lasting the improvement is, or
what factors make it more likely that an individual will improve.
</P>
<P>
   But Smyth and others suspect that the writing task may be
effective because it lets patients synthesize and make sense of
their experiences. Like psychotherapy, Smyth said, the writing
allows patients to alter the way they think about an event, giving
it order and structure. This process, he noted, is very different
from the intrusive and upsetting rumination that often follows
traumatic events, a process that has been shown to have
physiological effects, among them increases in heart rate and in
the levels of stress hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Previous work by other researchers has shown that in healthy
subjects the writing exercise can reduce visits to doctors, improve
subjective well-being and increase some indicators of immune-system
functioning. The new study is the first to test the effects on
medical conditions of the writing exercise, which was developed by
Dr. James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas at
Austin, and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel, author of the journal's editorial, said he was
surprised ``by the vigor of the biomedical outcome'' in the new
study, ``given the truly minimalist intervention.'' But he said it
was increasingly clear that the way patients responded to being
sick often affected the course of their illnesses. For some
patients, he said, illness may trigger associations to past
traumatic events that were beyond their control, causing the body
to respond ``as if you're being assaulted rather than just being
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, Holocaust survivors who develop cancer
sometimes find that the disease revives the feelings of
helplessness, loss of control and physical intrusion they
experienced earlier in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The new study underlines the role of stress in both asthma and
rheumatoid arthritis and alerts doctors to their patients'
emotional needs. But Smyth cautioned against generalizing the
findings too broadly. ``I really do believe that it's premature to
advocate this as a part of therapy,'' Smyth said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Klinnert, an associate faculty member in pediatrics at
the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, who
studies the relationship of stress to the onset of asthma, said she
welcomed the findings because they confirmed her clinical
observations. ``It's exciting that someone could document it,''
Klinnert said.

 &HT;    Ex-speaker takes up political agenda at fund-raiser
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich, the self-styled revolutionary who
now commands princely sums for his oratory, will star at a
$1,000-a-head dinner here tonight to benefit a charity and his
future in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing his involvement with GOPAC, the Republican organization
he once led, Gingrich is offering his most generous contributors
fancy dinners and regular meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's dinner is Gingrich's first major fund-raising event
since he left office in January. It is part of a two-day Washington
visit for big givers to the Friends of Newt Gingrich political
action committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Salute to Newt gala is expected to draw some of the
capital's top lobbyists, including former Gingrich aides and
colleagues in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Mary Tyler Moore will introduce Gingrich and praise his
work on behalf of juvenile diabetes, and a portion of the event's
proceeds will go to research into the disease. Jay Leno, host of
NBC's ``Tonight Show,'' will roast Gingrich via videotape.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 members of Congress, including Speaker Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), are expected to attend, although Gingrich
spokesman Mike Shields said votes in the Senate and House of
Representatives could keep some members away.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far cry from recent years when GOPAC dinners were
aired live on C-Span and the House's voting schedule neatly
conformed to Gingrich's political obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the political message Gingrich's supporters hope to
deliver this evening is that Gingrich remains relevant despite
having given up his seat in Congress after last year's
disappointing Republican showing in midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way for people to know that Newt Gingrich is still
interested in public issues,'' said Matt Towery, the former Georgia
state legislator and Gingrich campaign chairman. Towery is part of
a Georgia contingent that is expected for tonight's event.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has been seen in neighborhood coffee shops and at local
airports, but he has not given a public speech in the capital since
November, shortly after he announced he would step down as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   He has granted no interviews, aside from an appearance on Leno's
show.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gingrich has joined the conservative Washington think
tank American Enterprise Institute as a senior fellow and the board
of Forstmann, Little &AMP; Co., a mergers and acquisition firm.
</P>
<P>
   He is at work on a book and on forming a consulting business,
and he is giving speeches for fees reported to be as high as
$50,000 an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   His political supporters also have kept Gingrich's PAC account
flush. It ended 1998 with $275,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Shields would not say how much money might be added to the
account through tonight's fete or how many tickets have been sold.
But he said he expects the 500 seats in the Capital Hilton ballroom
to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, drawing on his success in attracting campaign cash,
also has recently signed his name to a fund-raising letter sent by
the Republican National Com- mittee.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, sent the first week of March, went to fewer than
100,000 Republican donors, RNC spokesman Michael Collins said.

MONUMENT TO HOLOCAUST ERECTED IN VATICAN GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>

 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Catholic and Jewish leaders Tuesday erected a stark
reminder of the Holocaust in a garden that belongs to the Vatican:
a 4-foot-high bronze menorah specially fitted with six candles to
symbolize the six million Jews who were killed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The menorah, which was delivered by a group of Jewish leaders
from New Jersey and New York, was placed in a corner of the
courtyard of the Pontifical North American College of Rome, a
seminary which, while standing outside St. Peter's, is Vatican
property.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first permanent Holocaust memorial on Vatican
territory, and it was placed there on Yom ha-Shoah, the annual day
of remembrance of the six million Jewish victims, as a symbol of
the growing reconciliation of Catholics and Jews after the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a another very positive sign how far the process of
dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people has
come,'' said Cardinal Edward Cassidy, president of the Holy See's
Commission on Religious Relations with Jews, standing alongside
several rabbis before lighting a candle on the menorah. ``Even just
a few years ago we could never have imagined such an event could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But other comments by religious leaders at the ceremony, as well
as those of some who did not attend, mainly underscored some of the
disputes straining relations between the Vatican and leading Jewish
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, Jewish-Catholic relations have never been
better,'' said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World
Jewish Congress, who was not invited to the event. ``But
paradoxically, Vatican-Jewish relations have gotten worse over the
last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The original idea for the menorah came from Gunther Lawrence,
executive director of the Interreligious Information Center of New
York City. His proposal was immediately accepted by Cassidy and the
leaders of the North American College. On Wednesday, the American
Jewish and Catholic delegations are expected to make a joint
presentation of a miniature of the menorah to Pope John Paul II at
his weekly general audience.
</P>
<P>
   But the project was launched without the approval or the
cooperation of some of the leading Jewish organizations, such as
the World Jewish Congress or the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   The two highly influential organizations had attacked as
inadequate the Vatican's apology for the failure of most Catholics
to resist the mass killing of European Jews. The Vatican document,
entitled ``We Remember: Reflections on the Holocaust,'' was
released a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   What is simmering beneath the criticism is a deep rift over the
role of Pope Pius XII during the war. The Vatican, which contends
that he never spoke out publicly against Nazi atrocities only out
of fear of mass retaliations and that he personally helped save
thousands of Jewish lives, has plans to make him a saint. Jewish
groups dispute the Vatican's defense of Pius XII, and bitterly
oppose any plans to beatify him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Partly because of the clashing views of Pius XII's role in the
Holocaust, major Jewish organizations have also been highly
critical of the Vatican's handling of its World War II archival
materials, complaining that the Vatican has withheld key documents
from public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In return, those organizations have been rebuked by Vatican
officials. In his address Tuesday, Cassidy reminded his audience of
a speech he wrote last February expressing disappointment over
Jewish organizations' failure to respond to a Vatican offer to
jointly examine 12 volumes of documents relating to the Holocaust
that have already been made public. The cardinal complained of
``insensitivity on the part of some Jewish organizations in
relation to what we were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish figures who attended Tuesday's ceremony expressed
sympathy for the Vatican position. Rabbi Jack Bemporad, who is the
director of the Center for Interreligious Understanding at Ramapo
College, in New Jersey, and a veteran of interfaith conferences,
delivered a speech defending the pope and Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the group also expressed disagreement with the stance
of organizations like the World Jewish Congress. ``This is not a
time to be strident,'' said David H. Lincoln, senior rabbi of
Manhattan's Park Avenue Synagogue, who said kaddish, the mourner's
prayer, at the ceremony. ``There are important things we can do
between Catholics and Jews given the total cooperation we already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said that while there is some diversity of opinion
within Jewish organizations, he suspected that Vatican officials
had deliberately sought out Jewish leaders that are outside the
mainstream of Jewish opinion. ``I have to say today's event raised
my suspicion that they are playing an old game of playing
favorites,'' he said, ``and that is not the way to engage in
genuine dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who conceived of the Holocaust memorial three years
ago and persuaded an Israeli artist, Aharon Bezalel, to create it,
said the sculpture speaks for itself. ``We are taking something
very Jewish and putting it on Vatican ground,'' he said. ``Surely,
everybody can unite on that.''

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS URGE CLINTON TO PREPARE FOR GROUND WAR 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional leaders urged President Clinton on
Tuesday to begin preparations for a ground war in Kosovo, even as
the House and Senate shied away from voting this week on
authorizing the commitment of U.S. troops to battle Yugoslav
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary push from Republican and Democratic lawmakers
to use ground troops as part the overall NATO campaign in the
Balkans came in a meeting at the White House in which Clinton
offered a ``forceful'' presentation, as one participant put it, of
the damage inflicted on Serb military operations by three weeks of
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked the 58 members of Congress in the meeting for
approval of billions of dollars in emergency funding to help pay
for the war effort through the end of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to present a detailed
assessment of the costs in a hearing Wednesday on Capitol Hill. But
administration officials said Tuesday that estimates range from $3
billion to $4 billion incurred thus far to as much $10 billion to
$12 billion if the NATO air campaign continues well into the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the money, which is likely to come from the
budget surplus, is also needed for the U.S. relief effort for
Kosovo refugees and to provide ``urgently needed assistance to
front-line states'' bordering Yugoslavia, ``who are struggling to
preserve their own stability as they cope with refugees and turmoil
in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These expenses are an immediate and urgent emergency. They are
necessary so that we and our NATO allies can continue to pursue
this mission,'' the president said in brief remarks at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Following the meeting with Clinton, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, said the president believes the air campaign ``is
working'' and there ``is no need for the insertion of ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the president's briefing, Armey said a ``general
consensus'' has emerged among congressional leaders to put off what
could be a potentially divisive vote on committing U.S. ground
troops and declaring all-out war against Yugoslavia. He said
Republican and Democratic leaders believe that the NATO air
campaign needs more time to work before moving to a full-blown
debate on the floor over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's view was echoed by other lawmakers attending the
meeting. They said Clinton reminded them that the allied Desert
Storm operation against Iraq included 44 days of nearly continuous
bombing. But the NATO pounding of Yugoslavia, which started 21 days
ago, has been hampered by bad weather, preventing allied planes
from achieving as much damage to military targets as NATO
commanders had hoped for at this stage in the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said Clinton stressed that the
alliance ``needs to be calm and determined, and proceed forward in
a very methodical way'' because ``there's a lot that yet can be
achieved by air.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton emphasized his belief that the bombing effort
alone eventually will force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to pull his forces out of Kosovo, Kerry said the president did not
rule out the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from the president ... that he does not personally
believe at this time that they will be necessary to achieve the
goal,'' Kerry said. ``But he did say that nothing is off the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry and several other lawmakers urged Clinton to begin
planning for an allied invasion of Kosovo, beginning with the
placement of supplies, equipment and support personnel in
front-line states in the event Milosevic continues his refusal to
bow to NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said that NATO does have a plan for ground forces,
but so far allied commanders have not begun preparations for using
them.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who pressed the case for preparing
more forcefully than anyone else in the meeting, said a NATO ground
war against Serb forces is inevitable unless Milosevic can be
convinced that his military will be ``eliminated'' and his hold on
power ended. But to do that, Lugar said, NATO must undertake
visible planning for a ground war.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., however, said he sees evidence that
ground troops are already engaged in the fight and called the
debate over whether to commit them ``a phony issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got three men captured. Our troops cut rail lines (from
other countries into Yugoslavia), and we're sending 4,000 into
Albania in support of Apache helicopter operations,'' Kerrey said.
``We've crossed the Rubicon here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a Medal of Honor recipient who lost a leg in the Vietnam
War, cautioned against underestimating the determination of
Milosevic and his military to dig in and hold out against the air
campaign. He suggested that a ground fight could be long and
bloody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got personal experience with how trenching tools defeated
B-52s,'' he said. ``If their will to fight remains, we've got a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of committing U.S. troops to a ground war in the
Balkans has thrown Congress into turmoil about what position to
take. While some members openly call for the commitment of U.S.
forces and would support a declaration of war against Yugoslavia,
others would like to end U.S. participation in the air campaign by
denying funding to continue the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Tuesday, however, that
``all of us'' should support the funding ``we need to do this
job,'' if for no other reason, because U.S. forces are engaged in
combat. But she said there are ``still many questions about where
we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., meanwhile, is pressing the GOP
House leadership to schedule a vote on whether to formally declare
war on Yugoslavia or to order the president to end involvement of
U.S. forces in the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who believes the United States is ``engaged in a war
that has not been declared,'' has filed a resolution with the House
that would force a vote on the matter by May 15 under the terms of
the 1973 War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   He said if the leadership fails to allow the vote, he plans to
file a motion in federal court in hopes of having Clinton's
commitment of forces declared unconstitutional.

RUSSIA'S ECONOMY STARTS TO STABILIZE, SAYS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After months of decline, the Russian economy is
beginning to show some stability, according to a monthly report
issued Tuesday by an independent research organization and the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue of the report, ``Russian Economic Trends,''
noted small increases in consumer spending and industrial
production in February and a falling inflation rate in March.
</P>
<P>
   Together, such shifts substantiate a widely held opinion here
that the effects of last August's economic crisis have not been as
dire as feared. Russia has so far averted hyperinflation, a free
fall in the value of the ruble and a continued steep drop in
economic output.
</P>
<P>
   But the report's authors and other economists said that such
stability could prove temporary, especially if Russia's political
situation, shaky in the last few weeks, grows more volatile or if
the government fails to receive a badly needed refinancing package
it is now discussing with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The economic indicators ``give ground for cautious optimism,''
said Peter Westin, an economist with the Russian European Center
for Economic Policy, an author of the report. ``But how sustainable
is the trend?''
</P>
<P>
   Industrial output rose 2.5 percent in February to the highest
level since May-June 1998. Construction, agriculture and retail
trade also grew. The increases, however, are driven by the
devaluation of the ruble, not by government policy, the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble has fallen from an exchange rate of about 17 cents in
August to 4 cents, resulting in a sharp decrease in imports because
they are so much more expensive when purchased in rubles. But some
Russian manufacturers have increased production to fill the supply
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devaluation has been a huge shot in the arm for domestic
producers,'' said Peter Boone, head of research at the Moscow
brokerage firm of Brunswick Warburg.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending increased in March for the first time since
August, most likely as Russians spent some savings for purchases
they feared would get more expensive because of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet inflation itself rose in March by 2.8 percent, compared to
4.1 percent in February. Over all, inflation has risen at an
annualized rate of about 97 percent over the seven months of the
crisis; while severe, that hasn't proven catastrophic to the
economy, said Rudiger Ahrend, director of the Russian European
Center for Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the relatively low monthly inflation rates is
that wages and pensions have held steady. Though the earning power
of most Russians has fallen precipitously, many have found ways to
adapt to increased hardship and have not really pressured the
government to raise state salaries or fix prices. The government
itself has taken steps to minimize inflation, raising the supply of
money by a moderate 25 percent in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many economists believe it would take very little to
destabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the wrenching economic changes needed in
industry and banking will be legislated soon, since parliamentary
and presidential elections are scheduled in the next 15 months. And
even with the signs of stability noted by the report, there are
troubling trends.
</P>
<P>
   The government's foreign-currency reserves, for example, fell to
a four-year low in March to $10.8 billion, partly because of
central bank purchases of rubles to prevent the Russian currency
from falling too steeply.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in reserves comes as Russia tries to restructure
payments on $150 billion in foreign debt, which consumed 40 percent
of the budget earlier this year. An IMF mission in Moscow is
negotiating a loan refinancing package with the government, and a
recommendation by the mission could come next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials went to Paris on Tuesday to begin negotiations
with nations that hold part of the foreign debt. The Russians are
expected to ask the creditors to forgive as much as 75 percent of
the debt and restructure payments due this year and next.

 &HT;    Rescued crane operator describes mill fire from over 200 feet in
air
 &HT;    By Jennifer Ffrench-Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Each day, after a 1 1/2 hour drive from Woodland,
Ala., to Atlanta, Ivers Sims climbs dozens of stairs in the center
of his crane 220 feet above the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill.
</P>
<P>
   He takes his lunch, a radio to communicate with his co-workers
below and a meter to measure wind gusts. ``I stay up there eight to
12 hours a day,'' he said, adding that he comes down only for
bathroom breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was to be a normal day. His Hammerhead crane was lifting
heavy beams in and out of the 1800s mill building that was being
gutted for residential loft apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Around 2 p.m., he noticed smoke curling up from the inside the
old building. At first it wasn't enough to alarm Sims, 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a small fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He watched some of his co-workers scurry from the top of the
building and put a hose to the fire. But it never occurred to him
to hurry down, Sims said Tuesday after a news conference at Atlanta
Medical Center, where he was treated for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more worried about them,'' he said. ``I stayed just in
case there was something I could do to help put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the fire _ fanned by 30 to 40 mph gusts of wind _ started
to spread. For the first time Sims thought of himself. He realized
he couldn't get down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to worry about myself then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Brown, area director for the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration's Atlanta West Area Office, said Sims was trapped
because heat from the fire cut off his escape down the central
stairway in his crane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the potential for a serious incident, but happily it
turned out OK,'' said Brown, who had staff at the old Cabbagetown
mill soon after the drama began unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose office inspects construction sites and workplace
accidents, said being trapped by fire in a crane is not a usual job
hazard for crane operators like Sims, who number 1,220 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more typical for cranes to collapse or for workers below
to be struck by materials dangling from cranes,'' said Brown whose
office oversees Georgia's 32 western and northern counties
including Fulton.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Brown said, OSHA has investigated about five
construction accidents involving cranes including one in Atlanta in
which a cement bucket dangling from a crane hit and killed a worker
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA is not investigating Monday's incident at the mill, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sims, a soft-spoken man, was rescued after about an hour and a
half on the crane. The cab he spends his days in caught fire from
the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost red hot,'' he said. ``It was a blessing the wind
was blowing so strong. It kept the heat off me.''
</P>
<P>
   To escape the heat that made his shoes ``real hot,'' Sims
crawled to one end of the crane and laid on his belly.
</P>
<P>
   While he waited, he kept in touch by radio with his supervisor.
He also spoke with Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   They told him someone would come to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Sims worried that the wind would make it difficult for the
helicopter and the firefighter to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   When Matt Moseley was lowered from a helicopter to get him, Sims
said he told the firefighter to be careful where he stepped because
the crane was hot.
</P>
<P>
   He had already worked out in his mind that he would have to wear
a body harness. He followed Moseley's directions and put his leg
through the harness and hooked it around him.
</P>
<P>
   As the helicopter lifted the pair to safety, Sims, who has been
a crane operator for 10 of his 21 years in construction, said he
felt no fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am used to heights,'' he said. ``I was just a little worried
the line might break.''
</P>
<P>
   Safely rescued, he wanted to ``kiss the ground'' but was hustled
off on a stretcher to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Sims, who had been at the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill
construction site for about six months, said he would take about
three weeks off but intend to be back on the job for his employer,
Jasper Construction Co.
</P>
<P>
   Crane operators like Sims are in demand in Atlanta's boom
economy. Statewide, they average an hourly wage of $12.96, said
Mike Wald, a regional economist with the U.S. Department of Labor,
Bureau of Labor Statistics. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA's Brown said there are enough cranes towering against
Atlanta's skyline for construction workers to call the Hammerhead
cranes ``the state bird of Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrust into the public spotlight by his predicament, Sims said
he didn't mind the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am glad to be here,'' he said. ``I don't mind as long as I
was here.''

SHANGHAI: A VESSEL FOR CHINA'S TREASURES

<P>
   At the center of China's largest and most cosmopolitan city,
Shanghai's city fathers have completed a showcase of urban planning
that reflects the times. A park in the middle of Shanghai, a
long-neglected city that has been pegged by Chinese leaders as a
model for the entire country, now embodies the best of China's
efforts to become a more sophisticated and a culturally richer
society.
</P>
<P>
   The park is still called by its original name, People's Square,
in keeping with the Communist political orientation that continues
to govern China. Yet People's Square now actually seems to offer
city residents a place to enjoy on their own terms, rather than at
the instruction of a paternalistic state. Visitors are welcome. In
fact, Shanghai's leaders are so proud of the square, they hope and
expect it will draw lots of tourists.  &QL;

   The jewel of this revitalized area is the Shanghai Museum, a
marvelous contemporary building the color of sand and the shape of
an ancient Chinese urn, designed by a team of local architects. It
houses a majestic collection of Chinese art, easily the finest in
the country.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Catty-corner across the square is a spanking new opera house,
the Shanghai Grand Theater, another distinct architectural triumph
in a land where hasty construction in recent years has littered
China's cities with excess chrome and garish colored glass. The
opera house, designed by a French architect, Jean-Marie
Charpentier, has a curved roof that opens toward the sky like a
giant offering plate. ``Aida'' was performed there last fall, and
concerts and other performances are held nightly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park that lies in between these two new cultural monuments,
with pleasant pathways lined with flowers and greenery, completes
the square's sudden, more civilized, incarnation. A new City Hall
on the far side of the park may look dull compared with its
neighbors, but at least it avoids the Stalinist excesses of most
government buildings elsewhere in China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, People's Park reflects the remarkable
transformation that Shanghai has witnessed in this century. In
colonial days, when the city was dominated by French and British
and American traders who divided it into foreign ``concessions''
with competing governments, police forces, and styles of dress, the
park was home to a race track where straw-hatted foreigners could
parade in their Sunday finery. After the Communist revolution in
1949, the area became a barren square of concrete, a place to hold
mass rallies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, People's Park was the site of rallies by Red
Guards, who often dragged ``bourgeois'' offenders to its center to
be punished. In the years that followed, the square remained bleak
and empty, as Shanghai languished and fell behind other areas of
China.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1990s the city was given the go-ahead, and the
money, to redevelop Shanghai into China's premier metropolis, and
People's Park was transformed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One component, the Shanghai Museum, for years was housed in a
dank old bank building that belonged to Shanghai's biggest
gangster, Du Yuesheng, before the revolution. In 1992, eager to
find a better showcase for their high quality collection, the
museum's directors took a risk, selling their old building to a
real estate developer for $25 million _ even though they had no
place to move. The collection was without a permanent home for four
years while the museum directors raised the rest of the money
needed for a new building and battled the city's bureaucracy for
the right to give it a prominence befitting its rich contents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Foreign donors, many of them Shanghai-born emigrants in New
York, London and Hong Kong, provided part of the financing. The
directors also relied on foreign connections to arrange visiting
exhibitions and to obtain modern lighting and humidity systems.
When the museum opened in 1996, its 11 exhibition spaces were named
for prominent foreign donors, who had contributed around $10
million in total.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum houses a first-class collection of bronze, porcelain
and Chinese painting, as well as impressive displays of
calligraphy, jade and classical furniture. Visiting exhibitions
often include 20th-century art. Even better, the presentation is at
once impeccable and accessible to those unfamiliar with Chinese
art, with labels in both Chinese and English.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum costs only $2.50, or 60 cents, for anyone with a
student card. A recorded guide costs an additional $5, and narrated
in Chinese, Japanese, French or excellent English, is well worth
it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of ancient bronzes on the ground floor may have
been given a premier location because it is the area of expertise
for Ma Chengyuan, the founding director of the museum, who recently
retired. Tastefully decorated in dark green, the hall is lighted
only dimly, which gives an extra luster to the pieces on display,
positioned on plexiglass stands that are so simple as to be nearly
invisible.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bronze epitomizes China's ancient civilization, and bronze
artifacts became treasured possessions of Chinese aristocrats in
the earliest known Chinese societies, more than 2,500 years ago.
Although bronzes are often denied star billing, the bronzes in the
Shanghai Museum are so impressive that they should not be passed
up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 400 pieces on view, though the museum owns
more than 6,000 pieces altogether. Many of those on display remain
well preserved because they accompanied their owners to the grave. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although first made as simple implements, by the height of the
Shang Dynasty (16th to 11th century B.C.) bronzes were made with
designs of brilliant and intricate beauty. A popular form was the
three-legged ding, a vessel often decorated with animal-shaped
masks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finest examples were originally designed as vessels
for wine, food or water, although Chinese nobles collected them in
a strict social system that specified how many bronzes one could
own, depending on social rank. A duke, for instance, might be
allowed to own seven, or five, or three or only one, depending on
his rank. To question one's allotment of bronzes was to challenge
the entire social system on which rank was based.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.) brought a flowering
of China's bronze age. One of most most striking pieces is a wine
vessel in the shape of an ox, with curved horns and a ring through
its nose, bug-eyed as though it had just been fired in a mold that
would keep it standing in the same position for millenniums.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ground floor also houses a sculpture gallery and an
exhibition hall. On the second floor, the ceramics section is
particularly rich. As a welcoming explanation at the entryway puts
it bluntly: ``Pottery belongs to all mankind, but porcelain is
China's creation.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The collection, displayed in one extended gallery, encompasses
ceramics from the pottery of neolithic times, to the creation of
celadon in the first century A.D., to the polychromed pottery of
the Tang Dynasty and the fine white porcelain of the Song Dynasty,
up to the 20th century.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the prizes here are the pieces that chronicle the invention
of underglazing blue porcelain in the 13th century A.D. that
brought a new richness and depth to the finish of porcelains.
Perhaps bringing Chinese ceramics to their finest moment, a
mountain town called Jingdezhen became the center of production for
porcelain, a position it held until the 20th century. Today,
Jingdezhen is still producing porcelains, but most of them are
cheap imitations intended to be sold as antiques.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum's calligraphy and painting galleries on the third
floor are beautifully designed, with wooden floors and traditional
Chinese roofing. Scroll paintings, many of them a delicate mixture
of painting and calligraphy, are magnificently displayed on
specially designed tables that tilt toward the viewer. The visitor
may notice that the dim lighting brightens as soon as an overhead
sensor detects his approach, then dims again to prevent fragile
paintings from fading from exposure to the light.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A charming tea pavilion on the second floor offers a distinctly
Chinese setting for tea, with carved wooden windows of the Qing
Dynasty set into the walls. The museum store on the ground floor is
excellent, offering a broad choice of ceramics, silk, stylized
boxes, jewelry and screens, and a particularly fine choice of art
and history books. Silk scarves, at $5 to $10, are good value. So
is jade jewelry, from $5 to $100. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai Museum, at 201 Renmin Dadao in People's Park, is
open every day from 9 a.m to 5 p.m.

SOUTH AFRICA'S PROBLEM OF POACHING GOES BEYOND ANIMALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETTY'S BAY, South Africa &UR;  &LR; _ Poachers take their chances when
they raid the small but fertile section of coastline that Mike and
Linda Tannett watch from the porch of their retirement getaway
here.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tannett, 56, has decked a 31-year-old poacher with one
punch, grabbed his car keys and kicked him across a gravel road so
hard he scraped the skin off his legs.
</P>
<P>
   On quiet afternoons, Mike Tannett, 58, has made arrests while
unarmed and barefoot. But after dark he sometimes sits up late in
the dunes with his night-vision scope. If he spots figures slipping
into the water, he radios for a friend with an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Poaching in South Africa is not restricted to the dramatic
things everyone has heard of, like elephant tusks and rhinoceros
horns. Those animals are generally safe here, thanks to well-armed
rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some of the things hauled out of the wild are so
obscure that their names are hard to pronounce. At the moment,
three of the biggest prey items are cycads (pronounced SIGH-kud),
buchu (BOO-choo), and perlemoen (PAIR-luh-moon). The first is
stolen only for the rich, the second for the poor, the third for
Chinese restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the funny names, they are no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Perlemoen is the local word for abalone, and with its price
reaching $135 a pound in Asia, the trade is worth millions. A
low-intensity war has been going on over perlemoen on the coast.
People have been shot, beach houses burned down, police cars
flipped over and mercenaries hired by landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Cycads are ancient plants that date back 300 million years and
were nibbled by dinosaurs. The rarest have sold for up to $15,000
before ending up in Johannesburg gardens or as decor on the grounds
of casinos. The battle to preserve them is fought more with science
than bullets as rangers try to find every wild one and hide a
microchip inside that can finger any new owner as a thief.
</P>
<P>
   Buchu is of the rutaceae family of aromatic herbs, with smells
ranging from licorice to lemon, once used by the Khoi-khoi, the
original inhabitants of the Cape, to treat everything from bruises
to kidney problems. In the 19th century, it was a lucrative export
to Europe, and an 1824 law made it a misdemeanor to ``tear up'' the
plant. It is not yet endangered, but illegal pickers have been
caught with hundreds of pounds of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest problem is a lack of knowledge of what's really
happening to African wildlife,'' said Superintendent Piet Lategan,
commander of the South African police's Endangered Species Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, founded 10 years ago to catch ivory and rhino horn
smugglers, has expanded to fight the growing trade in snakes,
tortoises, cactuses, aloes, parrots, and even rare beetles, not to
mention the smugglers of lemurs from Madagascar and chimpanzees
from central Africa who change planes in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing these laws can be trickier than catching drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Jurisdictions are a hodgepodge. A forest by the seaside might be
run by a local parks department while the tide pools a few yards
away ``can be the responsibility of some guy in Pretoria who never
sees the ocean,'' said Craig Spencer, a conservation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Also, identification is a problem. Customs agents are seldom
beetle buffs; and a beat cop asked to help raid a nursery might not
know a cycad from a cyclamen.
</P>
<P>
   Lategan said he once caught a man with 197 scorpions. It
definitely looked suspicious, he said, but he himself could not
tell if they were an endangered subspecies. He put five in an
envelope and headed for a flight to a university town with an
entomology department. The security guard at the airport asked,
``What's in the envelope?'' he said. ``I said, `Pets.' He took one
look and waved me through.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, this being South Africa, the issue has a racial aspect.
Many ardent conservationists, like the Tannetts, are
English-speaking whites, while poachers, especially near Cape Town,
tend to be impoverished people of mixed race.
</P>
<P>
   Their ancestors have gathered abalone and lobster for centuries
_ or millenniums, if you count the Khoi-khoi ancestry to which some
lay claim _ and they argue that their birthright is being snatched
away just as it has become valuable.
</P>
<P>
   They have long been resentful because, under the old apartheid
government, the biggest shellfish quotas went to whites connected
with the governing National Party. And now, the new black-led
government, trying to turn the ship of state around and make it
deliver housing, electricity and water, has bigger things on its
mind than the abalone.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, crime has flourished. Near Hawston, a depressed
fishing village, gangs have become so big that they intimidate the
police, said Maria Hauck, a University of Cape Town criminologist
who studies the industry. ``Up to to 40 guys, with guns and
radios'' can guard a stretch of beach while their divers take out
tons at a time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some gangs rent beach houses to hide in, monitor police radios
and hide nail-studded boards in the sand to pop the tires of any
vehicles that try to surprise them at work, the police and local
residents say. Inside Hawston, they attacked police vans trying to
make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Betty's Bay, which is so small it doesn't even have a police
station, poachers have tried intimidation. Tannett, a founder of
Sea Watch, a civilian group that has arrested more than 500
poachers and recovered $150,000 worth of abalone since 1995, has
been beaten up and his car has been rammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poachers came down my driveway at 1 a.m. and shined a light on
my bed,'' said Spencer, the local nature conservation officer, who
works with Sea Watch. ``I was in the shower and all I could do was
crouch down because I was nowhere near my gun. Luckily, my dog
started barking and they left.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The shallow waters of Betty's Bay, once the coast's richest
stretch, have lost 90 percent of their abalone and lobsters,
Tannett said.
</P>
<P>
   Cycads face the same kind of devastation. They resemble thick
palm trees, but with fernlike leaves and a fat central seedpod that
looks like a cross between a pine cone and a pineapple. There are
about 35 species in South Africa, and the practice for collecting
rare ones began about 20 years ago. A few are exported, but most
end up in the gardens of the wealthy. Now, two-thirds of the
varieties face extinction in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cycads are a very sorry story,'' said David Newton, national
representative for Traffic, the international organization that
fights the smuggling of endangered species. ``I know of one species
which has only one plant left, on an inaccessible cliff face, where
there were once hundreds and hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, three permits are required even to dig one up at home
to move to a new house _ collecting, export and import _ under the
Convention in International Trade of Endangered Species, the same
one that covers ivory. There are cycad nurseries, but the plants
take 15 years to reach salable size.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Johannesburg landscape gardener was arrested
selling them from his home for about $2,500 each. The buyers had no
way of knowing the plants had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   But the police, helped by a parks board agent, did. Each plant
had a microchip hidden inside that, as a scanner was passed over
it, transmitted a serial number indicating its species, age, and
where it should still have been _ a state forest in Mpumalanga,
hundreds of miles away.

 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Basil Hero tells it, the saving of Dustin Hoffman,
Meryl Streep, Faye Dunaway and Wendy Wasserstein began three years
ago in a Burger Heaven in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He and his best pal from boarding school, Andrew Greenspan, were
sitting around as usual, trying to think of a business venture they
could start together. Former television reporters who had hung up
their microphones in disillusionment over ``creeping voyeurism,''
they were looking for some way to pool their video and computer
skills.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s they had come up with the idea for a line of
history videos shrink-wrapped with matching textbooks. But after
putting together a business plan they discovered there weren't
enough videocassette recorders around yet to make it work. Then the
History Channel came along.
</P>
<P>
   Now they were thinking of some way to adapt Broadway productions
for television, using digital technology. After their burger lunch,
they decided to see how earlier stage productions had been adapted
and walked over to the Museum of Television and Radio on West 52nd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   And then it happened. ``Oh my God,'' said Hero, ``we found
hundreds and hundreds of fabulous productions.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was the new venture that he and Greenspan, both 43,
had been seeking. Called the Broadway Theater Archive, it
represents a collaboration between them and a deep-pocketed partner
(Michael Fuchs, the former chairman and chief executive officer of
HBO), a silent partner (the Broadway producer Chase Mishkin) and
WNET (Channel 13), the flagship public television station that is
heir to a vast video library preserving 40 years of the best of the
American stage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with many of the tapes deteriorating, the theater archive
is proceeding to clear the underlying creators' rights and transfer
the shows to digital format in exchange for marketing and
commercial rights. WNET, which contributed the tapes and prodigious
research work in tracking down the creators for rights clearances,
will itself rebroadcast some of the productions as ``Treasures From
the Archive'' in a new series ``Stage on Screen,'' to begin next
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it's a no-brainer,'' said William F. Baker,
president and chief executive officer of WNET. ``We're sitting on
one of the great libraries. This is an important art treasure for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, even before the Broadway Theater Archive
materialized, WNET had been searching for a way to preserve its
library of classics, which are not tapings of live performances but
productions restaged for television.
</P>
<P>
   The match seemed made in heaven for Jac Venza, the station's
director of culture and arts programming, who as a pioneer of
public television and executive producer of its ``Great
Performances'' series, helped create many of the landmark
television plays and a scattering of musical performances now being
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I'm sitting in my rocking chair, I'll get to see
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These are indeed the crown jewels of public television: more
than 100 tape reels of gems like Dustin Hoffman in his first
starring role on television, as a wacky Turgenev character in
``Journey of the Fifth Horse,'' from 1966; Meryl Streep in her
television debut in ``Secret Service,'' a Civil War melodrama from
1977; Faye Dunaway in a 1974 revival of ``Hogan's Goat,'' the drama
that originally catapulted her to ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and stardom,
and Wendy Wasserstein's first play, ``Uncommon Women and Others,''
starring Swoosie Kurtz and featuring Ms. Streep, from 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Along with an additional hundred or so productions from network
television in the days before culture was banished altogether as
insufficiently commercial, there are also classics like ``The Moon
and Sixpence,'' with Laurence Olivier, Judith Anderson, Hume Cronyn
and Jessica Tandy (1959); ``Death of a Salesman,'' with Lee J. Cobb
and Mildred Dunnock recreating their acclaimed Broadway
performances (1966); the Joseph Papp New York Shakespeare
Festival's ``King Lear'' with James Earl Jones, Raul Julia and Paul
Sorvino (1974); ``Hedda Gabler,'' with Ingrid Bergman in a rare
television appearance, and Michael Redgrave, Ralph Richardson and
Trevor Howard (1963); ``The Seagull,'' with Frank Langella, Blythe
Danner, Olympia Dukakis and Lee Grant (1975); ``Wuthering
Heights,'' with Richard Burton and Rosemary Harris (1958);
``Follies in Concert,'' with Carol Burnett, Betty Comden, Adolph
Green, Lee Remick, Mandy Patinkin, Elaine Stritch and Barbara Cook
(1986); ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' with Jason Robards and
Colleen Dewhurst and directed by Jose Quintero (1975), and a
Tennessee Williams trilogy of one-act plays with Ben Gazzara,
directed by Sidney Lumet.
</P>
<P>
   To name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   The shows are widely scattered in climate-controlled vaults and
open basement shelves of the Library of Congress, the Public
Broadcasting Corp., Time-Life, HBO, the networks, museums and
universities and WNET itself. Many, in deteriorating condition, are
in dire need of preservation. ``Secret Service,'' the Meryl Streep
debut, for example, was in such precarious shape that the cleaning
and copying process destroyed it, Hero said. But now there is a
digital master.
</P>
<P>
   Others have simply been lost over the years. No known copies
exist, for example, of three acclaimed 1961 ``Du Pont Show of the
Month'' productions: ``The Prisoner of Zenda,'' with Christopher
Plummer; ``Heaven Can Wait,'' with Robert Morley, Wally Cox and
Anthony Franciosa, and ``The Night of the Storm,'' with E.G.
Marshall and Julie Harris.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Before the salvage process can go forward, however, the three
partners including Fuchs, who ran both HBO and the Warner Music
Group before leaving Time Warner in 1995, must gain permission from
the authors or other creators or their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Past efforts to obtain such rights, which in these cases can run
between $75,000 and $350,000 per production, often bogged down in
royalty disputes. But the tapes' fragility, which could soon moot
the issue, is persuading owners to accept a percentage of the
Broadway Theater Archive's take rather than demanding up-front
payments out of the archive's limited initial capitalization of
several million dollars; the partners declined to be more specific.
Just tracking down legal titles has already cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Salvaging the tapes may cost several million more. Once the
shows have been digitally remastered _ a complex laboratory process
that can take up to a week if the single soundtrack has to be
separated into two for foreign broadcast requirements _ the theater
archive must still come to terms with the performers' unions on
residual fees or royalties, also to come out of the archive's
income.
</P>
<P>
   Without going into detail about what have become delicate talks,
Hero said, ``They're being extremely cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some works in the public domain come cheap, said Susan Marchand,
executive director of program marketing and distribution for WNET.
``Luckily,'' she said, ``we have three Shakespeares.''
</P>
<P>
   With rights issues cleared up and digital copies made, the
theater archive gets the right to license the shows for home video
sale and rebroadcast by commercial and public outlets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The archive is already on the Web (www.broadwayarchive.com)
offering, at last count, 137 titles for sale (VHS, $39.95 each),
starting this summer, provided the clearances come through.
</P>
<P>
   Hero said he expected overseas outlets like the BBC and German,
Russian, Eastern European and Israeli television to be his biggest
customers. ``They've never seen these before,'' he said, ``and
audiences haven't been dumbed down there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, he said, the Internet makes the venture
feasible, giving access to a global population of culture
consumers. Like nothing before, he said, ``the Internet can get the
enthusiast together with the owner.'' And at so little cost.
</P>
<P>
   Finding their angel, Fuchs, took some doing, Hero and Greenspan
said in a joint interview with Fuchs in the theater archive's
offices in Fuchs's 42nd-floor suite on West 57th Street, with all
of Central Park stretched out panoramically below.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their brainstorm at Burger Heaven, they said, they
saw Fuchs interviewed on ``The Charlie Rose Show,'' talking about
the lack of culture on television. They had a solution. But how to
reach Fuchs?
</P>
<P>
   He was, it turned out, a board member of the Los Angeles-based
Simon Wiesenthal Center, where Greenspan's ex-girlfriend worked.
With her help, they tracked him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in and pitched me,'' Fuchs recalled. ``I liked the
idea they were investigative reporters. They had the tenacity to
wrestle this to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs said that while commercial considerations were hardly
uppermost in his mind, ``nobody ever went broke accumulating a
library.''
</P>
<P>
   The business could grow in new directions, he said. There was
always Hero and Greenspan's original idea of coming up with the
digital age's answer to the black-and-white classics now in the
public television vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at Broadway like an ex-TV person,'' Hero said.
``After all these years, it has yet to make the leap to
broadcasting. The camera today has the ability to buzz around the
stage like a bumblebee. You can digitize the sets and take actors
into a studio and shoot with 360-degree mobility and point-of-view
taping. You're suddenly given a depth of field not possible
before.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Roone Arledge through instant replay completely
altered sports coverage,'' he said. ``Why not do for culture what
TV does best?''

 &HT;    Yager foe reunited with his daughters
 &HT;    By Clint Williams

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Philadelphia millionaire who vowed to crush
Atlanta children's activist Faye Yager as part of his strategy to
find his missing daughters now has the girls at home.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Lynn, 9, and Genevieve Marie, 7, were recovered by
millionaire Bipin Shah on Saturday in Lucerne, Switzerland, where
they were living with their mother. Ellen Dever, Shah's former
wife, remains abroad, according to a news release issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yager is the controversial operator of the Children of the
Underground, a network of safe houses that hides children, and
generally their mothers, from allegedly abusive fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In several interviews last spring, Yager said she helped Dever
disappear with the children in June 1997, despite the fact that no
one had accused Shah of harming the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Shah attracted worldwide media attention in December 1997 when
he offered a $2 million reward for information leading to the
return of his daughters. In January 1998, Shah filed a $100 million
lawsuit against Yager, the wife of an Atlanta pediatrician, in
federal district court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, Shah said last year, was filed to gain access to
information such as telephone records and to pressure Yager by what
he called ``bleeding Faye Yager financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys on both sides Tuesday declined to comment on what
role, if any, Yager played in the recovery of Shah's children.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI knew where to find Dever and the children and was in the
process of attaining a provincial warrant when Shah was reunited
with his daughters, said Linda Vizi of the Philadelphia FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant is issued for local authorities to execute, Vizi
explained, ``because we can't just go into another country and take
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The warrant for Dever's arrest is still pending and the case is
still under investigation, Vizi said.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for his children cost $3.2 million, Shah said in a
statement. The search, which focused on Europe early on, sent
investigators scurrying from Finland to South Africa. Shah was in
contact with more than 125 bounty hunters looking for a chunk of
the $2 million reward. None of the reward will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return of the children came by Mr. Shah's own
investigative efforts and the $2 million reward has been officially
withdrawn,'' said Albert Momjain, Shah's Philadelphia attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Shah, in his statement, said he will not be granting interviews,
citing the need for privacy during a period of readjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Chilivis, the Atlanta attorney representing Shah, said he
and his client haven't fully discussed the situation since the
children returned and could not comment about the future of the
lawsuit against Yager.
</P>
<P>
   Yager remains under investigation by a federal grand jury in
Philadelphia for her role in the abduction of the Shah children.
</P>
<P>
   Yager, who operated the Children of the Underground network for
more than a decade, moved last summer from suburban Atlanta to
Brevard, N.C., where she operates an inn. She said last fall she no
longer helps women and children go underground. Efforts to reach
Yager by telephone Tuesday were unsuccessful.

HOUSE PANEL HEARS FUNDING REQUESTS FROM DISEASE VICTIMS'
ADVOCATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the official government record, the hearing that
began Tuesday in Room 2358 of the Rayburn House Office Building
will be listed as ``public witness testimony.'' Unofficially, it
was long ago called ``Mother Teresa's waiting room,'' a moniker
that could not be more apt.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for three days this week and two next, the sick and
afflicted and their lobbyists are gathering in an annual telethon
of sorts: the desperate competition for research funding to cure
disease. Hundreds of ailments are represented, from the most common
cancer to the rarest genetic disorder. Even erectile dysfunction
got a mention.
</P>
<P>
   So many people asked testify before the subcommittee that holds
the pursestrings to the National Institutes of Health that two
thirds of them were turned down. The rest were selected by lottery
for the privilege of delivering a five-minute spiel _ time limits
strictly enforced _ to the 15 members of the panel, most of whom
did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is a rite of springtime in Washington, as
certain as the blooming of the cherry blossoms, and in recent years
it has hardly been polite. But with advances in biomedical research
spilling out of laboratories at an unprecedented pace, and talk
among lawmakers of doubling the budget for the National Institutes
of Health over the next five years, the faithful of Mother
Theresa's Waiting Room have cause for optimism, as well as
congeniality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are no longer fighting amongst themselves,'' said Mary
Woolley, president of Research!America, a nonprofit advocacy group
that lobbies for more money for research. ``The disease groups are
not pitted against each other. This concept of robbing Peter to pay
Paul is one that I hope has been banished forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Or if not forever, then at least while the money holds out. For
1999, Congress gave the Institutes a $2 billion budget increase,
bringing the total budget to $15.6 billion. While President Clinton
has suggested a more modest hike for 2000, of $320 million, members
of both parties in Congress say they are hoping for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that everyone feels that we are doing well and all
ships are rising with the incoming tide,'' said NIH Director Harold
Varmus. ``We're fairly happy campers right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy perhaps, but never completely content, as Tuesday's
hearing revealed. Doctors pleaded with the panel for more money for
research in general, and their interests in particular. ``In the
vernacular of Jerry Maguire, the movie, `More money, more money,
more money for NIH,' '' Dr. A. Paul Kelly, president of the
Association of Professors of Dermatology, told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   There is no similar public testimony session in the Senate, so
the hearings before the House Appropriations Committee's
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education is
the only chance for patients to talk to appropriators in a public
forum. The session was laden with hearbreaking stories, most of
them carefully orchestrated to grab the attention of the media and,
more important, Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who chairs the
subcommittee and was the only member to sit through the entire
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Kimmitt Rainey, a Senate aide, testified about the
devastating loss of her son to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in
1996. As she spoke, her new baby, a girl, squirmed in the stroller
beside her. ``I know that my personal story touched Chairman
Porter,'' she said afterward. ``I could see it in his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Reeve, the actor who was paralyzed when he fell off
his horse, is on the docket for Wednesday. Doug Flutie, the
football player whose son is autistic, is also scheduled to appear.
Jim Kelly, the retired quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, testified
Tuesday, describing in wrenching detail the life of his
two-year-old son, Hunter, who suffers from Krabbe Disease, a rare
neurologic disorder. The child cannot move any part of his body on
his own. He has never smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been surrounded by tough individuals throughout my
entire career,'' Kelly said. ``But never have I witnessed more
strength and toughness than that of my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity counts in the quest for research funding, but a tale
that can bring tears to the eyes counts even more, lobbyists say.
``I'll take my SIDS lady over any celebrity,'' said Dale Dirks, the
lobbyist who accompanied Mrs. Rainey. ``Because she's got a
compelling story to tell and she's a real person. And all of us
have kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter listened intently, seemingly taking the stories to heart.
To Mrs. Rainey, he confided that, as a new grandfather, he worries
about SIDS. When a doctor asked for more money for vision research,
he mentioned his mother-in-law has retinitis pigmentosa. He told a
representative from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America
that his sister has asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress does not appropriate money on a
disease-by-disease basis, the patient advocates are angling for a
brass ring with a more subtle effect: a mention in the report that
accompanies the subcommittee's bill. The NIH pays close attention
to the report, and how the committee parses its language can make
all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a code in the words,'' said Michael Stephens, a
former staff director for the subcommittee. ``They might say, `The
committee is aware of X disease. The committee urges that the
importance of this disease be reflected. And then, the most that
anybody ever gets: `Within the increase provided, X should be set
aside for this disease.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the hearings have taken on the tenor of a family
reunion. Committee staff members tell the story of the boy with a
disfiguring port wine stain on his face; one year, he showed up
with a clear complexion from laser surgery. For a time, an AIDS
patient came with his wife; when she didn't show up a few years
ago, nobody had to ask why.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 17-year-old Erin Bosch, who suffers from a congenital
heart defect, appeared for the third time. She recently had surgery
to reduce the size of her enlarged heart, a procedure, she hastened
to tell Porter, that was pioneered with federal money. The
congressman brightened when he saw her; she took that as a good
sign. ``I feel like I make an impact,'' she said, ``when he
remembers me from year to year.''

BOMBING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. tab for waging war with Yugoslavia and
tending to its refugees could top $4 billion, the Pentagon said
Tuesday, as President Clinton said the addition of hundreds of
fresh warplanes would escalate the campaign ``to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air war entered its fourth week, Clinton told
congressional leaders that he
</P>
<P>
   is prepared to continue the strikes for ``months'' if necessary,
noting that weather conditions have favored bombing during less
than half of the first 21 days of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also told the bipartisan gathering that he has not ruled
out sending ground forces into the embattled Yugoslav province of
Kovoso. He stressed, though, that he remains opposed to that
option, gave no indication that he is preparing for it in any way
and stressed that he would first give the expanding air campaign
far more time to take its toll on Serb forces in the field and the
regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not favor the use of ground forces, but he did say
that that option should not be taken off the table,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who was among the congressional leaders
attending the two-hour White House meeting. ``What was stated here
very clearly today, most importantly by the commander in chief, is
that this air campaign is going to go on for weeks and months, if
necessary, to achieve our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
the supreme allied commander, said the troops reporting to Serb
leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, are
``vulnerable to collapse,'' and would come under ``greater and
greater,'' attack in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Milosevic) has an apparent high degree of willingness to
accept damage,'' Clark told reporters. ``But the damage he's going
to accept is going to be greater and greater and greater.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of 82 fresh U.S. warplanes en route to Europe
over the next several days, the NATO air armada assembled against
Yugoslavia has roughly doubled -- to nearly 700 aircraft -- since
the strikes began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, has asked for 300 more fighters, bombers and support
aircraft, which the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff is expected to
approve within days.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the additional
deployments would likely require the call-up of Air Force reserves
-- some of which are already flying refueling tanker missions -- as
well as civil service and Army reservists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 24 Apache attack helicopters are expected to be on
the ground and operational from a base near the Albanian capital of
Tirana as early as this weekend, said Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles
Wald, vice director for strategic plans and policy for the Joint
Chiefs. Wald declined to say whether Clark had asked for additional
helicopters in his most recent request.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would send Congress, over the next several days,
a request for emergency supplemental spending -- government
payments not already authorized in this year's budget -- to cover
the U.S. portion of the costs of the NATO air strikes and refugee
support operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is not firm yet, but I would guess that it'll be in
the range of three-to-four billion dollars,'' Bacon said. ``It
could be over four billion.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bacon said, depending on how much longer the air
strikes continue and what shape additional elements to the campaign
might take, the war-fighting portion alone could well top $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That figure does not include regular salaries for the pilots and
soldiers involved in the NATO operation. Those payments are part of
the Pentagon's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The figure would be primarily to cover the premium such forces
receive for performing hazardous duty and for the costs of fuel,
bombs, cruise missiles and other sorts of materials being used for
the NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there's the refugee assistance: nearly 800,000
meals, thousands of tents, tens of thousands of blankets, in
addition to hundreds of intercontinental flights of giant cargo
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea of the cost,'' Clark said. ``I suspect
it will be substantial, but I would suspect it will be far more
substantial for Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In three weeks of strikes, Clark said, U.S. and allied pilots
have flown 5,924 sorties. Of those, 1,687 have been combat
missions. The rest have been refueling tankers -- flying roughly
2,000 sorties -- and reconnaissance and flight control aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On 10 days out of the first 21 of the mission, Clark said, more
than half of the combat missions were scrubbed because of heavy
clouds and fog that concealed targets or restricted the
effectiveness of precision bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those constraints, NATO pilots and sea-launched cruise
missiles have destroyed roughly 200 bridges, headquarters
buildings, ammunition sites and other major targets, in addition to
scores of tanks, trucks and other military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated strikes on refineries and oil storage depots have
destroyed roughly 70 percent of the fuel supplies in Yugoslavia,
Clark said, a measure that has forced troops inside Kosovo to park
armored vehicles wherever they can be hidden and horde precious
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic indication of the vigilance with which NATO forces
are pursuing fuel sources, Wald, the air force general, showed
footage of an F-16 attack jet destroying a tanker truck on a
highway in Kosovo with a precision-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   With an unknown number -- U.S., NATO and United Nations
estimates run from 250,000 up to 700,000 -- of ethnic Albanians
hiding in remote mountains with minimal food and shelter, Clinton
said military planners were searching for ways to assist them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very large problem. We are aware of it,'' Clinton said
during remarks from the Rose Garden. ``We know what the obstacles
are, and we're doing our best to overcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to rule out air drops, citing the danger such
missions would pose to NATO pilots and the possibility that aid
dropped by air for refugees would instead be taken by Serb troops
on the ground.

GIULIANI PRAISES BUSH'S LEADERSHIP 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Tuesday that critics of Gov. George W. Bush's foreign policy should
focus on Bush's leadership abilities, not the limits of his
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States,
one of the questions was: Did he have any foreign policy
experience?'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said Reagan proved as governor of California that
he had leadership qualities that would serve him well as president,
with policies carried through by President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the 12 years of the Reagan-Bush administration
and compare that to where our foreign policy is today, a lot of
Americans would say that maybe leadership is the real key to
whether you can handle foreign policy well,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has undergone criticism recently for being slow to
articulate a policy on the military intervention in Kosovo and then
strengthening it through a series of statements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush guaranteed Americans that he will be ready to serve as
foreign policy leader if he becomes president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up for the task,'' Bush said. ``When I swear in, I'll be
ready to assume the job.''
</P>
<P>
   But aides to rival Lamar Alexander questioned his overall depth
of knowledge.

<P>
   Tom Rath, an Alexander adviser who is a former attorney general
of New Hampshire, complained of the ``halo effect'' around Bush's
governorship and questioned how much leadership could be learned
from being the Texas chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Texas governor is different from many others in terms of the
power,'' Rath said, alluding to the relatively limited
constitutional scope of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kennedy, a national strategist for Alexander and former
Iowa Republican chairman, said Bush may approach issues such as
education with bite-size proposals like those advocated by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real threat they may start looking more like Clinton
Jr. than Bush Jr.,'' Kennedy told reporters. ``It's time to start
talking big again and dreaming bold.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Bush met at the Texas Governor's Mansion. While the
men spoke like a mutual admiration society, neither specifically
endorsed the other in their potential 2000 races.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is exploring a possible race for New York's Republican
nomination to the U.S. Senate, while first lady Hillary Clinton is
looking at seeking the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be one of the great campaigns in the history of the
United States Senate the way the rumors are shaping up,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Bush could help lead the Republican Party back to
national victory. But Giuliani also praised New York Gov. George
Pataki, who is looking as a possible favorite-son candidacy for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was asked about his differences with Giuliani, who supports
abortion rights and gay rights. Bush is opposed to abortion and to
adoptions by gay parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good people can disagree on a variety of issues in the
Republican Party,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told Texas reporters that he realizes that his vow to stay
in the state until the Legislature ends its session May 31 has hurt
his presidential organizing in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who say I'm late getting there, they are absolutely
correct,'' Bush said.

   STENKOVAC, Macedonia _ In the week since President Slobodan
Milosevic announced that he had halted offensive military
operations in Kosovo, Serbian paramilitary groups and Yugoslav
soldiers have systematically expelled tens of thousands of
Albanians from a swath of southeastern Kosovo, according to reports
from refugees arriving here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, among a group of 800 Kosovo Albanians allowed to
cross the border near here, described methodical attacks by
Milosevic's forces that cleared out a 10-mile-by-12-mile area that
appears to have little military value.
</P>
<P>
   In each account, Serbian paramilitary units or Yugoslav soldiers
were said to have expelled civilians and burned or shelled homes in
at least 15 villages around the town of Urosevac in southeastern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees described well-organized attacks in which masked
Serbian soldiers descend on an Albanian village, ordered everyone
to leave, and then shot or burned to death the defiant, infirm or
aged who stayed in their homes. It was impossible to determine how
many Albanians were forced from their homes by the attacks, but
roughly 50,000 people lived in the area before NATO bombing began
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that the rural area refugees have
described as the focus of the attack has not been a base of
operations for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian
guerrilla group fighting for independence. And several of the
remote villages attacked did not seem to have a strategic purpose
in terms of thwarting a NATO invasion or rebel efforts to smuggle
supplies into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces essentially sealed the border with Macedonia
last week, but the number of people allowed to cross here doubled
over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said that the increase in the number of
refugees crossing into Macedonia in recent days could signal that
vast numbers of Albanian may soon flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does sound very clear from the refugees that there is a
much larger number of people who want to come in,'' she said. ``But
we never know what to expect. The last time, it was 40,000 people
in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, two dozen of the refugees arriving in Macedonia
Tuesday described the same type of expulsions by Yugoslav forces
and paramilitary units that previous waves of Albanian refugees
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Luzlim Shala, a 28-year-old teacher, said Yugoslav Army soldiers
in armored personnel carriers descended on his village last Monday.
His village, Mirash, is a quiet, farming village of 1,000 people
nestled at the base of a 2,500-foot mountain and is five miles from
the main road. The soldiers ordered all civilians out of their
homes and burned a handful before departing. That same day, in an
attack potentially carried out by the same group, Yugoslav soldiers
descended on the village of Prelez i Jerlive on the main road
running north of Urocevac, according to Fadil Zeqir, a 32-year-old
agricultural engineer. There, he said, the town's 300 families were
told they had twenty minutes to leave the town. Resident scurried
into the surrounding hills and no homes were burned.

REVVING UP THE CANDLE POWER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)   (af)  
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until the invention of electricity, the world was obsessed with
light: how to get it, how to increase it, how to use it. And no
century explored it with more style than the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The Age of Reason was also the Age of Reflection. Chandeliers
dripped with cut-glass lusters, moldings glimmered with gold leaf.
Mirrors were placed behind blazing candles and opposite sunny,
full-length windows.
</P>
<P>
   And surprisingly, at least some chimney pieces of the day were
literally architectural jewels, studded, paved and highlighted with
paste diamonds (in other words, rhinestones).
</P>
<P>
   ``There was such a need to magnify the light candles gave out,''
said William Jay Iselin, a former Christie's associate who now
works with the eminent Paris antiquary Ariane Dandois. ``Anything
that could refract light, to up the candle power, so to speak, was
embraced.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently exhibited at the Palm Beach International Art and
Antiques Fair, one of Iselin and Ms. Dandois' most spectacular
finds is a formally carved, rhinestone-studded chimney piece, circa
1790.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of paste diamonds _ some classically clear, others a
murky, mysterious amber _ flicker across its surface, embedded in
painted copper panels of peacock-blue. Some of the rhinestones are
arranged into what appear to be palm trees or perhaps stylized
fountains. Others are formed into ovoid medallions and double
swags, their facets throwing off sparks of light as readily as a
river of solitaire diamonds around the throat of one of Thomas
Gainsborough's powdered beauties.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of such a fireplace in a crowded room, illuminated by
candles and a blazing fire, must have been like a late Georgian
version of a mirrored disco ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would have been used in a small reception room or
a ladies' drawing room,'' said Iselin, who noted that the chimney
piece, which is about 12 feet high and 14 feet wide, is for sale at
$95,000. ``It's too delicate in appearance for a gala room or a
man's library.''
</P>
<P>
   As intriguing as the lavish use of rhinestones, however, is the
chimney piece's construction: each inset blue panel is made of
copper. Rhinestones were a rare enough decorative material 200
years ago, but painted copper panels were seen even less often. And
when they were used, most can be traced to George Brookshaw, a now
undeservedly obscure English decorative painter turned
cabinetmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Though his name rings no bells like that of his occupational
compatriots, Thomas Chippendale or Robert Adam, the Birmingham-born
Brookshaw (1751-1823) was immensely talented. Often mistaken for
the work of the highly collectible Italian artist Michelangelo
Pergolesi, his painted secretaries, commodes and, yes, chimney
pieces, were greatly admired by the Georgian cognoscenti, as much
for Brookshaw's exquisite paintwork _ wicker baskets overflowing
with flowers, usually executed on a white or ivory ground _ as for
their sometimes startlingly costly construction.
</P>
<P>
   An artist at heart, and apparently indifferent to the
inappropriateness of the materials he used, Brookshaw once
fashioned a commode of solid mahogany, only to obliterate the
costly wood under layers of painted flora. The Iselin-Dandois
chimney piece, however, is made of painted and gilded pine, which
indicates a certain amount of economical common sense on
Brookshaw's part.
</P>
<P>
   Costly or not, Brookshaw's creations ended up in some of
England's finest houses. The fifth Duke of Beaufort ordered one of
the cabinetmaker's marble chimney pieces, which is still at the
Somerset family seat, Badminton, in Gloucestershire.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of lesser but equally discerning connoisseurs also
patronized Brookshaw's establishment, at 48 Great Marlborough
Street in London, where he advertised classes in painting for
``ladies of fashion'' as well as for the Prince of Wales, later
George IV, who commissioned at least one commode for Carlton House,
his Frenchified London bachelor pad, in 1783.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, mysterious financial reverses spelled the doom of
George Brookshaw's furniture business after only 20 years or so.
After a period of purposeful anonymity, during which he adopted
multiple aliases, Brookshaw resurfaced, this time as a master
engraver of botanical books like ``Pomona Britannica'' and ``A New
Treatise on Flower Painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Brookshaw's output as a cabinetmaker is limited, choice
pieces, like the rhinestoned chimney piece, continue to show up and
be admired. But not every (rhine)stone has been left unturned,
apparently: Iselin and Ms. Dandois' rarity may not be the only one
of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Though identified vaguely as an ``Adam-style fireplace'' in the
October issue of House and Garden, a Brookshaw chimney piece
appears to grace the living room of Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece
and his American wife, Marie-Chantal, in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence is there: inset copper panels, rhinestones
gathered into sparkling swags, palmlike panaches and concentric
ovals. But the royal couple's treasure has been smothered under an
oily layer of spinach-green lacquer. With some gentle coaxing with
paint remover, another example of Brookshaw's singular genius may
once again come to light.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on Tuesday
encouraged Gov. George W. Bush to run for president, but he stopped
short of formally endorsing him, noting that another Republican
governor is considering a White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's one of the real stars of the party,'' Giuliani
said after meeting with Bush at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it would be a good thing for the country and a good
thing for the party,'' Giuliani said of a Bush candidacy. ``He has
an ability to unify that the Republican Party, that any party,
would need.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani did not give Bush his political blessing _ a formal
endorsement. In New York, fellow Republican Gov. George Pataki also
is considering a run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to see who runs first before you can make a
choice about that,'' Giuliani said. ``Governor Pataki hasn't
decided whether he will run. But as I said before, Governor Pataki
would make a fine candidate for president. ... He's been an
enormously successful governor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more very good candidates we have, the better off the
party's going to be,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a Republican who has sometimes run afoul of his party,
is considering running for the Senate in New York next year. That
race may turn out to be as high-profile as the presidential
campaign if first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton decides to run on the
Democratic Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd make an excellent (Senate) candidate,'' Bush said
of the mayor. ``It could be one of the great campaigns in the
history of the United States Senate, the way the rumors are shaping
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the governor also didn't provide a formal endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine I'm going to be focusing on my own race, but he's a
good guy, I like him,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush wouldn't say if he would tap Giuliani as a running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the first thing I've got to do is get the nomination,
should I decide to run,'' he said. ``It's too early to be talking
about the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has formed an exploratory committee, which so far has
raised an estimated $7 million. He has pledged not to make a
decision about the presidency until the state Legislature wraps up
its current session in May.
</P>
<P>
   After the session, he will travel to different parts of the
United States before making a final decision on whether to
officially enter the race. He is expected to be in Iowa on June 12
to help raise money for Republican Rep. Greg Ganske.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at it, nothing is set in stone at this point,''
said Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. ``We will be traveling to Iowa
in June. We're in the process of nailing down the particulars. It
probably will be that day (June 12).''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will visit New York, but he doesn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go up there; it's a very important state,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   During their visit Tuesday, Giuliani said he told the governor
that a Republican could win in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although, it's seen very often as a Democratic stronghold,
Republicans can win,'' he said, noting his success as well as
Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he would be a very strong and competitive candidate
in Yew York, and of course every poll that's been taken indicates
exactly the same thing,'' he said.

BEST WESTERN EXPANDING  
 DISCOUNTS IN THE WINGS 
ONE-UPMANSHIP 
HEADING OFF SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably few people think of Pokhara, Nepal, and business travel
in the same breath. But Best Western &UR;  &LR; recently opened its newest
hotel there, the New Hotel Crystal, about 90 miles west of
Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 40 air-conditioned rooms, satellite television and
currency exchange facilities, it has a business center with fax,
e-mail and copy services.
</P>
<P>
   That brings to 185 the number of international hotels that Best
Western has added during the last year, along with 171 domestic
properties. Altogether, there are about 3,800 Best Westerns in 76
countries and territories, and next Jan. 1 it will top the 4,200
mark when almost 400 Consort Hotels in Britain will also carry the
Best Western logo.
</P>
<P>
   Best Western is not only the world's biggest lodging brand; all
of its properties are independently owned and operated. They are
gathered under the Best Western banner not as franchises but in an
association whose members pay for marketing, national advertising,
the toll-free reservations number and similar expenses.
</P>
<P>
   While still heavily patronized by leisure travelers, Best
Western's share of business travelers has been inching up. Three
months ago it started Business Plus, a program designed to appeal
to those who are self-employed or on a tight corporate budget.
</P>
<P>
   Some 350 hotels participate in the program, which requires that
at least 10 rooms or 10 percent of the property's total rooms meet
standards that include king-size or queen-size beds, desks, phone
lines for computers, lounge armchairs, clock radios, coffee makers,
irons and ironing boards, and free access to toll-free numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discounts in the Wings
</P>
<P>
   When normal air service resumes to such cities as Sofia,
Bulgaria; Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina; Skopje, Macedonia, and
Tirana, Albania, passengers wanting to fly there from Kennedy
International Airport in New York will be able to do so for about
$550, round trip, on Austrian Airlines. In addition to what amounts
to a 40 percent discount, they will also be allowed three pieces of
baggage, instead of two, up to a total of 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Data on Hotels
</P>
<P>
   Health and fitness centers are in 48 percent of hotels in the
United States, compared with 43.7 percent in 1996 and 36.4 percent
in 1994. Voice mail was in 52 percent of hotel rooms in 1998,
compared with 22 percent two years earlier. And the percentage of
hotels offering rentals of videocassette recorders has remained at
about 25 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those percentages do not include all hotels, but were compiled
from replies from more than 9,400 of the nearly 40,000 hotels
surveyed for the American Hotel and Motel Association. It is, the
association said, the most comprehensive such study ever conducted
under its auspices.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers are not likely to be surprised that more than
35 percent of the luxury hotels provide rooms with safes. Or that
one-third of the luxury properties sampled offer cell phone rental.
</P>
<P>
   It is also no big surprise that a smaller percentage of such
hotels now offer free local calls than in the recent past. What is
surprising is that the percentage plummeted to 34 last year from 48
just two years earlier, while 60 percent of economy hotels and 46
percent of budget hotels still throw in free local calls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One-Upmanship
</P>
<P>
   You know those apples many hotels keep at the check-in desk,
presumably for ravenous guests? Not to be outdone, the Premier
Hotel in Times Square in New York gives away Popsicles. But, as
befits a hotel whose posted room rates start at $395 a night, these
are champagne Popsicles. Enclosed in wrappers and presented on ice
in a champagne bucket, they are served in the lounge during
cocktail hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heading Off Scandal
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to be host to the Summer Olympic Games in 2012, and
determined to avoid a replay of the tawdry details surrounding Salt
Lake City's winning bid for next year, Cincinnati has established
an ethics panel. In addition to developing a code of conduct, the
committee will also consider opening the Games' financial
arrangements to public scrutiny. But the competition to land the
Games is likely to be as fierce as the competition in the athletic
events, because a dozen other cities have also expressed interest
in winning the 2012 Games. &QL;

THORNTON WILSON, 78, EX-BOEING CEO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thornton A. Wilson, a former chairman and chief executive of
Boeing Co., died April 10 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, died in his sleep and was found by members of his
family, said Peter Conte, a spokesman for Boeing. The cause of
death remains unknown, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, nicknamed T, retired in 1987 after 42 years with Boeing.
He was best known for developing and producing the Boeing 757 and
767 jetliners. He was also remembered for guiding the company
through a painful reorganization in the late '60s and early '70s,
laying off 60,000 workers during what became known as the Boeing
Bust.
</P>
<P>
   The job cuts, which came in the wake of slow aircraft sales and
Congress' cancellation of the supersonic-transport, or SST,
program, devastated the Seattle area, where Boeing is based. But
the company was slowly revived over the next two decades; it now
employs 218,000 people worldwide, including about 90,000 in the
Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was born in Sikeston, Mo., on Feb. 8, 1921, and graduated
from Iowa State University in 1943 with a degree in aeronautical
engineering. He joined Boeing that year, leaving briefly for a
teaching assignment and advanced study at Iowa State and a year at
California Institute of Technology, where he earned a master's
degree in aeronautical engineering in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   He also became overall project engineer of the B-52 bomber
program during the latter stages of its design and then led the
proposal team that won the contract for the Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was elected vice president of Boeing in 1963 and in 1964
was placed in charge of operations and planning for its corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he was named executive vice president. He
became company president in 1968 and chief executive a year later.
He remained in that position until 1983. He became chairman of the
board in 1972 and stayed in that post until 1987. He became
chairman emeritus and continued to serve as a member of the board
until April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend, Dean Thornton, described Wilson as
unpretentious, decisive and clearly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could make the hard decisions,'' said Thornton, who worked
as president of the Boeing commercial airplane group and an
executive vice president of Boeing Co. in the late '80s and early
'90s. ``You never had much question about who was the boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson received numerous awards and honors during his career,
and, in 1983, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of
Fame for his engineering and managerial accomplishments with
Boeing. And in 1987, the Museum of Flight in Seattle named a new
143,000-square-foot gallery after Wilson.
</P>
<P>

LATEST EARTH-BOUND ASTEROID BEING REPORTED CAREFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a discovery eerily reminescent of one made just a year ago,
astronomers have found an asteroid that will be coming quite close
to Earth in a few decades, and that even has a real but minuscule
possibility of an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last year astronomers made a similar discovery of an asteroid
that had a slight possibility of hitting Earth in about 40 years.
In that case, it quickly turned out the Earth was safe after all,
and astronomers have been arguing ever since about the way that
report was disseminated. Now, another very similar, possibly
threatening, asteroid has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The object, called 1999 AN10, was described in a detailed
scientific paper posted on a website by three astronomers. But
unlike last year's case, no information has been sent out directly
to the public and the press.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid is thought to be about a mile in diameter _ similar
to the one last year _ and could possibly come very close to Earth
in 2039. There is even about a one-in-a-billion chance that it
could strike the Earth that year, with devastating consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, don't panic. That's actually less than the risk that
an unknown asteroid or comet might hit Earth on any given day, and
therefore is not anything to be too concerned about. What might be
more worrisome is its long-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 600 years, according to astronomers Andrea Milani,
Steven Chesley and Giovanni Valsecchi, the asteroid could remain
very close to Earth, and if it comes close enough to be affected by
Earth's gravity its orbit could become so chaotic that it is
impossible to predict for more than a decade or two ahead. In that
case, it could require constant, careful monitoring for centuries
to guard against a possible impact.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time in history _ or perhaps the first
time, depending on whose analysis of last year's discovery you
believe _ that an asteroid has been discovered that has a small but
non-zero possibility of striking the Earth within a few decades.
Even though the actual likelihood is vanishingly small, that makes
it an interesting find. Some people have questioned the wisdom of
the changes in the way such information is disseminated as a result
of what many astronomers considered a serious public embarrassment
last year.
</P>
<P>
   British anthropologist Benny Peiser, who has written extensively
about the effects of past impacts on the Earth, Tuesday circulated
an e-mail message questioning the fact that this discovery, unlike
last year's, has not been the subject of any public announcement or
press release. While acknowledging that the risk is tiny and not
something that anyone should lose any sleep over, Peiser said he
found the lack of public notice disturbing, suggesting that it
reflects an overreaction to astronomers' embarrassment about last
year's announcement followed by a swift reversal.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers contacted Tuesday said that in fact, they see
this as a perfect example of how such information should be
handled. The astronomers who made the calculations of impact
probabilities have circulated their unpublished paper to several
colleagues around the world who specialize in such calculations, in
order to make sure their conclusions are correct. Some astronomers
contacted Tuesday said that all the comments so far from such
specialists have been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend them for the process of being careful,'' said
Richard Binzel, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who specializes in asteroids. Many astronomers felt that
last year's press release about an asteroid called XF11 was
premature and caused unnecessary public alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Binzel stressed the very low odds of an impact predicted by
Milani and his colleagues. Binzel has suggested the use of a hazard
scale that would allow all such discoveries to be given a simple
classification, similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, to
allow people to judge their seriousness. ``On a scale of zero to
5,'' he said, ``this thing is a zero.''
</P>
<P>
   And astronomer David Morrison of the NASA Ames Research Center
said that there was no reason for this finding to be disseminated
publicly. Last year the asteroid in question was still visible in
the sky for a few more weeks and it was important to alert
astronomers around the world to make every possible observation of
it to pin down the orbit, but in this case the asteroid is already
in a part of the sky where it cannot be observed for months, so
there is no such urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to do, even if we thought it was dangerous,''
he said.

TREASURY MAY GET REVAMP IN WAKE OF PROPERTY SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts' Abandoned Property Division will get
some unwanted attention this week as discontent mounts with its
handling of some $100 million in unclaimed assets.
</P>
<P>
   The treasury division is supposed to try to match rightful
owners with their lost property, everything from jewelry stashed in
a forgotten safe deposit box to stocks left moldering in brokerage
accounts to gift certificates customers never redeemed at
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses that must deal often with the division are fed
up, saying the process is time-consuming and not effective. The
businesses, including banks, financial services companies, and
hospitals, are set to file a flurry of bills that would:
</P>
<P>
   --Narrow the definition of abandoned assets.
</P>
<P>
   --Impose a three-year statute of limitations, after which the
assets would not have to be turned over.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit the use of outside ``bounty hunters'' to audit
businesses' books in search of unclaimed belongings.
</P>
<P>
   --Establish an appeals process to dispute such audit findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant issue,'' said David Floreen, senior vice
president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, a sponsor of
one of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The public, meanwhile, is not being well served, state officials
concede.
</P>
<P>
   Even with $100 million sitting in the abandoned property
account, only 3 percent of all businesses in Massachusetts are
complying with system's rules governing how to turn over assets to
the treasury, officials have found. State Auditor Joseph DeNucci
last month issued a scathing report on the division. He cited,
among pages of other concerns, a Beacon Hill vault strewn with
items that treasury employees had never logged.
</P>
<P>
   And even state Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien is grappling with
logisitical and staffing problems associated with the division,
which on Sunday will publish its largest annual list ever, with the
names of more than 38,000 people thought to have assets in the
account.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday O'Brien is scheduled to announce a task force aimed at
fixing many of the problems, although she disagrees with some of
the changes pushed by the business community because she believes
they would impinge on personal property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned that some of business's bills might go
too far,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the bills say they are not trying to play off
publicity generated by the alleged thefts of nearly $9 million from
a related treasury account known as the Unpaid Check Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they say legislation was filed before that scam came to
light in February. They say the division under former treasurer
Joseph D. Malone was too aggressive in searching out languishing
assets but not so in looking for the owners. Instead, Malone, with
political fanfare, would turn over unclaimed property to the
state's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prior treasurer sort of expanded this program of going
after abandoned property and pushed the envelope. Stuff they never
went after before, such as unredeemed gift certificates, credit
receipts, account receivables . . . could now be considered
abandoned property,'' said Donald Baldini, senior vice president
for legislative policy at the Associated Industries of
Massachusetts, which has sponsored a bill to overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   Malone could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   AIM wants to narrow the definition of abandoned property,
excluding such things as credit balances between, say, a vendor and
a manufacturing company. The group, which represents 5,000 members,
also wants to impose a three-year limit on record searching done by
freelance bounty hunters that paid a percentage of their find by
the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Baldini said current law does not provide a clear statute of
limitations. ``They can go back as far as they want and allege that
abandoned property was not turned over,'' Baldini said.
</P>
<P>
   AIM believes those bounty hunters should be paid an hourly rate
or flat fee, rather than a percentage, to discourage overzealous
searches. And the group wants an appeals process established.
</P>
<P>
   There are few rules governing the bounty hunters, and no
mechanism for investigating disputes between industry and those who
seek to profit from turning assets over to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are different from ``heir finders,'' two of which
were implicated in the Unpaid Check Fund scam. Bounty hunters turn
property over to the state for a percentage of the take. Heir
finders try to find the rightful owners of that property for as
much as a 30 percent fee. Money from the Unpaid Check Fund is
supposed to be transferred to the Abandoned Property Division after
one year.
</P>
<P>
   Property is generally considered abandoned if it is left dormant
for three years. There are exceptions to that rule. Safe deposit
boxes have a seven-year time frame. And traveler's checks can be
dormant for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have their own concerns in turning over pre-payments
for services after a patient has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really talking about rings and watches, which is
what everybody thinks,'' said a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts
Hospital Association.

BOMBING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. tab for waging war with Yugoslavia and
tending to its refugees could top $4 billion, the Pentagon said
Tuesday, as President Clinton said the addition of hundreds of
fresh warplanes would escalate the campaign ``to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air war entered its fourth week, Clinton told
congressional leaders that he
</P>
<P>
   is prepared to continue the strikes for ``months'' if necessary,
noting that weather conditions have favored bombing during less
than half of the first 21 days of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also told the bipartisan gathering that he has not ruled
out sending ground forces into the embattled Yugoslav province of
Kovoso. He stressed, though, that he remains opposed to that
option, gave no indication that he is preparing for it in any way
and stressed that he would first give the expanding air campaign
far more time to take its toll on Serb forces in the field and the
regime in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not favor the use of ground forces, but he did say
that that option should not be taken off the table,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who was among the congressional leaders
attending the two-hour White House meeting. ``What was stated here
very clearly today, most importantly by the commander in chief, is
that this air campaign is going to go on for weeks and months, if
necessary, to achieve our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark,
the supreme allied commander, said the troops reporting to Serb
leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, are
``vulnerable to collapse,'' and would come under intensifying
attacks in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Milosevic) has an apparent high degree of willingness to
accept damage,'' Clark told reporters. ``But the damage he's going
to accept is going to be greater and greater and greater.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of 82 fresh U.S. warplanes en route to Europe
over the next several days, the NATO air armada assembled against
Yugoslavia has roughly doubled -- to nearly 700 aircraft -- since
the strikes began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has asked for 300 more fighters, bombers and support
aircraft, which the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff is expected to
approve within days.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said the additional
deployments would likely require the call-up of Air Force reserves
-- some of which are already flying refueling tanker missions -- as
well as civil service and Army reservists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 24 Apache attack helicopters are expected to be on
the ground and operational from a base near the Albanian capital of
Tirana as early as this weekend, said Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles
Wald, vice director for strategic plans and policy for the Joint
Chiefs. Wald declined to say whether Clark had asked for additional
helicopters in his most recent request.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would send Congress, over the next several days,
a request for emergency supplemental spending -- government
payments not already authorized in this year's budget -- to cover
the U.S. portion of the costs of the NATO air strikes and refugee
support operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is not firm yet, but I would guess that it'll be in
the range of three-to-four billion dollars,'' Bacon said. ``It
could be over four billion.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bacon said, depending on how much longer the air
strikes continue and what shape additional elements to the campaign
might take, the war-fighting portion alone could well top $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That figure does not include regular salaries for the pilots and
soldiers involved in the NATO operation. Those payments are part of
the Pentagon's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   The figure would be primarily to cover the premium such forces
receive for performing hazardous duty and for the costs of fuel,
bombs, cruise missiles and other sorts of materials being used for
the NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there's the refugee assistance: nearly 800,000
meals, thousands of tents, tens of thousands of blankets, in
addition to hundreds of intercontinental flights of giant cargo
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea of the cost,'' Clark said. ``I suspect
it will be substantial, but I would suspect it will be far more
substantial for Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   In three weeks of strikes, Clark said, U.S. and allied pilots
have flown 5,924 sorties. Of those, 1,687 have been combat
missions. The rest have been refueling tankers -- flying roughly
2,000 sorties -- and reconnaissance and flight control aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On 10 days out of the first 21 of the mission, Clark said, more
than half of the combat missions were scrubbed because of heavy
clouds and fog that concealed targets or restricted the
effectiveness of precision bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those constraints, NATO pilots and sea-launched cruise
missiles have destroyed roughly 200 bridges, headquarters
buildings, ammunition sites and other major targets, in addition to
scores of tanks, trucks and other military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated strikes on refineries and oil storage depots have
destroyed roughly 70 percent of the fuel supplies in Yugoslavia,
Clark said, a measure that has forced troops inside Kosovo to park
armored vehicles wherever they can be hidden and horde precious
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic indication of the vigilance with which NATO forces
are pursuing fuel sources, Wald, the air force general, showed
footage of an F-16 attack jet destroying a tanker truck on a
highway in Kosovo with a precision-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO forces continued to pound Serb positions on the ground,
Albanian authorities said roughly 50 Serb infantrymen crossed over
that country's mountainous border with Kosovo and briefly seized
the village of Kamenica, about one mile inside Albanian territory.
Albanian troops drove the Serbs back after an hour and a half of
fighting, Tirana reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, officials denied that Serb forces had fought their
way into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   With an unknown number -- U.S., NATO and United Nations
estimates run from 250,000 up to 700,000 -- of ethnic Albanians
hiding in remote mountains with minimal food and shelter, Clinton
said military planners were searching for ways to assist them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very large problem. We are aware of it,'' Clinton said
during remarks from the Rose Garden. ``We know what the obstacles
are, and we're doing our best to overcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to rule out air drops, citing the danger such
missions would pose to NATO pilots and the possibility that aid
dropped by air for refugees would instead be taken by Serb troops
on the ground.

OFFERMAN OFF TO A DRIVING START 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It is the lament of many Boston ballplayers. They
arrive in the Hub, rent a place, get a car, and attempt to drive to
work. Approaching the ballyard, they see the light towers, but
still they cannot get to Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman tripled to knock in two runs in Tuesday's 6-0
home-opening victory over the White Sox. He is 15 for 32 (.469) at
the plate this season, but 0 for 2 at finding Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive twice and get lost twice,'' Offerman said after
Tuesday's nifty victory. ``Yesterday and today. I don't know. I
look and I see and it looks like I'm going the right way . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And before he can say, ``Charlie on the MTA,'' the Fenway light
towers are in his rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox don't play Wednesday, but Jose has a plan for Thursday.
He's meeting Red Sox traveling secretary Jack McCormick at the
Hilltop Steak House off Route 3 in Braintree. He'll follow
McCormick _ Braintree to Big Dig to Fenway. The road-rage answer to
Tinker to Evers to Chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than trying to explain how to get here from
there,'' said McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman hasn't had any trouble finding his way around the bases
in his short Red Sox career. He had at least two hits in each of
the Sox first six (road) games, and came home to a hero's welcome.
Fans applauded madly when he was introduced before the game. Many
stood. One fellow, Joe Lewizke, an engineer at the Foxboro Company,
wore a gray sweatshirt that said, ``Mo Who?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose Offerman really came here against a lot of odds,''
explained Lewizke. ``He had tough shoes to fill and he's done a
great job. It's amazing how quickly things can turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Maligned Sox general manager Dan Duquette is having a
better week than the person who bought the winning lottery ticket
at Star Market. The Duke sits smugly, offering only standard
Dukespeak, while Mo Vaughn (0 for 2) limps around the Angel
clubhouse on crutches and Offerman sprays the ball and runs the
bases like Roberto Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find anyone who predicted this scenario.
</P>
<P>
   There was laughter coast-to-coast when the Duke signed Offerman
to a four-year, $26 million contract and said he could replace Mo's
``on-base capability.'' Other general managers were mortified by
the signing and Offerman became a target for standup comics,
columnists, and talk-radio callers.
</P>
<P>
   There was great titillation in these parts (much of it from
yours truly) about the prospect of Duke squirming when fans booed
Jose and Mo returned to Fenway as the American League's All-Star
first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   We joked about the beginning of the ``Jose Offerman Era.'' The
switch-hitting slasher was destined to be one of those guys who
never had a chance with the Boston fandom. Remember Stan Papi? He
was ridiculed because he came in a trade for popular Bill Lee. More
recently, nice guy Pete Carroll has been pummeled because he is the
antithesis of predecessor Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the same deal for Offerman until his
tour-de-bases through Kansas City and St. Petersburg. By the time
the Sox completed their 5-1 road trip, Boston fans were ready to
embrace Offerman as the poster child for the new,
pitching-speed-and-defense, ``go-go'' Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked again in the home opener. After taking a called third
strike in the first inning, Offerman came up with two on and two
out in the third and cracked a triple to the triangle in center. It
was his third triple of the season (he led the American League with
13 three-baggers last year).
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought the ball was gonna travel that much,'' said
the 30-year-old Dominican. ``Then I saw it and I thought I had a
good chance to get at least a triple.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus a cult hero was born. For now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited what I am doing right now,'' said Offerman. ``I
like to start this way.''
</P>
<P>
   He handled the ``What about Mo?'' question with the same
deftness he displayed throughout spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever understands this game has to understand that there's
no comparison,'' said Offerman. ``I can't compare myself to Mo
Vaughn. We do different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Things might be different by July if the Sox sag and a power
outage pulls the plug on their wild card hopes. But seven games
into the 1999 season, Offerman is hitting .469, the Red Sox are
6-1, and a fan is cheered when he wears a ``Mo Who?'' shirt on
Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to feel the fans feel that way,'' said Offerman. ``I
feel happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not a perfect Fenway opener for Offerman. After
the game, he had to drive home to Braintree in the afternoon rush
hour. And we know that when you play for the Red Sox, sometimes
just driving home is tougher than driving home runs.

 &HT;    AIIM conference kicks off in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Tatiana Lichnerova and Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The magician's patter was mostly lost in the boom of
competing spectacles, but he continued gamely on.
</P>
<P>
   He groped for the obligatory bunny, taking the animal from his
equally inevitable female assistant, smiling, but silent at his
side. The bunny went into a box _ to be scanned, the magician said.
And by turning the faux crank on the front of the box, he produced
a flattened paper version of the rabbit then showed an open box to
prove the flesh and blood version was gone. Moments later, he went
to another box, pumped in the ``scanned'' picture, then opened the
container to show the rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath the banner proclaiming the magic of Ohio-based
Cranel Inc., the magician's grin was persistent as his assistant
skittered away with the hapless bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd noise, music and seemingly dozens of emcees with
microphones competed for attention. And this wasn't even the only
magician. Not far away, another trickster boldly did card tricks,
his moves duplicated on a large screen above his stage. Passing by
were what looked like a group of high school cheerleaders. On
another nearby stage stood a young man dressed in apparent
imitation of a stereotypical 1950s greaser. There were booths for
companies hailing from Atlanta, from Palo Alto, from Madrid, from
Stuttgart. Among them the crowd streamed. Like stones in the flow,
here are there stood another patron was pulling out a cellular
phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in short, another one of those high-tech conferences
that bring hundreds of thousands of people to Atlanta each year.
</P>
<P>
   This one is the Association for Information and Image Management
International, which began in earnest Tuesday at the World Congress
Center as the exhibition floor opened and a high-ranking executive
from America Online gave the keynote. This morning, the featured
speaker will be Linus Torvalds, inventor of Linux, the little
operating system that is starting to to scare mighty Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   About 35,000 information technology specialists were expected to
attend, according to AIIM conference officials. As they wandered
the aisles Tuesday, they could be forgiven for occasionally being
distracted by the sideshows and the noise.
</P>
<P>
   This was about technology and business.
</P>
<P>
   And there was software and hardware, toys for the mundane
corporate purpose, as well as the deep-pocketed consumer whim. For
instance, you might look at the Pioneer New Media Technologies
booth and recall that you have been thinking of putting together
your own movie, something that would include your own video clips,
pictures, and data files. The only thing you need is a recordable
DVD drive. And about $5,400. Oh, and about $40 for each blank DVD
that you want to record on.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer offers the DVR-S201, a device that can store up to 4.7
gigabytes of data _ the equivalent of seven compact discs _ it can
record more than two hours of video. It can store important data by
the boatload and is mainly pitched toward small companies that make
industrial multimedia or presentation materials, but like many
techno-toys, it seems likely to trickle down to consumers sooner or
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a huge backlog of orders for this thing,'' said Brad
Roseborough, senior manager for Pioneer. ``By June, they ought to
be shipping in larger quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD discs may not replace CDs quickly, but when they do, it
seems it will be for keeps. The life expectancy of DVDs is about
100 years, if they are treated well, compared to less than half
that for CDs, Roseborough said.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Meta4 booth, consultant Gabriel Duaso was
demonstrating ``knowledge management'' software meant to enhance
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Meta4, whose North American headquarters are in Atlanta, makes
systems that are meant to assess the expertise of a company's
workers and keep that information updated. Documents that a worker
uses can be evaluated and then ranked so that the next person
looking for help can quickly see which to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just one person,'' Duaso said. ``It's the democracy
of the company.'' Across the exhibition floor, Robert Foley, vice
president of Maryland-based CereSoft, touted systems that can read
handwriting _ turning near-scribbles into digital data.
</P>
<P>
   Selling for $9,000 and up, the system is particularly useful for
insurance companies and government agencies that must sift through
thousands of forms filled in by human beings, each with a script
using something less than perfectly crafted letters. Through
mathematical algorithms, all but the worst writing can be
translated into data _ digital, readable and manipulable, Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the technology is still getting better.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three years, you'll see teller machines where you can put a
check in and cash it,'' he said.

SABERHAGEN, ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A pitching line sometimes tells you all you need to
know. If you see that a Roger Clemens or a Kerry Wood has a ``0''
under the BB and a ``20'' under the SO, you don't need a doctorate
in Moundology to know that someone has thrown a spectacular game.
</P>
<P>
   Merely studying Bret Saberhagen's line from Tuesday, though,
doesn't give you an understanding of just what type of thoroughly
professional pitching performance it was. It is a pretty good line,
too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(! used as column separator) &QL; 
IP &UR;  &LR; ! H ! R ! E ! BB ! SO &QL; 
6 2/3 !  &UR;  &LR; 6 ! 0 ! 0 !  &UR;  &LR; 3 ! 5 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What it does not reveal are the 22 pitches in the first inning
and the 26 in the second. It doesn't tell you about the
bases-loaded mess in the first and the two-on, one-out jam in the
second. It doesn't explain how out of sync he was to begin with, or
how he managed to keep the White Sox from scoring while he was
trying to figure out why he was so uncomfortable out there. It
doesn't make it clear that only an intelligent veteran pitcher
could have dealt with the early circumstances well enough to last 6
2/3 innings and become the winning pitcher in a 6-0 Red Sox Opening
Day victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself lucky to get out of those first two
innings,'' said Saberhagen, who, two starts and 12 2/3 innings into
his 16th major league season is carrying a 0.00 run average, earned
or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Did he say lucky? Not quite. Luck, Branch Rickey always told us,
is ``the residue of design.'' That wasn't luck. That was
intelligence. That was experience. That was, well, pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't panic,'' pointed out pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
``It's the self-discipline to believe in yourself. You're trying to
work through this and find your mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen is a man who prides himself on being able to put the
baseball exactly where he wants it (how about 13 walks in 177 1/3
innings in 1994?), and in the first couple of innings Tuesday, the
ball was disobedient. Behind this guy. Behind that guy. A base hit
by Ray Durham to lead off the game. A walk to Frank Thomas. A walk
to Magglio Ordonez. What was going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad mechanics,'' Saberhagen explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, bad mechanics. That's solvable. Pain would be something
else, and that was the good news. These days, Saberhagen is feeling
no pain in his reconstructed right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like last year,'' he said. ``This year, all I have to
do is think about how to get out this particular hitter, and I
haven't been able to do just that for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two innings to figure things out. There would be a
between-innings videotape viewing. There would be a consultation
with noted expert Pedro Martinez. The conclusion? ``I was rushing
myself,'' he decided.
</P>
<P>
   While all this was going on, there was the matter of the five
baserunners and the long counts. He was the proverbial one pitch
away from big trouble in the first and second innings. That pitch
never came. What did come were very much-needed called third
strikes to Jeff Liefer and Paul Konerko in the first and to Durham
and Mike Caruso in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he makes a bad pitch,'' explained catcher Jason Varitek,
``that doesn't mean he can't make the next pitch a great pitch.
That's what a Cy Young winner can do.''
</P>
<P>
   When he took the mound in the third, it was with a 3-0 lead,
courtesy of a two-run triple by Jose ``Maybe I Should Renegotiate''
Offerman and an RBI single by Darren Lewis. A veteran pitcher knows
what must be done in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to give any runs back after your team has
scored,'' confirmed Saberhagen. And he didn't. The Chicago third
went as follows: Thomas fly ball, Liefer ground out, Ordonez caught
looking. Saberhagen was in command.
</P>
<P>
   They never really touched him after the second. Although the
third was his only 1-2-3 inning, he thereafter did not allow more
than one baserunner per inning, departing with two away in the
seventh after Caruso dumped his 102d pitch into center field for a
harmless single.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math. He threw 48 pitches in the first two innings. He
threw 54 pitches in the next 4 2/3 innings. That's the Bret
Saberhagen he likes to see in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed. The White Sox were looking at the full package.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few innings, I wasn't able to get my breaking ball
over,'' he said. ``I couldn't even throw my fastball for strikes.
Then I was throwing my fastball and curve to lefties and fastball
and change to righties. After that, I started throwing the change
to the lefties and the curve to the righties. When you mix it up
like that, they can't just look for two pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the where is just as important as the what.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fun to catch,'' said Varitek, ``because he loves to throw
inside and they know he means it. When someone can come inside like
that, it gives you so many more options.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who missed an entire season (1996) after Mets team
physician David Altchek performed radical reconstruction surgery on
his right shoulder. This is a two-time Cy Young Award winner who
went through the tedious and lonely rehab process and who
painstakingly worked his way back with minor league stints in
Lowell, Trenton, and Pawtucket. This is a man who won the Sporting
News American League Comeback Player of the Year award last year
while pitching the entire season in pain from what he refers to as
an ``impingement'' in his shoulder. And now this is a man who says
he is like a ``kid in a candy store'' because the scar tissue in
his shoulder is broken up, and he can pitch without discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Bret Saberhagen has always been a winning major league
pitcher. If there is any candy being dispensed, it's the poison
variety he has been serving up to American League batters.

 &HT;    Lawmakers: U.S. plans aimless
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _Walking through a refugee camp in Macedonia last
week, Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) was struck by the number of
signs on each tent listing the names and hometowns of a multitude
of missing family members.
</P>
<P>
   Those handwritten cardboard signs waving in the wind served as a
potent reminder to Chambliss of how many families have been torn
apart by the three-week-old war.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the tents at the Brazda-Stankovic camp near the Kosovo
border, Chambliss heard story after story about the Yugoslav Army
busting into homes and ordering families to flee at gun point. The
refugees told him how men had been arbitrarily separated from their
families and never heard from again. How children barely as tall as
his knee cap were ordered by the Serbian military to walk for days.
</P>
<P>
   The stories Chambliss heard at the hastily erected refugee camp
only strengthened his belief that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic is a ``Balkan thug and international murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also reinforced his frustration with the way the Clinton
Administration has handled war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this administration has a plan for how to get
out,'' said Chambliss, a member of the House Armed Services
Committee. He said the Clinton Administration also erred by telling
the American public that ground troops would not be considered as
an option when they may have to be called upon.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss is opposed to using ground troops at the moment,
citing Kosovo's mountainous terrain and the determination of the
Serbian forces to defend their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would run the risk of losing many, many soldiers,''
Chambliss said. ``But by the same token, I think it is a mistake
for the administration to carry out a military operation without a
contingency plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss notes that the United States has ``never been involved
in an operation where we have achieved a military victory without
ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss predicted that Congress would oppose the use of ground
troops without three things: a clear and defined objective of what
will be accomplished; a clear and defined exit strategy; and an
invitation from all of the NATO member countries to send troops.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss visited the camp with House Armed Services Chairman
Floyd Spence (R-S.C.) and fellow committee member Rep. Lindsey
Graham (R-S.C.)
</P>
<P>
   The trio visited six countries in nine days to assess NATO air
strikes in Yugoslavia and Kosovo. It was an emotional journey that
left all three visibly moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can walk away from the camps without having
a heavy heart for what the Kosovar Albanians are going through,''
Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham, like Chambliss, said he is not convinced that the
right way out to defeat Milosevic is to send American troops to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A ground war is politically unfeasible and militarily
unwise,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be successful we need to expand the target
list and aggressively pursue the air campaign,'' Graham said. ``We
must give our pilots and military planners more discretion over
target selection and carrying out the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that politics and bureaucracy are getting in the
way of the bombing campaign,'' Graham said. ``Our pilots and airmen
are being put at undue risk in an effort to minimize collateral
damage. While losses can be minimized, we cannot make war
pain-free. Soldiers are trained to kill and break things. We must
not let a 'zero-collateral damage policy' prevent us from executing
our air campaign.''

 &HT;    St. Joe Co. creates firm called Advantis
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The St. Joe Co., a former paper producer turned real
estate corporation, has combined its real estate service operations
into a new Atlanta-based firm named Advantis.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-employee operation is headed by T. Richard Bryant,
former president of Goodman Segar GVA, which was acquired by St.
Joe last September. The new firm, which also includes Florida Real
Estate Advisors, acquired by St. Joe in January, has operations
from Washington, D.C. to Miami. The firm has 65 employees in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville, Fla.-based St. Joe, a publicly held corporation
that is Florida's largest private land owner and parent of the
Arvida residential operations, has moved forcefully into commercial
real estate development. It recently purchased two office
development sites in metro Atlanta. The company is also looking for
potential office sites in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Advantis plans to build a client base of corporations that need
new or expanded facilities and property management, Bryant said.
The firm is also beefing up its institutional investment staff.
</P>
<P>
   Although Advantis is a subsidiary of St. Joe Commercial Group,
``St. Joe is not going to be a major part of our business,'' Bryant
said.

SERBS PROBABLY SOLD PIECES OF DOWNED STEALTH FIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Photos of the F-117 Stealth fighter that was shot down over
Bosnia more than two weeks ago show that the wreckage had been
picked clean within hours after the crash, but it's unlikely that
the debris will provide any useful information about the plane's
design that was not already well known, analysts said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pictures several hours after the crash showed it had been
picked clean,'' said aerospace analyst John Pike of the Federation
of American Scientists in Washington. ``All of the sort of intact
stealthy stuff,'' _ such as the special radar-evading materials
from a large section of wing seen in the first photos of the crash
site _ ``went off very fast,'' Pike said, as seen in later
pictures. ``I assume it was quickly auctioned off in very spirited
bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace engineers in Russia, among other places, are
undoubtedly studying these materials by now, Pike said, ``but
they're probably not going to get an awful lot'' of information
from it.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why aerospace engineers and analysts,
while chagrined by the loss of the plane in hostile territory, are
not losing sleep over the potential technology gains to those who
analyze its parts. Primarily, they say, it is because the
technology that went into that plane, designed to provide little or
no radar reflection to those attempting to track it, was developed
back in the 1970s. The secret technologies for Stealth aircraft
have progressed considerably since then.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most of the information about the F-117 itself is
already well known to anyone who is interested. The plane has been
displayed at air shows, where any paying visitor could walk right
up to the plane and examine it and take pictures, said Peter Young,
an Air Force colonel and visiting lecturer in aerospace engineering
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Aeronautics and
Astronautics Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a lecture at MIT a few weeks ago, Steven Justice of
Lockheed-Martin, the chief engineer of the F-117, demonstrated some
of the plane's radar-reflectance characteristics by using a widely
available plastic model kit of the plane, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The configuration is fairly well known, the materials are
fairly well known, the things done to elude radar are well known,''
Young said. Any foreign analyst who gets a chance to analyze a
piece of the wreckage, he said, will probably find that ``it just
confirms what people already knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, Young said, have already designed fighters for the
export market that include some Stealth features. British and
French aerospace companies are also said to be working on such
designs. But none of them are likely to be influenced by the loss
of this F-117, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and the Chinese are thought to be about two decades
behind the United States in aircraft technology, Pike said, which
is approximately the age of the technology used in the F-117. The
specifics of the the plane's design, Pike said, were in large part
dictated by the limitations of the computers available in the 1970s
for its design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current-generation computers can produce designs that are
curved, rather than faceted,'' Pike said. The only reason the F-117
``had such hard angles is because that was the most complex shape a
computer could handle back then.''
</P>
<P>
   And the materials used to provide ``low-observability'' on radar
screens are well known around the world, Pike said. As long ago as
World War II, Germany had been experimenting with antiradar
materials to use for the periscopes on their submarines. ``It's not
like there's some singular, mystical ingredient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, engineers in many places would be very interested in
seeing a piece of an F-117 firsthand. ``Anybody who works on radar
evasion wants to get a big piece from the leading practitioner,''
Pike said, and US Stealth aircraft design is acknowledged to be far
ahead of any other nation's.
</P>
<P>
   Young pointed out that much of the plane's success in evading
radar detection rests with the small details of how pieces are
assembled. Most such details could already have been gleaned from
photos taken at an airshow, and there's not likely to be anything
learned from the wreck ``that a good adversary wouldn't know
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117 was the first plane designed from scratch with radar
evasion as its primary design criterion, but that choice entailed
many compromises, analysts say. Speed, efficiency, and
maneuverability all suffer somewhat as a result.
</P>
<P>
   None of the plane's other features, such as its navigation and
communication systems, are anything special, Pike said, and would
be of little value to an adversary. ``They concentrated all the
development on the Stealth, and everything else was just ordered
out of a catalog,'' Pike said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Pike, ``one of these falling into the hands of the
Russians or the Chinese was not part of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if, at the end of the day, it doesn't cause anybody to do
anything different, simply being able to analyze actual samples
instead of just speculating about it is going to be useful for
weapons and aircraft designers, even if it just confirms what they
already knew.''

LEWINSKY SCANDAL, CONTEMPT CITATION SEEN AS CLINTON LEGACIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton was found in contempt of
court Monday for lying about his sexual relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky, the news was somewhat dulled because Clinton was dealing
with Kosovo. But when history is written, scholars say the Lewinsky
story and the contempt citation are likely to be the president's
enduring legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some unforeseen circumstance in which the Kosovo
conflict turns into the equivalent of World War III, the scholars
said, Clinton has little hope that his war actions will overshadow
his impeachment. And the ruling that Clinton was in contempt of
court for lying in his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit may have sealed his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Nixon had a war for most of his time in office and
that is not what we remember him by,'' said G. Calvin Mackenzie, a
professor of government at Colby College. While Nixon certainly is
remembered for the way he conducted the Vietnam War, it is Nixon's
Watergate dealings and resignation from office that became his
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a recent CBS-TV interview that he didn't regard
impeachment as ``some great badge of shame,'' and he has insisted
that it be balanced off by his many accomplishments as president.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the president refused to comment on the contempt
citation, and he walked away from journalists when they tried to
question him after he spoke about Kosovo in the Rose Garden.
Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could appeal the contempt citation, but he has little
enthusiam for that, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Such a fight might lead to weeks of hearings and even testimony
from Lewinsky, followed by a possible referral of the matter to a
prosecutor. Clinton is likely to accept the penalty of paying
several hundred thousand dollars in legal fees and the possible
revocation of his law license, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials hope that a successful, quick war effort
in Kosovo could be a big boost. But Clinton himself has proven how
fickle public opinion can be about foreign affairs; he beat
President Bush in 1992 despite Bush's victory in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's contempt of court citation was not surprising, given
that US District Judge Susan Webber Wright had hinted at it in a
September ruling. But Republicans viewed it as a vindication of the
House vote for impeachment, even though the House failed to approve
the article that specifically charged Clinton with lying in the
civil deposition. Despite the House's failure to approve that
article, Senate Republicans noted repeatedly that they believed
Clinton had lied and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there was a symmetry to two judicial actions on
Monday, and it provided what one analyst called ``an elegant
conclusion'' to the past year's focus on the Lewinsky story. The
contempt citation affirmed that Clinton lied under oath. And the
acquittal by an Arkansas jury of Clinton's friend Susan McDougal
affirmed the view that independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr had
gone too far in his effort to investigate the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a delicious conclusion for those who attacked both
Clinton and Starr in the last year,'' Brookings Institution scholar
Stephen Hess said. ``It is about where both deserve to be. It is a
punishment fitting the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But is the Lewinsky story really over? That depends in large
part upon Starr, who suffered a setback Monday when a Little Rock
jury found McDougal not guilty of obstructing Starr's investigation
and deadlocked on two contempt charges. McDougal's attorneys in
effect put Starr on trial, arguing that the prosecutor has been so
zealous in going after Clinton that he tried to get McDougal to lie
about her knowledge of the president's Arkansas business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The jury agreed with that defense, and Clinton quickly issued a
statement wishing her well. But Starr may decide to retry McDougal
on the contempt charges.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after that victory came the contempt citation and the
setback for the president. And in issuing it, Wright may have
opened the door a little wider for Starr to try to indict the
president for perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr is unlikely to try to indict Clinton while he
remains in office _ which many legal scholars said would be
unconstitutional _ he could try to indict him after he leaves the
White House. It depends on whether Starr believes that the House
impeachment vote and the contempt of court citation vindicate him
for his investigation and that he has an obligation to pursue an
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Starr would not discuss the contempt citation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will testify Wednesday against renewing the independent
counsel law, the Associated Press reported. He opposes renewal
partly on grounds that it violates the constitutional separation of
powers between the executive and judicial branches. Many lawmakers
of both parties want to eliminate or modify the statute allowing an
independent counsel to investigate possible illegal activities by
the highest-ranking members of an administration.

CAT IN A HAT A STAMP, HOW'S THAT! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass. native who made a story-time staple of
rhyming whimsy about green eggs and ham and cats with hats has won
a piece of popular iconography.
</P>
<P>
   The US Postal Service, encouraged by strong ballot-box support
in western Massachusetts, will unveil a stamp next month honoring
Dr. Seuss's most famous creation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the famous children's author might have put it: That
fuzzy cat in the tall striped hat will soon feel frequently damp;
his little fans from his creator's land have helped turn him into a
stamp!
</P>
<P>
   The new Cat in the Hat stamp will be issued at a gala planned
for May 26 at the Springfield Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a celebration of children's literacy, and a
recognition of how reading books is so important,'' said Joseph
Carvalho, president and executive director of Springfield Library
and Museum, who helped promote the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a writer who touched generations of Americans and who
continue to touch them in a very special and unique way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the sober domain of president, philosophers and
philanthropists, stamps are now as likely to celebrate popular
culture. Elvis _ forever young and slim _ has one. So does Marilyn
Monroe, Popeye and Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, so will Theodor Seuss Geisel, who created such
classics as ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' and ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' over a 54-year career. The 1984 Pulitzer Prize winner
for children's literature, drew on his Springfield boyhood for his
first book, ``And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seuss stamp is one of 15 stamps selected by nationwide vote
last year to commemorate the 1950s. A Postal Service advisory panel
selected subjects for the first five decades of the century and the
public has now voted on subjects for the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another son of Massachusetts, heavyweight champion Rocky
Marciano of Brockton, is also among the 1950s stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Other stamps to be issued depict images of video games, the fall
of the Berlin Wall, personal computers, hip-hop cultures, Sesame
Street, disco music, the Beatles, Woodstock, and baseball great
Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Cat in the Hat stamp will not be made public
until its unveiling next month.

 &HT;    Filibuster in Alabama aimed at slowing down lottery movement
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Alabama's Bible-belt backbone was up Tuesday
as Gov. Don Siegelman's lottery bill triggered a Senate filibuster
featuring dire predictions of the state's moral downfall should the
measure pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot ignore the fact that there will be divorce
problems, domestic abuse problems, homelessness and addiction
problems if you pass this gambling bill,'' said Sen. J.T. ``Jabo''
Waggoner, a Republican lottery opponent. ``How many of you are
going to go home this weekend and tell your momma, `Momma, I voted
for a gambling bill and I'm proud of it?'''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate vote had been expected Tuesday, but, with the
filibuster, now likely will not come before Thursday. Alabama's
House passed the lottery bill 70-31.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman, a Democrat who broke a long-running Republican lock
on the Governor's Mansion last fall by campaigning on an
``education-lottery'' platform, wants Alabama residents to vote on
a lottery in a constitutional referendum, perhaps as early as this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, Alabama would become the seventh Southern state with
a lottery. The issue has been raised in Tennessee, South Carolina,
North Carolina and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman would model Alabama's lottery after Georgia's, with
proceeds estimated at $150 million a year going to fund college
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are also scheduled to take up a bill that would allow
video poker terminals at greyhound tracks. Unlike the lottery bill,
however, the video gaming proposal would become law if passed, not
going to the voters in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman made the lottery his top campaign issue last fall,
when he unseated Republican incumbent Fob James. His supporters
cite polls showing a majority of Alabama residents want a vote on
the lottery, and that the proposal would pass if put on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lowell Barron, the Democratic leader in the Senate,
predicted the measure would pass, but not until opponents _ largely
Republicans _ have plenty of time to state their opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to cut off debate prematurely,'' he said.
``But I don't have any doubt we'll pass the lottery bill. We have
the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama currently allows betting on greyhound racing, but has
watched as casinos in neighboring Mississippi have mushroomed and
Georgia's lottery has provided scholarships for thousands of
college-bound students.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of expanding gambling offerings with active state
involvement seems to have struck a raw nerve in the conservative,
church-going state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good way of running our state,'' said Sen. Bill
Armistead, another Republican lottery opponent. ``What we need to
be looking at is legitimate ways of raising revenues, not taking
the last dollar from poor people who can't afford it.''

CISCO ADDS GEOTEL TO NETWORKING FOLD FOR $1.92 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER AND RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GeoTel Communications Corp., a six-year-old maker of software
for routing customer calls, will be purchased by giant computer
networking company Cisco Systems Inc. for $1.92 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday underscores the growing compatibility
of telephone networks and computer systems based on Internet
standards. It would give San Jose-based Cisco, an Internet hardware
specialist, access to GeoTel's software for managing customer calls
to corporate ``call centers''. Cisco would be better able to offer
products combining voice traffic with data.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents a bonanza for GeoTel, founded six years ago
on a $7 million initial investment. Tuesday's agreement values each
share of GeoTel at $58.64, or 33 percent higher than its price
before the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel earned a profit of only $9 million last year. But the
Lowell, Mass. company has made a name for itself selling software
to customers like American Airlines, Fidelity Investments and
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Now, such customers are looking to combine customer voice
traffic with data sent via Internet standards, an area where
Cisco's hubs and routers dominate. Six months ago, GeoTel began a
partnership with Cisco to create products in this area, and the
merger is the logical reflection of the emerging market, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Listwin, the Cisco executive vice president who will oversee
the new unit, said the growth of electronic commerce will only
accelerate the convergence. ``We see selling GeoTel software with
our hardware to the `New World Order' of companies like
Amazon.com,'' Listwin said, referring to the on-line bookseller
based in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   John Thibault, GeoTel chief executive, added: ``We looked at our
strategic alternatives and Cisco was a compelling partner because
of its strength in a combination of data and voice switching.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, GeoTel considered a similar deal with Cisco
competitor Lucent Technologies Inc., said a person familiar with
the matter. The companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has steadily acquired smaller technology companies over
several years, but the GeoTel purchase represents the largest since
1996. Then, Cisco bought StrataCom Inc., a maker of high-speed
switches, for $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel will remain as a separate unit of Cisco with Thibault as
its head. No layoffs are expected among GeoTel's 310 employees, the
two companies said.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal is completed, Cisco will have more than 1,000
employees in Massachusetts, mostly based in its regional
headquarters in Chelmsford.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was approved by boards of both companies Monday
night. It still requires approvals from GeoTel shareholders and
certain federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Cisco will exchange 0.5138
shares of its common stock for each of GeoTel's 32.7 million shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco shares closed Tuesday at $114 1/8, down 3 5/8. GeoTel
stock rose 11 11/16 to close at 55 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel Senior Vice President Lou Volpe said the agreement also
includes conditions under which breakup penalities would be paid if
the deal isn't completed, but he declined to describe these
details.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel was established in 1993 with a $7 million investment from
Fidelity Investments and Matrix Partners, the Waltham, Mass.
venture capital firm. The company sold its first public stock in
1996, and last year had sales of $44.85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault estimates the market for call center equipment at $5
billion a year, an industry that employs 130,000 people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel's software coordinates database records for customer
sales representatives. For example, a caller to an insurance
company looking to buy a policy after watching a national
television ad could be switched automatically to a sales agent at
the closest regional branch, depending on the area code of the
caller's phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, calls from customers who owe money on their credit
card accounts could be automatically routed to a collections
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the merger allays fears that GeoTel, which has
focused mainly on phone networks, could be swamped as call-center
consumers embrace the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a gaping hole in terms of GeoTel's general strategy
going forward, which is how they're planning to address the
next-generation network,'' said Ted Jackson, senior analyst at US
BancCorp Piper Jaffray. ``This is a good way to solve that''
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Herbert Tinger, First Albany Corp. analyst: ``Cisco wants
to get into telecom in a big way, and this is the quickest way to
get major customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecom is the last big industry that's still heavily based on
proprietary hardware, but that's starting to change because
everybody wants to bring e-mail or text-chat services'' to
traditional telephone customers, he said.

COMMENTARY: HOME IS WHERE THE HEARTACHE IS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Tuesday, April 20)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From here, looking over there, you would think it would be a
blessing to board a transport plane, even the back of a truck, and
get the heck out.
</P>
<P>
   But places like Kosovo or Bosnia and others where people are
forced out remain home. It is where people did normal things, like
go to school, fall in love and have babies. Where they know what
spring smells like, when it isn't overpowered by smoke and death.
It is the place they will dream of no matter where they land, the
place in the old photos for those lucky to have family pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of home even when it's being destroyed from inside and
out was enough to bring some Bosnian women back, according to
Deborah Lubar, an American writer and actor, whose works focus on
women in war zones. Recently in California as part of a lecture
tour on Bosnian women refugees, Lubar offered a perspective on what
happens after ethnic cleansing and peace accords. ``After the world
has stopped paying attention,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She's been to Bosnia twice in the last three years, interviewing
women in Sanski Most, a refugee city 15 minutes away from the city
of Prijidor in Bosnia. Many of the women used to live in nice homes
and work at good jobs in Prijidor, but Prijidor is now in the
Republic of Serbska and off limits to many of its former
inhabitants, including these mostly Muslim women.
</P>
<P>
   Technically they are considered displaced persons, not refugees,
because they live in their own country. But Lubar points out,
``They feel they are not at home. They have lost their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything they had is gone, including many of their husbands
who disappeared or were killed in the war. Many of their children
are moved far away, because they say there is no future in their
homeland. The women, middle- aged and older, feel it's too late for
them to start over in a new land.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, an economist unable to find work, told her, ``It's
hard to know who we are anymore. We've lost our friends. Our
husbands were killed. People don't see us as we were anymore.''
What strikes Lubar is how much the displaced people of Yugoslavia,
no matter which group, are no different from many Americans.
``People with decent, good lives'' and unprepared to have it all
wrenched away.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian refugees she knows were run out of their homes
during the 3 1/2 year conflict. She said what's happening in Kosovo
now is just ``a speeded-up version of what happened in Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   She wondered how the women knew what to take when ordered out of
their homes. They told her they didn't know. They stuck what they
could in a bag and left. One woman said it was summer and she left
in a dress and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `Why did I wear high heels?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of them made it to other parts of Europe but returned after
the 1995 Dayton Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these women were doctors, nurses and teachers, even a
judge. But outside of Bosnia they were treated like barbarians.''
Working as maids in different parts of Europe, they said their
employers treated them as if they had never seen a refrigerator
before. Because of the language difficulties the women couldn't
explain that, indeed, they used to own houses that were larger than
the ones they were cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to come back home,'' said Lubar, ``just like the
Albanians are going to eventually want to come home to Kosovo.''
Being a refugee is not the same as being an immigrant. It's not a
choice. One day you're an established member of the community and
the next day you're one of a thousand on a road, carrying your life
in a plastic shopping bag. You become an international dilemma _
the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian refugees from Kosovo who fled to Macedonia were
moved again this week, ordered to get on city buses and taken to
the airport and flown to Turkey and Norway. Some were relieved to
go. Some resisted. They worried that the farther they were removed,
the harder it would be to get back.

   ``You cannot fathom what happened to them because on the
outside, they're personally lovely. They wear makeup and little

very important to recover their femininity, their beauty.''

<P>
   But the men refugees, she said, don't talk about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are even more shattered. They couldn't save their
families. They feel utterly impotent.''

A PERFORMER OF MANY FACES, ALL BRAZILIAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antonio Nobrega, a Brazilian performer who will be making his
United States debut at the Kennedy Center's American Dance Festival
April 27 through 29, trots out a variety of characters in
``Figural,'' the one-man show he will use to greet North American
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The figures he conjures, through mime, dance, music and
acrobatics, are not simply creatures of the artist's fancy but a
string of types meant as a showcase for Brazil's culturally rich
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Nobrega, more than most performers these days,
feels himself on a mission greater than exploring his own emotions.
In his case, he has set out to do no less than preserve Brazilian
culture, both inside and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   To Brazilians, Nobrega is perhaps the most popular performer of
music and dance from the northeast, which serves as an artistic
wellspring for the rest of the country. In recent years, Brazil's
northeast has undergone a cultural resurgence, with the release of
films, books, music and dance from the area.
</P>
<P>
   The region's music, from the spirited forro to the fusion of
choro to the African drums of groups like Olodum, is now a staple
of the Rio de Janeiro club scene, and Nobrega himself typically
sells out the Canecao, one of the top concert halls for popular
music in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview from his home in Sao Paulo,
Nobrega said he considered Brazil's northeast ``the most
representative area of Brazil, if you talk about anything cultural
at all.'' Salvador of Bahia was the first capital of Brazil, in the
early 1500s. And from Recife, in the neighboring state of
Pernambuco, came the country's first export, the sugar cane
produced by African slaves. It was here that the cultures that form
Brazil _ Indian, African and European _ first mingled and made
music.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nobrega's recent shows in Rio, ``Wood That the Termites
Don't Chew,'' recreated the traditions of traveling minstrels of
the arid northeast, performers who visit towns and play for the
spare change tossed from windows. Nobrega credits some lyrics and
music to texts and traditions more than a century old.
</P>
<P>
   True to the minstrel shows of the northeast, Nobrega's wife and
children took part in the show, swirling around the shacks and
clotheslines on stage for the exuberant umbrella dances of frevo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, audiences will see Nobrega alone, performing one
of the first pieces he choreographed and wrote for his repertory.
In ``Figural,'' he dons the brilliant costumes and masks by Romero
Andrade Lima, among Brazil's most talented costume designers, to
portray a scoundrel, a saint, a beggar woman in rags and Casanova,
who dances with a doll.
</P>
<P>
   He portrays a clown, Tonheta, to tie the images together in the
second part of the show, using humor and music to comment on life's
sad parade. Tonheta, who plays several instruments at once, is the
only character not to wear a mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most distinguishes the work of Antonio Nobrega,'' wrote
Barbara Heliodora, dance critic for the Rio daily O Globo, ``is his
total delivery of himself as an instrument of creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the character changes of ``Figural,'' ``there is not
one gesture, not one look, that calls attention to Nobrega's person
or personality,'' wrote Ms. Heliodora, who has called the
performer's talent and technique ``exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobrega, 46, came to dance only as an adult. He originally
trained in classical music, encouraged by his father, a doctor in a
sanitarium. In the late 1960s, he played violin with two
orchestras, the Chamber of Paraiba and the Recife Symphony. He then
joined the Armorial Quintet, a group of classically trained
musicians who sought to promote Brazil's native, as against
strictly European culture.

 &UR; UNDATED: European culture. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was with the Armorial that Nobrega picked up the rabeca, a
four-string instrument of country music similar to the violin. The
move would redirect the artist in him utterly.
</P>
<P>
   In the following years, Nobrega gave himself over to researching
Pernambuco, his native state. Economically, the northeast is the
poorest piece of Brazil. If Brazil is sometimes nicknamed Belindia
_ part first world like Belgium and part Third World like India _
Pernambuco belongs firmly in that second end of the definition. But
culturally, the northeast is Brazil's richest area, Nobrega
realized.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the art with a distinctly Brazilian flavor, from the
books of Jorge Amado to capoeira, a form of martial arts borne of
slavery and balletic in its symmetry, came from the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roots of Brazil are there,'' said Roberto da Matta, a
Brazilian anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame in
Indiana. He noted that the music of the Bahian composer and singer
Dorival Caymmi opened the way for bossa nova, while Olodum has
played with Paul Simon. ``Music in Brazil is an essential element:
it's considered the equivalent of money here,'' da Matta said.
``You have three forro disks, some local food _ which is really
national food _ and it's like having a bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobrega studied Brazilian modern dance with Klauss Vianna, and
learned pantomime, mimicry and acrobatics at the Dmitri School of
Theater in Switzerland. Later, he went to the Advanced School of
Circus Art at Chalons-sur-Marne in France.
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Figural'' a ``synthesis'' of archetypes from the
northeast, ``little choreographic designs that spring form the
Brazilian imagination, adding, ``The figures represent a Brazilian
mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazil's population, at 163 million, and its Portuguese
language provide an instant market for everything home-grown, from
computers to line dances, as an artist Nobrega decries the
dominance of United States pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the health of the world, culturally speaking, lies in
what is a part of your soul,'' he said. ``If you cut out that soul,
you leave a sad people.'' On the Rio radio dial, a listener is as
likely to pick up American as Brazilian music. If it is Brazilian,
it often sounds like American music that just happens to be sung in
Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of globalization will be true only on the day that
it creates genuine contact,'' he said. ``I'm speaking about my
country, which is completely colonized by your country, and by the
worst elements. The music of yours that makes it here is not the
best of your music, it's the junk. The same with the television and
movies. It's a kind of cultural imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more selective level, Charles and Stephanie Reinhart see
Brazil exerting an important influence on American culture. The
couple, artistic advisers for dance at the Kennedy Center, invited
Nobrega as the only foreign performer in a series about American
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of dance in the United States, a
major part of the fusion that's happened has come from Latin
America,'' said Reinhart. ``In the early years of modern dance, you
have Catherine Dunham drawing on Caribbean and Brazilian movements.
It's part of our heritage in that it's part of what's formed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinhart said he had seen Nobrega rehearse ``Figural'' at his
Sao Paulo studio several years ago and thought his work a good
panorama of Brazilian movement. ``I think that what he's done, he's
done in a new way, even though it's old,'' he said. ``It's like
Picasso and the African sculptures: what's modern and what's not
modern? It was innovative and yet based on his interpretation of
tradition.''

CAT IN A HAT A STAMP, HOW'S THAT! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass. native who made a story-time staple of
rhyming whimsy about green eggs and ham and cats with hats has won
a piece of popular iconography.
</P>
<P>
   The US Postal Service, encouraged by strong ballot-box support
in western Massachusetts, will unveil a stamp next month honoring
Dr. Seuss's most famous creation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the famous children's author might have put it: That
fuzzy cat in the tall striped hat will soon feel frequently damp;
his little fans from his creator's land have helped turn him into a
stamp!
</P>
<P>
   The new Cat in the Hat stamp will be issued at a gala planned
for May 26 at the Springfield Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a celebration of children's literacy, and a
recognition of how reading books is so important,'' said Joseph
Carvalho, president and executive director of Springfield Library
and Museum, who helped promote the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a writer who touched generations of Americans and who
continue to touch them in a very special and unique way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the sober domain of president, philosophers and
philanthropists, stamps are now as likely to celebrate popular
culture. Elvis _ forever young and slim _ has one. So does Marilyn
Monroe, Popeye and Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, so will Theodor Seuss Geisel, who created such
classics as ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' and ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' over a 54-year career. The 1984 Pulitzer Prize winner
for children's literature, drew on his Springfield boyhood for his
first book, ``And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seuss stamp is one of 15 stamps selected by nationwide vote
last year to commemorate the 1950s. A Postal Service advisory panel
selected subjects for the first five decades of the century and the
public has now voted on subjects for the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another son of Massachusetts, heavyweight champion Rocky
Marciano of Brockton, is also among the 1950s stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Other stamps to be issued depict images of video games, the fall
of the Berlin Wall, personal computers, hip-hop cultures, Sesame
Street, disco music, the Beatles, Woodstock, and baseball great
Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Cat in the Hat stamp will not be made public
until its unveiling next month.

YUGOSLAV OFFICIAL, CHALLENGING MILOSEVIC, CONDEMNS PUBLISHER'S
KILLING
</HEADLINE>

 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The most liberal member of the Yugoslav
government has sharply attacked the use of Serbian wartime
patriotism for ideological and political ends, throwing down an
indirect challenge to President Slobodan Milosevic and his
nationalist and leftist allies, including Milosevic's wife.
</P>
<P>
   In two extraordinary statements over the last two days, the
deputy prime minister of Yugoslavia, Vuk Draskovic, has become the
only official voice to condemn both the murder on Sunday of an
opposition publisher, Slavko Curuvija, and proposals for Yugoslavia
to form an alliance with Russia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   ``May Slavko Curuvija be the first and last victim of those in
Serbia who want to start the mad spiral of fratricide,'' Draskovic
said Monday night on the Belgrade television station, Studio B,
which is controlled by his Serbian Renewal Movement, which governs
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on political parties not to manipulate the
patriotism and unity of the Serbs in wartime, saying: ``All parties
should temporarily bury their differences and insignias,''
attacking in particular the re-emergence of the old Communist
partisan flag, with its red star.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Draskovic went further in attacking the idea of an
alliance with Russia and Belarus, which won overwhelming support on
Monday from the Yugoslav Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is strongly supported by the Yugoslav Left Party of
Milosevic's powerful wife, Mirjana Markovic, who envisions a new
Communist bloc with Yugoslavia at its heart. President Aleksandr
Lukashenko of Belarus is expected in Belgrade on Wednesday to meet
with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are political forces who think we should enter the 21st
century on the ruins of a destroyed state,'' Draskovic said. ``They
think we should pick up picks and shovels with the same songs, the
same iconography, and 50 years later, start building Communism all
over again. This must not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He also attacked the ultranationalistic Radical Party of Deputy
Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj for bringing its own banners and
pictures of Seselj to the daily Belgrade rock concerts organized by
the city. When they did so on Monday, the organizers asked them to
put down their banners and the rock band, Del Arno, stopped playing
until the Seselj followers dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   If such efforts to misuse and manipulate unity continue,
Draskovic said, the concerts will stop. ``And I don't believe that
anyone has the right to lower their heads while journalists are
being murdered,'' Draskovic continued. ``The state of war does not
mean that civic courage should be trampled upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who was one of the leaders of the pro-democracy
demonstrations of 1996 and 1997, joined the Milosevic government
last year in what his former allies considered an act of
opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic failed to win support for a compromise on Kosovo that
might have prevented NATO's bombing . Since the NATO bombing began,
however, he has become an effective spokesman for the Serbian
cause.

TREASURIES WEAKEN AS MAJOR DEBT SALES NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury bond prices sagged Tuesday under the weight
of the large calendar of corporate and agency borrowers planning to
sell their debt over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate bonds give investors an attractive alternative to
Treasuries because the yields are higher, so the rates on
government paper have to rise to stay competitive. Securities firms
arranging the corporate sales often sell Treasuries ahead of the
offering, and that also tends to raise yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price. They do that as a precaution
against rates rising before the corporate deals are done, replacing
the government securities when the sales are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corporate borrowers expected to sell about $9 billion
soon, are the Inter-American Development Bank, Freddie Mac, and the
Associates Corp of North America. Inter-American priced a $1
billion global bond issue Tuesday through Lehman Brothers and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The 10-year bond was priced to yield
5.755 percent. That is about 65 basis points, or hundredths of a
percentage point, above a Treasury security with a comparable
yield.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 20/32, to 96
16/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
the price, rose to 5.49 percent, from 5.45 percent Monday,
</P>
<P>
   Reports on consumer prices and retail sales left market
expectations of continued economic growth with little inflation
unchanged and raised the likelihood that the Fed will not push up
interest rates soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the world we said we always wanted,'' said Donald
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, ``strong
economic growth with low inflation. The stock market continues to
rise, and people are having trouble finding things to get upset
about. The bond market, in turn, is expected to stay within its
current range as a by product of an unchanged FOMC stance, with the
long bond centered at 5.50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in
March, a smaller-than-expected increase. Fine said that along with
a minimal one-tenth of 1 percent rise in the core rate, the
inflation statistics continued to impress market participants. But
he said the relatively benign lift in gasoline prices may be
masking a much larger jump in the April data to be released in May,
as pump prices around the country have surged since the March data
were compiled. The key issue, he added, is whether fuel price
increases will continue, because if they do, the indirect effects
on transportation and other components of inflation could be
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance,'' Fine said, ``the 0.2 percent increase in
retail sales seemed to suggest a noticeable slowing in the growth
of consumer spending, but in light of past data revisions and
giddiness in the stock market, this conclusion would undoubtedly be
premature.''

LATEST EARTH-BOUND ASTEROID BEING REPORTED CAREFULLY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a discovery eerily reminescent of one made just a year ago,
astronomers have found an asteroid that will be coming quite close
to Earth in a few decades, and that even has a real but minuscule
possibility of an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Last year astronomers made a similar discovery of an asteroid
that had a slight possibility of hitting Earth in about 40 years.
In that case, it quickly turned out the Earth was safe after all,
and astronomers have been arguing ever since about the way that
report was disseminated. Now, another very similar, possibly
threatening, asteroid has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The object, called 1999 AN10, was described in a detailed
scientific paper posted on a website by three astronomers. But
unlike last year's case, no information has been sent out directly
to the public and the press.
</P>
<P>
   The asteroid is thought to be about a mile in diameter _ similar
to the one last year _ and could possibly come very close to Earth
in 2039. There is even about a one-in-a-billion chance that it
could strike the Earth that year, with devastating consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, don't panic. That's actually less than the risk that
an unknown asteroid or comet might hit Earth on any given day, and
therefore is not anything to be too concerned about. What might be
more worrisome is its long-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 600 years, according to astronomers Andrea Milani,
Steven Chesley and Giovanni Valsecchi, the asteroid could remain
very close to Earth, and if it comes close enough to be affected by
Earth's gravity its orbit could become so chaotic that it is
impossible to predict for more than a decade or two ahead. In that
case, it could require constant, careful monitoring for centuries
to guard against a possible impact.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time in history _ or perhaps the first
time, depending on whose analysis of last year's discovery you
believe _ that an asteroid has been discovered that has a small but
non-zero possibility of striking the Earth within a few decades.
Even though the actual likelihood is vanishingly small, that makes
it an interesting find. Some people have questioned the wisdom of
the changes in the way such information is disseminated as a result
of what many astronomers considered a serious public embarrassment
last year.
</P>
<P>
   British anthropologist Benny Peiser, who has written extensively
about the effects of past impacts on the Earth, Tuesday circulated
an e-mail message questioning the fact that this discovery, unlike
last year's, has not been the subject of any public announcement or
press release. While acknowledging that the risk is tiny and not
something that anyone should lose any sleep over, Peiser said he
found the lack of public notice disturbing, suggesting that it
reflects an overreaction to astronomers' embarrassment about last
year's announcement followed by a swift reversal.
</P>
<P>
   But astronomers contacted Tuesday said that in fact, they see
this as a perfect example of how such information should be
handled. The astronomers who made the calculations of impact
probabilities have circulated their unpublished paper to several
colleagues around the world who specialize in such calculations, in
order to make sure their conclusions are correct. Some astronomers
contacted Tuesday said that all the comments so far from such
specialists have been positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend them for the process of being careful,'' said
Richard Binzel, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who specializes in asteroids. Many astronomers felt that
last year's press release about an asteroid called XF11 was
premature and caused unnecessary public alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Binzel stressed the very low odds of an impact predicted by
Milani and his colleagues. Binzel has suggested the use of a hazard
scale that would allow all such discoveries to be given a simple
classification, similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes, to
allow people to judge their seriousness. ``On a scale of zero to
5,'' he said, ``this thing is a zero.''
</P>
<P>
   And astronomer David Morrison of the NASA Ames Research Center
said that there was no reason for this finding to be disseminated
publicly. Last year the asteroid in question was still visible in
the sky for a few more weeks and it was important to alert
astronomers around the world to make every possible observation of
it to pin down the orbit, but in this case the asteroid is already
in a part of the sky where it cannot be observed for months, so
there is no such urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to do, even if we thought it was dangerous,''
he said.

   DETROIT _ Environmentalists are pleased but oil and auto
industry lobbyists are worried by signals that the Clinton
administration is likely to require much cleaner gasoline and
autos, including cuts of up to 93 percent in allowable air
pollution from large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency drafted a proposal two
months ago for stricter rules on vehicles and gasoline, and
submitted it for an interagency review. That review is now in its
final stages, with an announcement expected as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Tuesday that some decisions on the
new rules had not yet been made. Last-minute lobbying could still
lead to further changes. But extensive contacts between the
administration and various interest groups active on the issue have
persuaded environmentalists and industry lobbyists alike that the
final plan probably will closely resemble the agency's proposal,
which calls for a crackdown that the oil industry in particular has
criticized as excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Strict rules could provoke a fight between the administration
and Congress. Some Republican senators have already warned the
administration against what they perceive as regulatory excess.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who heads the clean air subcommittee
of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has already begun
drafting legislation to cancel the gasoline cleanliness rules. But
any such legislation is likely to face a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is still working on whether to allow a longer
timetable for industries to meet the new rules, but it seems likely
to set the eventual levels of allowable pollution at roughly what
the EPA proposed, said lobbyists on both sides of the issue who
have been discussing the details with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my expectation that they would keep it as they
originally talked about it,'' said Josephine Cooper, president of
the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which is based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Keefe, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's
lobbying arm, said the administration was considering whether to
add to the EPA proposal a complex system of credits for oil
companies that make early changes in gasoline. But he dismissed
this idea as inadequate, and said that, ``So far, we don't know
that we've gotten anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Becker, senior energy policy analyst at the Sierra Club,
said that based on his understanding of the planned rules, he was
satisfied and wanted the administration to move as quickly as
possible. Once the interagency process is completed, the rules must
be issued for public comment and then issued in legal form. If that
process lasts past the end of the year, the auto industry could
seek an extension for some deadlines in the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration can't let that happen and let us lose a
year,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal regulations allow cars to emit four-tenths of a
gram of smog-causing nitrogen oxides for each mile traveled.
Minivans and the smaller sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks
are allowed to emit seven-tenths of a gram per mile, while the
larger sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks are allowed 1.1
grams per mile.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on all but the larger sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks are already scheduled to be tightened somewhat next
year. The Clean Air Act of 1990 explicitly allows the issuance of
new rules now for vehicle pollution and the cleanliness of fuel,
and the EPA's proposal would require much deeper cuts for all
family vehicles. Under a rule that would gradually take effect for
vehicles built from 2004 to 2007, the limit would be
seven-hundredths of a gram of nitrogen oxides per mile for cars,
minivans and the smaller sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks would also be
required to meet this tough standard starting with the 2009 model
year. This would mark the first time that these vehicles would be
regulated like cars, something several administrations had been
reluctant to do until recently because these large vehicles are
mainly sold by domestic automakers, for which they produce huge
profits and tens of thousands of jobs. But with big sport utility
vehicles in particular being used now as oversized cars rather than
work vehicles, and with sales soaring and environmentalists
starting to complain, the EPA changed its position.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules would not affect large commercial trucks or
vehicles already on the road. Officials of the environmental agency
said that without new rules, air pollution would start worsening
again about 2010, as Americans drive ever more miles in ever bigger
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA plan would also require a 91 percent cut, phased in from
2004 to 2006, in the level of sulfur in gasoline. Sulfur, a
naturally occurring contaminant of crude oil, clogs catalytic
converters and dramatically increases pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry's criticism of the administration plan has
been muted by Detroit's delight at the prospect of deep cuts in the
sulfur in gasoline. This will make it much easier for Detroit to
meet future emissions standards, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Cooper of the automakers alliance said further cuts in
sulfur would be needed after 2006 to make sure that all of the
administration's pollution targets could be met. Automakers
maintain that even with the cleaner gasoline, designing ever
cleaner engines and better catalytic converters could add several
hundred dollars to the cost of a car and more to the cost of a
sport utility vehicle. It is unclear how much of this extra cost
could be passed on to the public if competition remains fierce in
the auto market.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a greener image, Ford Motor Co. has begun voluntarily
building all of its sport utility vehicles to be as clean as
current cars. But even Ford executives have expressed worries about
the new standards in 2009 for large sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks. Ford and other automakers want a mandatory review in
2004 of the new rules; no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the auto industry, the oil industry gains nothing from
the new regulations, and so is very unhappy. O'Keefe of the
petroleum institute said the rules could add 5 or 6 cents to the
price of a gallon of gasoline. This, he contended, is an
unnecessary expense for people living in states with few air
quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers have suggested that the extra cost might be only
2 or 3 cents a gallon, but O'Keefe said this assumed that new
refining techniques, so far only demonstrated in the laboratory,
could be introduced on a commercial scale.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, who
were criticized for giving only $353 to charity in 1997,
drastically increased those donations last year to $15,197, tax
returns they filed Tuesday show.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores paid $52,463 in federal income taxes on an adjusted
gross income of $224,132, a 23 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore, Chris Lehane, would not comment directly
on how editorials, radio talk shows and other criticism about the
Gores' 1997 gifts had affected their 1998 giving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Gores have had the financial resources, they have
contributed at generous levels,'' Lehane said. ``That has been
their practice, as shown over the last six years when they gave
away about $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane noted that the vice president earned $5,000 for writing
the forward of a cookbook by his mother, Pauline Gore. The book
will be published by Henry Holt &AMP; Co. Gore also earned $15,564 in
royalties from ``Earth in the Balance,'' his 1992 book on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores gave their donations to charities for the homeless and
mentally ill, religious institutions and education organizations.
No gifts to environmental organizations were listed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton gave
$99,220 of their $504,109 income to charity last year, which helped
lower their federal income taxe rate to 15.8 percent, tax returns
released Tuesday by the White House showed.
</P>
<P>
   Having paid more than twice as much in federal income taxes as
the law required in 1996 and 1997 because of the way they gave away
royalties from a book by Mrs. Clinton, the Clintons received a
delayed tax break that cut their income taxes by 45 percent, to
$79,480. In 1997, the Clintons had an adjusted gross income of
$569,511 and paid $91,964, or 16 percent, in federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' adjusted gross income of $504,109 came from the
$200,000 salary Clinton earns as president, $16,665 in taxable
interest, $16,736 in dividends, $1,329 in state income tax refund
from Arkansas, $74,289 in royalties from Mrs. Clinton's
best-selling book ``It Takes A Village,'' and $200,318 from
securities from a blind trust they sold shortly before they paid a
legal settlement to Paula Jones. In addition, the Clintons earned
$4,780 in tax-exempt interest from municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons changed the way they gave away proceeds from Mrs.
Clinton's new book, which is about the presidential pets, said
Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, so that all proceeds from the
new book will go to charity and none to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Of their charitable donations, $7,220 came from their own
accounts. They donated the $12,000 Mrs. Clinton received last year
from the Henry G. Freeman Pin Money Fund, established in 1912 to
benefit first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons gave away $80,000 in royalties last year from ``It
Takes A Village.'' The Clintons received the royalties as income,
paid taxes on the royalties and donated the after-tax balance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Clintons gave away so much money that they could
not deduct the full amount on that year's tax return and had to
delay a $62,718 deduction until their 1998 income tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts, plus the delayed deduction, gave them charitable
deductions last year totaling $161,938.
</P>
<P>
   In three years, the Clintons have given away $920,000 in book
royalties to children's hospitals and other children's charities.
But had the Clintons arranged the book royalties differently they
could have given away $107,664 they paid in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To give the additional sums Mrs. Clinton would have had to have
given the copyright to ``It Takes a Village'' to a public charity
or a private foundation before the book was published. By creating
a donor-directed fund, an option that the IRS has approved for some
public charities, the Clintons could have distributed the money to
charities of their choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Had they done this, they would have had no royalty income in
1996, 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, the Clintons' income would have dropped to $429,820
and they would have paid $139,348 in federal income tax, a
recalculation of their income tax returns using TurboTax software
showed. Their income tax would then have been 32.4 percent of their
income, a typical rate for a couple in their income range.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the White House announced that the principle
behind the first family's tax preparation ``is that the Clintons
will neither benefit, nor lose, because of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the Clintons took the royalties as income, Mrs.
Clinton paid the maximum Social Security tax in those years at the
rate for self-employed individuals, increasing her Social Security
retirement benefits by about $600 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Mike McCurry, who was White House press secretary,
said the options to give away the royalties without incurring taxes
were either ``a hassle'' or had been unknown to the first family.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton gave the copyright to her latest book, ``Dear
Socks, Dear Buddy,'' to the National Park Foundation, which will
use the money to maintain federal parks and the White House, Toiv
said.
</P>
<P>
   No deduction was taken for the copyright and the gift is not
mentioned in the Clintons' tax return.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Toiv nor Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman were able Tuesday to
say how much the park foundation had received.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Rodriguez, a charity and tax specialist at Rodriguez,
Horii &AMP; Choi, a Los Angeles law firm, said ``the Clinton's prior
tax planning for `It Takes A Village' is an example of how anyone
can get tripped up in the tax code's complexity. A gift of the
copyright is the smart way to go because it maximizes the gift to
charity.''
</P>
<P>
   But several other tax experts said Tuesday that some people
knowingly pay more than is required in income taxes. Some
individuals forgo tax avoidance strategies that they regard as
legal, but unsavory, or they regard the government as equal or
superior to charities, said Bernard Wolfman, a Harvard University
law professor and expert on the ethics of tax professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people seek to minimize taxes,'' Wolfman said, ``but
others feel that the government does good things. And a lot of
people give to charity without regard to tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tax experts said that in giving away the copyright Mrs.
Clinton would lose control of the book and the receiving charity
might later sell the copyright or publish future editions in ways
that Mrs. Clinton would not want.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriquez said that Mrs. Clinton could have imposed restrictions
on the copyright gift, such as blocking its resale by a charity or
limiting publication and distribution of her books. ``That would
only reduce the value of the deduction the Clintons could take for
the gift, but since they took no deduction for the second book it
would have no effect.''

 Margy Rochlin's most recent article for the Arts and Leisure
section was about Rachel Griffiths.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Right up there on Sean Hayes' list of Worst Jobs
Ever was the time he was paid to entertain guests at a lavish Bel
Air party by performing the Charleston. ``It was so embarrassing,''
said Hayes, who doesn't blame Jack Nicholson, Don Rickles or the
other assembled celebrities for blithely ignoring him and his
partner when they simply merged into the crowd, hunched over and
began frantically waggling their knees. ``Everybody was standing
there, chatting, not watching. Then every so often, someone would
turn their head and give us this look like, `What are you doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the nature of show business is that the craziness
that leads in one instance to humiliation can be the guiding
principle behind a successful character on a sitcom. As proof,
witness Hayes' Jack McFarland on NBC's hit series ``Will and
Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   In his rendering of the wisecracking, unconditionally
self-involved gay sidekick to Eric McCormack's stolid gay lawyer,
Will Truman, Hayes doesn't just act the part; he stages a one-man
floor show. Often, he half-sings his dialogue or amplifies the zing
of a punch line by, say, striking a gaudy pose.
</P>
<P>
   In one bit, in which the ever-responsible Will helps Jack
unravel his tax problems, Hayes dressed up an uncomplicated line
(``Can we talk about something else?'') by flipping into a
headstand on a chair and bicycling his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, when ``Will and Grace'' had its premiere, television
pundits took up column space debating whether America was ready for
a show about the sometimes touching and always complicated intimacy
between best-friend roommates, one of whom is openly homosexual
(Will) and the other, a love-hungry heterosexual career gal (Debra
Messing's Grace). But viewers pronounced the discussion moot by
declaring their love for Hayes' Jack.
</P>
<P>
   After three episodes, the NBC promotions department decided to
use Hayes' breakout status to hype the show by broadcasting a
30-second Jack spot, complete with a fever-pitch montage of Jack
footage and a goofy Jack theme song.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was floored,'' reported Hayes, 28, whose friendly, upturned
face may be familiar because he has spent the last seven years
appearing in television commercials, for everything from Doritos to
Bud Light.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was thrilled with Jack. Gay rights groups saw
his flamboyant character as perpetuation of a gay stereotype.
That's a sensitive subject with the show's executive producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to comment on that,'' said Max Mutchnick (``I'm
the gay one''). ```Jack's too gay' and `Will's not gay enough.' To
what standard? Who is measuring that?'' David Kohan adds: ``All I
can say is that our goal is to write these characters as honestly
as we possibly can. We know people in real life that are very much
like Will and Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jack is based on a real person, an old friend. ``An
East Coast preppie with a real sense of entitlement and an odd view
of the world'' who has mixed feelings about the honor, says
Mutchnick. ``It depends on how he's medicated at the time,'' said
Kohan, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine what the real Jack, a Los Angeles interior
decorator, might make of his alter ego's dressing room on the
Studio City back lot. ``I know, it's boring,'' said Hayes, seated
on a beige couch in a bare-walled cubicle whose only flash of color
was a dying dieffenbachia in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Will and Grace,'' Hayes' television experience had
amounted to guest appearances on purgatory-hour episodics like
USA's ``Silk Stalkings'' and failed tryouts during the 1997 pilot
season, when he was passed over for ``Veronica's Closet'' and
``Dilbert'' (an animated series).
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read for it, it was a live-action show,'' said Hayes of
the latter. ``I guess I was so bad they decided to make it into a
cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was his star turn as a heartsick gay photographer in a
cloying independent film called ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss''
that caught the eye of an NBC casting executive, who found Hayes at
the Sundance Film Festival and faxed him the entire ``Will and
Grace'' pilot script. The gesture forced Hayes to invest some good
faith money in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel guy went, `Here's your fax,''' said Hayes. ``And
then, `That'll be 40 bucks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not much later, Mutchnick and Kohan found themselves in a
meeting with a lanky, blue-eyed actor who had the wraparound smile
and comic timing to pull off a character that on paper might not
always be likable.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hayes lives by himself in a two-story apartment in
Hancock Park, he spent his early years amid a crowd. The youngest
of five children, he grew up in the Chicago suburbs, watching his
mother try to make ends meet on her paycheck as the director at a
nonprofit food bank. As for his father, he merely watched him come
and go.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left my family when I was 5, 7, 9 and 12,'' said Hayes.
``It was crazy. He was an alcoholic. My mom basically raised us
all. He never contributed a dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 8, NBC removed Christina Applegate's exceedingly
average series ``Jesse'' from its Thursday lineup and bequeathed
the golden 8:30 p.m. post-``Friends'' time slot to ``Will and
Grace.'' It's a move that is sure to boost the ratings and give
Hayes' mother even more to talk about with neighbors and
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so proud,'' said Hayes. ``I'm glad that she can say,
`That's my son!' And I'm glad she's finally got something to hold
over my dad's head.''

THE NEW YORK ARTIST IS NOW FROM EVERYWHERE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What defines a New York artist at the end of the 20th
century? The question surfaced with the announcement that the works
to be exhibited at the next Whitney Biennial, due to open in March
2000, would be chosen by a team of art professionals who neither
work at the museum nor live in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell L. Anderson, the museum's director, spoke of giving the
show a ``national perspective.'' Hugh Davies, director of the
Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, La Jolla, and one of the
biennial's outside organizers, said that the biennial had been a
``New York event'' since the 1970s, and that California's
representation had been ``limited.''
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of having New Yorkers select the show, it could
be interesting to reverse the gaze, as theorists might say, and see
what non-New Yorkers come up with. It remains to be seen just how
different the biennial they choose will be from its predecessors _
very, somewhat or not much at all.
</P>
<P>
   But it was surprising to have the us-them, New York-America
split invoked, as if we were back in the 60s, when New York, or
more precisely Manhattan, tended to be indifferent to and ignorant
of nearly everything beyond its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Life was simpler then. A New York artist was someone who lived
in New York, made New York art and took up a lot of room in New
York shows like the Whitney Biennial, which irked non-New York
artists. In all likelihood, the New York artist was a living white
male.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, New York has become more open to non-New
York artists with every passing season, especially after the sudden
shock _ as in ``we are not alone'' _ of the German and Italian
painters, whose work arrived in New York in full force in the early
1980s. For a sense of this shock, consider Sigmar Polke's ``Spider
Man,'' a large work on paper from 1971-74 and one of the standouts
in the bracing survey of the artist's early drawings currently at
the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived on these shores in 1982, eight years after its
completion, for Polke's first New York show, at the Holly Solomon
Gallery in SoHo _ sudden proof that New York's idea of the art of
the 1970s was up for revision.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the notion of a New York art or the New York artist
has grown fuzzy around the edges. But maybe it was never really all
that clear-cut anyway. Even in the 60s and 70s, there were artists
who were prominent in New York but didn't live here.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Nauman, for example, has qualified as a New York artist in
terms of stature and ubiquity since the early 70s. So has Ed
Ruscha. But both artists began their careers in Los Angeles, and
Nauman has lived in New Mexico since 1979, although no one calls
him a New Mexican artist.
</P>
<P>
   Younger California artists who, like Nauman, are becoming
honorary New Yorkers because their work is so visible here include
Paul McCarthy, Charles Ray and Mike Kelley. Among newly emerged
artists, Kara Walker lives in Providence, R.I., and Ellen Gallagher
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, there are artists who leave New York without losing
their New York-artist status: the appropriation artist Barbara
Kruger has lived mostly in Los Angeles since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when jet planes and e-mail have made the world
smaller for everyone, we might almost talk about the dilution or
diaspora of the very concept of the New York artist. It's not so
much that the New Yorkers have left town; it's just that the term
itself is being scattered to the four winds, divvied up,
appropriated and reshaped by artists from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of nomadism may have a certain theoretical cachet these
days, but it also has a strong reality, no less so in the art world
than everywhere else. Contemporary art is now made by people from
all kinds of backgrounds and locales, and they are giving it a
diversity unimaginable in the 1970s, when the term pluralism first
came into use.
</P>
<P>
   New York is becoming less and less important as a place for
artists to live and work, and more and more a central ``clearing
house'' for a global contemporary-art scene. Showing in New York
remains a primary way that artists from around the world establish
themselves. (Another method is getting picked for a string of the
big international biennials.)
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, a geographically diverse roster of artists
seems almost de rigeur among New York galleries. They now routinely
represent artists from several states, if not countries and
continents: California, Rhode Island, Minnesota, but also China,
Korea, Brazil and Norway. And artists from all over are not only
showing in New York but spending quite a bit of time here too. They
visit, live here half time, or even settle here.
</P>
<P>
   On this score, the terse biographical data included in
exhibition catalogs make increasingly interesting reading. In the
1995 Whitney Biennial, Gabriel Orozco was listed as living in
Mexico City and New York; he listed only New York for the 1997
biennial. That show also included Ilya Kabakov, who claimed Moscow,
Paris and New York; the photographer Antonio Martorell, who
designated Puerto Rico and New York; and the American
choreographers William Forsythe and Amanda Miller, who both live in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In other recent exhibition catalogs, home to the Japanese
photo-artist Mariko Mori is Tokyo and New York; to the Italian
performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, it's Brooklyn and Milan. The
last word, for the moment, may be found in a recent catalog of the
work of Douglas Gordon, a film and video artist from Scotland. The
bio simply says ``Douglas Gordon lives and works in Glasgow, and .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Catalog biographies can reflect both the political turmoil of
recent decades and the increasingly complex cultural strands being
woven into the fabric of contemporary art. The artists (and
sisters) Rachael and Toba Khedoori, for example, whose parents are
Iraqi, were born and reared in Australia and now live in Los
Angeles. Rirkrit Tiravanija, who is Thai, was born in Buenos Aires,
reared in Thailand, Ethiopia, Malaysia and Canada, and now lives
mostly in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, New York remains a center partly because it has
a history of being one, but mostly by dint of sheer numbers. There
are more galleries, artists and full-time critics here than
anywhere in the world. But as the scene continues to expand, even
this concentration contributes to a kind of decentralization.
</P>
<P>
   The New York art world is splintering into so many different
groups, stylistic factions and neighborhoods that, outside of one's
immediate circle of friends and colleagues, it is becoming
impossible to keep track of who lives here and who's just passing
through. And what's more, it doesn't matter.

US SEEKS WAYS TO HELP ALBANIANS STILL INSIDE KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worries are mounting in the White House over how to
come up with a viable plan to reach hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians trapped inside Kosovo as fresh waves of refugees report
that many are battling hunger, cold, sickness, and death.
</P>
<P>
   How many thousands is anyone's guess. Since the air strikes
began and Yugoslav President Solobodan Milosevic expelled foreign
observers and journalists from the province, no one -- not the
Pentagon, NATO, or the United Nations -- has been able to get a
grip on the number of ``internally displaced'' Albanian Kosovars or
the depth of their plight. Nor have they settled on a strategy to
respond to this invisible crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real answer to that question is that . . . it is a very
hard one, and we are working on it,'' President Clinton said after
a meeting on Kosovo with members of Congress. ``It is a huge
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become more pressing since Serb forces sealed
the Kosovo border crossings last week and drove an estimated
100,000 refugees back into the country. According to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as many as 700,000 ethnic
Albanians have been routed from their homes but are still in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At a NATO briefing Tuesday, Gen. Wesley Clark, the Supreme
Allied Commander, said airlifting food posed a risk to NATO planes,
which continue to take Serbian missile and anti-aircraft fire. ``A
slow-moving transport plane would be vulnerable to such fire,''
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said there was no guarantee humanitarian supplies
delivered through an air drop would benefit those in need -- or be
seized by Serbian military forces and police.
</P>
<P>
   There are is another concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a secure drop zone, a big enough area controlled by
the people you want to benefit, you can't ensure that the hungry
people rushing to retrieve the stuff you drop out of plane don't
get shot,'' explained a State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the administration is also considering a
number of additional options, none of which he considered
promising.
</P>
<P>
   Among the options:
</P>
<P>
   _ Air drops by non-NATO, neutral countries such as Switzerland
or Sweden. The idea has only lukewarm support because the Serbs
have ignored Sweden's neutral position in the past and because it
would still not address the question of who on the ground would
receive supplies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funneling relief supplies to Kosovar Albanians through
Montenegro, which does not have a hard border with Kosovo since
both are Yugoslavian provinces.
</P>
<P>
   _ Convincing the Bulgarians, Russians, or Greeks to ferry in
supplies on behalf of the international community.
</P>
<P>
   ``All are pretty thin reeds, but we are exploring them to see
what we can build out of them,'' the official said. ``We speculate
and guess that things are horrible on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department official also said the options were
stop-gap measures and that support was growing for sending in
ground troops to secure the province so that international relief
groups can move in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other way to address this situation in any
systematic way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, policymakers and members of the international relief
community are expected to point to the plight of displaced Kosovars
to bolster the case for the immediate introduction of NATO ground
troops at hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massacres are only one method of ethnic cleansing available to
the Serbs,'' said Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst at the US
Committee for Refugees, a private advocacy group that publishes the
annual World Refugee Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starving people out was a tactic used in Bosnia, where the
Serbs surrounded people, shelled them, prevented food from getting
in, cut them off, and left them to die from starvation or
disease,'' Frelick said, ``and they are doing it again.''

DESPITE CHANGES, MASTERS STILL PARTIAL TO POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fear not, golf traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   Course changes to Augusta National Golf Club might have tempered
some players' decisions when faced with the risk-reward dilemmas
that make up the fabric of the Masters Tournament. But the
off-season tweaking did not turn the course into a safe haven for
par-shooting Robogolfers, as some had feared.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta remains a dream layout for those who prefer dice-roll
golf, not a potential U.S. Open venue with buzzcut rough. But
players must now be more judicious about when they roll those dice,
rather than automatically stepping up to the table at every par 5.
</P>
<P>
   That is the lesson we learned at the 63rd Masters. And that
stands as a change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Without the rough that reappeared in 1999, long hitters could
routinely spray drives on Augusta's watery, back-nine par 5s _ the
central holes in most final-round dramas _ yet remain confident of
reaching the green in two shots with a 7-iron. That is no longer
the case.
</P>
<P>
   A missed fairway now means indecision in club selection and a
possible flier out of the rough that could lead to disaster. The
risk factor is enhanced, making the rewards more meaningful for
those willing to roll the dice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's being aggressive, and there's playing stupid,'' said
Davis Love III, who finished as the Masters runner-up to Jose Maria
Olazabal. ``If you're in the rough at No. 13 or No. 15, there's no
reason to go for the green unless you have a perfect lie, because
you can't stop the ball. Just getting over the water on those holes
is not an issue any more. There's no point in making double bogey
just to prove you're man enough to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hit a good drive, however, and the reward is there for a
potential eagle. And the type of shot that separates the Masters
from other major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, short-and-straight types like Lee Janzen, a two-time Open
champ, surfaced early in the week. But the top names on Sunday's
leader board routinely attack Augusta with aggression and pizzazz:
Olazabal, Love, Greg Norman. So do fellow top-10 finishers David
Duval, Phil Mickelson, Lee Westwood and Nick Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still need a power game to win here,'' Duval said. ``But
the second cut of rough makes you think more about when and how you
use it. It was the biggest of all the course changes, from my
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, one of the PGA Tour's longest hitters, said the
rough made it impossible for him to bag birdies from the same
locations where he sprayed drives while setting a tournament
scoring record (18 under) in 1997. But given a good driving week,
Woods said his mark could be broken in a future Masters with
Augusta set up exactly as it was for the 1999 event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Woods said. ``The changes won't make that much
difference to the power hitters if they keep it in the fairway and
hole some putts. I just didn't make anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Woods hit more greens in regulation (50 of 72) than
anyone in the Masters field. But he was next-to-last among cut
survivors with 126 putts, 17 more than Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   And the Masters remains a putting contest, even for the big
hitters. That will never change, no matter how much they tweak the
rest of the course.
SPOTLIGHT ON ...Hale Irwin IRWIN CAN BREAK SLUMP, TIE HAGEN THIS
WEEKEND
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens at this week's PGA Seniors
Championship, Hale Irwin will make history.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins for a fourth consecutive time in Palm Beach Gardens,
Fla., Irwin will join Walter Hagen as the only player on any tour
to capture one major four consecutive times. If he fails to defend
his title, Irwin will reach the final weekend in April without a
Senior Tour triumph for the first time since he became eligible to
play a full schedule in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Irwin would prefer historic scenario No. 1. And he
couldn't be headed to a venue more conducive to breaking his
0-for-1999 slump at Senior Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 career rounds at PGA National Golf Club, Irwin's scoring
average is a sizzling 69.08 at the 6,722-yard, par-72 layout. He
won by 12 strokes in 1997, the largest landslide in tour history at
a 72-hole event. He bested Larry Nelson by seven shots last season,
matching his average margin of victory at this event.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin is not counting on a cakewalk in his quest to join
Hagen, the PGA champion from 1924 through '27.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question I like the course. It's been good to me,
and that gives me a boost of confidence,'' said Irwin, who set
Senior Tour earnings records in 1997 ($2,343,364) and 1998
($2,861,945). ``But the odds are still stacked against me. A lot of
things have to break your way to win a major championship, much
less four in a row.''
CHIP SHOTS COLONIAL FIELD UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard Colonial officals have issued sponsor's exemptions to
seven players for the May 20-23 event: Esteban Toledo, Duffy
Waldorf, Brian Watts, Frank Nobilo, David Ogrin, Mike Hulbert and
Dave Stockton Jr. Inclusion of those players brings the total
number of commitments to 87, including two of the top three players
in the world rankings: No. 1 David Duval and No. 3 Davis Love III.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials have five exemptions yet to bestow for the
1999 event, as well as two champion's choice spots selected by a
vote of past winners.
ELS SKIPPING AREA STOPS
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, winner of the 1995 GTE Byron Nelson Classic, has
informed tournament officials that he will skip this year's event
(May 13-16) to prepare for the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open in
Heidelberg, Germany. The German event is scheduled May 21-24,
overlapping Colonial week.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Nelson officials said Els is the only competitor
committed to play in Germany who has told them he would miss their
event for travel reasons. Other high-profile PGA Tour players on
the commitment list in Germany include Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara
and Nick Price.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson officials said they expect Woods, the 1997 Nelson winner,
to compete at the Four Seasons TPC Las Colinas because he has
inquired about hotel arrangements for that week. But he has not
made an official commitment.
Brooks' scouting report
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brooks will be attempting to survive the cut at the MCI
Classic Hilton Head Island, S.C., when the first paying customers
tee off Friday at the Brooks-designed Southern Oaks Golf Club in
south Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The course marks the first 18-hole project that Brooks has
overseen from blueprint to completion. For those seeking an early
scouting report, Brooks said to expect a traditional layout with
none of the oversized waste areas or island greens made popular in
recent years by Pete Dye and others. Also, don't look for a
signature hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in them,'' Brooks said. ``I hope 18 different
guys play the course and come away with 18 different ideas about
which hole is best.''
</P>
<P>
   From the front tees, which can play as short as 5,600 yards,
players are required to hit only one drive over water. The back
tees, which measure 7,300 yards, will present a much greater
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we did a really good job with routing the holes, and
with the bunkering. We tried not to make all the bunkers the
same,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the clubhouse remains under construction, Brooks is
low-key about Friday's opening but plans to be on hand for a
grand-opening gala this summer.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS Repeat after me
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Town Golf Links, site of this week's MCI Classic, has
crowned a multiple winner of the event 17 times in its first 30
tournaments. Topping the list is defending champ Davis Love III, a
four-time winner. A breakdown: Golfer Titles Years Davis Love III 4

GALVESTON PREPARES FOR `BEACH PARTY WEEKEND' 

</HEADLINE>
 PARTY-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ More than 100,000 people may swarm the
beachfront here this weekend to participate in what has become one
of the biggest _ and most costly _ events on this island resort
city's annual calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The city will spend more than $200,000 to pay overtime to its
own police officers and hire several hundred other area officers to
control traffic and prevent the gridlock that has occurred in some
previous years. Tens of thousands of cars are expected to invade
the island during the three-day event, which begins Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a lot of people at the beach party and
it's going to be very expensive,'' said Police Chief Kim
Schoolcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly called ``Kappa Weekend'' because it was associated with
a national black college fraternity, this weekend's happening now
is dubbed simply ``Beach Party Weekend.'' The event began about 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It will radically alter traffic patterns on the island, and
visitors to Galveston need to pay attention to signs and police as
they enter the city on Interstate 45, Schoolcraft said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the vast majority of those who attend the event are
day-trippers from the Houston area, many others stay the weekend,
filling hotels and packing restaurants and gift shops. In years
past, crowds have overwhelmed some businesses and restaurants and
many local people have complained of rowdy behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Because most people attending the event have tended to cruise
the beach in their cars, police last year began channeling the
Beach Party Weekend traffic into a huge one-way route running east
on Broadway then back west along Seawall Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints were fewer last year than in 1997 because traffic
kept moving.
</P>
<P>
   Police are reminding people that it is illegal to consume
alcohol or have glass containers on Seawall Boulevard, and that
they will cite violators. The fine and court costs add up to
$246.25 for alcohol consumption and $106.26 for carrying glass
containers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's crowds, especially, could be huge and could include
people from states far away, the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the weather, we expect anywhere from 75,000 to
120,000 people,'' Schoolcraft said.
</P>
<P>
   She said doubts about whether Atlanta officials would allow a
similar gathering in their city this weekend caused students at
many predominantly black Southern colleges to make plans to head
for Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta event, called Freaknik, began on a small scale in
the early 1980s and peaked in 1994 with a raucous street party
attended by about 200,000 people. Although Freaknik is being held
again this weekend, Atlanta officials have taken steps to crack
down on rowdiness.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Freaknik attracted only about 50,000 young people.
</P>
<P>
   Another similar event is the Black College Reunion in Daytona
Beach, Fla., which was held last weekend. Police said more than
100,000 people attended but things went smoothly until a rash of
violence Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two shootings occurred _ one of them fatal _ and there were at
least two stabbings, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Galveston, officials are hoping their preparations will lead
to another weekend as relatively problem-free as last year's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready for a big crowd,'' Schoolcraft said. ``We
pray for peace.''

CAT IN A HAT A STAMP, HOW'S THAT! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds date of death; Theodor is cq; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass. native who made a story-time staple of
rhyming whimsy about green eggs and ham and cats with hats has won
a piece of popular iconography.
</P>
<P>
   The US Postal Service, encouraged by strong ballot-box support
in western Massachusetts, will unveil a stamp next month honoring
Dr. Seuss's most famous creation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the famous children's author might have put it: That
fuzzy cat in the tall striped hat will soon feel frequently damp;
his little fans from his creator's land have helped turn him into a
stamp!
</P>
<P>
   The new Cat in the Hat stamp will be issued at a gala planned
for May 26 at the Springfield Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a celebration of children's literacy, and a
recognition of how reading books is so important,'' said Joseph
Carvalho, president and executive director of Springfield Library
and Museum, who helped promote the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a writer who touched generations of Americans and who
continue to touch them in a very special and unique way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the sober domain of president, philosophers and
philanthropists, stamps are now as likely to celebrate popular
culture. Elvis _ forever young and slim _ has one. So does Marilyn
Monroe, Popeye and Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, so will Theodor Seuss Geisel, who created such
classics as ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' and ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' over a 54-year career. The 1984 Pulitzer Prize winner
for children's literature, who died in 1991, drew on his
Springfield boyhood for his first book, ``And to Think That I Saw
It on Mulberry Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seuss stamp is one of 15 stamps selected by nationwide vote
last year to commemorate the 1950s. A Postal Service advisory panel
selected subjects for the first five decades of the century and the
public has now voted on subjects for the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another son of Massachusetts, heavyweight champion Rocky
Marciano of Brockton, is also among the 1950s stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Other stamps to be issued depict images of video games, the fall
of the Berlin Wall, personal computers, hip-hop cultures, Sesame
Street, disco music, the Beatles, Woodstock, and baseball great
Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Cat in the Hat stamp will not be made public
until its unveiling next month.

 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
delivered the first comprehensive assessment of the campaign
against Yugoslavia on Tuesday, saying allied planes and missiles
had caused at least some damage to every broad sector of the
Serbian military complex but had not destroyed any of them.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long presentation, Clark used an array of statistics
and a blizzard of maps, photos and videotapes to make his case that
the alliance had the firepower to grind down Yugoslavia's military
and was proceeding methodically toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that the Serbian military has endured only a small
dose of NATO's striking power, Clark confirmed Tuesday that he will
seek still more allied warplanes, including another 300 American
planes, pushing the NATO air armada to well over 1,000 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   After almost 1,700 bombing runs, Clark said that NATO had caused
damage to every broad strategic area, such as air defense, command
centers, oil production, military units in the field and military
transport. None were considered to be destroyed, he said, although
NATO does claim to have destroyed many individual targets within
those areas. Clark declined to say what percentage of NATO's
targets were now considered somewhat damaged, severely damaged or
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clark stopped short of declaring that the alliance would
win a victory from the air. He said only that Yugoslav's military
was potentially ``vulnerable to collapse'' if enough military
pressure was applied, but tried to sidestep any political question.
Asked at one point if NATO's political leaders had been too slow to
act against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic earlier this
year, Clark demurred. ``You're asking judgments about political
leadership, which it's not appropriate for me to give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of air attacks, he acknowledged, Milosevic
still seems determined to try to ride out the allied air campaign
and there is no sign that Serb forces are withdrawing from Kosovo.
``As we have said from the outset, this is likely to be as long and
difficult as President Milosevic makes it,'' Clark said. ``And
we're approaching it very systematically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark spoke at NATO's headquarters here as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov
met in Oslo, but failed to resolve their differences over NATO's
insistence that any peace in Kosovo be policed by an allied
military force. And in Washington, President Clinton and
congressional leaders from both parties tried to avert any attempt
by Congress to vote on the eventual use of ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the military commander of a 19-member alliance, Clark, who
has had about as much personal contact with Milosevic and his top
generals as any NATO diplomat, confronts a complex political, as
well as military, equation. His aim is to send the Serbs a message
that the NATO has the firepower to break their will while trying to
reassure Western political leaders and voters that the alliance
would use only the minimum amount of force needed.
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been easy. Since NATO's attacks began three
weeks ago, its bombing attacks have been hobbled by bad weather, a
limited number of aircraft and political constraints. Critics have
complained that the alliance was withholding key details in an
effort to mask disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   A four-star Army general, Clark, 54, is not an obvious choice
for Pentagon to send before the world's television cameras to sing
the praises of air power. On Tuesday, however, he did so in a
measured and qualified way. His methodical, technocratic style
contrasted with the blustery manner of some of his predecessors,
like Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to solidify Western support, Clark began by documenting
the steady Serbian military build-up in Kosovo in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   His presentation was intended to show that Milosevic had
repeatedly violated his promises to withdraw from Kosovo. But it
also inadvertently raised questions about the adequacy of the
alliance's military planning, which initially relied on limited air
attacks to punish the Serbian forces for their assaults on the
Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in a remarkable personal aside, Clark recalled in
some detail an October meeting he had in Belgrade with a leading
Serbian general, who insisted that the Yugoslav military could have
finished off the Kosovo Liberation Army, Albanian separatist
rebels, in two more weeks if it had been permitted to continue its
sweep of Albanian villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said to him, `Yes, and you created about 400,000
homeless people in this process in a campaign that's totally
disproportionate to any reasonable definition of a threat. It's a
political problem and you've tried to solve it by force,' '' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and the general had a ``long dialectical discussion''
and added: ``That's when I realized that there was still this very
strong proclivity to believe that this problem was a problem which
was appropriate to be solved by military force and the target would
be the population, since they couldn't get at the KLA directly.''

 BRUSSELS, Belgium:  ...  the KLA directly.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dealing with another politically sensitive issue, Clark said
there was little NATO &UR;  &LR; could do to ease the plight of the hundreds
of thousands of Albanians that have been driven from their homes by
Serb forces and are now homeless within Kosovo with very little
food.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NATO ambassadors asked Clark to look into ways to
provide food and medicine to the civilians there. But Tuesday, the
NATO commander said it would take 60 to 100 flights of slow-moving
transport planes each day to drop relief supplies and that the
aircraft might be shot down by Serb's air defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view on this is that, frankly, this is a problem that's
caused by President Milosevic,'' Clark said. ``He needs to address
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering new data on the military campaign, Clark noted that the
alliance had flown 5,924 missions, but that only 1,687 of these
were bombing missions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the distances involved, a larger percentage of the
alliance's missions consist of flights by refueling planes than in
previous air campaigns. And since Belgrade demonstrated its
potential to lash out by dispatching two Russian-made MIG warplanes
over Bosnia last month, the alliance is also maintaining constant
air patrols around Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clark insisted, however, that NATO's bombing strikes were
effective since the vast majority of strikes are being carried out
with laser-guided bombs and other precision-guided munitions.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the campaign, Clark acknowledged, the bombing
attacks have been handicapped by poor weather. Over three weeks, he
said, NATO forces had enjoyed good weather on only seven days. On
10 days, he said, more than 50 percent of the bombing missions were
canceled because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clark sought to turn these statistic into a public relations
advantage, noting that the allies' striking power could grow
substantially as skies clear over the Balkans over the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the bomb damage assessment, Clark said the alliance
was in a race, trying to damage Serb supplies and equipment faster
than the Yugoslav military could replace or repair it.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for example, has destroyed 70 percent of Yugoslavia's
storage capability for fuel, Clark said. Belgrade, however, is
continuing to receive fuel from oil foreign oil tankers. NATO is
hoping friendly nations will order those shipments stopped.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bombing, however, Clark conceded that there is no
evidence that the Serb military is withdrawing from Kosovo. At
40,000 troops, the Serbs force have even increased slightly since
the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen no evidence of any pull-back of Serb military or
police forces,'' he said. ``They are moving into defensive
positions in some areas. In other cases, they are continuing with
the pattern of ethnic cleansing and village destruction. And in a
third set of instances, they are regrouping, refitting,
reconstituting and preparing for future operations.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Milosevic, Clark said the goal was to pressure him to
accept the allied requirements for a Kosovo accord by striking the
security forces and military command and control he relies on to
maintain his hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   But the label on one slide in Clark's presentation suggested
that Milosevic would not be easy to intimidate. It read,
``Milosevic's Willingness To Accept Damage Is High.''

CAT IN A HAT A STAMP, HOW'S THAT! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds date of death; Theodor is cq; a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Springfield, Mass. native who made a story-time staple of
rhyming whimsy about green eggs and ham and cats with hats has won
a piece of popular iconography.
</P>
<P>
   The US Postal Service, encouraged by strong ballot-box support
in western Massachusetts, will unveil a stamp next month honoring
Dr. Seuss's most famous creation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the famous children's author might have put it: That
fuzzy cat in the tall striped hat will soon feel frequently damp;
his little fans from his creator's land have helped turn him into a
stamp!
</P>
<P>
   The new Cat in the Hat stamp will be issued at a gala planned
for May 26 at the Springfield Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a celebration of children's literacy, and a
recognition of how reading books is so important,'' said Joseph
Carvalho, president and executive director of Springfield Library
and Museum, who helped promote the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a writer who touched generations of Americans and who
continue to touch them in a very special and unique way.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the sober domain of president, philosophers and
philanthropists, stamps are now as likely to celebrate popular
culture. Elvis _ forever young and slim _ has one. So does Marilyn
Monroe, Popeye and Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, so will Theodor Seuss Geisel, who created such
classics as ``Green Eggs and Ham,'' and ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas'' over a 54-year career. The 1984 Pulitzer Prize winner
for children's literature, who died in 1991, drew on his
Springfield boyhood for his first book, ``And to Think That I Saw
It on Mulberry Street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seuss stamp is one of 15 stamps selected by nationwide vote
last year to commemorate the 1950s. A Postal Service advisory panel
selected subjects for the first five decades of the century and the
public has now voted on subjects for the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another son of Massachusetts, heavyweight champion Rocky
Marciano of Brockton, is also among the 1950s stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Other stamps to be issued depict images of video games, the fall
of the Berlin Wall, personal computers, hip-hop cultures, Sesame
Street, disco music, the Beatles, Woodstock, and baseball great
Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Cat in the Hat stamp will not be made public
until its unveiling next month.

NUMBERS INDICATE KOSOVO ACTION HAS A LONG WAY TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's one sign that the air war in Yugoslavia
could go on for quite a while: After 21 days, officials revealed
Tuesday, NATO attack planes have flown 1,687 sorties.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot _ but it amounts to fewer than 1/10th the number
flown in the 43 days of Operation Desert Storm, the 1991 air war
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The two wars are different in many ways, but the numbers suggest
what many officials and analysts say President Clinton needs to
make clearer _ that the battle over Kosovo has just begun and is,
by no means, an in-and-out thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and one of 50
legislators who met with Clinton Tuesday, said later in the day
that US forces might have to be involved, in one way or another,
not just for ``a matter of weeks'' but rather for ``months or even
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he believes NATO will eventually force Serbian leader
Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw from Kosovo and let the ethnic
Albanian refugees return to their homes. But others are less
certain, especially if NATO refuses to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 additional US warplanes that NATO requested Monday
_which, along with extra planes from other allied air forces, will
bring the total in the area to nearly 1,000 _ are designed
precisely to make the operation go faster.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said in Brussels Tuesday
that allied pilots have had only seven days of good flying weather
since the campaign began. On 10 days, cloud coverage was so dense
that more than half the sorties had to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more planes they'll be able to hit more things in a given
24 hours,'' said John Pike, a weapons specialist at the Federation
of American Scientists, a private group. ``They can take greater
advantage of breaks in the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of this air war seems to be following the principle
that Gen. Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
laid out in Desert Storm _ isolate the enemy soldiers in the field,
then destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Tuesday listed the targets struck to date: supply routes,
bridges, fuel refineries, command centers, radio relays, and,
increasingly, the troops themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the ``new phase'' in the
bombing campaign, to begin when the extra planes arrive, will
amount to ``a more intense version of the current phase.''
</P>
<P>
   However, several analysts note, it's one thing to bomb targets,
another to destroy a fighting force, and another thing still to
accomplish the main goal, which, as Clark put it, is ``to cause
Milosevic to change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombing campaigns through history have aimed at the same kinds
of targets that NATO is aiming at now. Some have done so
successfully. But few, if any, have by themselves changed an
opponent's mind.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Vietnam War, the US Air Force mounted an
earth-shaking air campaign, called Rolling Thunder, to disrupt the
flow of supplies from North Vietnam to the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolling Thunder did reduce the flow from the North by over 90
percent,'' said Robert Pape, professor of national security studies
at Dartmouth College. ``The problem was we couldn't get that last
10 percent _ and they were able to keep going on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins
University's School for Advanced International Studies and the
director of the US Air Force's official, five-volume history of the
Gulf air war, made a similar point.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing supply lines and petroleum refineries, Cohen said,
``works only when you make the other guy consume fuel and
ammunition.'' And the only way to get him to do that is to force
him to move his tanks and fire his bullets _ in other words, to
engage him with troops on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's minimal impact in attacking logistics lines and
petroleum refineries if they're just sitting there, dug in,'' he
said. ``My guess is, they've also thought ahead of time about
hiding supplies, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As for disrupting Milosevic's ability to control and communicate
with his troops, it may be worth noting that in the Gulf War, 580
air strikes were mounted on Saddam Hussein's command-control
facilities _ 260 against Iraq's leaders and their workplaces. Yet,
the Air Force later concluded that ``despite the lethality and
precision of the attacks,'' Hussein's ability to command his forces
``had not collapsed. ... The system turned out to be more redundant
and more able to reconstitute itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, other analysts, including some who have been
skeptical of past US military ventures, are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   William Arkin, a former US Army intelligence officer, said:
``There comes a point in a bombing campaign when the enemy starts
to unravel.'' In Kosovo, he said, this point will not take very
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav army is a force dependent on its garrisons. As
you destroy their garrisons and their logistics, that army
atrophies,'' Arkin said. ``If NATO ground forces are needed to go
in there, it will be to mop up a badly defeated Yugoslav army.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike agreed. He foresees the war ending in six weeks or so, with
an international security force leading refugees back into Kosovo.
``The question becomes, how much gunfire accompanies the security
forces?'' he said. ``My own view is, given another several weeks of
bombing, the Serbian forces will be in the same shape as the Iraqi
forces were when we started the ground war over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Pape are less hopeful. In the Gulf War, Iraq's tanks
sat defenseless on the Kuwaiti desert's flat terrain _ while the
Serbs' are dispersed in villages or hiding in forests, much harder
to hit or even see.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Gulf War, the allied bombing destroyed just 20
percent of Iraq's tanks, artillery, and armored personnel carriers.
``It's not impossible to get them,'' Pape said, ``but it's very
difficult, and it will take a long time.''

SABERHAGEN LEADS RED SOX TO 6-0 DRUBBING OF CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- If the Olde Towne wants to celebrate the fast start of
the Red Sox, who shut out the Chicago White Sox, 6-0, in Tuesday's
home opener to run their record to 6-1, Bret Saberhagen says party
on. Just don't expect the team to join in yet.
</P>
<P>
   Let there be songs in praise of Saberhagen, who ignored
48-degree temperatures and gusts of 35 miles an hour to deliver
another turn-back-the-clock performance with a suddenly pain-free
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpet flourishes for newcomer Jose Offerman, who gave the Sox
their first lead in Fenway Park by tripling to the triangle in his
second at-bat in home whites, driving in two runs and scoring a
third on Darren Lewis's single in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   A snappy guitar riff for Derek Lowe, who tightroped his way out
of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   A clash of cymbals for Troy O'Leary, whose three-run home run
into the White Sox bullpen sealed the outcome in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Even a good-natured waaaahh-waaaahh for John Valentin, who
passed Lewis on the basepaths to kill a first-inning uprising, one
of those daffy did-that-really-just-happen? moments you expect in a
T-ball game, not on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   But Saberhagen, for one, was happy that in the winners'
clubhouse Tuesday afternoon, there was no music blaring. Only
cartoons on the big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   Strike up the band in October, not for an April win against the
youngest team in the American League, one that the day before being
blanked by the Red Sox lost an exhibition to its Triple A team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just go out and play ball,'' said Saberhagen, who gave the
White Sox just six singles in 6 2/3 innings and departed to a
standing ovation from a sellout crowd of 31,874 that broke through
the day's chill and left him feeling warm and fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be really tough for somebody who didn't watch the
game to come into our clubhouse after a game and tell if we won or
lost. It's good we don't have music in the clubhouse. With music
playing, everybody gets too excited when you win. Then when you
lose and don't have the music on, there's too much emphasis on one
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here, one week into a season that represents the
team's best start in 44 years, was plain for everyone to see,
assuming they could see through the holes in their ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm happy and pleased that we're 6-1,'' said old hand
Valentin, ``but you've got to put it in perspective. We've played
good ball, and we've gotten good pitching. That's the reason we're
6-1.''
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth time in seven games, Sox pitchers limited the
opposition to three runs or fewer. All of the starters save Pat
Rapp have gone at least six innings, the measure of a quality
start, and staff ace Pedro Martinez and Saberhagen already have two
wins apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who threw six shutout innings in 76-degree
temperatures in Kansas City last Wednesday, had some trouble
weathering the first two innings. He loaded the bases in the first,
walking two batters, including Magglio Ordonez on four pitches,
before striking out Paul Konerko on the next three.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, he gave up one-out singles to Brook Fordyce and
McKay Christensen, before catching two more hitters, Ray Durham and
Mike Caruso, looking at third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scatter-brained, my mechanics were so off, I didn't
know where the ball was going,'' Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, he was locked in, allowing just three more hits,
two of them bloopers, before being replaced by Lowe with two out in
the seventh after Caruso's floater to center dropped in for a
single.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, already grumbling because manager Jimy Williams
lifted Saberhagen with a 3-0 lead after a yield of 102 pitches,
threatened to turn mutinous when White Sox strongman Frank Thomas
dropped a ground-rule double just inside the right-field foul line
and Lowe walked Jeff Liefer on four pitches to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The murmurs turned louder and darker when Lowe, who had
surrendered home runs in each of his previous two outings, went to
a 3-and-0 count on the next hitter, Ordonez. A mock cheer greeted
Lowe when he finally threw a strike, but to the relief of both the
pitcher and his critics, Ordonez rapped a one-hopper back to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not believe how happy I was when the guy hit the
ground ball back to me,'' Lowe said. ``After those seven straight
(balls) and those boos, I was looking for something positive to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After a winter in which the mere mention of his name caused
negative vibes, Offerman continued his rousing rebuttal. He
launched his third triple in seven games (and 15th hit overall)
after White Sox starter Jim Parque did the unpardonable, walking
the bottom feeders in the Sox order, Jason Varitek and Donnie
Sadler, with two out and nobody on.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, greeted with warm applause during pregame
introductions, received his first Fenway Park standing O after his
hit rattled around the 420-foot sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans like him,'' said general manager Dan Duquette, whose
own name had picked up some mud after he lavished a $26 million
contract on Offerman. ``He's an exciting player, a clutch player.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's hit not only gave the Sox the lead, it also allowed
Valentin to exhale after his base-running boner in the first
inning, when the Sox had the bases loaded with one out and came
away with nothing. Valentin, who had singled after Lewis's base
hit, was on second after Parque walked Mike Stanley on a full
count.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary whacked Parque's first pitch on a line to left. On a day
when the wind wasn't howling from left field, it might have been
off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis remained a couple steps off the third-base bag, preparing
to tag and score on what should have been a routine sacrifice fly.
Routine, that is, until Valentin took the turn like Jeff Gordon
hugging the curve at Talladega and chugged past a shocked Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience,'' Valentin said, mocking his own brain lock.
``When I saw it come off the bat, I said, `There's no way this is
catchable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Question: Did you know you had passed Lewis?
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Question: And what thought ran through your mind at that
instant?
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Have you ever passed a base-runner before, or even
passed on the turnpike?
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: Nope. I usually do the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Valentin, who walked ahead of Stanley, was in no
danger of getting a speeding ticket. All he had to do was jog when
O'Leary crushed an 0-and-2 pitch from lefthanded reliever Bryan
Ward over the new advertising signs on the visitors' bullpen.
Performance.com indeed.
</P>
<P>
   New Boston reliever Mark Guthrie, who lived in Scituate until he
was 11, worked a 1-2-3 ninth, and the Fenway organ sang out the
news of another Sox win. It'll be the White Sox here again
Thursday, with Martinez bidding for win No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good pitching staff,'' said Pedro's older brother,
Ramon, who made his first appearance in a Red Sox uniform Tuesday
during introductions, though he is still rehabilitating his
surgically repaired right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get 100 percent,'' he said, ``I can help this team a lot.
If they play the same way they've been playing, they have a chance
to win a lot, like they did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, the Sox hoping to get help from a pitcher with a blown
shoulder. Who comes up with these ideas?
</P>
<P>
   That's one question nobody thought to ask Saberhagen.

bring the total in the area to nearly 1,000 _ are designed
precisely to make the operation go faster.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said in Brussels Tuesday
that allied pilots have had only seven days of good flying weather
since the campaign began. On 10 days, cloud coverage was so dense
that more than half the sorties had to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more planes they'll be able to hit more things in a given
24 hours,'' said John Pike, a weapons specialist at the Federation
of American Scientists, a private group. ``They can take greater
advantage of breaks in the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of this air war seems to be following the principle
that Gen. Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
laid out in Desert Storm _ isolate the enemy soldiers in the field,
then destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Tuesday listed the targets struck to date: supply routes,
bridges, fuel refineries, command centers, radio relays, and,
increasingly, the troops themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the ``new phase'' in the
bombing campaign, to begin when the extra planes arrive, will
amount to ``a more intense version of the current phase.''
</P>
<P>
   However, several analysts note, it's one thing to bomb targets,
another to destroy a fighting force, and another thing still to
accomplish the main goal, which, as Clark put it, is ``to cause
Milosevic to change his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bombing campaigns through history have aimed at the same kinds
of targets that NATO is aiming at now. Some have done so
successfully. But few, if any, have by themselves changed an
opponent's mind.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Vietnam War, the US Air Force mounted an
earth-shaking air campaign, called Rolling Thunder, to disrupt the
flow of supplies from North Vietnam to the Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolling Thunder did reduce the flow from the North by over 90
percent,'' said Robert Pape, professor of national security studies
at Dartmouth College. ``The problem was we couldn't get that last
10 percent _ and they were able to keep going on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Cohen, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins
University's School for Advanced International Studies and the
director of the US Air Force's official, five-volume history of the
Gulf air war, made a similar point.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing supply lines and petroleum refineries, Cohen said,
``works only when you make the other guy consume fuel and
ammunition.'' And the only way to get him to do that is to force
him to move his tanks and fire his bullets _ in other words, to
engage him with troops on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's minimal impact in attacking logistics lines and
petroleum refineries if they're just sitting there, dug in,'' he
said. ``My guess is, they've also thought ahead of time about
hiding supplies, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As for disrupting Milosevic's ability to control and communicate
with his troops, it may be worth noting that in the Gulf War, 580
air strikes were mounted on Saddam Hussein's command-control
facilities _ 260 against Iraq's leaders and their workplaces. Yet,
the Air Force later concluded that ``despite the lethality and
precision of the attacks,'' Hussein's ability to command his forces
``had not collapsed. ... The system turned out to be more redundant
and more able to reconstitute itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, other analysts, including some who have been
skeptical of past US military ventures, are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   William Arkin, a former US Army intelligence officer, said:
``There comes a point in a bombing campaign when the enemy starts
to unravel.'' In Kosovo, he said, this point will not take very
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav army is a force dependent on its garrisons. As
you destroy their garrisons and their logistics, that army
atrophies,'' Arkin said. ``If NATO ground forces are needed to go
in there, it will be to mop up a badly defeated Yugoslav army.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike agreed. He foresees the war ending in six weeks or so, with
an international security force leading refugees back into Kosovo.
``The question becomes, how much gunfire accompanies the security
forces?'' he said. ``My own view is, given another several weeks of
bombing, the Serbian forces will be in the same shape as the Iraqi
forces were when we started the ground war over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Pape are less hopeful. In the Gulf War, Iraq's tanks
sat defenseless on the Kuwaiti desert's flat terrain _ while the
Serbs' are dispersed in villages or hiding in forests, much harder
to hit or even see.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Gulf War, the allied bombing destroyed just 20
percent of Iraq's tanks, artillery, and armored personnel carriers.
``It's not impossible to get them,'' Pape said, ``but it's very
difficult, and it will take a long time.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark,
delivered the first comprehensive assessment of the campaign
against Yugoslavia on Tuesday, saying that the allies had damaged
every broad sector of the Serbian military, but that President
Slobodan Milosevic appeared determined to ride out the air war and
showed no sign of withdrawing from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In an hour-long presentation, Clark used an array of statistics
and a blizzard of maps, photos and videotapes to make his case that
the alliance had the firepower to grind down Yugoslavia's military
and was proceeding methodically toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that the Serbian military has endured only a small
dose of NATO's striking power, Clark confirmed Tuesday that he will
seek still more allied warplanes, pushing the air armada to more
than 1,000 aircraft. The reinforcements would include 300
additional American planes, he said. Senior officials have said the
Pentagon was planning on approving the request.
</P>
<P>
   After almost 1,700 bombing runs, Clark said that NATO had caused
damage to every broad strategic area, such as air defense, command
centers, oil production, military units in the field and military
transport. None were considered to be destroyed, he said, although
NATO does contend to have destroyed many individual targets within
the broader areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clark stopped short of declaring that the alliance would
win a victory from the air. He said only that Yugoslav's military
was potentially ``vulnerable to collapse'' if enough military
pressure was applied, but tried to sidestep any political question.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NATO's political leaders had been too slow to act
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic earlier this year,
Clark said, ``You're asking judgments about political leadership,
which it's not appropriate for me to give.''
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of air attacks intended to cause Milosevic so
much military pain that he would withdraw his troops and agrees to
allied conditions for a settlement, Clark acknowledged, Milosevic
does not appear to be cowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have said from the outset, this is likely to be as long
and difficult as President Milosevic makes it,'' Clark said. ``And
we're approaching it very systematically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark spoke at NATO's headquarters here as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov
met in Oslo, but failed to resolve their differences over NATO
insistence that an allied military force police any peace in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton and congressional leaders from
both parties tried to avert any attempt by Congress to vote on the
eventual use of ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the military commander of a 19-member alliance, Clark, who
has had about as much personal contact with Milosevic and his top
generals as any NATO diplomat, confronts a complex political, as
well as military, equation. His aim is to send the Serbs a message
that NATO has the firepower to break their will while trying to
reassure Western political leaders and voters that the alliance
would use only the minimum force that was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The task has not always been easy. Since the attacks began three
weeks ago, NATO says the bombings have been hobbled by bad weather,
a limited number of aircraft and political constraints. Critics
have complained that the alliance was withholding crucial details
in an effort to mask disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   A four-star Army general, Clark, 54, is not an obvious choice
for Pentagon to send before the world's television cameras to sing
the praises of air power. On Tuesday, however, he did so in a
measured and qualified way. His methodical, technocratic style
contrasted with the blustery manner of some of his predecessors,
like Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf during the 1991 Gulf War, a plus
for an alli- ance that is still skittish about the notion of ground
forces and eager for a negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to solidify Western support, Clark began by documenting
the steady Serbian military build-up in Kosovo in recent months.
His presentation was intended to show that Milosevic had repeatedly
violated his promises to withdraw from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But it also inadvertently raised questions about the adequacy of
the alliance's military planning, which initially relied on limited
air attacks to punish the Serbian forces for their assaults on the
Albanian population in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, in a remarkable personal aside, Clark recalled in
some detail an October meeting he had in Belgrade with a leading
Serbian general, who insisted that the Yugoslav military could have
finished off the Kosovo Liberation Army, Albanian separatist
rebels, in two more weeks if it had been permitted to continue its
sweep of Albanian villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said to him, `Yes, and you created about 400,000
homeless people in this process in a campaign that's totally
disproportionate to any reasonable definition of a threat. It's a
political problem and you've tried to solve it by force,' '' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and the general had a ``long dialectical discussion''
and added: ``That's when I realized that there was still this very
strong proclivity to believe that this problem was a problem which
was appropriate to be solved by military force and the target would
be the population, since they couldn't get at the KLA directly.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with another politically sensitive issue, Clark said
there was little NATO &UR;  &LR; could do to ease the plight of the hundreds
of thousands of Albanians that have been driven from their homes by
Serb forces and are now homeless within Kosovo with very little
food.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, NATO ambassadors asked Clark to look into ways to
provide food and medicine to the civilians there. But Tuesday, the
NATO commander said it would take 60 to 100 flights of slow-moving
transport planes each day to drop relief supplies and that the
aircraft might be shot down by Serb's air defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view on this is that, frankly, this is a problem that's
caused by President Milosevic,'' Clark said. ``He needs to address
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering new data, Clark noted that the alliance had flown 5,924
missions, but that only 1,687 of these were bombing missions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the distances involved, a larger percentage of the
alliance's missions consist of flights by refueling planes than in
previous air campaigns. And since Belgrade demonstrated its
potential to lash out by dispatching two Russian-made MIG warplanes
over Bosnia last month, the alliance is also maintaining constant
air patrols around Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clark insisted, however, that NATO's bombing strikes were
effective since the vast majority of strikes are being carried out
with laser-guided bombs and other precision-guided munitions.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the campaign, Clark acknowledged, the bombing
attacks have been handicapped by poor weather. Over three weeks, he
said, NATO forces had enjoyed good weather on only seven days. On
10 days, he said, more than 50 percent of the bombing missions were
canceled because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Clark sought to turn these statistic into a public relations
advantage, noting that the allies' striking power could grow
substantially as skies clear over the Balkans over the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the bomb damage assessment, Clark said the alliance
was in a race, trying to damage Serb supplies and equipment faster
than the Yugoslav military could replace or repair it.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, for example, has destroyed 70 percent of Yugoslavia's
storage capability for fuel, Clark said. Belgrade, however, is
continuing to receive fuel from oil foreign oil tankers. NATO is
hoping friendly nations will order those shipments stopped.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bombing, however, Clark conceded that there is no
evidence that the Serb military is withdrawing from Kosovo. At
40,000 troops, the Serbs force have even increased slightly since
the NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen no evidence of any pull-back of Serb military or
police forces,'' he said. ``They are moving into defensive
positions in some areas. In other cases, they are continuing with
the pattern of ethnic cleansing and village destruction. And in a
third set of instances, they are regrouping, refitting,
reconstituting and preparing for future operations.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Milosevic, Clark said the goal was to pressure him to
accept the allied requirements for a Kosovo accord by striking the
security forces and military command and control he relies on to
maintain his hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   But a slide in Clark's presentation suggested that Milosevic
would not be easy to intimidate. ``Milosevic's Willingness To
Accept Damage Is High,'' it read.

HURRICANE-TORN CENTRAL AMERICA STILL WAITING FOR FINANCING

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Last fall's Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000
people and destroyed everything from power lines to major bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The floods and mud slides that came with the killer storm swept
away bridges, factories and hospitals in countries that can't
afford to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   While food and money poured in from international relief
agencies, the region needs more than just temporary aid. It needs
$8 billion to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   A region with a gross domestic product of $24.2 billion can't
foot the bill for recovery on its own, according to the Economic
Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, among
others, pledged $6 billion in loans to help rebuild El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   But the region won't see most of this money until this summer,
after a high-level meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, in late May.
That's when the four nations detail how they plan to spend the
money needed to rebuild roads, bridges, hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a sort of dress rehearsal for that meeting, Central American
government officials and funding organizers will meet Wednesday and
Thursday at Texas A&AMP;M University's George Bush Presidential Library
in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Key players attending the meeting in Stockholm will discuss how
to rebuild the region's telecommunications and agriculture
industries and its roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Until the financing comes through, Central Americans and all the
people involved in the effort live in a state of limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of inaction,'' said Dennis Wright, business
acquisition planning adviser for Brown &AMP; Root Services Corp. in
Houston. ``Six months has passed and very little substantive work
has been done. Today, you may come away with the perception that
life has returned to normal because the people have learned to
accommodate the inconveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   While the companies have been unable to close a deal, they've
been out selling their services.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 16 U.S.-based companies went on a week-long trade
mission to the region with David Aaron, Commerce Department
undersecretary for international trade.
</P>
<P>
   They saw how Central Americans have pushed aside debris, put up
temporary bridges and made makeshift fixes because they can't
afford to rebuild, said Wright, who was on the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department plans two more such trips to the region
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These long-range relationships will benefit the United States
and Central American countries for a long time to come,'' Aaron
said during a telephone conference with reporters while he was in
Managua, Nicaragua. ``We're trying to get in on the ground floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for work has drawn construction, telecommunications and
water purification companies from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department's trade mission was a follow-up to
President Clinton's trip to Central America. Clinton is trying to
push a $950 million aid package for the four countries through
Congress now.
</P>
<P>
   But that measure does not tackle the region's problems of debt,
poverty, economic development and low levels of education, said
Economic Policy Institute economist Robert E. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's package, ``is a proposal for trade enhancement,''
wrote the economist for the Washington D.C.-based economic think
tank. ``Humanitarian assistance and relief designed to simply
replace what was lost will only set the stage for future disasters
of even greater magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to the frustration of businesses interested in selling to
Central Americans and even more so to those living in the region,
reconstruction will not begin until after the Stockholm meeting.
</P>
<P>
   American businesses have made some sales there.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Weiss, president of Dallas-based Global Water Technologies,
said the trip boosted sales for his 12-person company, which had
not done business in Central America before the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss wanted to show Central Americans how his water
purification system could remove contaminants. He said he expects
$2 million in sales from the trip and could make another $18
million in sales this year if international aid comes through.
</P>
<P>
   He described a typical exchange with a potential customer:
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Do you like the system?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Yes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Do you like the price?'
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We love it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Have you got the money?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And they said `No.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once the reconstruction begins, exports to Central America
should skyrocket, with much of it flowing through the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, Chiquita Brands International and Dole
Food Co. have sent ships carrying relief supplies to Guatemala and
Honduras from the Port of Freeport in Texas, which receives most of
this region's bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's trade with the region remained the same last year at
$486 million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. trade with Central America increased slightly last year to
$19 billion from $17.3 billion in 1997, according to the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   So, until the bidding for the big projects begins, U.S.-based
companies compete with their foreign counterparts by literally
bridging Central America's gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Concrete Construction/Conspan based in Houston donated a
20-foot bridge to Honduras. The company plans to send this
prefabricated bridge to Honduras by plane and show the government
an example of its work. It could translate into more sales of the
company's bridges for the hundreds of spans wiped out by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   After the hurricane, Brown &AMP; Root Services worked for Chiquita
as consultants for flood control protection of its plantations.
Brown &AMP; Root officials would like the job of overseeing and
directing the hundreds of companies needed to rebuild Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned that they may try to piecemeal it to
fix it,'' Wright said.

 &HT;    Magician Blaine leaves the public speechless
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a busy New York sidewalk at dusk, magician David Blaine stops
a woman out for a walk and asks her to think of the name of someone
important to her. While she's thinking, a yellow taxi drives by on
the street behind them with the name ``Dawn'' scrawled on the side,
graffiti-style. Blaine points it out to her, and she freaks.
</P>
<P>
   And so will most viewers of Blaine's magic act tonight on ABC.
It's a magic show for people who don't like magic shows _ no
spangle-bedecked assistants, no white tigers, no sawing anybody in
half, no bombastic music. In short, no Vegas. Just Blaine, walking
around city streets in Manhattan and Memphis, accosting passers-by
and pulling off simple but astonishing tricks that leave them
open-mouthed in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   He does a card trick, and makes the chosen card appear inside
his victim's shoe. He swallows a long black thread, then lifts his
shirt and appears to pull it directly out of the skin over his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Other professional magicians say Blaine doesn't bring anything
new to the craft, that it's all just packaging. But so much of
magic is packaging, and Blaine's is just flat-out funkier than
anybody else's. Working completely outdoors in public with regular
people makes his act seem street-savvy. And then there's the magic
man himself: hip black T-shirt and jeans, Marine buzz cut, swarthy,
handsome, charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if Blaine has taken a misstep in his careful
image-crafting lately, it was that publicity stunt of being buried
under a New York sidewalk for seven days. It seemed so hokey, so
Copperfieldian, compared to the millennial coolness Blaine has
cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, ABC ran Blaine's first special. It wasn't a
blockbuster in the ratings, but everyone who saw it was obsessed
with talking about it the next day. Don't be fooled: Watch Blaine
tonight, and get ready to catch your jaw.

KEVORKIAN SENTENCED TO 10 TO 25 YEARS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ A Michigan judge on Tuesday sentenced Dr. Jack
Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison, despite emotional courtroom
pleas on his behalf from the widow and brother of the terminally
ill man he was convicted of killing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jessica Cooper of Oakland County Circuit Court, who denied
bail to Kevorkian, 70, said his flouting of the law had given
prosecutors and the courts no choice but to remove him from
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of
euthanasia,'' Cooper said. ``It was about you, sir. It was about
lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the ``60 Minutes'' program that featured a
videotape of Kevorkian's administering the lethal injection that
resulted in the charges, Cooper said that Kevorkian had ``the
audacity to go on national television, show the world what you did
and dare the legal system to stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sir, consider yourself stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The corridor outside the courtroom was crowded with foes of
Kevorkian, who burst into applause after the sentencing. Kevorkian,
who had talked on a cellular telephone in the courtroom before the
sentencing, smiled as he was led out by bailiffs. He had declined
to speak in his defense. One of his lawyers, Michael Schwartz, said
that on hearing the sentence Kevorkian had softly uttered,
``Justice?''
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Kevorkian on March 26 of second-degree murder
in the death of Thomas Youk, a 52-year-old accountant who lived in
suburban Detroit and suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
or Lou Gehrig's disease. His widow, Melody Youk, gave a statement
to the court Tuesday that bitterly criticized prosecutors and cast
Kevorkian as someone who was merely carrying out the wishes of her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that she wished she had been able to speak at the trial,
Mrs. Youk said that her husband ``would be greatly distressed that
the man who brought him peace at the end would now suffer on his
account.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Youk had decided before contacting Kevorkian that
he wished to end his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crushed,'' Mrs. Youk said. But she said she bent to her
husband's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Youk had tried several kinds of experimental drugs and
therapies, she said, but he had virtually lost all use of his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband had come to the end of his life as he chose it,''
she said. ``He was not depressed. He was not a victim.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Skrzynski, the prosecutor, said Kevorkian had used Youk
as part of his effort to rally support for euthanasia and assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant chose to put us in this sad situation,'' he
said. ``This is not a case where the prosecutor went looking for
Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, who plans to appeal, his lawyers say, must serve
more than six years before being eligible for parole under Michigan
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper told Kevorkian that whatever his views on euthanasia, he
must follow the rules of a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation of laws,'' she said. ``We have a civilized and
nonviolent way of resolving conflict. You can criticize the law.
You can gripe. You can lecture. You can petition the voters. But
you may not take the law into your own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that voters in Michigan last November defeated
by a wide margin a measure that would have legalized assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   She said the law was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you purposely inject another human being with what you
know is a lethal dose, that, sir, is murder.''
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that Kevorkian had lost his medical license in
Michigan eight years ago, and that he had no permission to hold the
sorts of toxic drugs he used to kill Youk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had no right to be in control of any kind of controlled
substance, let alone deliver it to someone else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was denying bond because she did not know whether
Kevorkian could be trusted to stop assisting suicides, even though
one of his his lawyers, Mayer Morganroth, said he had made such a
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question whether you will ever cease and desist,'' the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fifth time in a decade that prosecutors had tried
Kevorkian in the deaths of seriously ill people. Three trials ended
in acquittal. A fourth trial ended in a mistrial. In those cases,
he had not been charged with murder but with violating laws against
assisted suicide. In some of those trials, families of the dead had
given emotional statements defending Kevorkian's actions.
</P>
<P>
   But this trial, at which Kevorkian insisted on defending
himself, was different because prosecutors were able to use a
videotape Kevorkian made of himself injecting Youk with lethal
chemicals in September. Kevorkian took the tape to the CBS News
program ``60 Minutes,'' which broadcast it in November along with
an interview in which Kevorkian dared prosecutors to file charges
against him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another of Kevorkian's lawyers, Schwartz, criticized the
sentence as unduly harsh. He also noted that Kevorkian had recently
indicated he would go on a hunger strike in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a civil rights case,'' Schwartz said in an interview
after the sentencing. ``This was not about Jack Kevorkian.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Kevorkian was ``not some cold-blooded murderer,''
Schwartz said he failed to understand how the judge could view him
as a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Youk, a brother of Thomas Youk, said after the
sentencing that he found it ``outrageous, but not surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Youk had urged the judge to show leniency for
Kevorkian, and charged that prosecutors had been ``disingenuous''
by casting his late brother as a victim of the doctor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom fought the courageous and inspired fight,'' he said. But
he said his brother had become ``a prisoner in his own body.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother would have spasms of choking on his own
saliva. ``He was caught in hell,'' Youk said, his voice breaking.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother had ultimately decided to die ``from a
stable, well-informed point of view,'' and that he had often
lamented that although he did not want to die, he could not go on
living in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Youk accused the prosecution of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why doesn't the prosecutor charge me with conspiracy to commit
murder?'' he said, saying that he had composed his brother's letter
to Kevorkian and arranged their initial meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said his brother's intentions had been very clear. ``This was
no one else's decision but his.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``History will judge us harshly for such a lack of
insight and compassion.''

   TECH-PRODUCTIVITY (Undated) _ For years, as the computer
revolutionized the workplace, productivity _ the output of goods
and services per worker _ stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a
year. Yet today, skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy are having second thoughts.
Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996, capped by a
surge in the second half of last year, after eight years of
economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past upward
swings in productivity typically occurred early in a recovery as
economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased hiring, it
slowed again. But something seems fundamentally different this
time, something apparently having a lot to do with the increased
speed and efficiency that the Internet and other pervasive
information-technology advances are bringing to the mundane
day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses. By Steve Lohr.

BIBLE-BASED PARENTING PROGRAM HAS MANY CONVERTS, CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
 METHOD-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Lori and Scott Hashimoto, the first seven weeks of
parenthood were, by their own admission, ``hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Blake would cry. Lori would nurse him. He'd cry some
more. And so it went, round-the-clock, as the weeks rolled by in a
blur of broken sleep. Weary and discouraged, Lori even developed
blisters from her infant's strong and frequent sucking.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, that giant sucking sound was Scott and Lori
pulling the plug on ``child-centered'' parenting.
</P>
<P>
   They turned instead to a controversial ``Bible-based'' program
whose popularity has alarmed mainstream parenting experts and
created dissension among conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashimotos, who live in Lynnwood, Wash., say the parenting
program developed by Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo of Chatsworth,
Calif., restored their sanity and quieted Blake's distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two weeks, he was sleeping through 10 to 12 hours
without having to cry,'' says Scott, 35, an occupational therapist
with a home health agency. ``We got him on a routine during the day
and that's what stabilized him.''
</P>
<P>
   But many pediatricians and lactation experts say the Ezzo
routine comes at a cost, and babies pay the price. In extreme
cases, they say, babies are at risk of failure to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've suddenly boiled over,'' said British psychologist
Penelope Leach, author of the still-popular child-development
guide, ``Your Baby &AMP; Child'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 559 pages, $35),
first published in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, a founder of the British branch of the World Association
for Infant Mental Health, said she plans to voice her alarm over
the Ezzo program at an April 20 talk at Seattle's Tools for Parents
Lecture Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's called sticking your neck out,'' Leach said in a
phone interview from London.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having no formal training in the field, the Ezzos, who
have five grandchildren, are not shy about bucking established
views on child development, as popularized by authorities such as
Leach and Dr. T. Berry Brazelton.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos' advice: For trouble-free days and nights, put your
newborn on a feeding schedule and don't rush to pick her up when
she cries. After all, they say, God did not immediately answer
Christ's agonized cries on the cross, and half an hour of crying
won't hurt a baby that's kept clean and fed on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your baby will not lose brain cells, experience a drop in IQ
or have feelings of rejection that will leave him manic-depressive
at age thirty,'' says ``On Becoming Babywise,'' the secular version
of their church-based program.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' it adds, ``if you want a fussy baby,
never let him cry, and hold, rock and feed him as soon as he starts
to fuss. We guarantee, you will achieve your goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalled'' by such advice, Leach says the American Academy of
Pediatrics has been too timid in responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there must be a lot of people out there who are as
sickened by (the Ezzos) as I am,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has taken no position on the
Ezzo program but, in response to widespread concern among its
membership, is evaluating it and other parenting programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kyle Yasuda, president of the Washington state chapter of
the academy, said he does not recommend the Ezzo approach to his
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does raise some flags,'' he said, adding that he is
concerned about nutritional and behavioral aspects of the program.
``This kind of regimented approach doesn't sound like a nurturing
environment to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos initially recommended four-hour feeding intervals for
infants, but now say 2{- to three-hour ``parent-directed'' feedings
are fine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such adjustments, infant development specialists are
still concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to throw those books away!'' said Katy Brock
Jameson, clinical manager for the department at Seattle's Swedish
Hospital that does home visits and education for new moms.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has seen babies fail to regain their birth weight
after two weeks on the Ezzo schedule. Although some kids can
probably adapt, she said, ``in other cases I believe there may be
damage done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lactation specialists say nursing on demand, up to 12 or even 18
times a day in a newborn, optimizes the supply and fat content of
the mother's milk while also quenching infant's thirst, building
its immunity, stimulating bowel movements and providing comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they cry for prolonged periods, it burns up calories that
can otherwise be used for growth,'' Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos' course materials are marketed through Growing
Families International (GFI), their $4-million-a-year, for-profit
company, which they refer to as a ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Churches _ especially conservative, evangelical churches _ are
the prime venue for their classes, including their core course,
``Growing Kids God's Way.'' According to GFI, Ezzo materials have
been used by about 6,000 churches _ involving nearly 1.5 million
parents _ in 95 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos also have a secular following through the books ``On
Becoming Babywise'' and ``On Becoming Babywise Book Two'' by Gary
Ezzo and Dr. Robert Bucknam, who wrote the forward (both books from
Multnomah Press, $9.99).
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why our material has been so successful is because
it works,'' said Robert Garcia, GFI's executive vice president and
the Ezzos' son-in-law. (The Ezzos declined to be interviewed for
this story.)
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said failure to thrive is not an outcome of the Ezzos'
feeding method. ``I think it's something that just happens with
babies sometimes,'' he said, adding that the Ezzo program gives
parents ``hope'' and ``relief'' from being ``almost a slave to the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising children is not a matter of chance, he said, it's a
matter of ``right parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's bedrock principles are that the husband-wife
relationship is paramount, and that children should begin early to
learn self-control, respect, unquestioning obedience and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   In a philosophy that frequently clashes with established ideas
of child development, they also teach that infants are born with a
``sin nature.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, instead of viewing temper tantrums as a normal and
fleeting stage, the Ezzos teach in ``Growing Kids God's Way'' that
``a temper tantrum is the ultimate rejection of parental
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Defying conventional wisdom, they recommend structured playpen
time to help babies develop orderliness, mental focusing skills and
creativity _ which they call a function of boundaries, not freedom.
</P>
<P>
   They also encourage ``high-chair manners'' for babies as young
as 8 months, with a swat or hand squeeze if baby fails to use sign
language for ``please'' and ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late toddlerhood, Ezzo discipline follows a flow
chart that culminates in spanking, or ``biblical chastisement''
with a flexible tool chosen to inflict pain without causing injury.
The Ezzos have suggested a rubber spatula would do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ezzos' written words seem harsh and unambiguous,
families who take the courses say they emphasize positive
discipline and flexibility aimed at cultivating goodness in their
children's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Hashimoto suspects the program's very success has spawned
professional jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, however, laments that parents today find moderation
``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I do or say amounts to a kind of child-rearing
program,'' Leach said. ``That's what people seem to want _ a
formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach sees the Ezzo approach as part of a growing movement
toward authoritarian parenting that is polarizing the issue of how
to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Leach said, parents are hit with research on
critical brain development in the first three years of life _
creating panic in new parents who make minor ``blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they're sold the notion _ via Judith Rich
Harris' controversial book, ``The Nurture Assumption'' _ that what
they do as parents makes no difference, because peers are more
influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we have made the whole business of being a parent
so impossibly difficult,'' Leach said, ``that anything that looks
simple is going to get a hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Ezzos have won a fiercely loyal following. ``On
Becoming Babywise,'' published in 1995, is the
eighth-most-requested parenting book at Ingram Book Co., the
nation's largest trade book distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online bookseller, has posted 80 highly
emotional reader reviews of ``Babywise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blessing to our family,'' wrote one Oregon reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started `Babywise' when our child was 6 weeks old and have
not looked back since,'' wrote a mother from Yuma, Ariz., who said
her infant was constantly crying and unhappy before they bought the
book.
</P>
<P>
   But other readers are aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a couple who used this book and the baby suffered
failure to thrive and nearly was hospitalized,'' wrote a Montana
reader.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington state reader called the book ``child hate in
disguise,'' and an Ohio reader wrote, ``If you are looking for a
convenient way to have a child who falls into a schedule and
doesn't bother you too much ... GET A DOG!''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue pediatrician Don Shifrin said he's concerned by the
program's one-size-fits-all approach, which he believes sets
parents up for failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian community itself is divided. Focus on the Family,
a conservative group led by psychologist James Dobson of Colorado
Springs, Colo., says the Ezzo program is ``far too rigid'' and
misapplies scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, Calif., where Gary Ezzo
was formerly associate pastor, has disavowed the Ezzo program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Christian Research Journal dissected the Ezzo
program in a 14-page article with 111 footnotes. Although it found
some benefits, the thrust was highly critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``GFI is more than a parenting ministry _ it is a cultic
community,'' the article charged.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashimotos, who now have three sons, say critics overreact
to a program that, in their view, creates loving, thinking parents.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they spank occasionally, with a hand or a wooden spoon
(which the Ezzos don't recommend).
</P>
<P>
   But they say life overall is happy and relaxed, with well-fed,
well-trained children who are pleasant to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most appealing thing (about the program) is that
we enjoy our children when they're young,'' Scott Hashimoto said.
``For me, I feel offended when people say I'm stifling my child's
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He says any child-rearing method can be misapplied. And while
the Ezzos seem to promise otherwise, he says no child has a
guaranteed outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is,'' Hashimoto said, ``a lot of people turn out good
and a lot of people turn out bad.''

MILOSEVIC TARGET OF INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Prosecutors at the international war
crimes tribunal here have built a strong case to indict President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, diplomats and lawyers close to
the tribunal say. But they say the prosecutors are depending on
NATO governments for crucial links that they need to bolster their
case.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal still refuses to officially confirm that it is
investigating Milosevic. But prosecutors concede that they have
been pursuing the Yugoslav leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is right to say that our focus is at the top end,'' said
Graham Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor of the tribunal, which was
set up by the United Nations in 1993. The diplomats say tribunal
investigators have focused on Milosevic for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   As reports of Yugoslav forces killing and terrorizing ethnic
Albanians have grown, the court has been inundated with questions
on when it will indict Milosevic on war crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the tribunal have responded with frustration,
saying they have been delayed because NATO member countries have
been slow to provide vital information about the inner workings of
the Yugoslav political and military command.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the issue is not to collect evidence of more
crimes in Kosovo. Rather, they argue, they need to demonstrate what
orders were given, who was involved and what knowledge commanders
had of crimes committed by subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we have a lot of evidence of crime in Kosovo,''
Blewitt said. ``We can now indict people in the chain of command.
But it's a question of what level. We could go faster if we had the
right evidence about the top.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, will visit
NATO headquarters in Brussels to ask the allies for greater
cooperation in sharing their intelligence. The information she
needs is likely to be highly classified and includes interceptions
of radio, telephone or computer communications, which NATO
countries have so far withheld.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days NATO and British and American officials have said
they have information that they will give the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not seeing the goods,'' Blewitt said. ``We're not
getting anywhere near what we're expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials said the information would shore up the cases
they were building. ``We want an indictment only when it will
result in a conviction,'' Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Making the link between Milosevic and the reported brutal action
of his forces in Kosovo appears simple enough: he is the Yugoslav
head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces, and
Kosovo is part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   From a legal point of view, tribunal investigators say, it is
easier to hold Milosevic accountable now than during the war in
Bosnia, which he instigated and backed but from which he took care
to keep a formal distance as president of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has shown himself very adept at avoiding paper trails
and evading interceptions during the war that broke up Yugoslavia,
specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   He can also answer some of the prosecution charges. For example,
one investigator said, in the case of Kosovo, Milosevic can produce
a written order saying that all troops in the Yugoslav army must
behave in accordance with the law and that any offenses against
civilians or criminal acts will be punished severely.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they need information that not only supports an
indictment but that also can be used in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we have been given leads and intelligence, and
then we go back to the source and say we'd like to use this in the
courtroom,'' Blewitt said. ``Then they say no, because they do not
want to expose their intelligence gathering methods or compromise
their sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the debate outside the tribunal is whether NATO allies
want to see Milosevic indicted at this point, since it could be
difficult to negotiate with him once he was formally charged as a
war crimes suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Tribunal officials said they had not been subjected to pressure
by governments to indict senior Yugoslav officials or to withhold
indictments. Pressure has come from public opinion and from
questions asked by the press, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be an expectation that something is going to
happen right now,'' Blewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   That expectation may also exist in Yugoslavia. For three weeks
the Yugoslav Embassy in The Hague has refused to have any dealings
with the tribunal. It has refused to accept letters, documents and
even telephone calls, an official said.

ALBRIGHT MEETING WITH RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER PRODUCES MEAGER
RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ The Russian foreign minister said Tuesday that
Moscow remained opposed to an international security force in
Kosovo as part of a peace plan without the approval of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   This fundamental difference between Russia and the United States
appeared to blunt any prospect that real progress would be made
soon toward a diplomatic solution in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting at an airport hotel here, Igor S. Ivanov, the
Russian minister, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
discussed Yugoslavia. The meeting lasted more than three hours and
included other issues important to the Russian-U.S. relationship,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the encounter was as much about ensuring that
Washington-Moscow ties did not go off the rails over Kosovo as it
was about Kosovo itself, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright had spoken to Ivanov by phone almost daily since the
bombing began, and last week Vice President Al Gore reached out to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, urging him in a phone conversation
to help pursue a diplomatic solution in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The phone contacts Tuesday yielded a ``narrowing of the gap'' on
some issues, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With Ivanov beside her at a news conference, Albright read out
some principles that the two sides could agree on: the need for a
``verifiable end'' of violence; the withdrawal of ``military police
and paramilitary forces'' from Kosovo; and the unconditional return
of all refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Polite but firm, Ivanov said Russia could not agree to an
international security force in Kosovo without ``the agreement of
the leadership of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The international presence is one of the most complicated''
matters, he said. ``It is complicated because the leadership of
Yugoslavia comes out against any kind of military presence in
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has absolutely refused to entertain an outside force
in Kosovo, arguing that the province is the sovereign territory of
Serbia and Yugoslavia. His opposition was a major reason why he did
not sign the peace accords devised at Rambouillet, France, a
refusal that directly led to the NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said Tuesday that the Russian reluctance to endorse an
international force before Milosevic gave his assent was compatible
with the Russian behavior during the peace talks in Dayton, Ohio,
that led to the end of the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Russians refused to sign the accords _ which included
a NATO-led international force _ until Milosevic agreed to sign it
at the final ceremony in Paris. Russia went on to become part of
the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Russian soldiers remain in the
force despite Moscow's differences with NATO over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the meager results of the meeting Tuesday, Ivanov did
not rule out trying to be helpful. ``If we have to go to Belgrade,
if we have to go to Washington, we will go,'' he said of further
efforts to find a diplomatic resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But, in reality, a senior Clinton administration official said,
movement toward finding a diplomatic resolution was minimal because
Milosevic had not yet been hurt enough by the air assaults to send
out any real feelers for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to assuage the Russians, Albright has started to
describe the international security force, which is envisioned as
escorting refugees back to Kosovo and staying there, a little more
ambiguously. Instead of calling it a NATO-led force, the secretary
now describes it as having a ``NATO-core'' with ``other elements''
contributing.
</P>
<P>
   This configuration essentially conforms with the setup of the
NATO-led force in Bosnia, where the Russian troops are part of the
force but their direct commander not a NATO officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State Department officials tried to point out Tuesday that
because the Russians had been helpful in trying to put together the
peace settlement at Rambouillet they could be brought back into the
mainstream of international opinion on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright was trying to play on fears in the Russian leadership
that Russia could become isolated if it hangs on to its fairly
unfruitful relationship with Milosevic, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leadership has felt extremely frustrated at watching
NATO and the United States act in Kosovo without any checks from
Moscow and sees its position as one of weakness, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has acted boldly to jolt the Moscow-Washington
relationship. Moscow has frozen its relations with NATO, walking
out of the Permanent Joint Council that was formed for the purpose
of advising Russia about NATO activities.
</P>
<P>
   And while President Boris Yeltsin has pledged that Russia will
stay out of the Kosovo conflict, he warned last week that this
could change if the United States contemplated sending ground
troops to fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Clinton administration warned Moscow not to
share Russian intelligence with the Yugoslav military, saying that
such a move would bring serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they were concerned that a Russian
intelligence ship, the Liman, positioned near the aircraft carrier
Theodore Roosevelt, appeared to be trying to count the planes
taking off from the carrier. But Pentagon officials said that so
far they had found no evidence that the Russians were handing
intelligence to Belgrade.

EXPATRIATE ALBANIAN KOSOVARS HEADING HOME TO FIGHT SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Fifty men. Each with his own scars, his own
past and his own vision of vengeance. They came from half a dozen
different countries, in a dozen different ways, but they all ended
up on the same high-speed ferry crossing the Adriatic Sea and they
all planned to fight for Kosovo, the place where they all were
born.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the first Kosovo Albanians to gather informally at
the wharf in the Italian port city of Bari and then, realizing
their common resentment of Serbian military action, to travel
together on the uncertain trip home.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does anyone expect them to be the last. The arrival of
groups like this over the weekend seems to confirm the reports that
Kosovo expatriates are returning in strong numbers to join the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, whose battles against the
Yugoslav government brought the crackdown a year ago that has led
to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 50 men in this group say they have ever fought with
the rebels. Some served in the Yugoslav army, which they have come
back to fight against. A few fled their beloved homeland to avoid
the mandatory service that might have forced them to take up arms
against Bosnians or Croats in past wars and struggles.
</P>
<P>
   They have no training, no uniforms, no weapons. They say they do
not know whom to contact in Albania to take them to the front. But
they are sure the rebels will find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the heart for Kosovo,'' said Ylber Tafili, 31, who has
lived in New York and Toronto since leaving Kosovo 13 years ago.
``Even if we are going back with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor can they expect much. The rebels have been described as a
rough and disorganized bunch, not terribly well armed and with weak
leadership. The NATO alliance has not budged from its position of
refusing any direct aid to the rebels. Alabanian officials say they
support the rebels politically and morally, but not militarily.
</P>
<P>
   None of that mattered to Tafili and a friend, Afrim Gashi, 35,
who also came from Kosovo and now lives in Toronto. They traveled
together on a journey that took them six days. They flew from
Toronto to Hamburg, Germany, where they visited relatives and spoke
openly about their plans to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Then they boarded a train for the long journey from Hamburg,
south across the Alps into Italy and down the Italian peninsula to
the port at Bari.
</P>
<P>
   On they way they watched as other Kosovo Albanians boarded the
train in small groups or alone. Some had been living in Germany,
others in Norway, Sweden, Italy and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they arrived at the terminal for the high-speed
ferry in Bari, their common language and shared goals had united
them. There they met others who had come from different directions,
but with similar intentions. They almost showed some military
bearing as they marched aboard the ferry, not so much as a trained
regiment, but as people united in a cause.
</P>
<P>
   But they still were strangers, and on board the ferry for the
four-hour trip, they settled into their second-class seats in
different groups, those from Germany by and large together, and
some of the younger men apart from the older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little the rocking of the ferry lulled them to sleep
and they disappeared from view, stretched out on the floor between
seats. Most were sound asleep when the ferry passed several NATO
vessels stationed in the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But about an hour from the Albanian port of Durres they started
to stir and were willing to share their personal stories with a
visitor. Their tales revealed as clearly as any dissertation the
simmering resentment and wounded lives that have fertilized the
hatred and fed the anger in the Balkans for so long.
</P>
<P>
   For Tafili, it began with his father, who had dared raise a
voice for democracy in the dark days of communist dictatorship in
Yugoslavia. For that he spent seven years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Tafili was born in the city of Pec, in western Kosovo, and was
repeatedly reminded of his father's supposed transgressions. When
he turned 18, Tafili was forced into the Yugoslav army, and he was
repeatedly challenged there, too, to defend his father's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would either end up dead or in jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he completed the year's service, he returned to school.
With two friends he organized a protest against the government. His
friends were arrested, but he escaped and kept on running, first
into Austria, then to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in New York from 1993 to 1995, working as a taxi
dispatcher in Queens. He has since returned to Toronto, where he
works for a catering company at Pearson International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   His mother left Kosovo six years ago to join him, but a sister
and her two children remain. He does not know where they are or
what happened to them since the bombing began, because when he
calls, the phone rings but no one answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart beats for my sister and her family, of course, but
there is more involved,'' he said. ``If coming to Kosovo means
fighting, then, yes, I will die for my land, for my father's
beliefs and for mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men were less willing to share the details of their
lives. They declined to be photographed, and some were afraid to
identify themselves fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry,'' said Cani, 27, who fled a small village in
western Kosovo that Albanians call Gelance eight years ago to avoid
military service, ``but the point is that if I give my full name
they will harass my family.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cani lives in Hannover, Germany, he said, where he works as a
journalist for a radio station that broadcasts to the Albanian
community there. When he fled Kosovo, he left behind a brother, a
sister, his parents and a grandmother, and he is worried about
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they have gone to the mountains, about eight miles
from the city,'' he said. Of all the men, he alone wore a military
camouflage hat, something he had bought. ``I heard from somebody in
Albania that the Serb artillery is bombimg the camp. The village
itself is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   By Balkan standards of income and wealth, these men had all done
well. Most wore brand new boots or shoes they had bought for the
trip. Arben, 27, from Hoexter, Germany, left the town in Kosovo
whose Albanian name is Vitia nine years ago. Now he traveled in an
imitation leather jacket and pants, with an Adidas cap and a heavy
gold chain around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   The second Canadian volunteer, Afrim Gashi, owns a coffee shop
in Toronto and has justed started his own construction company. He
and his wife have a nine-month-old son, named Agim after Gashi's
brother, who he said was killed in Chicago in 1992. Although he has
no proof, he is certain that Serbs did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going back to Kosovo first of all for my family and for
the others who need help,'' Gashi said. ``I watched TV and I saw
the kids who went to Macedonia and then were sent out and thought,
`If nothing else, at least I can go and help them.'''
</P>
<P>
   He spent a year with the Yugoslav army, in a tank division, and
has heard that in the neighborhood where he grew up in Pristina,
Kosovo's capital, 50 Albanians have been killed. If the need
arises, he said, he is ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a chance to go inside Kosovo,'' he said, ``I will
go.''
</P>
<P>
   As the younger men made boasts about fighting, and dying, for
their homeland, Ismet Krasniqi sat quietly, listening intently,
daring to disagree only with his eyes. It was when the men were
asked about the rebel group's reputation of raising money through
illegal drug deals that he spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Albanian people who live outside Kosovo and the Albanian
people who live inside Kosovo'' who finance the rebels, Krasniqi
said. ``It's not from drugs. It's people like me.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo he was trained as an engineer, but he said that in Pec
he was beaten up by Serbs five times and pulled in for questioning
more than 25 times. He finally left five years ago to start his
life over in Buchholz in a town in Germany, where he has become an
archeologist for the local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going there to fight because in this century we cannot
allow families to be deported like animals,'' he said. He said he
had spoken by telephone to people in Albania who were in touch with
Pec.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood I lived in does not exist any more,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after 9 p.m., the ferry docked at Durres. The 50
dutifully gathered their belongings and submitted to cursory
immigration checks aboard ship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, silently this time, they filed out onto the dock. The air
was cool and smelled of sea water. It had rained earlier, but now
the sky was clear and dark.
</P>
<P>
   They found nobody waiting for them at the dock.
</P>
<P>
   They made their own way to Tirana and disappeared into the city.

DESTRUCTION OF TRAIN WAS `UNCANNY ACCIDENT,' NATO COMMANDER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO warplane that destroyed a passenger train
crossing a bridge in Yugoslavia on Monday spotted the train after
it was too late to abort the attack, but circled back for a second
strike against the bridge, NATO's senior general said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the second pass, the jet struck at the oposite end of the
bridge, which by then ``was covered with smoke and clouds,'' said
the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``And at the last minute, again, in an uncanny accident, the
train had slid forward from the original impact,'' he said, ``and
parts of the train had moved across the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   A cockpit video of the second strike showed a missile headed
directly into the train, hitting it for the second time, and
damaging the tracks on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the initial strike on the train could not have been
avoided since the aircraft first fired long before the pilot
actually saw the train.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Clark's account at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, the aircraft attacked the bridge over the Juzna Morava
River near Grdelicaa second time, because the first missile had
struck the train and not the bridge itself.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has justified destroying bridges and roads in Yugoslavia,
saying a major objective of the air and missile strikes is to cut
off transportation links used to resupply Yugoslavia's military and
police forces in Kosovo. The Pentagon announced on Tuesday that 11
bridges had been destroyed so far in three weeks of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and other NATO officials declined to discuss the type of
aircraft or weapon involved in the attack, citing security for
future missions. However, officials here in Washington said the
aircraft was an American F-15E, firing a newly modified bomb known
as an AGM-130. And while Clark referred at several points to the
jet's pilot, the F-15E in fact has a crew of two, a pilot and a
weapons officer, who controls the bombs and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The AGM-130, which can be fired at a considerable distance from
its target, is initially guided by satellite. As it nears its
target, the pilot or, in the case of an F-15, the weapons officer,
can guide it the rest of the way using the video image, such as the
one shown at NATO's headquarters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the explanation offered on Tuesday, it was not clear why
the aircraft returned to strike the bridge again, knowing a train
was on it, since NATO's stated aim has been to avoid killing
civilians. ``He believed he still had to accomplish his mission,''
Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav authorities said the attack on the train killed at
least 10 people and seriously injured at least 16 others. The
authorities escorted journalists to the scene as part of an effort
to portray NATO's strikes as cruel and unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   Clark expressed regret for the strike and emphasized that NATO
was doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties. ``It's
one of those regrettable things that happen in a campaign like
this,'' he said, ``and we're all very sorry for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack underscored the impossibility of avoiding what
Pentagon officials euphemistically call ``collateral damage,'' even
when the vast majority of the bombs and missiles being used rely on
lasers, radars and satellites to guide them with remarkable
precision.
</P>
<P>
   By showing footage of the strikes, NATO clearly hoped to dispel
criticism that the attack on the train had been wanton. As the
first missile homed in on the bridge, the train entered into view
in what Clark called ``a flash of movement.'' The video ended
seconds later when the missile struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the train coming in,'' he said. ``And unfortunately, he
couldn't dump the bomb at that point. It was locked. It was going
into the target.''

   The brief incursion into Albania by Serb forces Tuesday is a
provocative and potentially explosive development.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the scale and duration of any repetition,
Milosevic's attempt to widen the Kosovo conflict could be his
wiliest bid yet to crack NATO's unity in the Balkan conflict. And
the alliance's response to this nose tweak from Belgrade and any
encore can help answer _ or, more ominously, deepen _ questions
about how well the NATO campaign against Milosevic was thought
through before it was begun.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-border incident drew predictable cries of outrage from
the alliance and the Clinton administration. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright promised ``serious consequences'' for such
behavior but did not detail her threat.
</P>
<P>
   Given Milosevic's history of testing and toying with Washington
and NATO, the Serbs' hour-long raid into Albania should not have
been unexpected. Also, his forces had been shelling the border
region for several days.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have begun to use Albania as a base of operations _
``like a big aircraft carrier,'' said one defense establishment
wag. The government in Tirana has all but handed over the keys to
enable NATO to use its nation for military and humanitarian
purposes. Also, the much-discussed and much-anticipated Apache
helicopters being dispatched by the Pentagon for close-in fighting
in Kosovo will operate from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   That could be an alluring target for the Serbs. As Maj. Gen.
Charles Wald, a planning chief for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made
plain at the Pentagon briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just helicopters that are going,'' Wald said.
``There's a force protection package ... fighting vehicles and
infantry folks.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be almost unreasonable to expect Milosevic, who seems
to have an exquisite appreciation of Old Testament justice, to
overlook this point. And NATO will be lucky if the raid Tuesday is
a one-of-a-kind.
</P>
<P>
   That the daylight incursion could be the first of many is a
sobering point for NATO planners to ponder _ on several levels.
</P>
<P>
   First, the allies have promised Albania, as well as Macedonia,
protection from Serb aggression. And they repeated it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, we've conveyed some very strong messages to the
neighboring states,'' State Department spokesman James Foley said,
pointing out that NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana ``has made
clear that the security, the territorial inviolability of the
neighboring states, are of direct and material concern to the
alliance, and that the alliance will react if there are attacks on
those territories, particularly in conjunction with the presence of
NATO forces on those territories.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point the Albanians would have the right to ask NATO to
make good on the pledge. That would add to the planning and
logistical headaches that already exist in Brussels, Belgium, the
NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   If it's just border protection, that's difficult on any
long-term basis from the air. And it's no snap from the ground, as
the three U.S. servicemen being held captive in Serbia found out
one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And if there are engagements between NATO and Serb forces along
the border, it soon becomes a ground war, no matter how briefers on
either side try to dress it up.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the second problem for NATO. The polls in the
United States and western Europe showing that qualified support for
using ground forces against Milosevic would almost certainly wilt
if the casualty reports shot up.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties, in turn, would almost certainly lead to new
challenges to NATO unity.
</P>
<P>
   Foley addressed the point in attempting to assess Milosevic's
motivation for the Albanian incursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clearly Belgrade is fishing around trying to create
diversions, trying to in some way knock the allies off their
evident and united track to confront his aggression,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley added that ``none of these ploys have succeeded thus far,
and none are going to.'' His forecast: ``Total unity and
determination to continue this campaign through to success.''
</P>
<P>
   And that will be the answer until the coalition cracks and he
has to come up with some alternative spin.
</P>
<P>
   All this attention is very strange for Albania, the poorest
nation in Europe with an estimated per capita income of $830 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the height of the Cold War, it was barely an asterisk in
anyone's geopolitical equation. Stalinist strongman Enver Hoxha
closed his nation, which is about the size of Maryland, to the West
(and practically everyone else), but no one really missed it. From
1946, when an American mission was basically kicked out, until 1990
there was no direct diplomatic contact.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a U.S. ``aircraft carrier.''

   SEATTLE _ What the Ezzos say:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two related dangers that threaten successful
parenting. The first is not rightly understanding the significance
of the husband-wife relationship in the parenting process, and the
second is the danger of child-centered parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your choice in parenting philosophy will actually determine
your child's hunger patterns, sleep patterns and even his or her
basic disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...Consider mealtime an opportunity to teach basic skills. For
example, instruct your baby daughter in the appropriate use of her
hands and her voice, and begin to teach her early table manners....
If you have to, hold your baby's hands away from her food. Even
better, teach her where to place her hands while being fed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teach the child to obey according to the character of true
obedience _ immediately, completely, without challenge and without
complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If soiling continues to be a problem with a child who is over
two-and-a-half years of age, hold the child accountable for his or
her accidents. By that, we mean the child should clean up himself
or herself, plus the soiled clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   -From ``On Becoming Babywise'' and ``On Becoming Babywise Book
Two'' by Gary Ezzo and Dr. Robert Bucknam.
</P>
<P>
   What Penelope Leach Says:
</P>
<P>
   ``...Taking a baby's point of view does not mean neglecting the
viewpoint of parents or other caring adults, because they are
inextricably intertwined.... Raising children is hard work.... For
almost everyone it means making compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New babies sleep exactly the amount that their personal
physiology tells them to sleep. There is nothing that you can do to
make your baby sleep more than this amount and nothing that the
baby can do to sleep less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems over an older baby's or toddler's eating often
dominate the lives of whole families for months on end. You can do
a great deal to avoid them by cultivating relaxed and accepting
attitudes now.... Expect a mess and arrange to cope with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smacking children can't teach them how to behave and the proof
is that once a child starts to be punished that way, he'll get
smacked all through childhood. In fact, it's because physical
punishments are so ineffective that they tend to escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to force the child to sit on the potty, even if you
can see that she is about to have a bowel movement.... The clearer
you make it that you really want her to sit there, the less likely
she is to want to.... Above all don't imply that use of the potty
is a moral issue.''

CONGRESIONAL LEADERS WORK TO AVOID VOTE ON GROUND TROOPS IN
BALKANS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: please note change in byline) 
 (ac) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With some members of Congress pushing for ground
troops in the Balkans and others adamantly opposed to such a
deployment, congressional leaders worked Tuesday to head off any
vote this week that would showcase divisions and undercut the
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a two-and-a-half hour session at the White House
for 58 members of Congress, President Clinton and his national
security team mounted a concerted effort Tuesday to rally Congress
behind an intensified air campaign. ``Now we are taking our allied
air campaign to the next level, with more aircraft in the region,''
the president said after the session.
</P>
<P>
   An array of senior officials, including Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, Defense Secretary William Cohen, Gen.
Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state, went from party
caucus to party caucus on both sides of the Capitol, arguing that
the bombing campaign should be given more time to work. Time and
again they argued that of the 18 days that the air camapign had
been waged, only eight of those days had had clear weather.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said that for the most part both parties were rallying
around the air campaign, but they described a sharp division in
Congress over how extensive a military commitment the United States
should make if the air strikes do not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   After the White House meeting, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called
for accelerated planning and preparation for the deployment of
ground troops in Kosovo. ``Nothing should be off the table,'' he
said. ``We should be committed to use whatever is necessary to
achieve the goal, and nothing short of achieving the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential hopeful said in
a speech that NATO had to begin ``fighting this war as if it were a
war with huge stakes involved, instead of some strange interlude
between peace initiatives.'' He said, ``To that end we should
commence today to mobilize infantry and armored divisions for a
ground war in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the political spectrum, Rep. Tom Campbell, a
California Republican, pressed ahead with plans to force a vote on
the war under the 1973 War Powers resolution, introducing two
measures calling for the withdrawal of American troops from the
region or, alternatively, a declaration of war. ``We are presently
at war and it is an unconstitutional war,'' he said. Under House
rules, the resolutions would come to a vote no later than early
May.
</P>
<P>
   Both Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Tom Daschle,
the Senate minority leader, said that if the president were to
commit American ground troops in the Balkans, they would want to
see a vote first in Congress. But they insisted such discussion was
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will come a time when we will be better able to assess
whether other actions are necessary,'' Daschle said. ``This is not
that time.'' Lott said, ''I don't think we ought to speculate on
ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders quickly took up an offer by Cohen to send a
high-level congressional delegation to the Balkans this weekend to
see the situation first-hand.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders and their aides said that any significant
vote on Congress would be delayed until next week at the earliest
when Congress could take up an emergency request from the
adminstration to pay for the operation through the end of the
fiscal year on Sept. 30 _ a time frame that suggested a prolonged
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Tuesday Republicans leaders trod a careful line,
noting that they had past misgivings about the Clinton
administration's policy in the Balkans, but would support it now
that the air campaign was underway. Recalling that he had voted in
March against the bombing campaign, Lott said, ``I've always had my
doubts about how this was going to go. But that is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said, ``Once our
people are engaged in an action, it is time, in my estimation, to
cease any debate about whether or not that action should or should
not have been undertaken, give our full support to that and expect
that it be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But some rank-and file members were more clealy concerned about
the scope of the commitment. ``No one seems to know how long we're
going to have to bomb or whether we're ever going to be able to
stop bombing,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress said that Clinton and his national security
team insisted to them that the air campaign would continue for
weeks and months if necessary. ``I am impressed with the
forcefulness with which they present their belief that this is
working,'' Armey said, ``and therefore they anticipate no need to
insert ground troops. They do not rule it out, but they are clear
that they do not believe it is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said he still needed time to
assess the mood of his caucus before making decisions about any
votes on the Kosovo deployment. And in the Senate, Republicans said
that there was sharp criticism of the administration policy in a
closed-door Republican caucus. But Lott, they said, urged
Republicans to temper their criticism of the Administration for now
and not push for any immediate votes on ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very concerned and every possible viewpoint is
being expressed,'' said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican.
Noting that the air strikes had not forced Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to negotiate, as had first been expected, she
said, ``The president's official goals have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   At a caucus of House Democrats too, lawmakers said there were
sharp divisions over ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Porter Goss, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said
the briefings from President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers
and the assessments he had received from the military and the
Central Intelligence Agency left him thinking no one knows whether
Milosevic will break under the pressure and that it was
``impossible to predict at this point'' how long the war will take.

DUCKS FACE TOUGH ROAD TO PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When it comes to clinching the fifth seed in
the Western Conference, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks are so near, yet
so far.
</P>
<P>
   If the Ducks can beat sixth-place St. Louis tonight at the Pond
and follow that up with a victory over the Kings at the Forum on
Thursday that would assure them a first-round playoff match up
against Phoenix, thus avoiding longtime nemsis Detroit. The Ducks
finished 3-1-2 against the Coyotes this season and defeated Phoenix
in the first round of the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the two wins don't figure to come easy. Center Steve Rucchin
is not expected to play in either game due to a lingering groin
injury and the availibility of defenseman Jason Marshall is very
much up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was checked head-first into the boards by Phoenix's
Dallas Drake on Sunday and will miss tonight's game for sure. After
that nobody really knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about injuries this time of year, Anaheim coach
Craig Hartsburg said after practice Tuesday. ``We will keep it our
business ... we don't need everybody to know our business. I don't
think other teams are going to talk a lot about injuries this time
of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to suck it up and get the job done. We've played
without Rucchin, (Teemu) Selanne and (Tomas) Sandstrom this year.
</P>
<P>
   With Pascal Trepanier, gone for the season due to torn ACL,
Hartsburg will look to little-used Dan Trebil to pick up that slack
against a Blues offense that's led by the unheralded Pavol Demitra
(36 goals, 86 points), Pierre Turgeon (31 goals) and Norris Trophy
front-runner Al MacInnis.
</P>
<P>
   Trebil has 53 games of NHL experience, but only three this
season, having spent most of the year in the minors after being
injured in training camp. He hasn't played since March 21.
</P>
<P>
   But Trebil, who did play in nine playoff games with the Ducks
back in 1997, said he's not nervous about playing in the team's
biggest game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the games have been so big lately, each game has been
the biggest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   None bigger than this one, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who currently lead St. Louis by a point, certainly
don't want to fall a point behind the Blues with only two games to
play. They would then need help from the Coyotes or Kings, against
whom the Blues finish the season, and Anaheim's season finale
against San Jose on Saturday could be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come down to one game, said Rucchin, who will only be
able to root his teammates on from the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't playing our best as a team, he said, referring to
the Ducks' recent four-game winless streak. ``But the 3-0 win over
Phoenix was impressive. There's nothing better than coming off a
big victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Rucchin's coach continues to try and downplay the importance
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game, but we've said all along we don't care who we
play, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg insists the team can't get caught up looking for a
certain matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start thinking like that, that's when you are going
to get burned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt Anaheim, which is just a point away from
clinching sixth, would prefer to avoid the re-tooled Red Wings for
as long as possible. The Ducks were 1-3 versus Detroit this season
and are 4-15-5 against the Red Wings in franchise history, not
including the Detroit's four-game sweep in the second round of the
'97 playoffs.

NATO AND PENTAGON MORE FORTHCOMING WITH PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After refusing for more than two weeks to share
detailed information about the progress of Western airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, NATO and the Pentagon have begun slowly to open
the spigot of information.
</P>
<P>
   At its daily briefing, the Pentagon provided its first detailed
account since the bombing campaign began on March 24 of the total
number and types of targets destroyed by NATO warplanes and cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Gen. Wesley Clark,
the supreme commander of the alliance, gave reporters his first
comprehensive assessment of the progress of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, its chief spokesman, said:
``What you're seeing is both NATO and the Pentagon are becoming
more open. Basically as we've become more comfortable with the
operation, as we've realized what we can do and cannot do, we've
been more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the decision to release more information was
prompted in part by the realization that Yugoslav forces now
understand the tempo and tactics of the attacks. ``The Yugoslavs
have had three weeks to see what we're doing and the pattern of the
operation,'' he said. ``So it doesn't make a lot of sense to hold
off on the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he had ordered information withheld in the earlier
briefings because ``I wanted to be sure we had flexibility in our
operations _ that I understood exactly what was required to be
protected in order to protect the air crews.''
</P>
<P>
   News organizations had complained that at the early briefings by
NATO and the Pentagon, officials refused to say exactly how many
attack missions had been made against Yugoslav forces, how many of
the missions had been completed, how many bombs had been dropped or
what, precisely, they had hit.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at several news organizations, including The New York
Times, have formally protested to the Defense Department over the
restrictions on information.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's briefings in Brussels and Washington, military
spokesmen provided totals of the number and types of large targets
hit _ including 11 fuel-storage installations, 11 bridges and four
ammunition storage sites _ and a map to identify their location in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO, reporters on Tuesday were shown video clips of some of
the attacks carried out this week, including one on a Yugoslav
bridge in which 10 civilians on a train were reportedly killed.

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji swept into New York
on Tuesday, shunning all ceremony to focus on the thing that makes
his pulse race: capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nearing the end of a nine-day tour of America, Zhu barely budged
from his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria, where he entertained top
corporate executives, local political leaders and diplomats for
nearly eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu seems never to tire of courting Corporate America. He spent
most of his day lobbying for more investment and urging businessmen
to support China's drive to join the regulatory body for world
trade, people who met with him said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a tribute to New York's status as the world's leading
financial center, he pushed a button to start trading on the Nasdaq
stock market, the electronic network of brokers that has become the
largest stock market in the world. Zhu then presented Nasdaq
officials with a gift, a red wooden bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always bull market,'' said Zhu in English.
</P>
<P>
   But he had little else to say during his quick tour of Nasdaq's
Wall Street site and seemed eager to slip back to his hotel. There,
his advance team lined up a formidable meeting schedule with almost
40 chief executives, including a breakfast for media elites and a
lunch with insurance and banking leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a tremendous number of business leaders who
know him,'' said Robert Hormats, a managing director at Goldman,
Sachs who joined the prime minister for a detailed discussion of
Chinese financial reforms at lunch. ``Most of these people had not
just met him once, but multiple times. He makes a point of keeping
in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Zhu was feted at a dinner sponsored by the
Economic Club, where he spoke at length on his desire to make China
a member of the World Trade Organization. The drive to join the
group that sets the rules for global commerce has been Zhu's
preoccupation during his six-city tour of America, and he has had
nary a meeting or public engagement during which he does not speak
on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister told media guests Tuesday morning that he had
listened to protesters on the street below his hotel room Monday
night, shortly after his arrival in the city. But the
demonstrators, most of them calling for the independence of Tibet,
had dwindled by mid-day Tuesday, outnumbered by uniformed police
officers around the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, perhaps the bigger story was that urbane and jocular
Zhu, who ranks third in China's Communist Party hierarchy, seems to
incite less animosity toward China than his boss, the often
reserved President Jiang Zemin. The two have embraced in an awkward
political dance since they were the top officials in Shanghai in
the late 1980s. At that time and more recently, after the two moved
to Beijing to take the top posts in the central government, Zhu
served Jiang loyally even though Chinese and foreigners like him
much better than they do his boss.
</P>
<P>
   When Jiang visited New York in 1997, Gov. George Pataki and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani avoided him, generating headlines. Pataki
might also have snubbed a Chinese leader this time, as well. Just
one month ago, under an executive proclamation from the governor's
office, New York celebrated ``Tibet National Day'' in honor of the
state's official support of Tibetans ``in their fight for freedom,
independence and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pataki accepted Zhu's invitation to make a courtesy
call at the Waldorf. They held a wide ranging discussion on human
rights and trade. Pataki said he gave the prime minister a letter
urging the release of 100 people still imprisoned for their roles
in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki declined to discuss the reasons why he was willing to
meet one Chinese leader and not his superior. But he reflected the
views of many American politicians, scholars and even a few exiled
Chinese dissidents when he said that he sees Zhu as someone who can
help change China. (Business executives also like Zhu, but they are
eager to court Jiang as well).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been a strong advocate of an open economy, but
also the rule of law and human rights,'' said Pataki after his
mid-day meeting. ``This is something we want to encourage.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Students for a Free Tibet, who protested outside the
Waldorf, said they were surprised that Pataki chose to meet with
Zhu after the Jiang snub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect there was a lot of pressure for the governor to
meet with Zhu _ from other Republicans and from the governors of
other states that Zhu has visited,'' said John Hocevar, executive
director of the student's group.
</P>
<P>
   Sonam Zoksang, a Tibetan-American photographer who was among the
two dozen protesters at the hotel, said he had no problem with
Pataki meeting with Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's important to engage, but we also have to let
them know very clearly that what's happening inside Tibet needs to
be addressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least in public, Zhu allows no discrepancies between his
position and Jiang's on human rights and Tibet. In fact, the prime
minister seems less willing to engage in serious discussion of that
topic than Jiang, who debated human rights, Tibet and Taiwan at
length with President Clinton during a state visit to the United
States visit and during Clinton's reciprocal visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu's relentless focus on economics shields him from the
criticism often directed at Jiang and the No. 2 man in the Chinese
political system, National People's Congress Chairman Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's day began with a a breakfast hosted by Time Warner
chairman Gerald Levin, and the guest list included executives from
The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, CBS, CNN, The Associated Press
and The New York Times. The prime minister mostly fielded
questions, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu pointed out to the executives that the United States had
committed itself to reach an agreement in 1999 on China's
membership in the World Trade Organization. He said the agreement
was ``99 percent'' complete.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed concern that if the two sides do not conclude
their talks shortly, they could lose the chance, because the rules
for entry to the trade group will change in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have an agreement by October, or 13 years are out the
window and we have to start again,'' Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   Around a horseshoe-shaped table over lunch, Zhu briefed the top
executives from Merrill Lynch, Chase Manhattan, Chubb, AIG and
other banks, brokerage and insurance companies on his efforts to
remake China's financial system. He detailed some banking reforms,
including an initiative to reform the central bank along the lines
of America's Federal Reserve, people who attended said.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also warned bankers that they should not count on government
bailouts when they make loans to companies that cannot repay them.
That has been a pressing concern for foreign bankers in China since
the collapse of Guangdong International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., a
major investment company that defaulted on its debt late last year
despite close ties to the Guangdong provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do your homework,'' Zhu cautioned, according to one person
there. He said, however, that he did not foresee any similar credit
troubles coming.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister is scheduled to leave New York on Wednesday
for a stop in Boston before continuing on to Canada.

STENKOVAC ,  Macedonia: ... were burned.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next day, two adjacent villages located roughly five miles
southeast of Urosevac were attacked by paramilitary forces,
according to refugees. Sami Tahiri, a 61-year-old retired teacher,
said regular Yugoslav Army soldiers first came to his village,
Sojeve, and warned the 230 families over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Tuesday, Serbian paramilitary soldiers in black masks
roared into the village in jeeps. Most of the villagers fled into
the hills, but two young men were captured, an Albanian and a
Muslim who had fled the war in Bosnia. Both were killed, he said,
and an elderly couple were burned alive in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who stayed were killed,'' Tahiri said.
</P>
<P>
   As ethnic Albanians watched from surrounding hills, the
paramilitary forces torched two-thirds of the homes in the village,
he said. Houses in the nearby village of Terstenik were also
torched.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Serb forces shelled the Albanian village
of Preshtina, which lies roughly five miles in the opposite
direction of Urosevac, to the West. Jonuz Bytyqi, a high school
teacher from Urosevac who had fled to the area after NATO bombing
began, said he woke to the sound of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Six shells, he said, impacted in Preshtina, injuring no one. But
30 shells fired on the adjacent village of Zaskok killed at least
four people. Residents of both villages fled immediately after the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the shells hit a tractor near where I was,'' Bytyqi
said. ``I couldn't sleep at all after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, refugees said that Serb paramilitary units
carried out a separate attack on Varosh, an Albanian village on the
main road three miles south of Urosevac. Zeqir, who was sleeping in
a nearby field after fleeing the earlier attack on his own village,
said one young man who refused to leave his home was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the pattern of attacks on Thursday, Serb forces
shelled and then burned Zlatar, an Albanian village seven miles
west of Urosevac, according to Lulzim Shala, a refugee who fled the
village with his wife and two young daughters. It was the attack
farthest away from the city, according to the refugees from the
area who arrived here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shala said he and his family then fled to a nearby village,
Mirosale. That was attacked over the weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters' access to Kosovo is limited by the Yugoslav
government, so the accounts of the attacks could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   All of the refugees said they ended up fleeing to Urosevac after
the attacks, and believe they were intentionally driven into the
town. They said thousands of other Albanians are hiding in Urosevac
and the surrounding hills and running out of food.
</P>
<P>
   In a surreal end to their cat-and-mouse game with Serb forces,
the refugees said they were allowed to simply buy a $20 train
ticket in Urosevac Monday morning and ride in a packed train to the
border, they said.
</P>
<P>
   With many Serbian-run stores in Urosevac refusing to sell food
to Albanians and paramilitary forces randomly looting houses and
beating ethnic Albanians, the refugees decided the time had come to
flee with their families. They predicted thousands more would
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot stand it psychologically,'' said Bytyqi, the high
school teacher. ``For 21 days, I never knew what was going to
happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised myself I would not leave,'' he said. ``But my
daughter lost ten pounds from the tension and I have two sons. I
came here for them.''

 Venture catalysts provide advice, money to small startups
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A new breed of startup consultant and investor has sprung up in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dispensing cash, these so-called venture
catalysts provide plenty of advice to help entrepreneurs hone their
strategies, develop their markets and recruit management talent.
</P>
<P>
   While most big-name venture capital firms put a partner on the
board of companies they invest in and allocate maybe a day a month
for hand holding, partners of catalyst firms invest much more of
their time.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Comaford, founder of Artemis Ventures in Sausalito,
says she spends as much as a week per month helping an individual
business software or e-commerce client build its enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The venture catalyst firms have been a godsend to startups
ranging from Vanishing Point, which specializes in long-term hair
removal and other nonsurgical skin treatments, to Again
Technologies, a vendor of financial software.
</P>
<P>
   Like wealthy individual investors who are often dubbed angels,
venture catalyst companies are filling a niche vacated by some of
the more established venture firms.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by a record number of business plans and needy
entrepreneurs, the big VCs increasingly are investing larger
amounts in later-stage companies to avoid stretching their
partners' time and talents too thin.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves room for venture catalysts to provide $500,000 of
``seed capital'' in most cases to nurture startups until they are
ready to graduate to the next investment round.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lea Reed, editor of the Venture Capital Journal,
compares smaller VC investor/consultants and the growing number of
angel investor networks to ``preparatory schools'' that get
entrepreneurs ready for bigger institutions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 high-tech business plans are submitted to U.S.
venture capitalists a year, but less than 3 percent obtain
financing, according to Artemis Ventures. In most cases, that's
because the entrepreneurs don't have the right connections with the
right VCs and they don't present their plans in the best way.
</P>
<P>
   One Artemis client that realized it needed a helping hand is
Again Technologies. The San Mateo company was started in 1995 by
former Gap information systems executive Gopi Mattel and Visa
systems administration director Yelbert Yamaki to develop software
to help companies track and pay sales incentives and other variable
commissions and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   With less than $100,000 of their own money and the help of
software engineers enlisted by Mattel's brother in India, the
founders bootstrapped their way to $500,000 in sales last year and
signed some big-name customers like Clorox and Southern California
Edison.
</P>
<P>
   But Yamaki said, ``It was hard running a business and looking
for capital at the same time.'' In addition, he acknowledged that
he and Mattel know a lot about variable compensation but
comparatively little about marketing and raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Again Technologies was introduced to Artemis in September at a
Center for Software Development showcase in San Jose, where
entrepreneurs were presented to potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Artemis has committed $500,000 to the company and
helped it refine its business and marketing strategy, attract board
members and introduce it to other venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   Like other VC firms, Artemis' help does not come cheap. In
addition to taking a hefty chunk of stock in the companies it
counsels, it has charged a monthly retainer.
</P>
<P>
   But Yamaki is pleased with the results. ``Ending up with a
smaller portion of a large company is better than a large portion
of a small company,'' he said. ``Artemis has helped with our
business plan, changing it from a strategic operations document to
something geared to investors as well. And they are
well-networked.''
</P>
<P>
   Comaford may seem an unlikely Henry Higgins, who turns
unpolished businesses into financial fair ladies. She dropped out
of high school in Los Angeles at 16 and ran off to New York, where
she modeled lingerie for Bloomingdale's. She later attended
college, where she first aspired to become a Shakespearean scholar
but then became enraptured by BASIC programing language and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   After writing some accounting software for Domino's Pizza,
Comaford went to work for Microsoft. Then she started a contract
programming company and took more than 30 Microsoft employees with
her.
</P>
<P>
   She helped start four other companies including San Francisco's
Planet U, an online consumer promotions company that expects to go
public in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Comaford started Artemis Ventures (named after the
mythological Greek huntress) to help build multiple companies at
the same time. ``After being a serial entrepreneur,'' said the
hyper-energetic Comaford, ``I decided I wanted to be a parallel
entrepreneur working on several companies at once; the only way to
do that is to create a venture capital company and finance
companies as you build them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Comaford has raised $15 million from ``high
net-worth individuals'' for her $20 million venture fund and has
invested in a handful of business-to-business software companies.
These include ELetter, a San Jose online mailing service for
business, which like Again Technologies hired Artemis to refine its
strategy, find directors and advisers and prepare it for the big
investment leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Venture Strategy Partners of San Francisco is another venture
catalyst firm that focuses on consulting. The $25 million fund is
an outgrowth of Venture Strategy Group, which began in 1996
advising companies across various industries on how to build their
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, it has seeded a handful of startups with about
$500,000 each. These include Flooz.com, a new e-commerce site
started by iVillage co-founder Robert Levitan that lets users
e-mail personal greeting cards with an online gift certificate;
A.G. Ferrari, an Italian-style foods emporium; and Vanishing Point,
which has taken laser hair removal, nonsurgical cellulite reduction
and wrinkle removal out of the doctor's office and into boutiques
staffed by nurse practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing Point has two ``studios'' in San Francisco. The
company was started by Melisse Shaban, who previously managed 220
Body Shop stores and then built and sold the Aveda beauty products
company to Estee Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her experience, Shaban said Venture Strategy's services
have been essential. ``They've helped build our brand by
interpreting demographic data and conducting exit interviews with
consumers,'' said Shaban. Venture Strategy General Partner Joanna
Rees Gallanter ``is an integral part of our board and an extension
of our management team.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing Point is based in Raleigh, N.C., but it opened its
first shops in New York, San Francisco and Miami, where Shaban said
there are good populations of target customers. They include
``wealthy, educated, self-indulgent consumers who buy branded goods
and who are interested in healthy living and are driven by the
desire to improve their personal appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing Point's shop on 18th Street near Castro specializes in
long-term hair removal (six to 12 months) using two $100,000
medical laser devices. The cost per treatment, whether beard, back
or bikini line, is about $80 for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Vanishing Point's second store, which just opened on Fillmore
Street near Lombard, offers additional services for a similar price
with doctors on call in case of a problem. Treatments include or
will include a ``micro peel'' to exfoliate and improve the skin and
therapeutic cellulite massage to break down the tissue walls that
trap fat.
</P>
<P>
   An affiliated doctor also will come in to treat varicose veins
and inject collagen and Botox (a diluted strain of botulism) to
eradicate wrinkles and furrows in the brow, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Strategy Partners and other investors, Shaban
hopes Vanishing point will grow from five to 120 locations within
five years.

 Big Cisco Push Into Internet Phones
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Cisco Systems Inc. accelerated its push into the Internet phone
market yesterday with a $2 billion deal to buy GeoTel
Communications, a Massachusetts telecommunications company that
helps businesses route incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose networking giant said the purchase will help it
offer consumers a way to surf the Web and talk to a company's
customer service staff at the same time. Cisco said it will use
GeoTel's software to create products that let Web surfers click on
an icon and connect to a live call center operator.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco will exchange 0.5138 shares of Cisco common stock for each
share of GeoTel. The deal values GeoTel at $60.50 a share _ a 37
percent premium over GeoTel's closing price of $44.25 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel's technology is important for Cisco, which is in a race
with Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks to provide gear
for phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications providers are migrating to Internet-based
networks that can carry voice, video and data simultaneously. Cisco
wants to be able to offer those companies the same value-added
services they enjoy on traditional networks _ such as routing
incoming calls from customers who are on hold to an available
operator. Buying GeoTel will help Cisco gain that technology,
industry watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   But a $2 billion price tag for GeoTel, which had only $45
million in revenue last year and after-tax income of $9 million,
surprised several industry watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that the purchase may have a specific purpose _
to help Cisco on its contract with Sprint Corp. Cisco is developing
core technology for Sprint's Integrated-on-Demand Network _ a huge
project that will allow the long-distance giant to carry voice,
video and data over a single network. GeoTel also has a strong
relationship with Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most logical explanation for the size of the deal may be
significant pressure from key customers,'' said Hilary Mine,
executive vice president of Probe Research in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Sprint announced it would deploy GeoTel's call
routing technology as part of its new Internet-based network. Mine
said that partnership may be why Cisco agreed to pay such a hefty
sum for GeoTel.
</P>
<P>
   This is Cisco's largest purchase since it bought StrataCom Inc.
for $4.5 billion in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ammar Hanafi, a director in Cisco's business development
division, said Cisco paid $2 billion for GeoTel because the company
has strong growth, often beating Wall Street estimates by 20 to 40
percent, and is a leader in its field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we paid a very fair price for a company in this
marketplace,'' Hanafi said. He said the overlapping customer base
also helped cinch the deal, but would not comment on whether the
Sprint ION project played a significant part.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the price tag reflects the increasing
competition in the data networking field and Cisco's need for
specific technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at GeoTel, this is a real company with real
products,'' said Michael Cristinziano, an analyst at Gerard Klauer
Mattison &AMP; Co. in New York. ``If you get this into the hands of
Cisco, it becomes another weapon in their arsenal to compete with
Lucent.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristinziano said the purchase will help Cisco grab a share of
e-commerce by offering Internet call centers _ which exist today,
but are expected to become ubiquitous as more companies sell
products online.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at a Web commerce site, you want to buy something, but
you can't find the answer to a question. You click on a button and
a window opens and you're talking to a live attendant at a call
center,'' Cristinziano said. ``This is an area to attack. ... Cisco
can afford to pay $2 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition comes on the heels of two other
telecommunications purchases. Last week, Cisco agreed to buy Fibex
Systems and Sentient Networks Inc. for a total of $445 million in
stock to get products that add voice services to data networks.
</P>
<P>
   GeoTel jumped $11.69 to $55.94 yesterday. Cisco fell $3.63 to
$114.13.

STARR TO TESTIFY AGAINST EXTENTION OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, who came to embody the independent
counsel law as he pursued a variety of allegations about President
Clinton for almost five years, now says he believes that the nation
would be better off if the law is allowed to expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute should not be reauthorized,'' Starr has written
bluntly in testimony prepared for delivery on Wednesday. The Senate
Committee on Government Affairs is considering what to do about the
law that provides for the appointment of independent counsels like
Starr and which is set to expire at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Starr argues, the authority to investigate politically
sensitive cases involving senior administration officials should be
returned to the Justice Department and the attorney general _ with
Congress and the press keeping watch.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argues in his testimony that the law has many serious
flaws and, most importantly, has not achieved its main purpose,
which is to provide the public with a sense that investigations of
figures like the president are free from partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his own experience, Starr laments how his
investigation was criticized as too partisan, that he was portrayed
as a Republican out to get a Democratic president and that the
public did not, in the end, have great confidence in what he was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assaults took a toll,'' he said. ``A duly authorized
federal law-enforcement investigation came to be characterized as
yet another political game. Law became politics by other means.''
As a result, he said, ``the statutory mechanism intended to enhance
confidence in law enforcement thus had the effect of weakening
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was enacted in the aftermath of the
Watergate scandal, which produced a wide consensus that the
nation's chief law-enforcement officer, the attorney general, had
an inherent conflict in investigating the president or fellow
Cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr argues that the opposite has occurred. Rather than
assuring that the investigation is not too soft because it is
conducted by a political associate, independent counsels may be
criticized as overly eager to successfully prosecute someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Independent Counsel is vulnerable to partisan
attack, the investigation is likely to be seen as political,''
Starr says in his testimony. Starr has been ferociously criticized
by supporters of Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Starr has also faced widespread criticism from
those who argued that his efforts were not partisan but were,
nonetheless, ill-considered and frequently lacking any sense of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's statement is defensive as well over the criticism of the
expanding scope of his investigation, which began with questions
about Whitewater, a land deal in Arkansas in which the Clintons had
invested before they came to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's inquiry eventually included such unconnected topics as
the firing of employees in the White House travel office, the
improper collection of confidential FBI files on some Republicans
in the Clinton White House and most famously, the president's
intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Each time, Starr
received an expansion of his original jurisdiction, which had been
to investigate only the Whitewater matter.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Starr says that, ``the number of expansions is
unique and it may have fed the misconception that we were
investigating individuals rather than crime. Let me make clear:
that was not the case.'' He argues in his statement that he did not
seek to investigate some of those subjects but had them pressed on
him by the Justice Department. But investigating Ms. Lewinsky's
relations with the president, the area that attracted the greatest
criticism, was something Starr had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also criticizes the independent counsel statute, which he
said obliged him to report to Congress any offenses by the
president that might have been worthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's referral to Congress charged that Clinton committed
several impeachable offenses, including perjury and obstruction of
justice. The report led to a months-long ordeal during which the
House voted to impeach the president, but the Senate voted to
acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr's critics, his investigation of the Lewinsky matter
and his advocacy of impeachment were the principal examples of his
excessive zeal. Professor Sam Dash of the Georgetown University Law
School, who was counsel to the Watergate Committee in 1974 and had
been hired by Starr as a special ethics adviser, resigned saying
that Starr had overstepped his bounds as prosecutor by becoming an
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared testimony, Starr defends himself, saying that
the statute compelled him to offer a detailed explanation of the
president's alleged offenses. ``We could have shipped the raw
evidence with nothing more last fall,'' he said. But he said he
believed he had to bring some ``order and coherence to the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that, ``The law required us to decide whether particular
presidential acts might be impeachable and we believed that we
ought to share our reasoning, at least to the extent of explaining
how the evidence comported with the elements of particular federal
felonies and with the apotheosis of impeachable misconduct, abuse
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But he adds that he believes the burden of asking a single
prosecutor to determine whether a president should be impeached is
too great, and it inevitably politicizes the independent counsel
further.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the likelihood that the statute will expire, the
Justice Department has drafted tentative modifications to
guidelines on how it would resume investigations that used to be
given to special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee, Dennis
J. Burke, the acting assistant attorney general, said that under
the draft rules, it would be easier for the attorney general to
name special counsels to investigate matters which might present
conflicts. The attorney general has that authority now but it has
been used infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel statute, the attorney general
determines if such a conflict might exist and then a panel of three
federal judges selects the prosecutor. Although Attorney General
Janet Reno was a vigorous supporter of renewing the statute in
1994, she now says the Justice Department opposes its renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Starr acknowledges that returning
politically-sensitive investigations to the Justice Department
poses risks. But he said that if investigations even by independent
counsels are going to be seen as political, the attorney general
should be at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If politicization and the loss of public confidence are
inevitable,'' he said, ``then we should leave the full
responsibility where our laws and tradition place it, on the
attorney general'' and, in the case of impeachment, the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starr urges in his testimony that if Congress renews the
statute, it should reject a common suggestion to limit the amount
of time an independent prosecutor may have to investigate. He said
that would only invite delay on the part of the targets of the
investigation.

WAR ESCALATES AS SERBS RAID VILLAGE IN ALBANIA 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday announced the
escalation of the air campaign in Yugoslavia as Serb forces made a
foray into Albania and NATO bombers continued to target strategic
sites, including the country's biggest oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with lawmakers, Clinton said that the sustained
bombing has weakened Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's war
effort, damaging refineries and ammunition plants while destroying
aircraft and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reduced his ability to move, sustain and supply the
war machine in Kosovo,'' Clinton said in remarks from the Rose
Garden. ``Now we are taking our allied air campaign to the next
level; with more aircraft in the region, with a British carrier
joining the USS Roosevelt and French carrier in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ``our humanitarian effort is also
increasing to meet the daunting challenge of providing food and
shelter for the hundreds of thousands of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton compared Milosevic's campaign to rid Kosovo of ethnic
Albanians to the genocide of the Jews and others in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that is was Holocaust Remembrance Day, the president
said: ``On this day, let us resolve not to let this `ethnic
cleansing' and killing by Mr. Milosevic go unanswered.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials have requested the use of 300 more U.S. aircraft,
and the Pentagon has said that more helicopters also may be added
to the air campaign. Twenty-four low flying Apache helicopters are
headed to Albania, where they are expected to be used for more
precise bombing of Serb ground operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said Tuesday he has
requested hundreds of new aircraft not only from the United States
but from other NATO countries to double the force attacking
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has more than 500 aircraft at its disposal. Those planes
have flown 5,924 sorties in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kevin Bacon said NATO bombers would ``fly
more intensively during both day and night hours ... and strike a
wide range of targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also said that the increased air campaign would involve
the call-up of military reserves, including pilots and army civil
affairs specialists who can work with local populations in Albania
and Macedonia, where many of the refugees from Kosovo are now
situated. At least 2,000 may be called, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain said it was sending 1,800 more soldiers to Macedonia and
Greece, where officials said they would be used as part of a
peacekeeping, not an invasion force. There are already 6,300
British troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO planned to step up its campaign against Yugoslavia,
it appeared that Serbs were also preparing to escalate their
military effort.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces threatened to dramatically expand the scope of the
military engagement when they pushed into northern Albania, fought
Albanian forces and briefly took control of a village.
</P>
<P>
   Albania's interior minister, Petro Koci, said that Serb troops
exchanged gunfire with Albanian border police before entering the
village of Kamenica. Serb troops had shelled the village for
several days before the incursion into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   While the Serb forces later retreated, U.S. officials condemned
the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made clear within NATO as well as the United States
specifically that widening of this conflict by the Serbs to other
countries in the region would have severe consequences,'' said
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was in Oslo, Norway,
meeting with Russia's foreign minister about the two nations'
differences over NATO's Yugoslav mission.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that despite the bad weather they have hit a
number of strategic targets, including Yugoslavia's largest oil
refinery, which they contend will choke off fuel supplies to the
military.
</P>
<P>
   But at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Clark was forced
to explain the bombing on Monday of a train filled with civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the pilot was assigned to destroy a railroad bridge
that is part of a communications supply network in Serbia. But
Clark said when the pilot realized that the bomb had targeted the
train rather than the bridge, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unfortunate incident which he (pilot) and the crew
and all of us very much regret. We certainly did not want to do
collateral damage,'' he said, referring to deaths of 10 civilians.
Despite the blasting of the train, NATO officials said that the air
campaign has weakened the Serb air defense system and its supply
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are becoming stronger and Milosevic is becoming weaker,''
said NATO spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   But Shea said that officials from member countries, who met
earlier this week, acknowledged that military campaign is far from
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of the foreign ministers yesterday is that it may be
a long haul and we have to be ready for it,'' Shea said.

 Column: Fish Processor Zapata Giving a Green Light to Its  Internet
Spin-Off 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The once derailed Internet spin-off of Zapata may be back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston holding company, founded by George Bush but no
longer controlled by the former president, grabbed national
headlines last year when it boldly announced that it, too, was
going to dive into the dot-com pool.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata's bid to buy a bunch of Web sites gave off a detectable
odor largely because the company's primary businesses were in the
nondigital worlds of fish processing and sausage casings.
</P>
<P>
   But the scent didn't throw all investors off the trail. Some
financial pundits took Zapata seriously because the company's core
assets were strong and its chief executive, Avie Glazer, was viewed
as a smart guy.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata zapped its designs on an Internet spin-off last summer
when the initial public offering market got weak in the knees. But
now, Zapata is taking another shot. Yesterday, the company filed
documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying it
plans to spin off its Internet subsidiary, Zap.com.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time is that Zapata is shunning Wall Street
bankers and underwriting the deal itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-written deals are sort of in no man's land, and very few
have worked,'' says Ben Holmes, president of IPOPros.com, an
independent research firm in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But ``who knows? They'll be the first to go from fish meal to
the digital world. I applaud them,'' Holmes says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, Zap.com ``plans to create an
advertising network and e-commerce platform by building a branded
network.'' The Zap.com Network would be linked by banner
advertisements displayed on Web sites owned and operated by third
parties.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Zap.com is a small fry. The operation currently
consists of a couple of Web magazine sites Zapata acquired from
Qwest Communications International in April 1998. The unit has 21
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no self-respecting Internet concern could be taken
seriously if it wasn't bleeding at least a little red ink. Zap.com
lost $148,000 during the 11-month period ended February 28 on zero
revenues. (The division was created last April, the filing stated.)
</P>
<P>
   The spin-off will be unconventional, which is par for the course
with Zapata. In fact, it will be a rights offering, where Zapata
shareholders will be given rights to buy Zap.com common stock at $8
a share. Zapata shareholders will have the right to buy a share of
Zap for each share of the parent they own.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata will invest $8 million in Zap.com in exchange for 10,000
super-voting preferred shares and 13.6 million rights to common
shares, which it will offer to holders of Zapata. Upon completion
of the offering, Zap.com will be a majority-owned subsidiary of
Zapata.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for those investors who would actually like to get their
hands on some of these somewhat gamey shares, you'll have to wait
until Zapata shareholders sell their Zap.com stock over the counter
on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata investors weren't thrilled with the filing, including an
announcement that three legal battles had been brought to an end.
The company stated that to pay the settlements, it plans to take a
pretax charge of about 14 cents a share during the first quarter.
Zapata shares, which trade on the Big Board, fell nearly $2 to
$10.38 in bumpy trading yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Viva Zapata!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FINAL THOUGHT: &LR;  Look out below. First, Dell dropped a bomb in
February, when it revealed slower-than-usual sales growth for its
personal computers. Then, Compaq launched a Scud on Friday, saying
its PC sales will be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, yesterday, Intel admonishes Wall Street to cool its
jets regarding expectations for its chip sales. And yet the
tech-sector is still supposed to be the engine driving this
high-flying market?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Internet bulls are saying that their darling Net
stocks are now at the throttle. And that's a sobering thought.

 Plans for Billion-Dollar `Ultimate' Internet
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Telecommunications giant Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC yesterday said it
will build a billion-dollar phone network in the United States that
will handle Internet and data traffic at blur-fast rates. The
network will be available in 60 metropolitan areas, including the
Bay Area, by the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The American subsidiary of the London company, Cable &AMP; Wireless
USA, announced it is now spending $670 million on 15,000 miles of
fiber-optic cabling for the as-yet-unnamed network, whose price tag
eventually will top $1 billion. When complete, the new network will
deliver voice, data and Internet services at speeds more than 10
times faster than the commercial Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating the ultimate Internet for consumers and
businesses,'' said Art Medici, senior vice president of marketing
at Cable &AMP; Wireless USA in Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The vast network eventually will be hooked up to Cable &AMP;
Wireless' global Internet network, with operations in Europe and
Asia. Cable &AMP; Wireless USA plans to make segments of the U.S.
network available as soon as they are ready. Half a dozen unnamed
cities are scheduled to be switched on in September.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for the network has not been finalized, Medici said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless _ which paid $1.75 billion for MCI
Communications Corp.'s Internet business last year _ is in the
midst of a five-year, $1 billion plan to construct a similar
high-speed network in Europe. The British company is already one of
the largest telecom companies in Asia through its majority stake in
Hong Kong Telecommunications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom rivals are scrambling to develop global phone services
using Internet-based technology to cash in on an online boom. The
number of Internet users is expected to double, to 300 million, by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Among the competitors creating worldwide networks:
</P>
<P>
   _AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC said they will
join forces to sell global phone services to multinational
companies using Internet-based technology.
</P>
<P>
   _Internet2, a coalition of 130 universities and high-tech
companies, in February flipped the switch on a key segment of its
private research network that connects 70 college campuses. The
3-year-old nonprofit organization includes the University of
California at Berkeley and Stanford University, as well as
corporate sponsors Cisco Systems, IBM and Qwest Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-mile Internet2 network is up to 45,000 times faster
than the commercial Web, but it is not available to the public.
Only researchers and employees at the colleges and corporate
sponsors can use it. Consumers eventually will be able to use
cutting-edge applications created on Internet2 but only after they
have been developed and sold by Internet2 members for commercial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   _Project Oxygen ( &LR; www.oxygen.org &LR; ) _ a $10 billion commercial
venture that hopes to leapfrog the nonprofit Internet2 _ would pump
video, sound and data at speeds up to 5.5 million times faster than
the Web to users in 78 countries. The underwater network of
fiber-optic cables will traverse the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they have raised $1.8 billion from investors,
loans and corporate sponsors such as Lucent, Pacific Telesis,
Japan's NEC and France's Alcatel. They also said they have deals
with 40 telecom carriers. Launched in mid-1997, Project Oxygen will
undergo several phases before it is completed in early 2003.

 How to Keep Your 800 Number
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I signed up for a U.S. long-distance 800 number for my
business with one telephone company but was unhappy with the
service.
</P>
<P>
   When I tried to change to another service, my provider refused
to release my 800 number and disconnected my number. As a result, I
lost calls and business.
</P>
<P>
   I have called them at least five times to complain. Although
they promised to fix the problem, they have not. Isn't the 800
number mine to keep?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The answer is yes. Once you sign up with any company
for an 800 number, it is yours to take with you if you change to
another telephone service, says Mari Gottdiener, who runs Outsource
Solutions ( &LR; www.outsolve.com &LR; ) in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``recovering attorney,'' Gottdiener has created
a home-based business to help folks resolve disputes out of court.
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that you should write the CEO of the offending
company, documenting the number of times you called, as well as the
dates, times and persons with whom you spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Demand an immediate release of the 800 number to a designated
phone company.
</P>
<P>
   You can also demand compensation for lost business if you can
document and quantify it. (If nothing else, this should at least
get you a quick release of the number.)
</P>
<P>
   Send a copy of your letter to the California Public Utilities
Commission. Also be sure to notify your local phone company of the
new provider.
</P>
<P>
   Deducing Deductions
</P>
<P>
   Q: In 1997, I spent $13,000 developing a safety device for
automobiles. (About $10,000 was for materials.)
</P>
<P>
   I believed I had a buyer and this still may occur. But if not,
can I write my expenses off as a loss on my taxes when (if) it is
rejected? If so, how do I do it?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are unincorporated and operate as a sole
proprietorship, you should file a Schedule C to report income and
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of your $13,000 investment is likely deductible as
an expense. However, if you have no income and never had any,
accountant Carolyn Amster of Burr, Pilger &AMP; Mayer in San Francisco
says the IRS might be skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is to report the development costs as a
Section 212 expenditure on the Schedule A itemized deduction
portion of your individual tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The $13,000, or a portion of it, might fall under ``expenses
incurred for the production of income.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Amster suggests that you consult with a tax adviser
because your situation could be complicated.
</P>
<P>
   If, like most of us, you report income and expenses in the year
they are incurred, you probably should have reported expenses in
1997. You might want to amend your tax return for that year.
</P>
<P>
   Your situation could be complicated further by the fact that
some of your investment, such as equipment or patent costs, might
need to be deducted over a number of years, rather than all at
once.

 Nortel to Buy Shasta for $340 Million
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Northern Telecom Ltd., which bought Bay Networks last year, is
buying Sunnyvale's Shasta Networks Inc. for $340 million in cash
and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel said it will pay $318 million in stock and $22 million in
cash for the privately held networking company.
</P>
<P>
   Shasta, which has 70 employees, makes gear that helps phone
companies run Internet-based networks. Nortel said it is buying
Shasta to gain the firm's expertise in that arena.
</P>
<P>
   As telecommunications companies migrate to an Internet-based
network, equipment-makers like Nortel, Lucent Technologies and
Cisco Systems Inc. want to be able to sell products for these
next-generation networks.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Chandran, Nortel president of carrier packet solutions,
said Shasta will help the company develop value-added services for
these networks of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Shasta's headquarters will remain in Sunnyvale and the company
does not expect any layoffs.

   COMBAT
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO bombers destroyed a railway bridge in southern Yugoslavia
where, just hours before, allied bombs hit a train. Yugoslavia said
10 people on the train were killed.
</P>
<P>
   _ The allies also hit two oil refineries in Yugoslavia and a
Belgrade suburb. Eight explosions were heard from the southern
outskirts of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yugoslav forces reportedly crossed the Albanian border to
attack a village, and Albanians called on the allies to stop such
incursions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, asked allied
governments for 300 more warplanes to intensify the bombing.
President Clinton said that the air campaign was moving ``to the
next level,'' and that he planned to ask Congress for emergency
funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Britain said it plans to send 1,800 more troops to the
Balkans, bringing its contingent to just over 6,300, based in
Greece and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   DIPLOMACY
</P>
<P>
   _ Senior Russian and American diplomats concurred at talks in
Oslo, Norway, on the principles for a political agreement in Kosovo
but remained divided over the proposed deployment of an
international force under NATO command to police any accord.
Britain wants Russia to be part of a peacekeeping force, but doubts
that Moscow can mediate an end to the dispute with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary-general, who has offered to
attempt peace talks with President Slobodan Milosevic, is to attend
a special summit meeting of the European Union Wednesday to discuss
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.N. human rights commission voted 46-1 to condemn
Yugoslav authorities for their ethnic purges in Kosovo. Only Russia
voted against the resolution, which was sponsored by Pakistan and
supported by the United States and the European Union. China, Cuba
and India were among those abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES
</P>
<P>
   _ Thousands more Albanian refugees streamed out of Kosovo into
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. NATO estimated the total since
the bombing began on March 24 at 448,000; U.N. refugee officials
say an additional 150,000 migrated between March 1998 and March
1999.
</P>

FRENCH OFFICIAL SAYS NATO MUST DECIDE ON ARMING KOSOVO REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French Defense Minister Alain Richard said Tuesday that
the Serbian campaign against armed ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo
was raising questions about whether the NATO allies should try to
arm the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the information we have indicates that the Kosovo
Liberation Army has not been destroyed,'' said Richard. ``It's
fallen back, it's been forced to regroup, but in some areas it is
still as much a force as it was last Jan. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Richard said, ``we have to think hard about distributing
military aid that might just insure that Kosovo became a permanent
field of battle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a political decision to make,'' he told a group of
correspondents for British and American news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Some 8,000 NATO troops, including 700 French soldiers, are now
being sent to northern Albania to help deal with the crisis caused
by the arrival of several hundred thousand refugees from Kosovo in
that poverty-stricken and remote area in the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said the allied troops might soon be in situations where
they had to decide whether to turn a blind eye to Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters trying to infiltrate across the Albanian border to
continue the battle against the Serbs there, or to prevent them
from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a decision we have not yet made,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO mission in Albania is purely one of providing relief
aid, according to the allies. But Richard described the mountainous
northern part of the country where most of the soldiers are to be
sent as a ``security vacuum,'' without any effective Albanian
government security or police presence.
</P>
<P>
   In the French view, Richard said, the Kosovo Liberation Army is
a representative organization that had every right to a voice in
what was to become of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel representatives took part in the failed peace talks at
Rambouillet Castle outside Paris in February, and were part of the
Kosovo Albanian delegation that signed the draft accord in Paris in
March.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to accept that
accord, or the 28,000 NATO peacekeepers that it provided for, led
the alliance to start bombing military targets throughout
Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambouillet accords also provided that the KLA would disband
and be disarmed under the supervision of the peacekeepers as all
but a few hundred Yugoslav army border guards withdrew from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Allied foreign ministers agreed at a meeting in Brussels on
Monday that the Rambouillet agreement would still be the basis of a
political settlement of the Kosovo crisis, but they are also
exploring the possibility of imposing some kind of international
administration over the province if Milosevic continues to refuse
to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian television Tuesday accused NATO of putting helicopters
at the service of ``terrorists'' from the KLA and said allied
planes had given the rebels air cover and bombing support for their
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said a French helicopter had evacuated a French citizen
whom news agencies identified as Franck Brucker from the Albanian
border region near Padesh on Monday after he and some rebel
fighters were wounded in a Serbian mortar attack on the village.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said all the French military on the scene knew about him
was that he was apparently French. A Reuters news agency report
from Tirana said that Brucker was believed to be a freelance
journalist, and that the French Embassy in the Albanian capital
said he was not a French government employee.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials in Brussels say the alliance has no contact of
any kind with Kosovo Liberation Army forces inside Kosovo. They
have described rebel operations as ``sporadic'' after the
destruction of seven rebel field headquarters by Serbian military
and heavily armed police units. The allies are trying to attack
Serb forces with an air armada that will soon number more than
1,000 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is NATO's supreme commander,
said he could not confirm reports from Albania on Tuesday that
Serbian forces had briefly crossed over the border from Kosovo to
pursue rebel troops.

VETERANS' ACCOUNTS HELP SAVE `MIDWAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   War isn't fun. This startling revelation from Robert Ballard,
master plumber of the briny deep, comes at the end of Wednesday
night's latest National Geographic ``Explorer'' special, ``The
Battle for Midway,'' on TBS.
</P>
<P>
   One would hope Ballard didn't have to poke around in the
subaqueous ooze for the USS Yorktown to reach his conclusion, but
it's a safe bet TBS Superstation would be airing this overwrought
documentary regardless of Ballard's position on armed global
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard the philosopher doesn't weigh in Wednesday night on the
relative value of making a living looking for scrap metal on the
ocean floor. Having already found the Titanic, the Bismarck and the
``lost fleet'' of Guadalcanal, his position is obviously secure
among the folks at National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   But the producers of ``The Battle for Midway'' obviously
realized that trolling for sunken hulks has all the dramatic appeal
of an 8 a.m. oceanography lecture on the first day after spring
break. To compensate, Wednesday night's two-hour special is as much
a retelling of the Midway story as it is a documentary on Ballard's
latest deep-sea spelunking. After all, one shot of a submersible
floating above a barren oceanscape goes a long, long way. About
20,000 leagues, give or take.
</P>
<P>
   To keep ``Midway'' from becoming a snoozefest, National
Geographic introduces a compelling human element: four veterans of
the famous battle _ two Americans and two Japanese _ who
accompanied Ballard last spring as he searched for traces of the
aircraft carrier Yorktown and four Japanese carriers that sank in
the Pacific during or shortly after the battle in June 1942.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever manipulation that succeeds in tugging at the
emotions. But, aside from some overused claptrap about providing
``closure'' for the vets, no one ever explains exactly why the
Yorktown had to be found. Or why Ballard was in a ``race against
time,'' as narrator Peter Coyote points out early in the program.
The Yorktown, stuck in the muck about three miles down, certainly
isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the other half of ``The Battle for Midway'' is an
eminently serviceable documentary about the conflict itself. As one
of history's great sea battles, the story hardly needs introduction
or embellishment, especially with the 1976 movie ``Midway'' showing
up on American Movie Classics every few days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss of the Yorktown and the enormous sacrifice of
American torpedo-bomber crews, an incredible combination of
courage, luck, skill and chance gave the U.S. Navy a turning-point
victory against Japanese forces in the battle of Midway.
</P>
<P>
   By interspersing historical footage with coverage of last year's
search for the Yorktown, producers Peter Schnall and Brian Berger
created a passable program that's strong on history and weak on the
high-tech material. Perhaps leery of boring us, ``The Battle for
Midway'' stints on the sort of scientific reportage that makes
PBS's ``NOVA'' series so fascinating. It relies on the most
rudimentary technical coverage, glossing over the really hard stuff
and focusing instead on the connection between the veterans and the
battle that occurred more than a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's a transparent attempt to add weight to a weak story, and
the artificially created drama diminishes the heroic efforts of the
four veterans who accompanied Ballard. No doubt the cruise was
meaningful and emotional for them, but using them to create a
viable premise for a documentary on Ballard's penchant for probing
the depths is, well, shallow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four, Harry Ferrier, lives in Oak Harbor, Wash., and
remembers last year's trip fondly. Ferrier, who spent 30 years in
the Navy and retired with the rank of commander, was a
radioman/gunner in a torpedo bomber squadron that was nearly wiped
out during the battle of Midway. Of the group, a unit that was
attached to the carrier Hornet but was based at Midway, only
Ferrier and his pilot survived, both wounded and somehow able to
limp home in a tattered Grumman Avenger that was essentially a
flying piece of Swiss cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on his contribution to the battle, Ferrier isn't
so much philosophical as he is matter-of-fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was afternoon,'' he said, ``and it became obvious that our
airplane was the only one that had come back, that the other five
did not, and we eventually just had to accept the fact that all
five were shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   If we need Robert Ballard to remind us of such heroic sacrifice,
then ``The Battle for Midway'' serves a purpose. But just as
Ballard looks at war and asks why, it's easy to look at Ballard's
efforts and ask the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Racing to save a film legacy
</P>
<P>
   If you believe film is art, just as worthy of preservation as a
Michelangelo fresco or a Mick Jagger recording, you might
appreciate the spirit in ``The Race to Save 100 Years.'' But you
likely won't have a better understanding of how films are
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour documentary, airing Wednesday night on the Turner
Classic Movies cable channel, is a noble attempt to drum up support
for preserving and restoring films of the past. It includes rarely
seen excerpts of movie history, such as the only surviving footage
from Greta Garbo's 1928 silent film, ``The Divine Woman,'' plus
many before-and-after examples of painstakingly restored films.
</P>
<P>
   But for film buffs interested in the actual process of
restoration and preservation, it's merely a tease. While ``The Race
to Save 100 Years'' does a good job of explaining the deterioration
of old films on nitrate stock and even newer acetate stock, it
falls way short of illuminating the effort to put the magic back in
the great films of the past century.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned: As a production of Turner Entertainment Co., the
documentary also spends the requisite amount of time applauding Ted
Turner's efforts to preserve films, but it doesn't detract from the
film or from a 24-hour ``restoration marathon'' Wednesday on TCM.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   NBC will air what amounts to its first three-hour season finale
May 22 when a one-hour episode of ``The Pretender'' at 8 p.m. leads
into a two-hour cliffhanger at 9.... Fans of Donna Abandando, take
note: Gail O'Grady will reprise the character in an appearance on
ABC's ``NYPD Blue'' April 27.... The animation frenzy continues.
David Spade (``Just Shoot Me'') has begun production on the
animated comedy series ``Sammy'' for NBC. The series borrows from
Spade's real-life relationship with his father, Sammy Spade. David
Spade will do the voices of both characters. Others in the cast
include Andy Dick and Maura Tierney of ``NewsRadio.'' NBC has
ordered 13 episodes and plans a midseason launch next year....
Beginning April 26, ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' will begin
nightly broadcasts in high-definition digital format....NBC says
its decision this week to cancel the soap opera ``Another World''
has generated fewer than 50 complaints.

LAW FIRM TO PAY LONGTIME FOE $50 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, a New York law firm that
has grown rich by suing Corporate America, agreed to pay $50
million Tuesday to its longtime foe, Lexecon Inc., a Chicago
consulting firm, which had contended in court that the law firm had
tried to destroy its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-running feud, Lexecon and one of its prominent
consultants, Daniel Fischel, the dean of the University of Chicago
Law School, had accused lawyers at Milberg Weiss of having tried to
discredit the consulting firm by unfairly trying to tie it to the
billion-dollar collapse of Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the consultants' contentions that the law firm had
abused the legal process to discredit Lexecon, a jury in U.S.
District Court in Chicago on Monday awarded the consulting firm $45
million in compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   Before the jury could decide whether punitive damages should be
added to that amount, the two sides talked through the night,
reaching the $50 million settlement Tuesday morning. The settlement
takes the place of the $45 million jury verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest and most powerful class-action plaintiff's firm
was found liable for abuse of process,'' said Alan N. Salpeter, a
lawyer at Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt in Chicago, which represents
Lexecon. ``This sends a message that lawyers should not abuse the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at Milberg Weiss said Tuesday that they did not wish to
comment. Lexecon referred all questions to Salpeter.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss agreed to wire $50 million Tuesday to Lexecon's
account, Salpeter said. And both firms agreed not to sue each other
again over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Milberg Weiss and Lexecon have often appeared on
opposite sides of the court room in class-action lawsuits filed
against public companies alleging they committed securities fraud.
Milberg Weiss has brought hundreds of those lawsuits on behalf of
shareholders, while Lexecon has often been hired by the
corporations being sued to testify as an expert witness and punch
holes in the suits' claims.
</P>
<P>
   Fischel has long been an outspoken critic of the securities
fraud cases. In 1995, in testimony before a congressional panel, he
said that the lawsuits were ``legalized extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The class-action cases, which have earned fortunes in
contingency fees for Milberg Weiss and other plaintiffs' law firms,
are typically filed when bad news causes a company's stock price to
drop. The suits often contend that corporate executives misled
shareholders by not disclosing the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit settled Tuesday revolved around a move made by
Milberg Weiss in 1990 to add Lexecon as a defendant in a securities
fraud case brought against Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan, the Irvine,
Calif., institution controlled by Charles Keating that collapsed in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss had pointed to reports by Lexecon consultants that
said that Lincoln was sound. Lexecon had argued that the lawsuit
was frivolous. But it agreed to settle the claims, paying the
plaintiffs about $700,000, which was about how much it had received
from Lincoln in consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   After the settlement, when Lexecon appeared as an expert witness
in other securities cases, Milberg Weiss lawyers brought up the
Lincoln Savings case to try to discredit Lexecon's testimony, the
consulting firm contended in the lawsuit. And that, in turn, hurt
the firm's business, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Lexecon was founded in 1977 by two University of Chicago
professors. Late last year, Lexecon was acquired by Nextera
Enterprises Inc., a company controlled by Michael Milken. Nextera
has plans to soon sell shares to the public. &QL;

COMMENTARY: CONTEMPT, SHE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As though our president didn't have enough to worry about, with
the confusion on Kosovo policy and the collapse of the China World
Trade Organization deal, now he must finally face the music on
being contumacious about his concupiscence.
</P>
<P>
   After years of slipping and sliding around, Bill Clinton was
finally pinioned by his former law student, Judge Susan Webber
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   In a scalding ruling that was far more gratifying than the
partisan House impeachment hearings, and far more appropriate than
a congressional censure, Judge Wright plainly rebuked Clinton for
what he was plainly guilty of: lying through his teeth. ``Simply
put,'' the judge said, citing Clinton for civil contempt in the
Paula Jones lawsuit, the president's testimony was ``intentionally
false.''
</P>
<P>
   She upbraided him not on his tacky sexcapades with the pizza
girl, but on his real offense, his lifelong habit of customizing,
altering, evading or dribbling out the truth to maintain political
viability. It is unappetizing when he does it in political venues;
but in a legal venue, with the judge sitting right in front of him,
it was literally and legally contemptible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply is not acceptable to employ deceptions and
falsehoods in an attempt to obstruct the judicial process,'' she
wrote, ``understandable as his aggravation with the plaintiff's
lawsuit may have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Hillary never gave us ``closure'' by braining the big boy
with a frying pan, it was delicious to see another brainy lawyer
ding him with a 32-page order and fine. The judge dryly mocked
Clinton's tortured definition of his tryst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the president is asserting that Ms. Lewinsky could
be having sex with him while, at the same time, he was not having
sex with her,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The president and the prosecutor who have spent years locked in
a warped embrace were still hopelessly entangled this week. On the
same afternoon that Clinton got slapped by a Little Rock judge for
obstructing justice, Ken Starr got slapped by a Little Rock jury
for using an obstruction-of-justice charge to unfairly bludgeon the
president and his old business partner.
</P>
<P>
   After years of a runaway investigation and abusive tactics,
Starr was finally pinioned by Susan McDougal. Starr's former
prisoner _ who still has her own home page on the Web with that
fetching picture in manacles and miniskirt _ showed once again that
it is long past the time for the special prosecutor to pack up and
get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   In the same Little Rock federal courthouse where Judge Wright
issued her ruling, Ms. McDougal had just triumphed with what her
lawyer, Mark Geragos, called ``a Ken Starr defense.'' The woman
Starr let languish in solitary confinement _ she called herself ``a
political prisoner'' _ turned the tables and put the prosecutor, or
``the sleazy toad,'' as she likes to call him, on trial in her
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Her case was simple: Starr was out to get the president, so
determined, in fact, that he was pressuring her to tell lies about
the Clintons. Thus she did not need to answer the sleazy toad's
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the message here was that Ken Starr has run out his
time,'' said a happy Geragos.
</P>
<P>
   This whole farce is so over. But the now-comical characters keep
rushing back onto the stage. This week, Susan, Bill, Ken, Web and
Paula were all in the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will be back before Congress testifying on Wednesday at a
hearing on whether the Independent Counsel Act should be renewed.
He has long opposed the law on constitutional grounds, but has
turned himself into the poster boy for its excesses. After spending
four and a half years rooting around in the president's life, Starr
is expected to tell us it's time for the independent counsel law to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   In the immortal words that Monica spoke to her gal-pal Linda
Tripp after Starr's agents swooped down on her, ``Thanks a lot.''
Couldn't he have shared these insights about getting rid of himself
$50 million ago?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in this endless dance of the macabre, another
congressional committee evaluating whether to preserve or kill the
special prosecutor law wants to hear from none other than Susan
McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   It should be so over. But it so isn't.

DEADBEAT DAD SENTENCED TO 18 MONTHS IN FEDERAL PRISON  

</HEADLINE>
 DAD-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ED ASHER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Shirley Malone Price had grown to enjoy a fairly
comfortable life here.
</P>
<P>
   Her family had maid service six days a week in their two-story
home.
</P>
<P>
   She had jewelry and furs. It was ``a joy,'' she says, to be a
stay-at-home mom raising four children.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest was 9 months old and a ``crawling child'' when her
husband of 18 years left her in 1982 and moved to California.
That's when Price began to see her life erode.
</P>
<P>
   She had to find outside work and eventually had to move back to
the one-story, cracked-brick house where she grew up ``on a very
rough street'' in inner-city Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She was grateful for food stamps, but her children were
embarrassed that other kids knew they were on a free lunch program
at school.
</P>
<P>
   Price reached the point she had to pawn her jewelry and furs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the upper class to begin with (in her marriage) and
we had to come all the way down,'' said Price, 52, now a telephone
representative for Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Price says, she finally saw justice when her former
husband, Wendell Price Sr., was sentenced to 18 months in a federal
prison for failure to pay child support and ordered to pay his
former wife more than $173,000.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Hittner ordered Price, 56, to prison
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence ended the first felony ``deadbeat parents'' case
heard in federal court in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell Price was charged under the Deadbeat Parents Punishment
Act of 1998, signed into law by President Clinton last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The law stiffens the Child Support Recovery Act of 1992 by
upgrading failure to pay child support from a federal misdemeanor
to a felony when the amount owed is greater than $10,000 or has
remained unpaid longer than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The government has an interest in these cases because custodial
parents often end up on welfare when child support is not paid,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Bobb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal benefits,'' he said, ``are used at an alarming rate
when these deadbeat parents don't pay up.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecuting deadbeat parents ``is working toward Congress' and
the president's goal of reducing welfare rolls,'' Bobb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Attorney General's Office, which investigates these
cases, says the law puts more teeth into the prosecutorial process.
</P>
<P>
   The AG office refers any case dealing with a noncustodial parent
living outside of Texas to federal prosecutors. But child support
advocates have complained that such cases were not a high priority
for the feds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main difference is, making it a felony gives U.S.
attorneys more of an incentive to pursue the case,'' AG spokesman
Matt Winslow said. ``Everybody operates with limited resources, and
a felony is going to be a higher priority than lesser crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Child support advocates say it's too early to tell the new law's
impact, if any, but they are happy about the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a clear message to people who go to other states to
avoid paying that this crime will no longer be tolerated,'' said
Debbie Kline, national chapter development director for the
Association for Children for Enforcement of Support Inc., a
nonprofit group based in Toledo, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Kline agreed that child support cases were never a priority for
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobb says the Price case is proof the federal government is
now serious about prosecuting such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Price's case is particularly egregious, because he had money,
Bobb said.
</P>
<P>
   In the couple's 1985 divorce, Price was ordered to pay $1,500
per month in child support. Shirley Price said he never paid more
than $400 at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Houston, her husband was earning about $300,000 a
year operating a welding shop and a machine shop on contract to
several large oil equipment companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When indicted, Price was living in a $400,000 house in San
Bernadino, Calif., and managing a lucrative restaurant owned by his
second wife's cousin, Bobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Price said her ex owns two Mercedes-Benz cars and two
pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a very good living,'' Bobb said. ``He could have paid
his child support payments, but he let his children live in poverty
and struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Price says Price was once a good husband and father, and
she is not pleased he is going to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main objective was to get the money to take care of my
family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so horrible for children to have to go without when their
parents have money. It would be different if my husband didn't have
money all these years. He has money and would not give it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she expects her ex-husband to pay up now, Shirley Price
said, ``I hope so.''

CLINTON MOVES TO RESTART TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Smarting from criticism that he backed away from a
trade deal with China because of domestic politics, President
Clinton telephoned China's prime minister Tuesday night to restart
the negotiations in Beijing this month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced the effort as Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji was wrapping up an 11-day tour of the United States and was
in New York Tuesday before heading to Canada. It also a followed a
meeting on Monday in which nearly two dozen business executives
lobbied the White House to emphasize how important the deal was to
American companies seeking access to the world's largest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were happy with the progress we made but were worried
that the deal would not come to fruition,'' an administration
official said. The official said that Clinton's telephone call,
which lasted about 20 minutes, was intended to send a signal to the
business community that the White House was doing all it could to
seal the deal and as a signal that it intended to lock China into
concessions it had made on numerous trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the two countries said they would ``move
intensively'' to resolve the remaining issues that blocked them
from reaching a deal last week while Premier Zhu Rongji met with
Clinton in an official three-day visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu came seeking China's entry into the World Trade Organization
but was denied the prize after talks collapsed at the last minute.
Some administration officials said that anti-China sentiment on
Capitol Hill was so intense that they thought they could not get
any deal through. At the same time, officials familiar with the
negotiations said, Clinton was distracted by the Kosovo conflict
and had not fully conveyed to his negotiators how much he wanted to
complete the deal himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats in Congress were leery of an accord with China,
predicting it would trigger a divisive battle in their party.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said during his visit here that he believed the deal fell
through because of domestic American politics and that Washington
had politicized what was essentially an economic issue. Republicans
on Capitol Hill have been furious over Clinton's policy of
engagement at a time when China has reportedly stolen military
secrets from the United States, is cracking down on political
dissidents and was accused of making illegal financial
contributions to Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, said last week during
Zhu's visit that he strongly opposed a deal and was suspicious of
whether China would commit to fair trade practices. The United
States has a $57 billion trade imbalance with China.

BIBLE-BASED PARENTING PROGRAM HAS MANY CONVERTS, CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
 METHOD-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Lori and Scott Hashimoto, the first seven weeks of
parenthood were, by their own admission, ``hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Blake would cry. Lori would nurse him. He'd cry some
more. And so it went, round-the-clock, as the weeks rolled by in a
blur of broken sleep. Weary and discouraged, Lori even developed
blisters from her infant's strong and frequent sucking.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, that giant sucking sound was Scott and Lori
pulling the plug on ``child-centered'' parenting.
</P>
<P>
   They turned instead to a controversial ``Bible-based'' program
whose popularity has alarmed mainstream parenting experts and
created dissension among conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashimotos, who live in Lynnwood, Wash., say the parenting
program developed by Gary and Anne Marie Ezzo of Chatsworth,
Calif., restored their sanity and quieted Blake's distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two weeks, he was sleeping through 10 to 12 hours
without having to cry,'' says Scott, 35, an occupational therapist
with a home health agency. ``We got him on a routine during the day
and that's what stabilized him.''
</P>
<P>
   But many pediatricians and lactation experts say the Ezzo
routine comes at a cost, and babies pay the price. In extreme
cases, they say, babies are at risk of failure to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've suddenly boiled over,'' said British psychologist
Penelope Leach, author of the still-popular child-development
guide, ``Your Baby &AMP; Child'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 559 pages, $35),
first published in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, a founder of the British branch of the World Association
for Infant Mental Health, said she plans to voice her alarm over
the Ezzo program at an April 20 talk at Seattle's Tools for Parents
Lecture Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's called sticking your neck out,'' Leach said in a
phone interview from London.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having no formal training in the field, the Ezzos, who
have five grandchildren, are not shy about bucking established
views on child development, as popularized by authorities such as
Leach and Dr. T. Berry Brazelton.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos' advice: For trouble-free days and nights, put your
newborn on a feeding schedule and don't rush to pick her up when
she cries. After all, they say, God did not immediately answer
Christ's agonized cries on the cross, and half an hour of crying
won't hurt a baby that's kept clean and fed on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your baby will not lose brain cells, experience a drop in IQ
or have feelings of rejection that will leave him manic-depressive
at age thirty,'' says ``On Becoming Babywise,'' the secular version
of their church-based program.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' it adds, ``if you want a fussy baby,
never let him cry, and hold, rock and feed him as soon as he starts
to fuss. We guarantee, you will achieve your goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalled'' by such advice, Leach says the American Academy of
Pediatrics has been too timid in responding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there must be a lot of people out there who are as
sickened by (the Ezzos) as I am,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics has taken no position on the
Ezzo program but, in response to widespread concern among its
membership, is evaluating it and other parenting programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kyle Yasuda, president of the Washington state chapter of
the academy, said he does not recommend the Ezzo approach to his
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does raise some flags,'' he said, adding that he is
concerned about nutritional and behavioral aspects of the program.
``This kind of regimented approach doesn't sound like a nurturing
environment to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos initially recommended four-hour feeding intervals for
infants, but now say 2{- to three-hour ``parent-directed'' feedings
are fine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such adjustments, infant development specialists are
still concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to throw those books away!'' said Katy Brock
Jameson, clinical manager for the department at Seattle's Swedish
Hospital that does home visits and education for new moms.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has seen babies fail to regain their birth weight
after two weeks on the Ezzo schedule. Although some kids can
probably adapt, she said, ``in other cases I believe there may be
damage done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lactation specialists say nursing on demand, up to 12 or even 18
times a day in a newborn, optimizes the supply and fat content of
the mother's milk while also quenching infant's thirst, building
its immunity, stimulating bowel movements and providing comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they cry for prolonged periods, it burns up calories that
can otherwise be used for growth,'' Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos' course materials are marketed through Growing
Families International (GFI), their $4-million-a-year, for-profit
company, which they refer to as a ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Churches _ especially conservative, evangelical churches _ are
the prime venue for their classes, including their core course,
``Growing Kids God's Way.'' According to GFI, Ezzo materials have
been used by about 6,000 churches _ involving nearly 1.5 million
parents _ in 95 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Ezzos also have a secular following through the books ``On
Becoming Babywise'' and ``On Becoming Babywise Book Two'' by Gary
Ezzo and Dr. Robert Bucknam, who wrote the forward (both books from
Multnomah Press, $9.99).
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why our material has been so successful is because
it works,'' said Robert Garcia, GFI's executive vice president and
the Ezzos' son-in-law. (The Ezzos declined to be interviewed for
this story.)
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said failure to thrive is not an outcome of the Ezzos'
feeding method. ``I think it's something that just happens with
babies sometimes,'' he said, adding that the Ezzo program gives
parents ``hope'' and ``relief'' from being ``almost a slave to the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising children is not a matter of chance, he said, it's a
matter of ``right parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's bedrock principles are that the husband-wife
relationship is paramount, and that children should begin early to
learn self-control, respect, unquestioning obedience and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   In a philosophy that frequently clashes with established ideas
of child development, they also teach that infants are born with a
``sin nature.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, instead of viewing temper tantrums as a normal and
fleeting stage, the Ezzos teach in ``Growing Kids God's Way'' that
``a temper tantrum is the ultimate rejection of parental
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Defying conventional wisdom, they recommend structured playpen
time to help babies develop orderliness, mental focusing skills and
creativity _ which they call a function of boundaries, not freedom.
</P>
<P>
   They also encourage ``high-chair manners'' for babies as young
as 8 months, with a swat or hand squeeze if baby fails to use sign
language for ``please'' and ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late toddlerhood, Ezzo discipline follows a flow
chart that culminates in spanking, or ``biblical chastisement''
with a flexible tool chosen to inflict pain without causing injury.
The Ezzos have suggested a rubber spatula would do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ezzos' written words seem harsh and unambiguous,
families who take the courses say they emphasize positive
discipline and flexibility aimed at cultivating goodness in their
children's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Hashimoto suspects the program's very success has spawned
professional jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, however, laments that parents today find moderation
``boring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing I do or say amounts to a kind of child-rearing
program,'' Leach said. ``That's what people seem to want _ a
formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach sees the Ezzo approach as part of a growing movement
toward authoritarian parenting that is polarizing the issue of how
to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, Leach said, parents are hit with research on
critical brain development in the first three years of life _
creating panic in new parents who make minor ``blunders.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they're sold the notion _ via Judith Rich
Harris' controversial book, ``The Nurture Assumption'' _ that what
they do as parents makes no difference, because peers are more
influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we have made the whole business of being a parent
so impossibly difficult,'' Leach said, ``that anything that looks
simple is going to get a hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Ezzos have won a fiercely loyal following. ``On
Becoming Babywise,'' published in 1995, is the
eighth-most-requested parenting book at Ingram Book Co., the
nation's largest trade book distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online bookseller, has posted 80 highly
emotional reader reviews of ``Babywise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a blessing to our family,'' wrote one Oregon reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started `Babywise' when our child was 6 weeks old and have
not looked back since,'' wrote a mother from Yuma, Ariz., who said
her infant was constantly crying and unhappy before they bought the
book.
</P>
<P>
   But other readers are aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a couple who used this book and the baby suffered
failure to thrive and nearly was hospitalized,'' wrote a Montana
reader.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington state reader called the book ``child hate in
disguise,'' and an Ohio reader wrote, ``If you are looking for a
convenient way to have a child who falls into a schedule and
doesn't bother you too much ... GET A DOG!''
</P>
<P>
   Bellevue pediatrician Don Shifrin said he's concerned by the
program's one-size-fits-all approach, which he believes sets
parents up for failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian community itself is divided. Focus on the Family,
a conservative group led by psychologist James Dobson of Colorado
Springs, Colo., says the Ezzo program is ``far too rigid'' and
misapplies scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, Calif., where Gary Ezzo
was formerly associate pastor, has disavowed the Ezzo program.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Christian Research Journal dissected the Ezzo
program in a 14-page article with 111 footnotes. Although it found
some benefits, the thrust was highly critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``GFI is more than a parenting ministry _ it is a cultic
community,'' the article charged.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashimotos, who now have three sons, say critics overreact
to a program that, in their view, creates loving, thinking parents.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they spank occasionally, with a hand or a wooden spoon
(which the Ezzos don't recommend).
</P>
<P>
   But they say life overall is happy and relaxed, with well-fed,
well-trained children who are pleasant to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most appealing thing (about the program) is that
we enjoy our children when they're young,'' Scott Hashimoto said.
``For me, I feel offended when people say I'm stifling my child's
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He says any child-rearing method can be misapplied. And while
the Ezzos seem to promise otherwise, he says no child has a
guaranteed outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is,'' Hashimoto said, ``a lot of people turn out good
and a lot of people turn out bad.''

WHITE SOX HITTERS SHOW INEXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Chicago White Sox must be wondering what the big
fuss is about Fenway Park. Never mind the Green Monster. What do
you do to combat Boston's veteran pitching?
</P>
<P>
   The inexperience of Chicago's Kiddie Corps showed time and again
in a 6-0 loss to the Red Sox and Bret Saberhagen Tuesday. Nothing
in their two previous series _ on the road in Seattle and at home
against Kansas City _ could have prepared the young hitters for
their Fenway Moment.
</P>
<P>
   They almost had Saberhagen on the ropes in the first inning,
loading the bases. But he repelled them with three called third
strikes. For the day, the White Sox struck out seven times, though
the Boston pitchers got some assistance from plate umpire Dale
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have a Saberhagen on the hook early, you have to
take advantage of it,'' said Chicago manager Jerry Manuel, whose
team has lost five straight. ``We didn't do that. We sent up six
men in the first inning and didn't score. They had an experienced
pitcher who knew what he was doing and how to get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had Albert Belle and Robin Ventura batting fourth
and fifth for 162 games. It's a little different when you have to
replace them with a young man coming up from Double A ball (Jeff
Liefer) or another man (Magglio Ordonez) who is just 22 years old.
It's a learning experience and hopefully we can grasp it and run
with it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox' motto for this rebuilding season is ``The Kids
Can Play.'' They can . . . but right now they're overmatched by
good pitching. Even though Frank Thomas, one of the few veterans in
the lineup, is hitting a league-beat .591, the White Sox have
scored just one run in their last 20 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had opportunities and didn't take advantage of it,''
said Thomas. ``Anytime you get runners on base three times like we
did today and don't get anything out of it, there is a good chance
you're not going to win ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saberhagen pitched out of a jam in the first because he's a
veteran who can spot the ball where he wants it. We have a bunch of
young, talented guys who are used to having control of the strike
zone. Up here, sometimes you can't control some things. You have to
take your knocks, and that is just what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven called strikeouts bothered Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a hitter gets into a strikeout situation,'' said Manuel,
``you would hope they would be able to foul that pitch off to get a
better pitch, not just take it and leave it in the hands or
judgment of whomever. Leave yourself some room for the pitcher to
make the mistakes. We just can't continue to say we're learning.
I'd like for us to make some adjustments and do some things to
enhance that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel also wasn't pleased that his starter, Jim Parque (1-1),
walked two batters to set up Boston's three-run rally in the
second. There were two outs when Parque walked Jason Varitek and
Donnie Sadler. Jose Offerman then tripled them home and scored on a
single by Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitch selection wasn't the best in that inning,'' said
Manuel.``We were 2-0 on Varitek and he threw a curveball. I'd much
prefer to see him go after a guy rather than throw a pitch like a
breaking ball and fall behind further, then end up walking him and
the next guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could come into Boston knowing we'd give up only three
runs, I could accept that. But with the way our offense is going,
you have to evaluate from that perspective. We have to be able to
score. One run in 20 innings is too much pressure. You can't expect
your pitchers to out and hold a team to no runs or one run.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be this way forever, said shortstop Mike Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting started,'' he said. ``We're just getting
things to fall in place. The important thing is to keep playing
good defense. As the season goes on, we will start hitting.''

TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT ON HOW TO RAISE, DISCIPLINE BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
 SIDEBAR-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What the Ezzos say:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two related dangers that threaten successful
parenting. The first is not rightly understanding the significance
of the husband-wife relationship in the parenting process, and the
second is the danger of child-centered parenting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your choice in parenting philosophy will actually determine
your child's hunger patterns, sleep patterns and even his or her
basic disposition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``...Consider mealtime an opportunity to teach basic skills. For
example, instruct your baby daughter in the appropriate use of her
hands and her voice, and begin to teach her early table manners....
If you have to, hold your baby's hands away from her food. Even
better, teach her where to place her hands while being fed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teach the child to obey according to the character of true
obedience _ immediately, completely, without challenge and without
complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If soiling continues to be a problem with a child who is over
two-and-a-half years of age, hold the child accountable for his or
her accidents. By that, we mean the child should clean up himself
or herself, plus the soiled clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   -From ``On Becoming Babywise'' and ``On Becoming Babywise Book
Two'' by Gary Ezzo and Dr. Robert Bucknam.
</P>
<P>
   What Penelope Leach Says:
</P>
<P>
   ``...Taking a baby's point of view does not mean neglecting the
viewpoint of parents or other caring adults, because they are
inextricably intertwined.... Raising children is hard work.... For
almost everyone it means making compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New babies sleep exactly the amount that their personal
physiology tells them to sleep. There is nothing that you can do to
make your baby sleep more than this amount and nothing that the
baby can do to sleep less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems over an older baby's or toddler's eating often
dominate the lives of whole families for months on end. You can do
a great deal to avoid them by cultivating relaxed and accepting
attitudes now.... Expect a mess and arrange to cope with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smacking children can't teach them how to behave and the proof
is that once a child starts to be punished that way, he'll get
smacked all through childhood. In fact, it's because physical
punishments are so ineffective that they tend to escalate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to force the child to sit on the potty, even if you
can see that she is about to have a bowel movement.... The clearer
you make it that you really want her to sit there, the less likely
she is to want to.... Above all don't imply that use of the potty
is a moral issue.''

(ATTN: ILL.)  
 ADMINISTRATION ASKS FOR $4 BILLION TO PAY FOR WAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the air campaign against Yugoslavia continues to
widen, the Clinton administration presented Congress with the bill
Tuesday: over $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And Defense Secretary William Cohen is asking President Clinton
to call up thousands of air force and army reservists to fly and
maintain many of the 300 additional airplanes requested by NATO
this week, as well as to serve in other parts of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In closed door sessions with members of the Senate and House,
officials from the administration said the Pentagon would need at
least $3 billion for the air war itself and another $500 million
for the refugee operation through the fiscal year that ends Sept.
30, according to senior officials who attended the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said the emergency
request, not counting the refugee relief operation, could reach $4
billion by the time it is formally submitted sometime this week.
``It's all in the early stages of planning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is expected to ask the president to call up pilots to fly
some of the refueling tankers that are part of the latest request
made this week by Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme commander of NATO
forces, for 300 planes that include combat jets for ground attack
and air defense suppression as the campaign over Yugoslavia becomes
a 24-hour operation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Pentagon said it would need to call up specialists
in the Army reserve to serve in Macedonia and Albania, particularly
in civil affairs units.
</P>
<P>
   Since the campaign began, the armed forces have been under a
growing strain. All air patrols over northern Iraq have been
suspended because combat jets were sent to fight over Yugoslavia.
The only aircraft carrier normally in Asian waters has been
deployed to the Persian Gulf, allowing the Theodore Roosevelt to be
sent for duty to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's stock of air-launched cruise missiles has been
depleted to below 100 missiles, according to Pentagon officials.
And this week, the Pentagon asked for a ``supplemental
solicitation'' for jet fuel and other petroleum products for forces
in Europe because the air war has drawn down the jet fuel supplies.
</P>
<P>
   And as the air war moves into what President Clinton described
Tuesday as a new phase, ``a more intense version of the current
phase,'' according to the Pentagon, operating around the clock and
increasing the number of daylight raids, the demands on the U.S.
air force are growing.
</P>
<P>
   Clark ``would like to fly more intensively during both day and
night hours _ in other words, more sorties; and strike a wider
range of targets,'' said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   To wage such an widening war and take advantage of the damage
already inflicted on the Serbian armed forces, Clark has made two
requests since Saturday for a total of 382 additional airplanes,
squeezing certain areas _ especially on the fleet of refueling
tankers. As the air war has intensified the need for aerial
refueling has grown dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Kosovo war has called on 63 percent of the active
duty force of KC-135 tankers, according to Lt. Col. Charles Wynne
of Scott Air Base, in Illinois, and the base just hit a record of
sending 100 tankers to the European theater, which includes some
planes earmarked for southwest Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we increase the tankers sent over, the national guard and
the reserve will have to make the crew,'' said Wynne. ``We can
squeeze a few more from active duty, but the majority will have to
be the guard and reserve.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All of these demands add up to the request for emergency funding
described to Congress Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is a rough estimate, several Clinton
administration officials told Congress that the refugee relief
operation would cost from $515 to $560 million, which would be
shared between the State Department's refugee office and the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials told congressional leaders that
it cost from $70 to $100 million a day to fight the air war over
Yugoslavia, according to a spokesman for Trent Lott, the Senate
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the campaign at this cost, with the strain it
places on the military, led some congressional leaders to ask
whether the military remained prepared to fight two major wars at
the same time, as required under defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders said they wanted to approve the emergency
supplemental funding but they had yet to determine whether they
would have to look for cuts in other domestic programs to offset
it.

FOR SCHUBERT, AGE YIELDS ITS RANK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Art isn't a question of age. I can't think the way someone else
does just because he's older and famous. One argument that
(italics)never(end italics) counts is `I'm right, because I have
more experience.'''
</P>
<P>
   So says the German baritone Matthias Goerne, who is 32, still
legitimately within the category (popular with publicists, who
treat it as infinitely elastic) of the ``young'' singer.
</P>
<P>
   But if the label suggests promise for the future rather than
mastery at the present hour, it does not apply. Like any performer
in a classical discipline _ a discipline, that is, with an
established literature and technical standards about which there
exists a reasonable degree of consensus _ Goerne had to learn his
craft along the way. Yet like Cecilia Bartoli and Bryn Terfel, he
burst on the international scene as a personality fully formed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of seniority arises in connection with Goerne's new
recital partner, the professorial Austrian pianist Alfred Brendel,
who is 68. Together, they have been investigating Schubert song
cycles. New Yorkers will hear the duo for the first time on
Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall in ``Winterreise,'' that
agonizing cycle of heartbreak and alienation. The more varied
``Schwanengesang'' follows on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners expecting performances in any sense directed from the
keyboard, a possibility Brendel's eminence might in theory make
plausible, are in for a surprise. The pianist's last association of
this sort goes back to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who towers over
the postwar landscape of song like a lone colossus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I heard Herr Goerne,'' Brendel said recently, ``nobody
since Fischer-Dieskau has inspired me to go back to lieder.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, because Herr Goerne and Herr Brendel (as the
partners call each other with old-school formality) always think
alike. Far from it. Goerne tells the story that when they reached
an especially fraught moment of ``Winterreise,'' their interpretive
instincts were diametrically opposed. Brendel wanted to underscore
the pain by broadening the tempo. Goerne thought the passage should
be drier, simpler. Brendel invoked ``tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is it written?'' Goerne wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' Brendel insisted, with a thump on the score. ``In the
notes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the notes, too,'' Goerne came back.
</P>
<P>
   Three years have passed since Goerne first sang in New York, in
a recital at the Frick Collection. That week, he and Graham
Johnson, his pianist for the occasion, paid a visit to Robert
White's lieder class at the Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in a leather jacket, metal trim jangling, shod in biker
boots, with dark hair buzzed down to a shadow on the skull, the
singer looked to have wandered onto the set of a very wrong movie.
But the instant he got to work, running through Brahms' ``Four
Serious Songs'' (Op. 121), he showed what it means to be in
command, or perhaps to be possessed. The Biblical text rang out in
tones as momentous as they were beautiful, the message both
timeless and immediately personal, distilling the bleak wisdom of
ages into the inflection of a syllable.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmastime last year, Goerne was back in New York, this
time at the Metropolitan Opera, as Mozart's birdman Papageno. ``Die
Zauberflote'' teaches its life lessons by means of fable, and here
again, Goerne proved an interpreter of genius.
</P>
<P>
   On the concert stage, he affects a Nehru jacket, an
unconventional choice, but his peculiarly expressive rubber-jointed
body language shows through any costume. Constant, too, is the look
on his round face and cornflower eyes, wide with wonder, the mirror
of a mind to which the world is ever new. His voice _ a smooth,
seductive instrument rather than a mighty engine _ touches the
music with gentle assurance, like a hand in a velvet glove.
</P>
<P>
   We are a long way from the formal graces of the star vocalists
of yesteryear, yet among the new generation of recitalists, no one
has absorbed more from the postwar paragons or had more of their
attention. In the age of the master class, the (``young'') singers
entitled to list Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf
on their resumes are legion. Those who have studied with either of
them for an extended period are few. Goerne did so with both.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important than these, Goerne says, was the unsung
Hans-Joachim Beyer, who took him on in the Communist East Germany
of his adolescence at the Mendelssohn Hochschule in Leipzig. At the
time, Beyer was a lowly assistant. Goerne was his first student.
For two years, they worked together an hour and a half a day. Other
than that, Goerne did not practice at all, he says. ``We only did
exercises, no singing. Lots of la-la-la-la, ne-ne-ne-ne.'' Any
songs and arias were strictly as required for exams.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, he was my most important teacher,'' Goerne says.
``He made it possible for me to study with the others. Going to
them, you need to be able to sing reasonably well. Then they get
all the laurels. It's not really fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time he sang for Fischer-Dieskau, one of his songs was
``Am Meer,'' from ``Schwanengesang.'' ``Herr Goerne,'' he recalls
the great man saying, ``you have a very attractive voice. It speaks
to people. You have a way of focusing a listener's attention, very
personal, very honest, not dry. But now, let's sing this song
right.'' In the event, Goerne worked with Fischer-Dieskau regularly
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to accept that teachers like this are strong
personalities with strong points of view,'' Goerne says. ``You
can't expect to change them. You have to take what they give you.
And in the long run _ on the stage, at the latest _ you have to do
what works for you. Fischer-Dieskau never wanted to make people
sing like him. He had great distance. He said what he had to say,
you did it or didn't do it, and either was OK
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing I got from him is concentration, the
ability to be in a piece from the first note. A song is so short.
There are great possibilities, but little time. You have to start
with great clarity, so people know where you're going.''
</P>
<P>
   And what lessons did he draw from Ms. Schwarzkopf?
</P>
<P>
   ``She focuses a lot on interpretation, too. But she also has the
courage to intervene in technical matters. She had a great
influence on the timbre of my voice. When we started, I sounded
like a tenor on top, like a bass at the bottom, and in the middle a
little bit like a baritone. The differences in color were too
great. She always tries to find the point where a voice rings out
in the most beautiful and natural way.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the purpose of all this study is to find yourself,
to find your individual tone, not to fit into a whole class of
nobodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is nothing anonymous about Goerne's instrument
or manner, and his approach to repertory is also distinctive. In a
recital, he looks for what he calls a ``story,'' though it need not
be of the narrative sort. ``It's more of an emotional thing,'' he
explains. ``I want to take a listener through the program, giving
clear emotional direction, step by step, with smooth transitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though signed to an exclusive recording contract by
Decca/London, Goerne casts a wary eye on executives who want to
groom ``all-around'' artists, with portfolios ``from Baroque to
Broadway.'' He does not believe that a baritone who has sung
Mozart's Count Almaviva needs to do Don Giovanni, too. He has no
designs on Rossini's Figaro, although he has the notes for the
part. And he turns down offers for Debussy's Pelleas, for which he
has the sensitivity but not the French.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, his discography stretches from Bach's cantata ``Der
Streit Zwischen Phoebus und Pan'' (on Hanssler) to Hanns Eisler's
``Hollywood Songbook'' (London) by way of Schubert's Goethe songs
(London) and ``Winterreise'' (Hyperion). Last December, the Eisler
appeared on the front page of the influential French newspaper Le
Monde as the classical recording of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Goerne does not mind confessing that Bach's quasi-instrumental
treatment of the voice makes his music hard to sing, though you
would not guess it from his performance. He thinks of the Eisler as
a latter-day ``Winterreise'': not linear, as Schubert's is, yet no
less searching on the subject of exile. In November, at the Zurich
Opera, he takes on Berg's ``Wozzeck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and patience are the most important things,'' the singer
reflects. ``In every phase, whether you're 21 or 31, you need to
feel that this moment is the ne plus ultra. You can't tell yourself
that in five years you'll do a piece differently or better. But
five years later, you look back and you can see that you're in a
new place. It's a sign that you've been working hard.''

SERB INCURSION INTO ALBANIA HEIGHTENS WAR FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslav forces shelled and briefly occupied a
small village on the Albanian side of the Albania-Kosovo border
Tuesday, sending waves of fear through a nearby camp of 90,000
refugees, some of whom began fleeing toward the Albanian capital of
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were no casualties and the invaders soon withdrew,
the incident was the most serious along the border in several
weeks, and it raised the spector of expanded fighting while dealing
a blow to hopes that the refugee crisis in the region was coming
under control.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, political support spread for use of
NATO ground troops in Kosovo, if that is necessary for victory. But
US and alliance officials said they still expect to win without
having to invade Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spent much of his day briefing members of
Congress on the crisis and urging them to be patient and give the
air campaign time to work. Participants in the sessions said
Clinton did not rule out the use of ground troops, though the White
House said the president has no intention to use such forces.
</P>
<P>
   In other major developments Tuesday, the 21st day of the effort
to stop Serb-dominated Yugoslav abuses of ethnic Albanians in the
Kosovo province:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme commander of NATO, said in
Brussels the allies are grinding down the Serbian armed forces but
are still far short of delivering a knockout punch. Some elements
of the Serbian military machine ``would recover rather quickly if
we were to let go of our attack . . .,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton said he would ask Congress to fund the military
operation through an emergency supplement, estimated by the
Pentagon at $3 billion to $4 billion through the fiscal year ending
October 1. Administration officials said the Pentagon could soon
call as many as 2,000 US reserve troops, mostly Air Force
personnel, to active duty.
</P>
<P>
   _ NATO said it attacked two major oil refineries in Serbia and
various targets near the Kosovo capital of Pristina in overnight
air strikes. The refineries at Pancevo, east of Belgrade, and in
the northern city of Novi Sad have been attacked several times.
Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug said NATO again attacked
targets around Novi Sad at about 1:20 a.m. on Wednesday. Tanjug
said NATO also attacked the Bistrica hydroelectric plant near the
southern Serb town of Nova Varos on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov met for four hours in Norway, and, while
neither side changed its basic positions, Ivanov's remarks
afterwards were free of the harshness with which Russia has
condemned the NATO bombardment in recent weeks. US officials
suggested Russia could play a constructive role in ending the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Russian government minister said the air campaign had killed
more than 400 civilians in Yugoslavia, and a Yugoslav official
called a missile attack that killed 10 civilians and wounded 16 on
a train a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said the missile was fired at a key bridge between Kosovo
province and the rest of Serbia. A film of the attack, released by
NATO in Brussels, showed the train entering the pilot's view only
an instant before the missile was fired.
</P>
<P>
   _ A defense official in Washington said an aerial photograph
showed signs of a mass grave near the Kosovo town of Velika Krusa,
where a human rights group reported Yugoslav forces apparently shot
and killed 40 ethnic Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 3,000 Kosovo refugees streamed into Albania,
international monitors said. Hundreds also poured into Macedonia,
the biggest group to cross since Yugoslavia closed its borders last
week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said his country
has been notified that Yugoslavia will charge two detained
Australian humanitarian workers with espionage. Aid workers Steve
Pratt and Peter Wallace were detained March 31.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the president Tuesday, Senator John F. Kerry,
a Massachusetts Democrat, said Clinton told members of Congress
that neither Clark nor the NATO allies are calling for use of
ground troops, and the president ``does not personally believe at
this time that they will be necessary to achieve the goal. I also
heard him say... he will accept nothing less than the achievement
of our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said subsequently that the administration had made a
mistake by stating, initially, that use of ground troops would not
be considered and ``that now has been reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Democratic and Republican lawmakers urged Clinton to at
least begin preparations for ground troops so it could be done
quickly if they were deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general feeling among those making the decisions
that it's premature'' to be talking about use of ground troops,
Kerry said, but ``there has been a general movement toward
acceptability'' of such a step. He said he did not know if there
was majority support in Congress for a ground war, ``but there is
definitely majority sentiment that we need to follow this through,
and we need to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional expression of this sentiment could come within two
or three weeks, Kerry said, predicting votes approving American
involvement in the NATO operation would come far in advance of the
60-day deadline specified in the War Powers Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb incursion into Albania occurred at 1 p.m. Tuesday,
Albania time, when about 50 troops entered Kamenica, a village of
six houses separated from Kosovo by a 16-foot-wide road. The Serbs
fired mortars, set four of the houses on fire, then fled back
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Langis Langlois, a field monitor for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said there were no
casualties on either side, and no involvement in the skirmish by
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence from Yugoslavia. Neverthless, Langlois said this was
the most serious of recent skirmishes along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Albania said the Serb push into its territory would carry
consequences. Sokol Gjoka, an Albanian Foreign Ministry official,
said his country would take necessary steps to defend itself, ``in
close coordination with our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamenica's civilian residents left long ago, followed by the
OSCE border station, which moved to Bajram Curri, 12 miles away,
several weeks ago as tensions with the nearby Serb forces rose.
</P>
<P>
   The gravest impact of the incident could be the alarm it is
spreading among refugees from Kosovo who have fled to Albania.
After the firing, unconfirmed reports swept Kukes, where one of the
largest camps of displaced persons from Kosovo is located, that the
Serbs intended to shell the town.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the refugees tried to flee, but many roads in the area
were impassable and few vehicles were available.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said incursions have occurred periodically,
and some suggested the latest incident might actually be a positive
sign for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, the ones that occurred today may be seen
as a sign of the Yugoslav forces' desperation,'' Kenneth H. Bacon
said. ``They have failed in their goal to cut down the KLA...
(which) continues to engage the Yugoslav forces. And they obviously
have increased in size. They have been recruiting a lot from
displaced persons within Albania.''

<P>
   STENKOVAC, Macedonia _ In the week since President Slobodan
Milosevic announced that he had halted offensive military
operations in Kosovo, Serbian paramilitary groups and Yugoslav
soldiers have systematically expelled tens of thousands of
Albanians from a swath of southeastern Kosovo, according to reports
from refugees arriving here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, among a group of 800 Kosovo Albanians allowed to
cross the border near here, described methodical attacks by
Milosevic's forces that cleared out a 10-mile-by-12-mile area that
appears to have little military value.
</P>
<P>
   In each account, Serbian paramilitary units or Yugoslav soldiers
were said to have expelled civilians and burned or shelled homes in
at least 15 villages around the town of Urosevac in southeastern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees described well-organized attacks in which masked
Serbian soldiers descend on an Albanian village, ordered everyone
to leave, and then shot or burned to death the defiant, infirm or
aged who stayed in their homes. It was impossible to determine how
many Albanians were forced from their homes by the attacks, but
roughly 50,000 people lived in the area before NATO bombing began
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that the rural area refugees have
described as the focus of the attack has not been a base of
operations for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian
guerrilla group fighting for independence. And several of the
remote villages attacked did not seem to have a strategic purpose
in terms of thwarting a NATO invasion or rebel efforts to smuggle
supplies into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav forces essentially sealed the border with Macedonia
last week, but the number of people allowed to cross here doubled
over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said that the increase in the number of
refugees crossing into Macedonia in recent days could signal that
vast numbers of Albanian may soon flee Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does sound very clear from the refugees that there is a
much larger number of people who want to come in,'' she said. ``But
we never know what to expect. The last time, it was 40,000 people
in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, two dozen of the refugees arriving in Macedonia
Tuesday described the same type of expulsions by Yugoslav forces
and paramilitary units that previous waves of Albanian refugees
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Luzlim Shala, a 28-year-old teacher, said Yugoslav Army soldiers
in armored personnel carriers descended on his village last Monday.
His village, Mirash, is a quiet, farming village of 1,000 people
nestled at the base of a 2,500-foot mountain and is five miles from
the main road. The soldiers ordered all civilians out of their
homes and burned a handful before departing. That same day, in an
attack potentially carried out by the same group, Yugoslav soldiers
descended on the village of Prelez i Jerlive on the main road
running north of Urocevac, according to Fadil Zeqir, a 32-year-old
agricultural engineer. There, he said, the town's 300 families were
told they had twenty minutes to leave the town. Resident scurried
into the surrounding hills and no homes were burned.

   NEW YORK _ The chanting of the two dozen protesters across the
street from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel could barely be heard over
the din of Manhattan traffic Tuesday, but they persisted, hoping
their message would somehow reach Prime Minister Zhu Rongji as he
conducted meetings inside the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we might not make a difference standing out here,'' said
Sonam Zoksang, a Tibetan-born photographer. ``But at least I am an
annoyance to Zhu right now, and I'm doing it for the 6 million
Tibetans who are suffering because of the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Orderly groups of protesters calling for the independence of
Tibet followed Zhu across New York City Tuesday as he met with
business leaders, politicians and members of the Chinese-American
community. At their peak, protesters numbered about 200 outside the
Hilton Hotel, where Zhu attended a dinner with the United
States-China Business Council. The low-key demonstrations mirrored
the generally muted response of the Chinese-American community to
Zhu's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the visit of President Jiang Zemin in 1997, when Chinese
flags flew along the streets of Chinatown for the duration, there
was much less fanfare for Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   John Young, executive director of the Committee of 100, which he
described as a group that ``promotes friendship between the Chinese
and American people,'' said there was relatively little hoopla
because ``the atmosphere is quite bad right now.'' He was referring
to recent accusations that China tried to influence the 1996
presidential election and that a spy had passed nuclear weapons
secrets from a government weapons laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M.,
to China.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-language newspapers, particularly those with pro-China
stances, have followed Zhu's travels in the United States closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``His visit has been aimed more at business and not so much on
the overseas Chinese,'' said David Chen, of the Chinatown Planning
Council. ``But even though it's been pretty low key in the
community, of course there are segments of the community that are
very enthusiastic that he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngman Lee, president of the United Orient Bank in Chinatown,
said that while Zhu might not be as politically important as Jiang,
``he may be more important because he's the bread-and-butter guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters who shadowed Zhu included people calling for
freedom in Tibet, the release of Mongolian and Tibetan political
prisoners, and recognition of Taiwanese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese have been threatening to use force against Taiwan
for years and we don't want China interfering in our sovereignty,''
said Bor-Cheng Shu, a member of the Taiwanese Collegian, a group of
Taiwanese college students and graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Shieh, the international campaign director of the
Taiwanese Collegian, said the protests were important because ``at
least it shows the world that people in New York are watching
what's going on inside China.''
</P>
<P>
   Thupten Tsering, a Tibetan-born filmmaker who like many Tibetan
exiles was raised in India, said the chanting and waving of Tibetan
flags outside the Waldorf and the Hilton was one of the few ways
Tibetans could send a message to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhu's here as a leader,'' he said. ``If he hears what we're
doing, he'll at least know that people are not keeping silent here
as they are in China. And maybe he can rethink what China's
doing.''

ON THE TECH OF OLD SOUND, HIGH AND NO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   News of Rachmaninoff's return from the grave by way of
technology appeared in this space not long ago and has generated
considerable response. I now have in hand CDs of Granados playing
Granados and Debussy playing Debussy, both thanks to the same kind
of updated player-piano technology that made the great Russian
pianist and composer rematerialize before our ears.
</P>
<P>
   Nimbus Records has sent along Ignaz Friedman playing Liszt and
Chopin in Aeolian's Duo-Art process in the early 1920s. Names like
Aeolian, Welte-Mignon and Ampico are becoming as familiar to music
historians as Forkel, Kochel and C.P.E. Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Some wisdom has it that these are our new intermediaries to
long-dead traditions. Master rolls have been cleaned up, the
mechanical has given way to the computerized, and shiny new pianos
have been tuned up to receive and disburse the ``real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with CDs of these reproducing pianos (for new technology
does deserve a more dignified name) have come examples of
traditional recording archeology: Emil von Sauer recorded live in
Amsterdam and Vienna, and most intriguingly, Ignace Tiegerman
recorded in Cairo, often from his own parlor. Both are on the
Arbiter label of Allan Evans, the organizer of Lincoln Center's
recent series ``Great Pianists of the 20th Century on Film.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who gets anywhere near a record store or catalog knows
that ``historic'' releases are coming from every direction.
Legitimate enterprises like Nimbus' ``Grand Piano'' series and
Philips' giant new survey of the century's best pianists compete
with pirate tapes of murky legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Marston, an up-and-up little company from Pennsylvania, has
given us a series of valuable opera-singer recordings of Tito
Schipa and his long-dead colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Our appetite for the long-ago is growing, and two methods vie
for our custom. One uses technology to bring old performances into
the present. Musician-engineers like John Farmer in London and
Kenneth Caswell in Austin, Texas, make Debussy sound with all the
nuance and resonance of those who interpret him on records today.
</P>
<P>
   The second method comes to us from a distance: scratchy,
distorted, depleted, often translated from one-sided, 78-rpm
shellac or even a cylinder. The sound incorporates the faraway as a
part of the listening experience.
</P>
<P>
   Recording quality becomes a metaphor for the passage of time.
Affixed in our minds is the message that years of change stand
between the original experience and the reproduced one, and that we
should not forget it.
</P>
<P>
   I am often in awe of the reproducing-piano experience, but
oddly, my heart lies more with the cracks, pops and top-heavy sound
of its competitor. As in sex, it is not the open leer and full
disclosure that lodge the heart in the throat; it is the veiled,
the suggested, the withheld, even the forbidden. Prolong the
expectation, set the goal just out of reach, and increase the
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The principal players in my little collection of antiques are
Enrique Granados, representing the reproducing piano, and
Tiegerman, spokesman for the old spinning disk. Hearing the grace
and command of Granados so shinily presented on Caswell's private
label helps one understand why this music can be both so erotic and
so dense with complication. Granados could manage both elements and
does.
</P>
<P>
   Granados was a Catalan and died at sea in 1916, trying to rescue
his wife after their ship had been torpedoed. By way of
Welte-Mignon rolls made in 1912, we hear the wonderfully dark and
overgrown quality of four excerpts from ``Goyescas,'' a work famous
enough in the early years of this century that the composer was
induced to turn it into a mini-opera. We know this music mainly
because of Alicia de Larrocha, one of the few pianists of similar
culture and the requisite technique.
</P>
<P>
   The two Tiegerman CDs have even more of the romance of history.
The Arbiter release is subtitled ``The Lost Legend of Cairo: Radio
and Private Recordings,'' and offers, sometimes in scraps, Brahms
and Saint-Saens concertos and the Franck ``Symphonic Variations,''
taken from Egyptian radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are tapes of Chopin from homes of students and Tiegerman's
studio. Especially, there are stunning, elegant performances of
Brahms' B minor Capriccio (Op. 76, No. 2) and B flat minor
Intermezzo (Op. 117, No. 2).
</P>
<P>
   Why Cairo? Why, indeed, Tiegerman? Born in Poland in 1893, he
was Friedman's star pupil and so admired among his colleagues that
Horowitz considered him the principal rival of his Berlin years. By
1931 Europe's political climate and Tiegerman's asthma had driven
him to emigrate. A trip to New York had so unnerved him that he
went south, not west. Breathing in the friendlier air of Egypt, he
began a music academy and became an honored local figure.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on his playing and teaching abilities still filter down
through students, including the scholar and author Edward Said, who
is also a musician. Tiegerman died in 1968, a pianist who might
have dominated the world's stages but comes to us as a shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Is it perverse to find this shadow more human than the cryogenic
nuances of Granados unthawed? Caswell's eerie cleanliness is
beautiful, but it tries to tell us that those 87 years never
passed, that by unfreezing a long-ago present it becomes the
present all over again.
</P>
<P>
   This is the troubling paradox of the reproducing-piano
experience: that it is both more real and less real. The sound
lives, but the past is denied, wiped away. All those years between
us and Granados have changed us and our image of him, and maybe we
need the scratches and fluctuating turntable speeds to tell us so.

AN INCUBATOR'S CHILDREN COME HOME TO SAY THANKS

 Allen Hughes is a former music and dance critic of The New York
Times.  
 By ALLEN HUGHES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the not too distant past it was my good fortune to
chance upon the performance of an arresting, unconventional work. A
luminous fabric comprising music both vocal and instrumental,
literary fragments from varied centuries and civilizations, and
everyday movement functioning as dance, it projected an
irresistible aura of good will and celebrated the wonderful power
of artistic persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the best of reasons, it reminded me instantly of the
Judson Dance Theater, that whirlpool of restless creative spirits
performing at Judson Memorial Church at Washington Square in the
1960s. This was not just because the performance I was experiencing
was being given in the St. James Memorial Chapel of Union
Theological Seminary and had been conceived and directed by
Meredith Monk, but because its unrelated elements had been
juxtaposed so imaginatively into an expressive whole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. The Judson dance activity of the 60s was
taking place in a period of general youthful rebellion, and the
rambunctious avant-garde goings-on in the name of dance seldom
achieved anything approaching an ``expressive whole.'' But
combinations of wildly disparate ideas and doings were commonplace,
and occasionally they coalesced into something communicative.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 37 years after they first began enjoying Judson's
hospitality, a group of those formerly young would-be creators, who
found performance and exhibition space when they needed it most,
are expressing their gratitude in ``No Limits _ A Celebration of
Freedom and Art to Benefit Judson Memorial Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Judson Dance Theater are joined by those
of the Judson Poets' Theater and visual artists whose works were
displayed in the Judson Gallery. Some 75 dancers-choreographers,
poets, painters and sculptors are expected to participate in events
that began at the church last Friday and will run through this
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 works donated by artists are being offered for
sale, and dance programs will be presented on Thursday and Friday
evenings. Among the dances scheduled are reconstructions of Yvonne
Rainer's ``Trio A With Flags'' and David Gordon's ``Chair Dance,''
new works by Kenneth King, Gus Solomons Jr., Wendy Perron with Dan
Froot, and a duet performed by Sara Rudner and Douglas Dunn, who
will be dancing together for the first time in more than 20 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rainer, an organizer _ with Ruth Emerson and Steve Paxton _
of the Judson Dance Theater in 1962, became one of its most
prolific choreographers and possibly the least concerned with
audience response to what she did. Sometimes her extreme
self-absorption and aloof indifference to the public seemed almost
hostile. But some of the group movement in the Meredith Monk
performance at St. James Chapel brought back memories of an oddly
affecting work by Ms. Rainer.
</P>
<P>
   Entitled ``We Shall Run,'' it had a dozen people running to the
music of the ``Tuba Miram'' from the Berlioz Requiem. They were not
professional dancers, and there were no costumes; whatever they
wore that day, they wore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is how I reported it in The Times: ``Sometimes they ran as
a pack, sometimes they divided into groups, sometimes they huddled
for an instant, but only as a respite from the gentle rhythmic
running that almost became hypnotic before it ended. And all the
while, the singing of Berlioz went on.'' Nothing could have seemed
more illogical as an artistic concept, but it worked, it really
worked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That performance took place in Judson's gym, but most of those I
recall were given in the sanctuary upstairs, a big open space
without fixed church pews. There, one evening, ``a big
chandelierlike construction of self-playing drums rose from the
lowered position in which it had been playing (agitatedly but
quietly) in almost total darkness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A spotlight focused abruptly on a white curtain,'' I
continued. ``An imperious whirring sound arose and through the
curtain, Fred Herko flashed in, looking beatific. He wore black
tights, a yellow-and-blue jersey with JUDSON emblazoned across the
front, and, on one foot, a black shoe and his means of locomotion _
a roller skate. Continuing to look beatific, he skated around the
floor for a time, moving his arms and the unencumbered foot through
various balletic positions. Before vanishing behind the white
curtain he did a bit of toe-dancing _ roller skate and bare foot
notwithstanding.'' This was part of something he called
``Binghamton Birdie.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herko, whose work in the very first Judson Dance Theater event
on July 6, 1962, was ``Once or Twice a Week I Put On Sneakers to Go
Uptown,'' always appeared to me to be one of the cheeriest and
least complicated of the early Judsonites, but by 1965 he was being
memorialized by James Waring in a Judson dance program. He had
jumped through a window to his death, possibly as a result of
taking amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   He was, I think, one of the most naturally gifted of the early
Judson dance people. Some of the others, it seemed to me, could get
hung up on theorizing. Ms. Rainer may have been one of those; in
1973 she gave up dance altogether to go into filmmaking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one thing you could be sure of at a Judson dance event was
that matters of audience comfort would never trouble the
performers. If you were lucky and arrived early, the reward might
be a platform, a bench or maybe an odd chair on which to sit.
Otherwise you stood. But, of course, you could never be sure before
you got there which way you would want to be facing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary's usable floor space had no real front or back or
sideways, and the performers could deal with it as they wished. In
any case, standing did not seem too bad when the proceedings proved
interesting in one way or another. But because everything was not
only experimental but new (as long as I was a Judson regular,
nothing was ever repeated after its initial performances), and some
of the stuff was simply boring. Quality control did not seem to
figure in the scheduling of works, at least not quality as
conceived by the average viewer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a group, these young choreographers _ who also included,
among others, Elaine Summers, Deborah Hay and Lucinda Childs _
disdained the conventions not only of classical ballet and modern
dance as represented by, say, Martha Graham, but also the artistic
practices, if not the movement technique, of Merce Cunningham, the
teacher of many of them.
</P>
<P>
   And since they were rebelling against so much, they had to forgo
borrowing almost anything related to theatrical dance unless the
intent was to make fun of it. This left them with a lot to invent,
too much in some cases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Dada and the casual theories of John Cage suggested that
training and skill in an art were not necessarily required to be
creative in it, some painters and composers got into the Judson
Dance act. Some of their pieces could have been identified in the
programs as ``happenings'' (the name then given to what would now
be called ``performance''), but they were not.
</P>
<P>
   These nondance people also took part in other people's
creations. The most famous of them was the painter Robert
Rauschenberg. I remember seeing him in works by Steve Paxton, but I
do not recall that he had charisma as a performer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I cannot say who was most addicted to multimedia
experimentation, but there was a lot of it. Bits of movies, both
homemade and commercial, projections of almost anything
photographable, tapes of music of all kinds, of sounds of nature
and the street, of speeches by the famous and otherwise, the
playing of random radio shows _ all, in varied combinations, were
familiar elements of the dances at Judson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Except for The New York Times and The Village Voice (with Jill
Johnston), the New York dance press ignored what was going on at
Judson Church in the early years, declaring that it was not dance,
period. But word began to get around that something vital was
involved there, and, before long, opportunities to perform
elsewhere were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first two years, several venues opened up for various
groups of Judsonites in and around New York (one at a farm in New
Jersey), and early in 1964 there was an engagement as far afield as
the Once Festival in Ann Arbor, Mich. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over time, new participants _ including Monk, King and Solomons
_ joined Judson Dance, but in 1964, the fervor, intensity and
inventiveness that characterized its beginnings had begun to
dissipate as opportunities to perform elsewhere increased. And in
1968, dance performances at Judson Church came to an end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perceptive writing about avant-garde dance of the time was
beginning to be found in a variety of publications by 1965. Among
them was a monograph on dance in New York destined for a German
anthology. The author was George Jackson, an experienced dance
observer, who cited with enthusiasm the ``living dolls'' at
Judson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Living dolls! Did they merit that encomium? Yes, I think so.
Unpredictable, irrepressible and, at times, exasperating they
surely were. But they managed to be entertaining more often than
not, and I feel that _ for the most part _ they sincerely believed
in what they were doing. They burst straitjackets of dance in their
time, and the effects are still with us today. Who could ask for
more?

 &HT;    FEMA officials tour tornado destruction
 &HT;    By Joann Rouse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN CO., Ohio _ Investigators from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency toured the Warren County townships of Deerfield,
Salem and Hamilton on Tuesday to assess Friday's tornado damage.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft's administration hopes to get results of the
federal government's preliminary damage assessment in the next few
days, so Taft can decide whether to ask Washington to provide
federal loans and grants for rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will have to declare the region a disaster
area to release federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county's had at least $2.2 million of damage,'' said
county emergency services director Frank Young. ``About $1.5
million of that is in Deerfield, the rest is in Hamilton and about
1 or 2 percent is in Salem.''
</P>
<P>
   The twister destroyed six homes in Deerfield Twp. and one in
Hamilton Twp., according to the final official count.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado also caused severe damage to 10 Deerfield Twp. homes
and two homes in Hamilton Twp. Between 30 and 40 Deerfield Twp.
homes suffered minor damage, as did 25 in Hamilton Twp. and seven
in Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   During the windshield tour, one FEMA team assessed damage to
individual homes and another team searched for damage to public
structures. Officials said no public property damage had been
reported yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be showing them around (because) we're hoping we get a
declaration,'' Young said. ``We already had the state and county
declaration to get FEMA.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor will use information collected on the tour to
support his claim that the combined city, county and state
resources are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will then submit a written request to the president
through the FEMA regional office.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA also provides the president with an analysis and a
recommended course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel from Carlisle and Mason said they hope they
can bill the federal government for overtime hours used after
helping the affected townships. But FEMA officials said they may do
so only if their mutual aid agreements compensates officers for
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA does not reimburse for services that are not usually paid,
federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   County and local officials - including building inspectors who
said they will waive the inspection fees for reconstructed houses -
are compiling a list of costs they hope to bill to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get the declaration, the paperwork will really be flying
then,'' Young said.

Raising bar is necessity for Rockets
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it odd to hear the U.S. Davis Cup team's recent triumph
over Great Britain referred to as an inspiring upset?
</P>
<P>
   Is that what men's tennis in America has come to? After all, the
Brits haven't reared a male Grand Slam champion in more than six
decades.
</P>
<P>
   And it was equally strange to hear the TV types Monday night
gushing over the Rockets' win at Minnesota as a breakthrough _
their first ``quality'' victory on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota? Is that what the Rockets have come to?
</P>
<P>
   Afraid so.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the maturing Timberwolves are a respectable outfit.
They were five games over .500, despite a recent swoon, until the
Rockets hit town. But, for a team with reasonable NBA championship
aspirations, the Rockets' standards require a significant upward
adjustment. Particularly because the winning script in Minneapolis
once again included that dreaded
hanging-on-for-dear-life-at-the-finish wrinkle.
</P>
<P>
   A comfortable lead, as is usually the case, begat a late swoon
and there the Rockets were, unsure of their fate until the waning
seconds. When Rudy Tomjanovich said a loss would have been
``devastating,'' he probably understated the case.
</P>
<P>
   On stage and screen, dramatic conclusions never are bad. On the
hardwood, if they are unnecessary, they only contribute to
self-doubt and excessive wear and tear on the body. The impact of
the latter, of course, is magnified in this mad scramble of a
season, especially with a talent core as old as Houston's.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley, not long removed from knee surgery, should have
been comfortably ensconced under a towel at the close Monday
evening, not shooting clutch free throws and then having to make a
crucial steal (granted, that bit of heroics became necessary
because he missed a couple of clutch free throws) to secure the
win.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets must find a way to cut themselves slack over their
13 remaining games. The fact nine of them are at home and a 10th is
an afternoon start in San Antonio is fortuitous scheduling, but it
seems an easy blowout tonight against Vancouver with Portland
coming in 24 hours later is beyond obligatory.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the crazy lineup Rudy put on the floor to start the
second quarter of the Utah game? It was Bryce Drew, Sam Mack, Matt
Bullard, Antoine Carr and Othella Harrington, and that's who should
play most of the fourth quarter against the hapless Grizzlies, a
7-31 shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets also have two games remaining against both the
Mavericks and the Clippers, and three of them are at Compaq Center.
Combined with the nine off days sprinkled semi-liberally through
the season's presumed soft landing at Denver on May 5, the Rockets
should have plenty of energy to spare for the more demanding tests
against Seattle, Phoenix and Minnesota plus, of course, the
measuring-stick faceoffs against the Trail Blazers, the Spurs, the
Lakers and the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, the Rockets have a 1-6 record against the latter
quartet, their alleged peer group in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about the Rockets sending messages, either. It's not
about them proving anything to the bad guys. It's about proving
something to themselves. Until they whip the good teams, they can't
be sure they can. Simple-minded stuff perhaps, but this is how the
human mind works.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie triumvirate of Cuttino Mobley, Michael Dickerson and
Drew doesn't know how it feels to beat the elite because it has no
reference point, save for the lonely W against Portland. The
superkids need positive reinforcement before the playoffs, or they
won't be ready for the entirely different level of intensity that's
going to smack them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Scottie Pippen is in a similar boat. He might have a
hand full of rings plus one, but it's apparent his remarkable
Chicago experience has had little carry-over effect on his second
life in Houston. The same as the rookies, he has no self-validating
point of reference to make him believe he can win here, no matter
how often he might have won there.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has become a completely different player in Rockets
pinstripes. Even his natural instincts appear stifled, if not
missing. But, if he could produce just one huge game against a team
that it's not so easy to be huge against, perhaps muscle memory
would kick in, the light would come on, and he would find his
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie's teammates try to help. Barkley insists Pippen needs to
take at least 15 shots per game to be in the flow and that he would
be honored to surrender a share of his. Yet, against Minnesota,
Pippen launched a mere six attempts _ to Barkley's 12 _ and played
just 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder about Pippen's back. If the problem is he's in pain,
then his underperforming is understandable, and there might be no
salvation possible. Still, we keep hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Just as we keep hoping the Rockets can learn how to protect a
lead _ and figure out a way to defeat a team worth defeating.

 &HT;    First lady attends campaign dinner for husband's defender
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton thanked
U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler for ``standing up against the right wing
fanatics'' who wanted to impeach her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was here for a campaign dinner for Wexler, a Boca Raton
Democrat who was one of the president's most ferocious supporters
during his impeachment hearing and trial.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the House Judiciary Committee, Wexler often shouted
into the microphone accusing Republicans of attempting to oust the
president because they despise him, not because he had committed an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is the first elected official that I was ever
able to believe in,'' Wexler told a crowd of several hundred at the
Boca Raton Hotel and Resort. ``What happened to him was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Wexler broached the question that was on everyone's mind,
especially the many former New Yorkers who live in his district:
Will Mrs. Clinton run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by
Patrick Moyniham of New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a congressman who represents more former New Yorkers then
any other congressman in the country,'' Wexler said with a wink,
``I have standing to say that people in this room and New Yorkers
all over the world wish her very well in her pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton acted as if she were about to say something serious
about the possibility of running and then laughed, saying, ``I
won't go there.'' Noting that Wexler wins his district by large
margins she added, ``It's clear he could send a few of you back
since his margin is so enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   She then spent much of her 20-minute speech defending the record
of her husband, saying that he has worked diligently on issues that
are important to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding the audience that while America is prospering, people
in Kosovo are dying, she said it is tragic that as the century
comes to a close the world must face another crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day she attended a Yom Hashoah ceremony
remembering the Holocaust at the Jewish Federation in Boca Raton.
In a somber voice, she said, ``There has always lurked in the human
soul a dark evil.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, she said, ``the people you see on television are not
abstractions, they are mothers and daughters, parents and
grandparents.'' She said the United States and NATO cannot afford
to ignore the atrocities there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe right now, inhumanity and evil have once again
raised its fists,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Kenneth Brander of Boca Raton told a crowd of more than
2,000 that when he sees the refugees on trains it reminds him of
the Holocaust. ``When I see the children I see the face of my
father,'' he said. ``When I see their parents I see the faces of my
grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dare not forget the Holocaust,'' he said. ``And today, we
dare not be silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yom Hashoah, an annual ceremony to remember the millions of Jews
killed during the Holocaust began at sundown on Monday and ended at
sundown on Tuesday. During the ceremony at the Jewish Federation
Center, survivors of the Holocaust, people who lost members of
their family and young Jews lighted candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need young people,'' Clinton said, ``not only to hear the
stories of the Holocaust but to tell the stories.''

INTEL'S RESULTS SLIGHTLY BEAT EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. reported Tuesday that first-quarter
earnings increased 57 percent, slightly higher than analysts'
estimates, with slower sales offset by improved profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had braced for a disappointment after Compaq Computer
Corp. announced Friday that its results would fall far below
estimates. Intel's relatively strong performance is one indication
that Compaq's problems are solely its own _ stemming from issues
like the integration of Digital Equipment Corp., rather than the
mark of a broad slowdown in PC sales.
</P>
<P>
   The results were released after the market closed. Shares of
Intel closed Tuesday at $60.50, down 75 cents in Nasdaq trading.
But in after-hours trading, it fell to $57.75. Analysts said
investors were reacting to sales growth that was slower than
expected. The first quarter is typically down seasonally from the
fourth, and Intel had said in January that it expected sales to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a quarter where investors really fretted over results
and everybody assumed the worst, but the actual results are
considerably better than that,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst
with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Relative to our own
expectations, sales are a little bit below where we thought they
would be, but that is consistent with the environment. The offset
was that margins were a little bit better, which shows Intel's
control of the cost structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel warned that it expected revenue for the second quarter to
be flat to slightly down, because of seasonal factors. The company
also said it expects its gross profit margin in the second quarter
to be about the same as it was in the first quarter _ 59 percent.
Intel said its gross margin expectation for 1999 is 57 percent,
plus or minus a few points.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter, Intel reported earnings of $2 billion, or
57 cents a diluted share, up 57 percent from $1.27 billion, or 36
cents a share in the first quarter of 1998. Revenues rose 18
percent, to $7.1 billion from $6 billion in the first quarter of
1998. All per-share amounts have been adjusted to reflect Monday's
2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif.,
to earn 55 cents a share, according to First Call Corp. Analysts
said income from the sale of investments added about 2 cents a
share to Intel's earnings. Intel sold some or all of its stakes in
Broadcast.com Inc., Inktomi Corp. and Cnet Inc. during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with our substantial year-over-year growth in
profitability resulting from our cost-control efforts,'' said Intel
president and chief executive Craig Barrett in a statement. ``As we
expected, revenue declined from the prior quarter reflecting a
seasonally slower selling period.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Intel's strong margins reflect not only cost
controls, but the success of the company's strategy to segment the
market. By offering the Celeron at the low end, Pentium II and
Pentium III in the middle, and the Pentium Xeon at the high end of
the market, Intel can fight a price war with Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. for the below-$1,000 personal
computer market, while maintaining premiums on high performance
chips for work stations and servers.
</P>
<P>
   But competition at the high end of the chip market should
increase as Advanced Micro Devices increases production volumes of
its fastest chips. At the same time, demand could stall because
Microsoft Corp.'s newest version of Windows NT has been delayed,
and many corporations see little reason to upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are predicting that the pricing for
microprocessors will soften further in the second quarter.

   ECONOMISTS STARTING TO SEE A PAYOFF FROM TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, most of the nation's leading economists
have questioned the economic payoff from information technology _
the billions upon billions spent each year by companies and
households on everything from computers to software to cellular
phones.
</P>
<P>
   But now economists are wondering whether higher productivity
growth _ averaging about 2 percent in the last three years, roughly
double the pace from 1973 to 1995 _ is the long-awaited
confirmation that the nation's steadily rising investment in
computers and communications is finally paying off.
</P>
<P>
   SEVERAL COMPANIES IN PHONE DEALS
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, the maker of data-networking equipment, announced
a $2 billion acquisition of Geotel Communications, expanding into
telephone software, while two of the biggest makers of traditional
phone systems, Ericsson and Northern Telecom, said they would
acquire private data-networking companies. Shares of Geotel
Communications rose $11.6875, to $55.9375.
</P>
<P>
   MOTOROLA'S PROFIT INCREASES 20 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Motorola said that its first-quarter profit rose 20 percent,
helped by cost cuts and improved sales of mobile phones and chips.
</P>
<P>
   BELL ATLANTIC SAYS MARKET IS OPEN
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, in a meticulous march toward the $80 billion
long-distance market, told New York state regulators that it had
fully opened its network to competition, as required.
</P>
<P>
   DOW GAINS, BUT OTHER AVERAGES FALL
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 55.5 points, to
10,395.01, another record, but other gauges slipped as investors
took profits, especially in technology issues. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.82 points, to 1,349.82, while the
Nasdaq composite index declined 15.31 points, to 2,583.50.

   A PROPOSAL TO CUT AUTO POLLUTION
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is preparing to announce as early as
next week that it will require cleaner gasoline and tougher
pollution standards for autos, including forcing large sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks to meet the same emission
standards as cars.

   INQUIRY OF AMERICA ONLINE SOUGHT

<P>
   At least seven former volunteers who helped maintain America
Online's virtual community have asked the Labor Department to look

   BARCLAYS CHIEF QUITS, CITING HEALTH
</P>
<P>
   Barclays, Britain's second-largest bank, is looking for its
fourth chief executive in six months after Michael O'Neill resigned
because of ill health, touching off speculation that the bank may
be vulnerable to a takeover. O'Neill, 53, fainted twice last week

 &HT;    Tait is moveable mountain
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As a kid growing up in Tempe, Ariz., John Tait
was Mr. Softy on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Too much baby fat and too little coordination kept him on the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if his friends in Tempe's Pop Warner League could see him
now, they'd find that things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The pillow-soft cushion in his midsection has disappeared,
replaced by rock-hard muscle. And he has turned all that
awkwardness into elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the kid is all grown up. Now the 6-foot-6, 310-pounder from
Brigham Young _ he bench presses 470 pounds, squats 660 and runs
the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds _ is poised to be the first
offensive left tackle taken in the NFL draft on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a big, clumsy kid who got beat up in practice,''
Tait said. ``I was always big, so I had to play against kids two
years older. I wanted to quit, but my dad wouldn't let me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was even involved in a protest because me and another kid
weren't playing. Each of us was supposed to play five plays. We
didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tait was never be accused of being lazy, however. So while he
was developing his skills at Tempe McClintock High School, the big
boys came calling.
</P>
<P>
   He chose BYU over UCLA, Texas, Colorado and Arizona State
because the Cougars' offensive line coach, Roger French, impressed
him.
</P>
<P>
   After a redshirt freshman year, he took off on his Mormon
mission for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people go to place like China,'' he said. ``I went to
Knoxville, Tenn., where there was barbecue and pinto beans. I was
one of those guys on bicycles wearing badges. Whenever people there
saw me, the first thing they asked, because of my size, was if I
played football. Football is a religion there. It was a great
icebreaker. We ended up talking about the Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an intense learning experience, two years of being on
your own. Your focus was totally on serving other people. But some
people, when they come back from their mission, are not nearly as
good or don't have that desire. I had to relearn how to play. But
none of that desire was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the Provo, Utah, campus in 1996, he needed
to add 20 pounds to return to his playing weight of 270. He gained
that, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Tait won the starting job at left tackle that spring and didn't
leave the lineup until the end of the '98 season _ his junior year.
He earned first-team All-Western Athletic Conference honors two
straight seasons, then decided to go to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people said, `Stay for the Outland (Trophy),' '' he said.
``But I'm not big on that stuff. I was getting good reports back
from the NFL and thought I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft expert Mel Kiper Jr. calls Tait the eighth best player in
the draft and predicts he'll be the first offensive lineman chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Another expert, Jerry Jones, said Tait is so valuable because he
does more than just protect a right-handed quarterback's blind
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the fact he's enormous and moves quite well, what
differentiates him from other BYU linemen is he can run block,''
Jones said. ``BYU guys make wonderful pass blockers. Some think
that's all they can do, but this kid is an exception to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Tait be nervous on Saturday? No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy the whole thing,'' he said. ``And I'll play
anywhere. They're writing checks. I'm strapping it on.''

CLINTON'S COMMENTS AFTER CONGRESSIONAL MEETING ON KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: item in double parentheses should be set in brackets) 
 (ac) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from President Clinton's statement on
Kosovo at the White House Tuesday and from an exchange with
reporters, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   OPENING STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   I have just had a long and very good meeting with a large number
of members of Congress to discuss America's effort, along with our
NATO allies, to stand against ethnic cleansing, save lives and
bring peace in Kosovo. I'm grateful for the support we have
received from members of Congress from both parties, and also very
grateful for the questions, the comments, the advice that came out
of this and previous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Our objectives here are clear but I want to restate them. We
want the Serb forces out of Kosovo. We want the refugees to be able
to go home, protected by an international security force as they
work toward self-government. This is Holocaust Remembrance Day. On
this day let us resolve not to let this ethnic cleansing and
killing by Mr. Milosevic go unanswered. ...
</P>
<P>
   Our campaign is diminishing and grinding down Mr. Milosevic's
military capabilities. We have weakened Serbia's air defenses and
command and control. We have reduced his ability to move, sustain
and supply the war machine in Kosovo. We have damaged his
refineries and diminished his capacity to produce ammunition. We
are striking now at his tanks and at his artillery and have
destroyed half his advanced MiG-29 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are taking our allied air campaign to the next level,
with more aircraft in the region, with a British carrier joining
our U.S.S. Roosevelt and a French carrier in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Our humanitarian effort is also increasing to meet the daunting
challenge of providing food and shelter for the hundreds of
thousands of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   All of us would like the conflict to end, especially for the
suffering people of Kosovo. We would also like to end the trials
for the people of Serbia who have been forced into confrontation by
a cynical leader who has no regard for their welfare, and who I am
absolutely convinced has not even told them the truth about what he
has done to the people of Kosovo. We and our allies did everything
possible to end this crisis peacefully. But now we are at arms. We
and our allies are united on this point: We must stay the course
and persist until we prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Again I say: Mr. Milosevic can end this crisis right now by
withdrawing his forces, permitting deployment of an international
security force and allowing the unconditional return of all
displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
   As I told the members of Congress today, I will shortly submit
to them an emergency supplemental budget request to fund our
military operation's ammunition needs while maintaining our
military readiness, to provide urgently needed assistance to the
front-line states, nations bordering Kosovo that are struggling to
preserve their own stability as they cope with refugees and turmoil
in the region. ...
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</P>
<P>
   Q. ((inaudible)) inside Kosovo, can you reach those refugees?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ Well, the real answer to that question is that we are
_ it is a very hard one and we are working on it. We're quite
concerned about the hundreds of thousands of refugees in Kosovo.
The ones that are out of Kosovo, there's a big problem in providing
food and housing and medical care, dealing with the ones that are
just dehydrated. But at least we are now organized and we're moving
on that. There's a much bigger problem with the people within
Kosovo and there are any number of problems for _ with providing
aid from the air.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, there is the possibility that if we air drop
supplies they won't actually get to the refugees, that Serbian
forces will take them up. Secondly, there is the problem of risk to
our aircraft of going into Kosovo air space to try to air drop the
supplies. So we are looking at both of those problems and what can
be done about them and what other options we have. It is a huge
problem; for the last couple of days we've been working very hard
on it. As soon as we have more to say on it, I'll be glad to make
the appropriate announcements. ...

   Los Angeles became Internet World's West Coast home in 1997
after the event outgrew convention facilities in San Jose, said
Jack Powers, Penton's conference chairman. Now, only the fall
Internet World in New York attracts more exhibitors and visitors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For all its girth, however, few local companies are
participating in the conference this year, in part because the show
leans heavily toward Internet software firms.
</P>
<P>
   Others can't -- or don't -- want to pay the entry fees, which
can reach tens of thousands of dollars for exhibit space. Officials
with Westlake Village, Calif.-based Safe Surf, a maker of filtering
software to control children's access to adult content on the
Internet, said that with a limited marketing budget they must pick
and choose their trade shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually we would (share) a booth with another company but we
just decided this year to focus on smaller, family-oriented
shows,'' said Safe Surf Chairman Ray Soular. Instead of exhibiting
at Internet World, he said, Safe Surf executives will try to meet
with others exhibiting at or attending the show in informal
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   For others, however, the exposure the conference can bring makes
it worth the relatively high price of admission. Westlake
Village-based NetZero Inc., a free Internet service provider, will
be sponsoring a conference room and working the crowds of industry
executives and media to spread the word about the seven-month old
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, a lot of key folks come out,'' said Janet Daly, a
spokeswoman for Net Zero. ``You have the chance to raise your
profile among key industry folks, so it's worth it, absolutely.''

MRV HOLDS ONTO MOST OF SURPRISE GAIN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHATSWORTH, Calif. -- Shares in telecommunications equipment
maker MRV Communications treaded water Tuesday after unexpectedly
gaining 36 percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
   MRV stock closed at $8.4375, down 25 cents, after 2 million
shares changed hands in a day of trading volume roughly nine times
the issue's 30-day average.
</P>
<P>
   In similarly heavy trading Monday, MRV shares rose 36 percent,
leaving armchair analysts wondering just what had happened. With no
official word out of the company, speculation in Internet chat
rooms ran to complex put-option executions and possible secret
product news.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said analyst Vivek Rao at Gruntal &AMP; Co., there was no
single factor that pushed the shares so high, but a combination of
events. Most significant, Rao said, was the fact that the company's
new network router for Linux-based computer systems was being
well-received in trade journals. The company announced the product
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up also was influenced by a public offering last Friday
that gave Extreme Networks, a company that makes equipment similar
to MRV's products, a $2 billion-plus market capitalization. ``That
was clearly encouraging it,'' Rao said. ``The (MRV) stock is cheap
relative to some of the other companies now being traded.''
</P>
<P>
   MRV will announce earnings later this month. While most analysts
expect the company to report a net loss, they see this as a
turn-around quarter just before MRV is back in the black. Rao said
he expects the company to report a quarterly loss of 4 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, MRV officials were clearly pleased Tuesday
with the renewed interest in their firm. In particular, Chief
Financial Officer Edmund Glazer said MRV's entry into the Linux
market could lead to a huge new business for the company, a fact
investors have apparently recognized. Linux is a free, open-source
operating system gaining popularity among corporate network
operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have an enormous potential for us, certainly enough
for us to be excited,'' Glazer said.
</P>
<P>
   MRV makes network switching equipment and fiber optic systems
that improve the performance of networks. The company saw its share
price melt last year after revenues were seriously hurt by weak
demand in Europe and delays in the launch of new products. Weaker
margins also took a toll while the company spent more heavily on
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that, from an all-time high of $38.75 in
September 1997, shares fell to $7.5625 in late August 1998 and
continued to lose ground intermittently, closing the year at
$6.1875.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Artwise, was this really the American century? We take the
cliche for granted because, well, because we are so arrogant. Never
mind that it's just a catch phrase cooked up in 1941 by Henry Luce,
the most thoroughly unreconstructed of American chauvinists, partly
out of missionary zeal and partly to sell his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   We accept it because, let's admit it, we're proud to have taken
over the planet. We only feign embarrassment that people living in
remotest Borneo drink Coke and like Mike. Better us, we think,
than, say, the French, heaven forbid, because then we would all
have to speak their language and eat their food and have shorter
work weeks and maybe even live in Paris for a while, and wouldn't
that be awful?
</P>
<P>
   The American Century is the title of what looks to be an immense
two-part survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the first
part of which, covering the years 1900 to 1950, will open Friday.
It's one of several century-ending extravaganzas (the Modern is
planning another). And no doubt they all, to some degree, will
confront the cliche of American predominance in visual art,
deciding what it means and whether it really makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Why doubt it? For starters, of course, because during half the
century not even most Americans cared about American art. Artists
like Hartley, O'Keeffe, Weston, Dove, Demuth, Davis, Lawrence,
Benton and Marin made little impact here or elsewhere. Their
profiles have gone up considerably in the United States as we've
had more chances to see their work, but they're undervalued and
still hardly ever exhibited elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   People abroad mostly regard them as provincials, the way we
regard artists like Ben Nicholson and Stanley Spencer as provincial
British painters. It may be unfair but it's the case. John Marin
was perhaps the most admired American artist in the United States
at midcentury. I'd wager that Marin today is no more familiar even
to an art-savvy European than Francis Gruber and Cornelis Corneille
are to us.
</P>
<P>
   So when we boast about the American century in art, we really
mean the American half-century. Then we must figure out what, if
anything, is specifically American about American art during the
last 50 years, because otherwise we easily make the mistake of
confusing the quality of American art with the impact of the
American dollar: to acknowledge that we have dominated the
marketplace and the media since World War II is not to say that the
visual art that we have produced has been truly distinctive and,
more than anyone else's art, has shaped worldwide taste.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question about the influence everywhere of jazz and
rock and Hollywood films. But we're talking here about painting and
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   And from the beginning, as Robert Hughes has written, American
art has oscillated between dependence and invention. Another way of
putting it is that American art, for much of this century, couldn't
decide how American it ought to be. On the one hand were the
regionalists (John Sloan, George Luks, George Bellows, Grant Wood,
John Steuart Curry and so on).
</P>
<P>
   And on the other hand were the modernists, who, whether they
were pure abstractionists or Surrealists, pursued a European model
of what you might call pan-nationalism or universalism (Burgoyne
Diller, Ilya Bolotowsky, Peter Blume, O. Louis Guglielmi). We
devalued them both: American art seemed to us either too derivative
of Europe or too local, a contradiction that we never quite
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Then Abstract Expressionism came along, and it was soon touted
as the first distinctly American brand of modernism. America, it
was said, had finally invented an abstract art that owed nothing to
Europe. The American century had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least, that's the standard account. Politically minded art
historians during recent decades have added to it the notion, which
has become fashionable, that artists like Pollock and de Kooning
were then aggressively exported to further an American agenda
during the Cold War. Abstract Expressionism, according to these
historians, became a form of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that the Abstract Expressionists enjoyed a freedom
of expression that was not possible in the Soviet Union. So the
United States government and the Museum of Modern Art conspired to
promote them abroad, in exhibitions like the Venice Biennale and
the Sao Paulo Bienal, and pretty soon American art had insinuated
itself around the globe along with other American products.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Looking back, the Abstract Expressionists don't seem
quite so all-American. We can see, for example, how much de
Kooning, the Dutchman who sneaked into the United States as a
stowaway in 1926 and changed the course of art here, continued to
owe to previous Dutch painters like Hals.
</P>
<P>
   And there's not much strong evidence that the Abstract
Expressionists were ever embraced by the government during the
early 50s; nor were they extensively pushed elsewhere until they
had already begun to be supplanted here by a new generation that
included Johns, Rauschenberg, Lichtenstein and Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   The first Pollock retrospective to tour Europe was in 1958. By
then he was already dead. No one abroad seemed terribly impressed,
anyway. Shows in Europe of new American art were panned throughout
the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans to achieve global fame were probably the Pop
artists during the 1960s, whose success was obviously linked to the
ascendance of American pop culture generally. But it's useful to
recall that British artists like Richard Hamilton, Malcolm Morley
and Eduardo Paolozzi, and Germans like Sigmar Polke and Gerhard
Richter, at the same time and for different reasons, were also
using pop images in their work.
</P>
<P>
   So you could say that cutting-edge American art during the early
60s did not so much dominate or shape world taste as dovetail with
it, or with a part of it. Meanwhile, America, having developed an
inflated ego, no longer seemed to feel it had to pay the same close
attention to what was going on elsewhere, and it wasn't until the
1980s, when a booming art market buoyed interest in almost
everything, that many myopic Americans finally noticed what Polke
and Richter (and also Beuys and Kiefer and various others) had been
up to.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on the generation that emerged during the late 50s
and early 60s, it's a guess that internationally speaking, Polke
and Richter will be remembered with Rauschenberg, Warhol and Johns
among the major figures, and that American art will seem neither as
distinct nor as dominant as we tend to think it was.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prognosticating, of course, is a risky enterprise, but while
we're at it, let me also suggest that the most singular
agglomeration of Americans in the century may turn out to be the
ones who came next: the Conceptualists, Minimalists and
Post-Minimalists, among them Donald Judd, Bruce Nauman, Eva Hesse,
Richard Tuttle, Ana Mendieta, Robert Irwin, Richard Serra and the
artists of diverse stripes who went to work on a vast scale in the
American West: Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, James Turrell and
Michael Heizer.
</P>
<P>
   I might add the exceptional case of Philip Guston, an Abstract
Expressionist in the 50s, who in the 70s, ignoring almost
everyone's advice, remade himself, until he died in 1980 producing
what the artist Elizabeth Murray has called sad, nutty songs: wild,
angry, cartoonish pictures that caused many people to say he'd lost
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when there's so much new art that involves cartooning and
surrealism, his weird late works seem astonishingly prescient and
moving. Guston has turned out to be one of the most influential
American painters at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean by all this to say that the artists to emerge in
the late 60s and 70s are necessarily the best ones we've ever
produced. I mean they belong to the first American generation in
this century that depends principally on what, by now, had become a
modern American tradition: they built on works by Pollock,
Rauschenberg, Johns, David Smith, Ad Reinhardt and others who were
not even strictly visual artists, like John Cage.
</P>
<P>
   What they produced, moreover, bespoke a specifically American
context. Artists like Smithson were working in the American
landscape, and Minimalists and Post-Minimalists like Judd and Serra
were exploiting a vocabulary of industrial forms that grew out of
the American cityscape. Their art actually resembled the streets of
SoHo, then still an industrial neighborhood only beginning to be
taken over by artists.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Americans like Demuth and Sheeler had painted pictures
of industrial buildings in a streamlined style. But the sculptures
by artists of the late 60s and early 70s consisted of steel and
tar, their stripped-down esthetic evoking not only an urban present
but also a Puritan past.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're at the end of the century, and the American paradigm,
it seems, has gradually shifted. No doubt all the big
century-ending exhibitions will have to confront this fact.
Throughout our history, the notion has prevailed that there could
be a distinctly American art, as if a particular form or style
might encapsulate the nation's identity. Assimilation was an
underlying assumption.
</P>
<P>
   But there really has been no national art. It's curious but true
that we do not, as a nation, identify with specific American
paintings, or at least not with any paintings of serious quality,
as Mexicans identify with the works of Rivera and Italians identify
with the works of Raphael or Titian. I put it this way to exclude
the work of an illustrator like Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Can you name any American picture, which, if it were to be sold
and end up in another country, would provoke anything like the
national heritage debate that surrounds the Greeks and the Elgin
marbles? Certainly not a Pollock or a Warhol. And if you cite
``Washington Crossing the Delaware'' then consider the fact that
not more than a handful of Americans have even heard of the man who
painted it (Emanuel Leutze).
</P>
<P>
   We're so enamored of the free market that we don't think of
American art in terms of national treasure. But more to the point,
we're so diverse culturally: the goal of a synthetic American art
remains illusory because the idea of an American identity is, in
the end, an illusion. If we cling to the melting pot idea, we have
also become increasingly alert to its inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the paradigm has begun to change. The 90s are a
pluralist decade in art, the legacy of multiculturalism, economics
and technological change. The breakdown of old borders, thanks to
the end of the Cold War and the burgeoning of the Internet, has
hastened American awareness of culture globally, and vice versa: we
see more new art from around the world, and people elsewhere see
more easily the art we make.
</P>
<P>
   If, consequently, art around the world today isn't actually more
varied than it used to be, we have become more respectful of a
wider range of it. We're regularly given chances to view
contemporary work from Japan, Korea, India, Africa and Central
America, not to mention Europe, and emigre artists here trumpet
their roots.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity is now regarded as an asset. That is a prevailing
theme in American art at this moment. And America, particularly New
York City, as the world's economic epicenter, remains the
crossroads for new art, so by extension, diversity is a message
being spread around the world. We may be leaving the American
century without having produced an American art that speaks for us
collectively as a nation, but as a nation we have developed into
the nexus for world art.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? In the future, the American century, if it's
still called that, may be defined, paradoxically, not by the art we
began to invent at midcentury but by the global culture we helped
to disseminate at century's end.

REPORT ON BREAST IMPLANTS IS TAINTED, PLAINTIFFS ASSERT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Colo.)   (rk) 
 By   GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers representing women who contend that their health was
affected by their silicone breast implants sought Tuesday to
dismiss the report of a panel of scientists who evaluated the
issue, saying that one panel member had a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   They said his collaboration with the other three members of the
panel ``taints the final opinions'' of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers filed a motion yesterday in U.S. District Court in
Birmingham, Ala., where Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr., who oversees
breast implant lawsuits in federal courts, had appointed the panel
to evaluate research on the toxicity of silicone breast implants.
In their report last December, the scientists said evidence to date
did not support claims that implants had caused disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plaintiffs' lawyers said, they have discovered that one of
the four, Peter Tugwell of the University of Ottawa, had entered
into consulting agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb, an implant
maker, at about the time the panel's report was being released.
</P>
<P>
   They said Tugwell had received a $750 honorarium for taking part
in a company-sponsored seminar on arthritis and agreed to
participate in the company's research on new arthritis drugs. They
also said he had solicited money for a professional meeting from
drug companies, including Bristol-Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Pointer did not return telephone calls Tuesday. A clerk said he
would review the motion on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Eittreim, a lawyer for Bristol-Myers Squibb, said the
plaintiffs' lawyers' complaints were ``ridiculous.'' He dismissed
the entire issue as a desperate ploy of lawyers who see that the
tide has turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   Tugwell referred questions to a lawyer for the science panel,
John M. Kobayashi of Denver. Kobayashi, did not return several
telephone calls, but released a letter urging reporters to
``evaluate all of the facts regarding this matter, including all
written submissions and argument to the court, before reporting a
one-sided version of these events.'' He did not respond in detail
to the assertions in the motion filed Tuesday .
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the lawyers who filed the motion said they too
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gordon, a New York lawyer not involved in the motion but
who represents women with implants, said the plaintiffs' lawyers
were not accusing Tugwell of intentionally altering his findings at
the behest of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nor, he said, are they accusing
the company of deliberately trying to buy Tugwell's support.
</P>
<P>
   But, Gordon said, when all of Tugwell's contacts with the
company are considered and that he did not disclose them, it
``undermines the trust of the litigants'' and throws the panel's
findings into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of money _ I don't think that's what the point
is,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict of interest statement that Tugwell signed asked if
he or anyone in his household ``ever received any research funds,
graduate support or other funds (awards, honoraria, speaking or
consulting fees, etc.) from any interested party.'' The contacts he
had with Bristol-Myers occurred after Tugwell filed his conflict of
interest statement. The plaintiffs' lawyers say he should have
altered the form at that point.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gordon said the report had an immediate impact on the implant
litigation. ``A number of people have settled their cases on the
basis of this report,'' he said. ``Now the women are feeling a
little ripped off.''
</P>
<P>
   Eittreim, the Bristol-Myers lawyer, criticized the motion by the
plaintiffs' lawyers as ``the latest effort by the plaintiffs to
discredit the science panel's results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing they can't abide is serious scientists looking at
these issues,'' Eittreim said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the instructions to the panelists gave as an example
of conflict of interest a ``significant financial investment or
close tie to a corporate defendant,'' he said: `By no stretch of
the imagination could this be considered a significant financial
investment or a close tie. The money was really no money at all. It
didn't even reimburse his expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Eittreim said the next step was for Bristol-Myers Squibb to file
its response with Pointer's office, which he said it would do by
the end of this week.

   Starting pitchers staying course for beleaguered Reds bullpen
</P>
<P>
   By Hal McCoy
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Sears Tower and The John Hancock Building both
peer down from 100 stories above the Chicago landscape, but as far
as the Cincinnati Reds are concerned the tallest objects in Chicago
right now are the team's starting pitchers standing atop the mound.
</P>
<P>
   When Pete Harnisch trudges up that little hill this afternoon in
Wrigley Field to face the Chicago Cubs, he will try to extend the
starting staff's string of pitching at least into the seventh
inning to six straight games.
</P>
<P>
   And that has been a nifty little gift for manager Jack McKeon
because he hasn't had to rely so much on the beleaguered bullpen
that was bruised and battered by the San Francisco Giants the first
three games of the season _ all defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have won three of the first four games on this six-game
trip to St. Louis and Chicago and while the bullpen has awakened
somewhat from its early nightmares, it has been the starters
staying the course that made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The past five games:
</P>
<P>
   Steve Avery, 7 innings, 1 run, 3 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Bere, 6.1 innings, 2 runs, 8 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko, 7 innings, 2 runs, 4 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch, 9 innings, 0 runs, 6 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Avery, 7.2 innings, 3 runs, 3 hits.
</P>
<P>
   For those five games, the starters have pitched 37 of a possible
45 innings and given up eight runs (1.95 earned-run average) and 24
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What pays off for us is that we stretch our pitchers out early
in spring training, get 'em to pitch four innings in their first
outing instead of a couple, and increase it each time,'' McKeon
said. ``So they're ready to go at least seven innings on Opening
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery is a mystery for opposing hitters, who watch his
meandering fastball flutter at 83 miles per hour. It looks as if
they could bust it to Katmandu, but Avery seldom puts it in The Hit
Zone. It is on the outside corner, on the inside corner, down
around the knees.
</P>
<P>
   And he surrounds that fastball with an abundance of changeups,
so that when he goes to the fastball it looks speedier, or as
Chicago's Sammy Sosa said after Monday's game, ``When he throws so
many changeups (40 out of 108 pitches), you look for it and the
fastball seems to come at you like a speeding train.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery believes he can, and will, be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``My control is still off at times (11 walks in his 14 innings),
so when I get my control going and my fastball going, I'll be more
effective,'' he said. Amazingly, of those 11 walks, only one has
scored.
</P>
<P>
   And Avery said despite the early awfulness, he isn't distressed
when he turns the ball over to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person we have in the bullpen has a lot better stuff
than I have, so I don't worry about those guys . . . they're all
very good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Avery was the one question mark of the starting staff before
spring training because Harnisch, Brett Tomko and Denny Neagle are
tried and proven. Neagle, though, reported to camp with a dead
shoulder and is only now ready to step into the rotation, probably
Sunday in Cinergy Field against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   What Harnisch did also was remarkable _ missing the last two
weeks of spring training and his Opening Day assignment with lower
back spasms, then pitching a six-hit complete-game shutout against
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon is happy with the 16 home runs his team has hit in seven
games to lead the majors, but he realizes championships are won and
lost with pitching.

   ``Good pitching is just the ticket,'' he said. ``When we get
good pitching, hold the other team to three runs or less and get
six or more innings from our starters, we have a chance to win a
lot of games. Harnisch was the backbone of our staff last year and
we missed him Opening Day. If he had been able to pitch and lead
the way, we might be 6-1 instead of 3-4.''

 &HT;    Standard to buy back stock
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Standard Register plans to repurchase up to 1
million shares of its stock, a move that could cost about $30
million and send a message of confidence to the investment
community, said Robert J. Cestilli, associate vice president for
investor relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to say we believe in what we're doing,'' Cestilli
said. The move may or may not drive the stock price up, he said.
The company's stock hit a 52-week high of $40 a share nearly a year
ago but then dropped off last fall. It has languished around $30 a
share this year.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Register's board of directors authorized the repurchase
last month. The repurchase isn't likely to begin until after
Standard Register announces its quarterly earnings and holds its
annual meeting April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Register will use some of the cash from the $100
million sale of its Communicolor division, a deal that closed April
5. Cestilli said the remainder of the cash is likely to be used to
buy other companies and pay down the $234 million in debt incurred
when Standard Register bought UARCO
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered in Dayton, Standard Register makes business forms,
has a nationwide network of printing facilities and sells document
management systems.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Register's stock (NYSE: SR) closed Tuesday at 30, up
7/16.

 WASHINGTON: ... with China. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; China made several broad concessions last week in order to gain
entry to the trade organization, a step it has been working toward
for 13 years. Entry would require China to demolish its tariffs and
trade barriers but would give it broad access to the markets of
many other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese concessions included allowing foreign companies to
sell their products directly to consumers, an enormous opportunity
in a land of 1.2 billion people. China also agreed to allow foreign
companies to invest as much as 49 percent in telecommunications
industries and to give greater access to foreign-owned insurance
companies. In a separate civil aviation deal, it agreed to allow
more flights from the United States. And it signed an accord to
lift restrictions on imports of U.S. wheat, citrus fruits and meat.
</P>
<P>
   But still outstanding were areas such as trade in financial
services and assurances that the United States could enforce its
agreements with China.
</P>
<P>
   After Zhu left Washington on Saturday, he criticized Clinton,
saying in cities across the United States that the president ``does
not dare'' take a political risk in allowing China to join the
trade organization. One senior official traveling with the prime
minister said, ``We had a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton called Zhu, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, said on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the president was
committed to seeing that negotiations would be finished in time for
China to join the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will re-engage with the Chinese shortly,'' she said in
testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, promising to ``work
on each of the issues that are open to bring this full agreement to
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   While some senators were hostile, others said they were worried
that the deal would unravel and that China would withdraw the
concessions it made last week. Zhu himself complained that the
administration had ``made public many documents and said we had
agreed to them, but in fact we have not agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, accused the administration of ``raw,
rotten protectionism'' at the behest of American textile and steel
companies, which are worried about the low price of Chinese
imports.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration was trying to force China to keep
limits on textile exports to the United States for five years
longer than currently allowed under the trade organization's rules.
And he said that America's high barriers in this area had already
cost the average family of four $700 more in clothing bills each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to lose more jobs by protecting noncompetitive
American industries than we are going to possibly gain in those
areas,'' Gramm said.

USING STEROIDS HELPS PATIENTS REPAIR MUSCLE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two anabolic steroids, muscle-building male-hormone substitutes,
have given renewed strength to patients who had been severely
weakened from being on kidney dialysis and to patients who suffered
marked weight loss from the AIDS virus, researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of two studies published in Wednesday's issue of The
Journal of the American Medical Association recommended that a low
dose of the drugs, which in higher quantities are known to have
serious side effects, be put to immediate use for the sickest of
both groups of patients.
</P>
<P>
   But the authors, along with an editorial, cautioned against
wider use of anabolic steroids, which in similar synthetic
compounds have been used in large doses by some professional and
amateur athletes to build muscle mass and enhance weight lifting or
other forms of physical performance. These steroids are substitutes
for human testosterone, which is responsible for male
characteristics like increased muscle tissue, facial hair and a
deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   The medical researchers said that much more study was needed to
learn more precisely the levels and length of time the drugs can be
safely taken. Among the side effects known to occur at high levels
are stimulation of prostate tumors, liver disorders, worsening
cholesterol levels, uncontrolled aggressive behavior and, more
cosmetically, body hair growth in women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results with low doses for seriously ill patients were
very encouraging _ enough so to warrant the use now for these
patients,'' said Dr. Kirsten Johansen, an assistant professor of
medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, who led
the study of dialysis patients.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Johansen estimated that as many as 10 percent of the 250,000
patients who are using dialysis machines warrant the steroid
treatment. Loss of muscle mass has been associated with a
significantly reduced life span among patients in long-term
dialysis programs, as it has in patients infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the accompanying report on patients infected with HIV, Dr.
Alison Strawford, a researcher at the University of California at
San Francisco and the lead author of the study, said a similar drug
when used with a supervised weight lifting program produced a
significant gain in muscle strength.
</P>
<P>
   For the dialysis study, researchers looked at 29 patients with
end-stage kidney disease. To build muscle mass, 14 of the patients
were given synthetic anabolic steroids made of the chemical
compound nandrolone decanoate, administered in combination with
exercise periods of walking and stair climbing. Fifteen patients
received placebo injections.
</P>
<P>
   After six months, the researchers found that the patients given
steroids had increased their lean mass, or nonfat body weight, by
an average of 5.5 pounds more than the average gain in the placebo
group. The group on steroids walked 10 percent faster, while the
placebo group slowed down by 10 percent. Using a measurement known
as the Profile of Mood States, the steroid group was also found to
have become significantly less fatigued, Dr. Johansen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the research project aimed at reversing weight loss related
to HIV, 22 patients were tested. Eleven were given a synthetic
steroid made of the chemical compound oxandrolone, and 11 received
a placebo. In addition, all 22 were put on a modest resistance
weight lifting program. The gains for upper and lower body strength
among those on the steroid were significantly greater than for the
placebo group, Dr. Strawford said. Those given the steroid gained
an average of 16 pounds compared with a gain of 8 pounds for the
placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   The one adverse side effect, Dr. Strawford said, was a
significant drop in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol _ the good
kind _ which helps prevent arterial clogging and heart attacks.

STARR TO TESTIFY AGAINST EXTENTION OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf to insert how testimony was obtained) (sw) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, who came to embody the independent
counsel law as he pursued a variety of allegations about President
Clinton for almost five years, now says he believes that the nation
would be better off if the law is allowed to expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statute should not be reauthorized,'' Starr has written
bluntly in testimony prepared for delivery on Wednesday. The Senate
Committee on Government Affairs is considering what to do about the
law that provides for the appointment of independent counsels like
Starr and which is set to expire at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Starr argues, the authority to investigate politically
sensitive cases involving senior administration officials should be
returned to the Justice Department and the attorney general _ with
Congress and the press keeping watch.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argues in his testimony that the law has many serious
flaws and, most importantly, has not achieved its main purpose,
which is to provide the public with a sense that investigations of
figures like the president are free from partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his own experience, Starr laments how his
investigation was criticized as too partisan, that he was portrayed
as a Republican out to get a Democratic president and that the
public did not, in the end, have great confidence in what he was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assaults took a toll,'' he says in his testimony, which
was provided by someone on Capitol Hill. ``A duly authorized
federal law-enforcement investigation came to be characterized as
yet another political game. Law became politics by other means.''
As a result, he said, ``the statutory mechanism intended to enhance
confidence in law enforcement thus had the effect of weakening
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel law was enacted in the aftermath of the
Watergate scandal, which produced a wide consensus that the
nation's chief law-enforcement officer, the attorney general, had
an inherent conflict in investigating the president or fellow
Cabinet officers.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr argues that the opposite has occurred. Rather than
assuring that the investigation is not too soft because it is
conducted by a political associate, independent counsels may be
criticized as overly eager to successfully prosecute someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Independent Counsel is vulnerable to partisan
attack, the investigation is likely to be seen as political,''
Starr says in his testimony. Starr has been ferociously criticized
by supporters of Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Starr has also faced widespread criticism from
those who argued that his efforts were not partisan but were,
nonetheless, ill-considered and frequently lacking any sense of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's statement is defensive as well over the criticism of the
expanding scope of his investigation, which began with questions
about Whitewater, a land deal in Arkansas in which the Clintons had
invested before they came to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's inquiry eventually included such unconnected topics as
the firing of employees in the White House travel office, the
improper collection of confidential FBI files on some Republicans
in the Clinton White House and most famously, the president's
intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Each time, Starr
received an expansion of his original jurisdiction, which had been
to investigate only the Whitewater matter.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Starr says that, ``the number of expansions is
unique and it may have fed the misconception that we were
investigating individuals rather than crime. Let me make clear:
that was not the case.'' He argues in his statement that he did not
seek to investigate some of those subjects but had them pressed on
him by the Justice Department. But investigating Ms. Lewinsky's
relations with the president, the area that attracted the greatest
criticism, was something Starr had sought.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also criticizes the independent counsel statute, which he
said obliged him to report to Congress any offenses by the
president that might have been worthy of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's referral to Congress charged that Clinton committed
several impeachable offenses, including perjury and obstruction of
justice. The report led to a months-long ordeal during which the
House voted to impeach the president, but the Senate voted to
acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr's critics, his investigation of the Lewinsky matter
and his advocacy of impeachment were the principal examples of his
excessive zeal. Professor Sam Dash of the Georgetown University Law
School, who was counsel to the Watergate Committee in 1974 and had
been hired by Starr as a special ethics adviser, resigned saying
that Starr had overstepped his bounds as prosecutor by becoming an
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared testimony, Starr defends himself, saying that
the statute compelled him to offer a detailed explanation of the
president's alleged offenses. ``We could have shipped the raw
evidence with nothing more last fall,'' he said. But he said he
believed he had to bring some ``order and coherence to the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds that, ``The law required us to decide whether particular
presidential acts might be impeachable and we believed that we
ought to share our reasoning, at least to the extent of explaining
how the evidence comported with the elements of particular federal
felonies and with the apotheosis of impeachable misconduct, abuse
of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But he adds that he believes the burden of asking a single
prosecutor to determine whether a president should be impeached is
too great, and it inevitably politicizes the independent counsel
further.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the likelihood that the statute will expire, the
Justice Department has drafted tentative modifications to
guidelines on how it would resume investigations that used to be
given to special prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee, Dennis
J. Burke, the acting assistant attorney general, said that under
the draft rules, it would be easier for the attorney general to
name special counsels to investigate matters which might present
conflicts. The attorney general has that authority now but it has
been used infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel statute, the attorney general
determines if such a conflict might exist and then a panel of three
federal judges selects the prosecutor. Although Attorney General
Janet Reno was a vigorous supporter of renewing the statute in
1994, she now says the Justice Department opposes its renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Starr acknowledges that returning
politically-sensitive investigations to the Justice Department
poses risks. But he said that if investigations even by independent
counsels are going to be seen as political, the attorney general
should be at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If politicization and the loss of public confidence are
inevitable,'' he said, ``then we should leave the full
responsibility where our laws and tradition place it, on the
attorney general'' and, in the case of impeachment, the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Starr urges in his testimony that if Congress renews the
statute, it should reject a common suggestion to limit the amount
of time an independent prosecutor may have to investigate. He said
that would only invite delay on the part of the targets of the
investigation.

   NEW YORK _ Picture Adolph Green. Sprightly, white-haired
musical-theater octogenarian. Screenwriter, with his partner, Betty
Comden, for ``Singin' in the Rain''; lyricist, with Ms. Comden, for
``Wonderful Town,'' ``Bells Are Ringing'' and ``On the Town.''
Picture them both. Ms. Comden is the elegant woman in black.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on to this image.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside it, imagine the rappers Q Tip, Sean (Puffy) Combs and
Positive K just sitting around, after hours, off duty.
</P>
<P>
   Now put the two crews together.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Joe's Pub, open seven nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   You enter through the side door of the Joseph Papp Public
Theater. Farther south on Lafayette Street, revolving doors admit
patrons to the Public's various theatrical spaces, but here, on the
outskirts, an iron-fenced portal offers entree to the theater's new
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Coaxing nightclubs from legitimate theaters is not unheard of.
Florenz Ziegfeld found room for one in 1915 atop his New Amsterdam
Theater on West 42nd Street. Throughout the life span of Ziegfeld's
``Follies,'' the New Amsterdam roof was the toniest nightspot in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe's Pub is a much less lofty enterprise, carved as it is
from ground-floor back-office space at the theater. The $2.35
million club is the result, in part, of a construction and
renovation grant to the Public from city capital funds that
includes refurbishment of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   There were some doubters when the club opened in October who
wondered whether the Public Theater could make a theater-night life
alliance work. Six months later, according to George C. Wolfe, the
producer of the Public, Joe's Pub ``is actually doing better than I
thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has caught fire,'' Wolfe said.``Though it still isn't
making any money, but that will come, like any new business.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now is, what effect if any will the popular success
of Joe's Pub have on the creation of theater at the Public. For
Wolfe, the answer is twofold. ``It's an entirely new talent pool
for us that we're going to tap,'' he said, ``and, hopefully, an
entirely new audience, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The club's programming is idiosyncratic: from ethnic music
ensembles to spoken-word artists to the most promising young
musical-theater composers and performers on the contemporary scene,
the changing roster has generated an after-hours theatricality all
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Tuesday, a monthlong Performance Festival will
supplement the usual (or, more to the point, unusual)
entertainment. A showcase for offbeat solo artists and downtown
theater companies, the festival will include Slant, an
Asian-American performance trio and rock band; Morplay, a
Boston-based white hip-hop duo; Dream Express, an existential
lounge act, written and, in part, performed by the playwright and
director Len Jenkins, plus a bill of short plays by members of New
Georges, an Obie-winning women's theater company.
</P>
<P>
   One-woman shows by Nancy Giles, a Second City alumna, and Sarah
Jones, a spoken-word performer, are also on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Insinuating cutting-edge culture into mainstream theater and
cabaret fare is a revolutionary act of sorts. And perhaps Wolfe is
right: young audiences who may never have bought a theater ticket
will be enticed into doing so by what they see at Joe's Pub. Who
could imagine Comden and Green and Funk Master Flex, show-music
fans and supermodels, Audra McDonald and Donald Trump occupying
common ground? Yet on many nights, from the opening at 5 p.m. to
the closing around 4 a.m., you can watch it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perpetually looking for ways to get all kinds of people
into this theater,'' said Wolfe, above the din one recent night.
``Give them a stake in the building, a sense of ownership. Then,
once we get them in, start to blur the boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for the Pub's trendy late-night profile is
Serge Becker, the designer behind some of the most popular club
ventures of the last decade or so, including Bowery Bar, M.K., Area
and Fez. The Public _ which leases the space to Becker, who
operates the club _ gets a small percentage of the food and drink
sales, while keeping the admission fees from all events it
programs.
</P>
<P>
   After midnight, though, it is Becker, for the most part, who
books the noisier techno music entertainment and ornaments the room
with celebrities. Like Giorgio Armani. There he was, one Friday
night, listening to the drum and bass boogie of Future Proof, an
Indian hip-hop ensemble, whose youthful Asian-American audience
chain-smoked avidly in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   In designing Joe's Pub, Becker has given the rectangular room a
wide-open feel: the small platform stage can be seen from all
angles. Yet the two-tiered space _ with its bar area slightly
raised and overlooking the main room _ also appears cozy,
especially when its 160 seats are filled. A brace of ringside
tables arcs around the modest stage. Table tops are mirrored;
coffee is served in Japanese teapots, and food ranges from deviled
eggs to caviar platters. There is a two-drink minimum and admission
fees range from $10 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Massive pinups of the Pub's flamboyant namesake, Joseph Papp,
the founder of the Shakespeare Festival, cover one wall and, near
the stage, a spotlighted accordion is displayed on high, behind
glass. Could it once have been Papp's?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' suggested Wolfe sardonically. ``Joe used to play it
while making casting decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker knows otherwise. ``It's not Joe's at all,'' he said with
a smile when asked. ``It's not anybody's. I just liked the way it
looked.''
</P>
<P>
   The cabaret crowd arrives early on Mondays for the 8:30 p.m.
Songbook Series; the curator is the associate producer at the
Public, Wiley Hausam. To date, audiences have listened to young
composers like Jason Robert Brown, who wrote the music for the show
``Parade,'' and performers like the three-time Tony Award-winner
Ms. McDonald, who unofficially christened Joe's Pub with a series
of concerts in October.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing throughout this month is Lea DeLaria, the Mermanesque
singer and Sapphoesque comic who found stardom in the Public's
revival of ``On the Town'' and who is closing out her Off Broadway
run in Paul Rudnick's comedy ``The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday fare includes the spoken word, alternative music and
fringe performance acts, slam poets, flavor-of-the-month
singer-songwriters like Duncan Sheik and polemical authors like the
poet and novelist Sapphire.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdays bring salsa late into the night. Though dancing is
forbidden, at least formally (Joe's Pub does not have a cabaret
license), salsa crowds do shimmy. Thursdays through Sundays are
more loosely programmed.
</P>
<P>
   One night, as eager Duncan Sheik fans took their seats, Bonnie
Metzgar, the producer of Joe's Pub who programs the Public's events
there, said, ``If we hook them right away, I think we might
actually turn them into theatergoers.'' Hours later, in a room now
filling with cigarette smoke and predatory social energy, Ms.
Metzgar mused aloud, ``Even if we get 2 out of 200 every night,
that's a vast potential new audience for the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe's Pub may well be the only nightclub in the country that
operates as a covert recruiting center for the theater. But the
gulf between the Public Theater agenda and that of Becker can
sometimes yawn ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations are required for Public Theater-sponsored
performances in the early evening, with tickets available at the
theater's box office and through Telecharge. A velvet rope and
moody door minions rule after midnight, and Public Theater patrons
and subscribers have sometimes been turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this odd co-existence also lends the enterprise a real
frisson. And the potential for creative cross-pollination between
nightclub and theater remains vast. Slant, Ms. Metzgar said, has
received a commission from the Public to create a new piece for one
of the theaters across the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become the theater that never closes,'' concluded Wolfe,
from his banquet. ``We never let our audience go.''

RODMAN ISN'T BAD _ GOLF ANNOUNCERS ARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The long and short of it:
</P>
<P>
   _So it's unanimous that the Lakers screwed up by signing Dennis
Rodman? Well, no. He was a worthwhile gamble in an oddball season,
and they do have a better shot at the NBA title with him than
without him.
</P>
<P>
   And if Rodman's signing reflected turmoil in the Lakers' front
office, that turmoil would have existed whether or not they'd
signed him.
</P>
<P>
   For those who claim they absolutely, positively knew Rodman
would be more trouble than he's worth: What kind of coin did you
flip?
</P>
<P>
   _The ``yes'' side of the ``are golfers athletes?'' debate took a
9-iron in the chin over the weekend in all that weepy talk about
Jose Maria Olazabal's old injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the melodramatic language of TV golf commentators, Olazabal
was ``unable to walk'' for a time in 1996 because a back condition
caused severe foot pain. It was as if he'd risen from the dead to
win the Masters. Not to minimize it, but the plain truth is, he had
an injury and he came back strong, just as men and women in other
sports are required to do all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Example: If Jose Vizcaino hits a game-winning home run for the
Dodgers this year, you won't hear anybody saying, ``Last summer he
was unable to walk. Tonight he makes the triumphant walk to the
dugout...'' They'll say, ``He spent 48 days on the DL with a
sprained ankle last summer. Looks OK now.''
</P>
<P>
   _Of course, the Masters commentators are generally full of it,
because Augusta National likes them that way. As far as they're
concerned, nobody ever hits a bad ball. Somebody's middle-iron shot
landed 50 yards to the right of the target Sunday, and the
announcer said cheerily, ``He'll have a lot of green to work
with.'' A short chip skittered off the back of the green, and the
guy said, ``An indifferent chip by Davis Love.'' Indifferent!
</P>
<P>
   If JFK had been shot at Augusta, Walter Cronkite would have been
forced to say something like, ``Lee Harvey Oswald, bless his heart,
can never be accused of blind patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   _This might be it for Wayne Gretzky. As for Jim Brown, Sandy
Koufax and Michael Jordan, better a year too soon than a year too
late.
</P>
<P>
   _Odd, but the advertising all over Dodger Stadium actually
jazzes up the park's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, baseball, whether viewed in person or on TV, has never
looked better, from the uniforms to the ballparks to the grass.
</P>
<P>
   _About that grass: A colleague who covered the New York Yankees'
workout at Dodger Stadium _ the day before the recent exhibition
games there _ noticed the field's deep green hue and absence of the
usual early-spring brown spots. Then, as he typed in the press box,
onto the field rolled one of those trucks with rows of water spouts
at the back. Only what came out wasn't plain old water but some
kind of green liquid.
</P>
<P>
   _Half of this season's Major League Soccer games have ended with
tie-breaking shootouts, which seem to be unpopular with players and
fans. Which raises the question, What's wrong with ties, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   _Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tony Martin on why he's sure
money-laundering charges won't keep him out of training camp: ``I
believe in myself and the Lord.'' In that order? In other words:
``God is my flight attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   _Davey Johnson, who has a math degree and keeps a personal
computer on his clubhouse desk, on the way Earl Weaver used to set
the Baltimore Orioles' lineup according to batter-pitcher matchup
statistics recorded with pencil and paper: ``He'd say, `I'm sitting
you down because you're only 1 for 5 against this guy, and
so-and-so is 2 for 4.' I'd tell him about the standard-deviation
charts, and how it would take 1,000 repetitions before those
numbers would be meaningful, and he'd say, `I don't want to hear
about it.' (Don) Baylor would go 4 for 5 and he wouldn't be in the
lineup the next night. We'd say, `It's not like he's in a slump.'
Earl would say, `If I play him against this (pitcher), he will
be.'''
</P>
<P>
   _It's definitely baseball season when you read stats like this:
``Tiger Stadium opened in 1912, and never before had a home opener
at the ballpark been scoreless going into extra innings ...''
</P>
<P>
   _After seeing David Wells take an artificial-turf grounder off
his ankle in Toronto, do you wonder about the safety of the
plate-to-mound dirt path in Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   _Upsets in three major Kentucky Derby preps last weekend mean
the May 1 race could draw the maximum 20 horses for the first time
since Swale's Derby in 1984. If more than 20 try to enter, earnings
will be the qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   _Mark Calcavecchia should never have made his cold-hearted
statement that Arnold Palmer ought to quit playing the Masters
because the 69-year-old can't keep up with the younger golfers. On
the other hand, Calcavecchia was right.
</P>
<P>
   _And finally: I'm here for you, Brooke.

   With Kosovo Conflict, Cruises Change Course
</P>
<P>
   A number of cruise lines are replacing calls at Dubrovnik and at
ports in Croatia with ports along Italy's east coast. Cunard and
Seabourn lines, both owned by Carnival, have changed the
itineraries of 21 cruises by five vessels _ the Vistafjord, Sea
Goddesses I and II, the Seabourn Spirit and the Seabourn Legend _
to avoid warfare on the eastern shores of the Adriatic. Holland
America's Maasdam is also making calls in Greece and Italy instead
of Dubrovnik. Windstar Cruises' Wind Surf will eliminate calls at
Dubrovnik and Rab Island, Croatia, on all 12 of its Rome-Venice
sailings this summer; alternative Italian calls will be made, and
Venice remains as a home port.
</P>
<P>
   These lines say that passengers on any of these cruises who want
to cancel their reservations will pay whatever penalty is specified
in the sales contract, which varies by cancellation date; the lines
are not providing full refunds because they do not consider the
changes substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Euro Cruises' Delphin Queen has changed itineraries to omit the
Black Sea cruises on its departures May 29, June 5, June 12 and
July 6 and is providing refunds to passengers who cancel. Danube
cruises through Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary are being
substituted. The president of Euro Cruises, Bjarne J. Mikkelsen,
said that not many were requesting refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart T. Chiron, vice president of the Cruise Line agency in
North Miami Beach, said that few passengers were cancelling
Mediterranean trips, although many were calling to find out about
changes since the State Department issued travel warnings on
Bosnia-Herzegovina on March 9 and on Serbia-Montenegro on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Levine, a spokeswoman for the Berkely Group, which
administers trip-cancellation policies for many cruise companies,
said that people who bought cruises and their cancellation coverage
before the two warnings and wanted to cancel should check the
policies to see if their losses are covered. Some provide
reimbursement if the State Department issues an advisory notice for
the specific area the traveler is holding a ticket for. Policies
bought since the warnings will not provide reimbursement.

   Luxury Hotel Opens Near Covent Garden
</P>
<P>
   London's newest hotels go for cool, not chintz. One Aldwych is
no exception. It occupies a triangular landmark building that was
built in 1907 as the headquarters of the Morning Post, designed by
the team of Mewes &AMP; Davis, who were responsible for the Ritz hotels
in London and Paris. It's at the corner of The Strand and Aldwych,
in the West End and near Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic lobby, anchored by a grand bar, has soaring
windows, and the elevators, lighted in jazzy yellow by day and
lilac by night, contrast with the more restrained hallways. Each
guest room has two telephone lines, with fax machine, fresh fruit
and flowers, original artwork and bathrooms with mini-TV's. Some of
the rooms are narrow because of the building's configuration, but
even these have a sitting area. In the basement, a 60-foot lap pool
has an underwater music system. There is a coffee bar, Cinnamon,
with a street entrance, and a casual restaurant, Indigo, on a
balcony; the 30s-style Axis restaurant serves updated English food
with Asian touches.
</P>
<P>
   One Aldwych, at 1 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BZ, has 105 rooms and
suites, from $390 to $1,580; (44-171) 300-1000, fax (44-171)
300-1001.
</P>
<P>

   Art From West Unveiled in New Nagoya Museum
</P>
<P>
   There is a new museum to visit in Japan, filled not with hanging
scrolls or woodblock prints, but mainly with Impressionist
paintings and Mediterranean antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagoya-Boston Museum of Fine Arts was scheduled to open in
Nagoya April 17, with two exhibitions, ``Monet, Renoir and the
Impressionist Landscape'' and ``Art of the Ancient Mediterranean
World.'' The museum, operated jointly by the Boston museum and the
Foundation for the Arts in Nagoya, was born of necessity nearly a
decade ago. The Museum of Fine Arts had plenty of art in its
storerooms but was short of operating money; Nagoya, an industrial
city of four million people between Tokyo and Kyoto, had cash but
not enough art.
</P>
<P>
   In return for $50 million in payments spread over the life of a
20-year-plus pact, the Museum of Fine Arts agreed to share its
permanent collection in a collaboration that the two institutions
say is ``the first museum in Japan to provide a comprehensive view
of world art across all cultures and time periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Museum of Fine Arts will send two five-month loan
exhibitions to the 4,700-square-foot museum in Nagoya; it will also
provide exhibits lasting five years and will send objects from its
extensive Jananese art collection to the Nagoya museum's ``Japanese
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monet, Renoir and the Impressionist Landscape,'' which will be
on view until Sept. 26, shows the development of landscape painting
from Barbizon artists like Corot and Millet, through the
Impressionists and Post-Impressionists like Gauguin and van Gogh,
to the Neo-Impressionists like Signac. Among the more than 60
paintings are van Gogh's ``Houses at Auvers'' and Monet's
``Grainstack (Sunset).''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural long-term show, ``Art of the Ancient Mediterranean
World,'' traces the development of ancient civilizations in Egypt,
Greece and Rome and their interconnections. Among the highlights of
its 220 objects are a bird statuette from the Egyptian Late Period
(circa 750 to 333 B.C.), a female figurine from Greece's Early
Bronze Age (2600 to 2500 B.C.) and a head of Aphrodite from the
Antonine Period of Rome (A.D. 138 to 192). The exhibition will
remain on view through March 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The first object in the Japanese corner is a painted Japanese
folding screen from 1601-14 that depicts a European king and his
court.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 1-1-1 Kanayama-cho, Naka-ku, Nagoya, is part of
the new 31-story Kanayama Minami building that houses the Hotel
Grand Court Nagoya and offices and is adjacent to the Kanayama
train station. It is open daily except Monday. Information is
available on the Web at www.nagoya-boston.or.jp. &QL;

 &HT;    Pending reports provide look at chip business
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Earnings reports from Motorola Inc., Advanced
Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp. today and Wednesday should give
investors a first-quarter snapshot of the health of the Central
Texas microchip business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are modestly upbeat about the earnings prospects for
Motorola and Intel, which will release their results this
afternoon. AMD, which reports its results Wednesday, has already
warned it will post a sizable loss for the quarter due to
production problems and falling prices for its Austin-made
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is expected to report earnings of 24 cents a share, due
in part to an upturn in its Austin-based semiconductor business.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is expected to report earnings of $1.09 a share, up from
81 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Intel's stock dropped $4.12 1/2 to $61.25 a share. AMD
closed down 56 1/4 cents at $15.06 1/4 and Motorola fell $1.43 3/4
to $81.56 1/4.

 &HT;    Abortion ban fails in Florida committee
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A ``partial-birth'' abortion ban failed in a
Senate committee Tuesday, the most prominent legislative defeat for
anti-abortion groups in Florida in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion groups threatened political retaliation against a
moderate Republican senator whose swing vote made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Burt Saunders of Cape Coral was the sole Republican on the
prevailing side in a 4-3 vote in the Senate health committee,
saying he did not think it would survive a constitutional challenge
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take Saunders out,'' said an angry John
Dowless, executive director of the Christian Coalition of Florida,
after the vote. ``He basically lied to us. There will be serious
repercussions in the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders said, ``I did not tell anybody I was going to vote for
that bill. I consider the procedure barbaric, and I voted for (a
similar) bill last year, but I think it's inappropriate to waste
taxpayers' money making a political statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was elected last year to replace Fred Dudley, who left
office to run unsuccessfully for attorney general. Saunders is up
for election again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court in Miami struck down last year's ban, saying it
was too broadly written and protect the health of the woman seeking
the procedure. The state had to pay nearly $100,000 in attorneys
fees for the other side defending it.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure involves terminating a pregnancy after the birth
of the entire body except the head. It is rare enough that sponsor
Sen. Anna Cowin, R-Leesburg, at an earlier hearing, could not cite
a single instance of its use in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Jack Latvala had also questioned the
constitutionality of the bill but left the committee room during
the vote to work out a deal on lawsuit reform, leaving Saunders in
the hot seat. Saunders said later he could have walked out also _ a
3-3 tie along party lines would have killed the bill _ but felt
honor-bound to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights attorney Charlene Carres said Saunders was just
one of several senators who looked at the facts and saw a case that
couldn't be won in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the senators on this committee thought hard
about what they were doing,'' Carres said. ``Today we were
fortunate that a majority of senators felt they way they did.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``Choose Life'' license plate and a bill requiring parental
notice for abortions for girls under 18 are expected to pass, with
legal challenges expected. The Senate health committee earlier
rejected a bill placing additional regulations on clinics that
perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 partial-birth ban narrowed the definition of the
procedure but did not include an exemption for the health of the
mother. That was by design, with the expectations of a renewed
legal battle, sponsor Cowin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it will be challenged and we will follow that in the
courts,'' Cowin said during debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, was one of the three Democrats to
vote against the bill. His own sister had a similar procedure
because of health complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal view is I'm still concerned is if we have to make
a decision between the baby being born and the health of the mother
that we would want to sacrifice the health of the mother,'' Klein
said.

 &HT;    Student voucher plan runs into senatorial roadblock
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to give private school
vouchers to the students attending the state's worst public schools
hit a snag Tuesday, courtesy of a state senator Bush helped elect
last month.
</P>
<P>
   What Democrats tried and failed to do in the House two weeks ago
and for two hours on the Senate floor Tuesday, novice Jacksonville
Sen. Jim King managed in just a few minutes, successfully pushing
an amendment that narrows the reach of Bush's voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and the House want to offer ``opportunity
scholarships'' to every child in a school deemed failing by the
state for two years running, King's amendment would give vouchers
only to those students in those failing schools who also score in
the bottom fourth on statewide assessment tests.
</P>
<P>
   King said he had not researched how many students at the four
schools now considered failing would meet that criterion. Bush
spokesman Cory Tilley said the governor's office hadn't produced
that statistic, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it something we support? We don't,'' Tilley said, but added
that the amendment doesn't destroy the point of the bill. ``We're
confident we can still come up with a piece of legislation that's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   King said he wanted to make sure that those students who most
need the help get it, and not unnecessarily expand an experimental
program to those students who many not need it. His first attempt
to pass the amendment fell short on a 20-20 tie, which was undone
minutes later on a motion to reconsider the vote by Sen. Pat
Thomas, D-Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   The second time around, King's amendment passed 23-17, with a
total of eight Republicans _ King included _ voting with the
chamber's 15 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   King said later he meant no disrespect by his action _ ``The guy
came down and helped me get elected. He walked precincts with me''
_ and he understands if Bush feels a proprietary ``pride of
authorship'' for the voucher bill. Nonetheless, he said he clearly
spelled out his cautious attitude toward private school vouchers
before his special election last month and felt he couldn't now
change his view just because the governor asked him to.
</P>
<P>
   Senate bill sponsor Anna Cowin, R-Leesburg, said she hoped to
remove King's addition after the bill passes the full Senate and
she can negotiate differences with the version passed by the House,
which, more closely follows Bush's original proposal.
</P>
<P>
   That passage probably won't happen until Friday _ originally
planned as a short work day for the Senate. King's amendment was
just the second of 11 he has filed, and the seventh of some 50 the
chamber needs to hear before voting on the bill. Senate President
Toni Jennings originally planned it for Thursday, but now will
spend that day dealing with the remaining amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to make arrangements to be here on Friday,''
Jennings warned her senators.

 &HT;    Golf not too unlike life for Olazabal
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It was last Tuesday night, just before the
Champions' dinner in the clubhouse at Augusta National Golf Course.
The then-reigning champ, Mark O'Meara, was serving chicken and
steak fajitas, and sushi.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the crew sat down, Gary Player pulled Jose Maria
Olazabal aside.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what happened next, you must understand that
Player, 63, considers himself a grandfather figure to all of golf's
non-U.S. players.
</P>
<P>
   Player, from South Africa, set the standard to which they all
aspire. He has won all four major professional championships, one
of only four men (Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus are the
others) to do so.
</P>
<P>
   So Player said to Olazabal, ``I'd like to talk to you for about
five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal: ``OK. Whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Player: ``How are you playing?''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal: ``Ok. So-so.''
</P>
<P>
   Player: ``How is your confidence?''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal: ``Not really great.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Olazabal said Player looked at him ``with those eyes _
you know how he looks with those eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   (Player has a stare of steel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a great swing,'' Player said. ``If you didn't, I
wouldn't tell you this. But you have a great swing, and you have to
believe in yourself, you know? Look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Olazabal got up and went into a linebacker's
stance with his arms straight out in front of him, hands extended,
palms to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He said Player went into this stance and said, ``Look at me!
Look at me!''
</P>
<P>
   And then he quoted Player:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to believe in yourself. You have to believe in
yourself. You play 18 holes. If you don't play well, it doesn't
matter. You go to the driving range and practice hard. After that
you go to the putting green and you keep on putting there. That's
how you achieve things.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like Knute Rockne in the Notre Dame dressing room before
the Army game.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal laughed as he stood up out of his crouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``you have to see him like that. The
determination and his words and the way he said it. It helped me.
It helped me to believe in myself, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, while all around him were being exposed by
gusting winds, pavement-hard greens and jelly nerves, Olazabal was
playing the final 13 holes in 4-under-par to win his second
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Jose Maria Olazabal was born, his mother was hard
at work, setting pins on her greenskeeper husband's golf course.
No, not putting the pins in, putting the cups in.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on that course, near the Spanish fishing village of
Fuenterrabia, being handed his first cut-off club when he was 2 and
actually playing at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   At 33 and a millionaire many times over, he could have built a
mansion anywhere. Instead, he still lives in the 250-year-old
Basque farmhouse in which he was born with his mother, father and
younger sister, a common practice in Spain, where generations live
together through their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal San Sebastian putting green is 20 yards from his front
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first one in my family who had an option,'' he said.
``Until me, we've been very poor and had to work all day long to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has considered joining the U.S. tour more than once,
each time he has decided to stay loyal to the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Because, for Jose Maria Olazabal, there was no option.
</P>
<P>
   He's still the kid from the small town. Only the stage is
bigger.

 SEEING THE '60s THROUGH A '90s CORRECTIVE LENS   (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A whiff of incense mixed with marijuana smoke drifts through two
recent movies, ``Hideous Kinky'' and ``A Walk on the Moon,'' both
of which conjure an era that Hollywood, in its devotion to snugly
happy endings, has largely avoided.
</P>
<P>
   In the countercultural dream that has so intimidated Hollywood,
a hippie Pied Piper with stringy shoulder-length hair, a fringed
jacket and reeking of patchouli oil is banging a tambourine on his
knee with one hand and flashing a peace sign with the other. Beside
him are a trio of spaced-out go-go girls shimmying and gazing
groggily into the purple haze.
</P>
<P>
   Although that signature scent, blown across three decades of
shifting winds, isn't overpowering in these films, it is just
pungent enough to suggest that what we think of as ``the 60s'' _
the years (1964-72) bracketed musically by Beatlemania and
``American Pie'' _ were not a hallucination but a messy,
uncomfortable reality.
</P>
<P>
   In their hesitantly nostalgic ways, both films remind us that in
the days of turning on, tuning in and dropping out, people actually
followed Timothy Leary's notorious prescription for personal
enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   But in remaining true to Hollywood's tidy, late-'90s formulas,
they also suggest that dropping back in was just as easy and that
all that dope smoking, acid tripping, searching, protesting and
free love was an adolescent prank, a temporary lapse of judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that this heady ethos was really just an episode in a
cultural mini-series whose happy ending finds the Dow Jones
industrials hovering around 10,000 and garish $1 million houses
sprouting all over the American landscape is a quintessential
revisionist view of what the 60s were about.
</P>
<P>
   These films insinuate that thousands of ex-hippies, now in their
late 40s and 50s and presiding in executive suites, emulated Bill
Clinton's experiment with marijuana and never inhaled. And if they
did inhale, God forbid their children should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Both films focus on young, attractive women who break the rules
to pursue sexual and spiritual transcendence, then return to the
middle-class lives they renounced. In the smart, beautifully acted
``Hideous Kinky,'' set in Morocco in 1972, Kate Winslet is Julia, a
young Englishwoman drifting around North Africa with two young
daughters in tow and no money.
</P>
<P>
   In Marrakech she meets a Moroccan street acrobat (Said
Taghmaoui) who is also penniless. The two make love, smoke hashish
and drag the girls along on a risky trek into the Moroccan
countryside. Now and then, Julia, who aspires to learn Sufi
dancing, makes noises about wanting to experience pure joy by
obliterating her ego.
</P>
<P>
   In reimagining an era of hippies, dropouts and seekers after a
higher consciousness, ``Hideous Kinky'' is accurate as far as it
goes. But that isn't very far. The movie conveys only the flavor of
the time. Julia's quest is portrayed as muddled and vague, and the
movie nudges us again and again to recognize what a terrible,
irresponsible parent she is.
</P>
<P>
   When one daughter insists she wants to return to England and
have a proper education, her mother is dumbfounded. True, Julia
radiates a certain defiant charm. But in the film's overall
judgment, she is also a silly spaced-out fool who must come to her
senses. And in the end she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon'' follows its protagonist Pearl Kantrowitz
(Diane Lane) to a working-class Jewish resort in the Catskills in
the summer of 1969. Pearl, who married her husband, Marty (Liev
Schreiber), when she became pregnant at 17, is now the mother of a
14-year-old daughter, Alison (Anna Paquin), who is just entering
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, while Marty is back in New York City repairing
televisions, Pearl plunges into an affair with Walker (Viggo
Mortensen), a smolderingly handsome peddler of blouses that he
sells to the summer colony out of his van.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl momentarily loses her head and slips off with Walker to
the nearby Woodstock festival, where her daughter accidentally
witnesses Pearl, body-painted and ecstatic, being whirled in her
lover's arms. Alison is understandably upset. When Pearl finally
has to choose between Marty and Walker, the small, finely acted
film caves in to 90s movie values.
</P>
<P>
   In the final scene, Pearl and her husband begin a tentative slow
dance to music on the radio: a soupy version of Dean Martin singing
``When You're Smiling.'' Marty, realizing that his wife has almost
left him behind in the '50s, switches to a station playing Jimi
Hendrix's ``Purple Haze.'' Signaling that he'll try to get with the
times, he relaxes and swings out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Walk on the Moon'' is a decent little film, but in reducing
a wrenching life decision to a matter of switching radio stations,
it blithely denies the enormous power of the forces that have
tugged Pearl into an affair. An earlier scene in the film
juxtaposes images of Pearl and Walker making love at the exact
moment Neil Armstrong first sets foot on the moon. The implication
is clear. For Pearl, this is not just a dalliance but an
earthshaking, life-changing sexual awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Had ``A Walk on the Moon'' been made in the '70s, there is
little doubt that the character would have forsaken her family to
go on the road with her sexual savior. Today, that's just not
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   In what they show and don't show of the '60s, both films raise
disturbing questions: When did it become embarrassing for the mass
media to portray the counterculture as a movement driven by
passionate idealism and a reckless insistence on crashing through
barriers? Could it be that the movies are too scared of the era and
the freedoms it represented to confront it head-on?
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, Hollywood has tried. ``Easy Rider,'' which
came out of left field in 1969 and was made for a dime, proved to
be a one-of-a-kind, a fluke. While other films of the period, like
``Midnight Cowboy'' and ``Five Easy Pieces,'' and later,
``Shampoo'' and ``Coming Home,'' expressed a combative, rebellious
spirit, they didn't dive in to the thick of things.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood was very late in addressing the Vietnam War. It had to
be safely behind us before we could begin to watch movies about it.
Among Hollywood's leading filmmakers, only Oliver Stone, in films
like ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' ``Platoon'' and ``The Doors,''
has taken the passions of the 60s seriously enough to portray the
full impact of the generational and political fissures that ripped
open the American psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Stone's films, vintage rock music and rock
documentaries, from ``Monterey Pop'' to ``Gimme Shelter,'' seem to
do a much better job than most feature films of capturing the era.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One could list a hundred reasons why Hollywood has never given
the 60s their due. High on that list would be the problem of '60s
fashions. Even at the time, the hordes who donned the more
extravagant hippie regalia often looked ridiculous. How could
anyone take such weirdly dressed characters seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the stoned-out argot adopted by millions of
young people in the late '60s and early '70s (with its ``right
ons''; ``like, mans'' and (italics)``heavies''(end italics)). Today
it sounds quaint and surprisingly conformist.
</P>
<P>
   Post baby-boomers may find it hard to envision block after city
block of shaggy- haired young people clad in exotic robes and
finery milling in the streets. But such scenes were commonplace in
San Francisco, in college communities and in the East Village of
New York City in the late '60s. On Sunday afternoons, the area
around the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park became a stoned soul
picnic in which hundreds of artists, pot-smoking hippies, drug
dealers and musicians congregated for fragrant, dreamy communal
love-ins.
</P>
<P>
   As one who embarked on the same pharmaceutical, sexual and
political consciousness-raising adventures that millions of others
did, I can remember a day when I was so convinced that the world
had changed forever that I tossed all my neckties into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   In the antimaterialistic spirit of the times, I gave away
treasured possessions, which amounted to almost nothing in those
days: a collection of cherished 45 rpm records donated to a
friend's jukebox. Determined to ``rip off'' the system, one day I
bravely pilfered a can of tuna fish from a supermarket shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting some friends in Key West, Fla., in the spring of 1969,
I descended on a town crawling with drugged-out hippies, including
a self-proclaimed white-robed Jesus. During that sojourn, I met a
skinny, acid-tripping girl who solemnly informed me that ``Any Day
Now,'' the title of Joan Baez's new album of Bob Dylan songs,
referred to Dylan's imminent suicide. ``He's just going to trip
right out,'' she said with that special hushed ``Wow!'' in her
voice that seriously hip people attached to all things mystical.
</P>
<P>
   As much as that counterculture was mobilized by antiwar
sentiment, its driving force was really drugs, and not only
psychedelics. In the quest to ``break on through to the other
side,'' as Jim Morrison bellowed, any and every stimulant was
enlisted for the cause. Amphetamines, which were widely available
back then and carried little stigma, contributed immeasurably to
the collective paranoia that was rapidly building up. And, of
course, there was always booze to smooth the transitions.
</P>
<P>
   Two other random flashbacks. In one, I am hounded out of a
Chinese restaurant by a radical feminist and her poet husband after
I describe my extremely liberal political views. But they and their
revolutionary comrades have big plans to sabotage the 1968
presidential elections by, among other tactics, vomiting on the
voting machines. Liberals were their worst enemies. ``When the
revolution comes, you'll be one of the first to go!'' they scream,
and I'm out of there. Fast.
</P>
<P>
   In the other, I am living in New York and supplying lyrics for a
revolutionary rock band no one has ever heard of in another city.
Asked to donate $300 _ a third of my life savings at the time _ for
sound equipment, I gladly obliged, only to discover that the money
has gone up the leader's nose in crystal methedrine. So much for
the new Beatles!
</P>
<P>
   Recalling such crazy 60s moments, I wonder if what we call the
'60s was a mass psychosis that is either best forgotten or swept
under the rug. But I don't think so. For all the smashed lives and
insanity that such excesses brought, the root of that frenzied
exploration still strikes me as an honest, if naive, effort to
improve the human condition by storming the barricades of
consciousness. That idealism is distilled in the best music of the
era, which combines a majestic rage with an exhilarating eroticism.
</P>
<P>
   Today's social climate is in many ways antithetical to that of
30 years ago when the notion of capitalism itself was under siege.
The power of today's American economy combined with the country's
conservative, comformist values, make joining the system
irresistible to all but a few. Rebellion is reduced to a matter of
fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   If the AIDS epidemic ended the sexual revolution, sexual allure
has increasingly become the major marketing tool fueling the
economy. Rock may have been superseded by rap, but the history of
rock-and-roll is probably the one with which more Americans are
familiar than any other. As for drugs, the new miracle elixirs,
Prozac and the other serotonin boosters are tools to help people
become happier, more efficient producers in the great American
money machine.
</P>
<P>
   Movies may never get the 60s right. For one thing, those days
are fading fast, and many of the Hollywood studio executives
calling the shots are Wunderkinds in their 20s and 30s whose
closest contact with the '60s are VH1 flashbacks or their parents'
(censored) anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   In his sweetly prescient '60s ballad, ``Younger Generation,''
John Sebastian, a quintessential Woodstock-era songwriter,
contemplated impending fatherhood and the raising of an adolescent
son. ``And then I'll know that all I've learned my kid assumes/And
all my deepest worries must be his cartoons,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   In a way he was right. But the lessons taught by the '60s are
not the ones that those who lived through them imagined they would
be.

 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There could be at least five quarterbacks picked in the first
round of this weekend's NFL draft. The player to be chosen at No. 1
depends on which of the 50 million draft analysts, scouts, coaches,
personnel men or stat geeks you talk to.
</P>
<P>
   The group of quarterbacks is cluttered, like a menu at a tourist
restaurant on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Browns decide to pick a quarterback with the first
pick in draft, it should be Tim Couch. He stands out the way
lobster distinguishes itself from a quarter-pounder with cheese.
Nothing against the other passers available, but few of them can
run an offense the way Couch can.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years as a starter for Kentucky, he put up numbers
never before seen in the Southeastern Conference. He threw for more
than 4,000 yards with 36 touchdown passes. In six different games,
he threw over 50 passes. Couch has something that is difficult to
teach: an ability to feel a football game, a talent that many
quarterbacks spend years trying to develop.
</P>
<P>
   The great ones wrap themselves in a cocoon, and nothing
penetrates that shield. Not screaming fans. Not a drooling
defensive tackle. Not even a coach like Bill Parcells hollering at
his quarterback in front of teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Couch has the calmness needed to function in today's
high-intensity game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I call it,'' said one personnel director
whose team is in position to draft Couch should the Browns pick
someone else. ``I just call it cool. He is cool under pressure,
kind of cocky in some ways. That's good as far as I'm concerned.
You want your quarterback to act like everything is fine, even if
he knew the world was going to end next Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch does have some things to learn. He took too many
blind-side hits in college, which in the pros usually leads to a
concussion. And he had a tendency to throw off his back foot, and
hold the ball at ear level, instead of around his shoulder. But
these are minor flaws that Browns coach Chris Palmer, excellent
working with quarterbacks, can help fix.
</P>
<P>
   And please, do not talk about how Couch got his big numbers
because of the run-and-shoot offense, and how those kinds of
players don't make it big in the pros. Couch completed over 70
percent of his passes, and run-and-shoot or not, that is
impressive. He is also smart enough to adapt to a more pro-style
system.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Ware and David Klingler were run-and-shoot busts, but one
of the originals, Neil Lomax, was a productive NFL player. Couch's
arm strength is also questioned. But while his power may not be
measured in megatons, it is more than good enough.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he doesn't throw the ball across a river. At
Kentucky, he could drop it into a wide receiver's hands anywhere on
the field. And there were no questions about his arm when he lit up
a talented Florida team last year for 406 yards and three
touchdowns. That Gator defense could have three players drafted in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The same questions about arm strength swirled around Peyton
Manning before last year's draft. But after settling team and NFL
rookie records for attempts, completions, yards and touchdowns,
those questions went the way of the eight-track tape. A
quarterback's arm does not need to be strong _ just strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone can be Phil Simms, and Joe Montana did just fine
without a cannon arm. Couch will be a starter in this league for a
long time. He is the kind of player a franchise can build around
for the next 10 years. Think hard, Cleveland, pick the safe
quarterback, the best quarterback, and then sleep tight knowing
that if Couch is the choice, you made the right one.

COMPANY BUILDS BOOTHS AGAINST POISON, BULLETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Spurred by concerns about terrorism,
officials of Valencia, Calif.-based Delta Scientific Corp. said
Tuesday that the company has developed a bulletproof guard booth
with chemical and biological warfare defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first of their kind, the booths would help maintain
security during a terrorist attack by providing a haven for victims
and rescuers alike, officials at the north Los Angeles County firm
said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Vice President David Dickinson said there already is
significant interest in the system, expected to cost roughly
$60,000, and the first prototype is being field-tested in a
location he wouldn't name.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said the booths are intended for more than the
security of soldiers and civilians in faraway lands or as a
response to the deadly 1995 sarin gas attack in a Tokyo subway.
Dickinson predicted the core market for the new booths will be in
the United States as the international threat of terrorism grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared here, so there's a risk here,'' Dickinson
said. ``This is vicious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The booths have interlocking decontamination showers and
advanced air-filtration systems, in addition to the standard
1{-inch-thick bulletproof windows and steel walls that already come
with Delta Scientific's ballistic-rated security booths.
</P>
<P>
   A system of new booths could protect perimeter security at a
facility after a chemical or biological attack. The booths also
could serve as sites for medical treatment of victims and
decontamination of rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   While too sophisticated and costly for the corner grocery store,
the chemical-biological warfare booths could gain a major following
in specialized, high-security markets, said David Howard, spokesman
for the American Society for Industrial Security, a trade
association with about 32,000 members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the general demand will be astonishingly high,''
he said. ``But within that niche, demand could be fairly high.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson said initial buyers are expected to include the
Department of Defense, the State Department, federal buildings and
``sensitive corporations with an international presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta Scientific already is noted for its heavy-duty,
anti-terrorist vehicle barriers. About 125 U.S. embassies and 85
nuclear power plants use them, and the barriers account for a
lion's share of the company's roughly $12 million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Security booths, both ballistic-rated and standard models, are a
relatively small part of the company's business, representing about
10 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   That could change with the new booths designed for protection
from chemical and biological gases, but Dickinson said there are
still ``some reservations as to whether this is a rational product
that is needed.'' He said similar doubt once surrounded the
introduction of bulletproof guard booths.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dickinson said, there is nothing conventionally
rational about criminals and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a rational person would not kill anyone using
chemical and biological agents,'' he said, ``there are a lot of
irrational people out there.''

 &HT;    School officials omit names from dropout lists to state
 &HT;    By Michele Kurtz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Austin school district, attempting to
prevent its high schools from being rated ``low-performing,''
worked hard to purge students' names from dropout lists sent to the
state, documents subpoenaed by a Travis County grand jury show.
</P>
<P>
   School district administrators in 1996 and 1997 calculated
exactly how many students _ of each ethnic group at each school _
could drop out before a school would receive the state's lowest
rating, internal school district memos show.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Psencik, the deputy superintendent who last week was
indicted along with the district in the test-tampering
investigation, wrote a 1996 memo to area superintendents directing
them to coach principals ``in strategies to improve their dropout
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the Austin district violated any laws or
whether it merely took advantage of various ways it could improve
its dropout data under the state's reporting system. Several former
and current school district employees interviewed for this story
said no one told them to do anything inappropriate when reporting
dropout data.
</P>
<P>
   But some acknowledged that the reporting system for dropouts has
potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Falling dropout rates statewide and in Austin have come under
increasing scrutiny in recent months. Legislators, public interest
groups and now the grand jury have questioned the numbers'
validity, with some critics calling the figures laughable and the
state's reporting system too lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please understand that I am holding you responsible for the
efforts of your campuses in lowering their dropout rates and
preventing a low-performing rating for 1996-97,'' Psencik wrote on
Nov. 19, 1996 _ a week before the schools' deadline for reporting
dropout numbers to the district.
</P>
<P>
   In her memo, Psencik said five high schools had preliminary
dropout numbers high enough to warrant low-performing ratings. But
in the spring of 1997, not one received that low-performing
designation.
</P>
<P>
   Psencik has refused to discuss the memos, citing her pending
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Roy Minton, said Psencik wanted dropout
information reported accurately. Previously, some students on
schools' dropout lists were attending school elsewhere, but the
Austin district discovered them too late to take them off the
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that she was never telling anyone to change
something from accurate to inaccurate,'' Minton said.
</P>
<P>
   The school district has implemented several strategies to combat
the dropout problem, including creating Garza Independence High
School, designed to lure students back to school and keep others
from quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Schools were also expected to whittle down their dropout numbers
by finding students who had left school and either enrolled
elsewhere or planned to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   And Ricky Arredondo, the district's formerdata analyst and the
central figure in the test-tampering investigation, emphasized in a
handful of memos to his supervisors that schools could also remove
students from their dropout lists if the students have ``intent'' _
the word appeared in bold type _ to enroll in General Education
Development (GED) programs.
</P>
<P>
   Arredondo and his attorney did not return phone calls requesting
comment for this story.
</P>
<P>
   In an August 1997 memo, Arredondo predicted that a more rigorous
state-required reporting system would produce soaring dropout
numbers that would ``shock'' Austin and other communities this
spring. He referred in the memo to students whom the district
reported as having enrolled in other districts, but who never
actually did. The state for the first time can now track those
students. The dropout figures tallied under the new system are
expected to be released statewide later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The issues mentioned in the Austin district memos are central to
the grand jury investigation into dropout statistics, Travis County
Attorney Ken Oden said. Oden began an investigation into Austin's
test tampering last fall and expanded it a few months ago to
include the possible manipulation of dropout data.
</P>
<P>
   Oden said the questions about dropout reporting, which he calls
a ``wink-and-nod system,'' likely aren't unique to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is strong reason to be very suspect or very
concerned about the accuracy of dropout data produced by our school
district and, I'm afraid, by the statewide system,'' Oden said.
``There is great incentive by administrators at every level to
minimize those numbers because the truth may be disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency said the state
keeps better records of dropouts than it did 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving to a more comprehensive reporting system this
school year that we hope will provide a more complete and accurate
listing of students who leave their public schools,'' said
spokeswoman Debbie Graves Ratcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   Oden, whose office this week began interviewing school
record-keepers under oath, said that even if the Austin district
has manipulated dropout statistics, the actions might not rise to
the level of criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with numbers in the Austin schools
</P>
<P>
   Several Austin schools in 1995 or 1996 _ including Austin,
Bowie, Lanier and Reagan high schools _ had earned the state's
low-performing designation because of high dropout counts. In the
two years following, district correspondence shows, school
officials dedicated significant energy to avoiding similar ratings
among the high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was there, there were quite a few high schools that
were rated low-performing. There was a lot of pressure to clear the
record on that, to get them out of low-performing,'' said Hector
Montenegro, an area superintendent in the Austin district in
1995-96 who is now San Marcos' superintendent. ``After I left, the
pressure was stepped up quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Baldwin, principal of Garza and a former principal of
Fulmore Middle School, recalled going to great lengths to locate
students who had quit attending school during her tenure at
Fulmore. She said that her school's reporting was always accurate
but that it's conceivable some schools might have bent the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some practices that are unscrupulous. Part
of that has to do with sheer volume,'' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Memos show that the district took a two-pronged approach to
fixing its dropout problem: It spends about $4.5 million on
dropout-prevention programs a year. Among those programs is Garza
Independence High School, which opened in January 1998. And in the
mid-1990s, the district started the Delta Program, an
individualized learning program available at each high school.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the district has focused more heavily on
cleaning up data and reducing dropout numbers. Sometimes, the
district dispatched visiting teachers to track down students and
sent data experts and district officials to help schools cut their
dropout lists.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, Arredondo sent area superintendents a memo with
two attachments: the most recent bimonthly preliminary dropout
count for schools, and a report that listed the precise number of
students at each high school _ in each ethnic group and those
considered from low-income homes _ that could drop out before a
school would be rated low-performing. Schools are ranked
low-performing if 6 percent or more of their students drop out, or
if 6 percent of any subgroup drop out. Arredondo asked the area
superintendents to pass along copies of the data to the principals
in their districts. Defining a ``dropout'' Reducing dropout numbers
is a complicated and time-consuming endeavor for schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, a student who stops coming to school is generally
considered a dropout unless a school district has documented one of
several things, such as that the student has transferred to another
school, enrolled in college early, enrolled in a GED program or
died. Parents mustsign a form specifying the student's plans. If a
school has no record of a transfer and doesn't know the student's
whereabouts, the district mustreport him or her as a dropout.
</P>
<P>
   The TEA expects districts to make a ``good-faith effort'' to
check whether former students attend programs they say they will _
and have not merely dropped out of school, said L.T. Bailey of the
agency's data inquiry unit, which investigates data anomalies in
districts.
</P>
<P>
   For students classified as seeking GEDs, Bailey said state
investigators prefer more than a form with a parent's signature as
proof the student enrolled. But several other TEA officials said
districts need only a parent's signature _ or that of the student
if he's or she is at least 18 _ indicating plans to pursue a GED.
</P>
<P>
   As Arredondo saw it, schools had to to show only that a student
has ``intent'' to enroll in a GED program, which he noted in a few
memos to Psencik and then-Superintendent Jim Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this documentation indicates the student has intentto
re-enroll in a graduation or GED program, the no-show can be
removed from a campus dropout list,'' Arredondo wrote in 1997 and
again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When state investigators questioned large numbers of withdrawals
among some Austin high schools in 1997, they urged Austin officials
to try to confirm former students' enrollment in GED programs. But
Arredondo said in a memo to Psencik that district officials asked
state investigators whether they were required to track those
students, and the investigators said, ``No, but it is a good
idea.'' Clerical staffs at the high schools said the task would be
a huge burden, Arredondo wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin district is now trying to establish communication
with area GED programs, said Susan Kemp, interim director of
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 10 years ago, the state suspected that large numbers of
students reported as dropouts had transferred to other Texas
districts. So beginning in 1990, state officials tried to find the
students. The process, dubbed ``dropout recovery,'' also lowered
the state's dropout numbers _ by 4,452 students for the first year.
It later was expanded to include other students, such as those who
had earned GEDs. Last year, the state's recovery process shrank the
dropout list by more than 16,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, districts like Austin have begun their own
``recovery'' efforts, trying to track down missing students to get
them back in school or show they're attending school elsewhere or
plan to attend. Each fall, the district generates a preliminary
dropout list _ middle and high school students who failed to show
up for school and who apparently quit with no legitimate record for
withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors and other school employees locate former students by
making phone calls and even visiting homes. They may try to
re-enroll students, learn they are attending elsewhere or suggest
adult education classes.
</P>
<P>
   Some involved in tracking former students said the general idea
is a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think overall the main concern is that they find a program
for the students,'' said Bonnie McDonald, Austin High's registrar.
``Of course, there's a lot of pressure to get students off the
dropout list. I can't deny that at all. I feel it. But it won't do
them any good if you just get them off the list. You've got to get
that student in a program that works for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Interim Superintendent A.C. Gonzalez and other top-level
administrators would not comment on the memos or the district's
dropout reporting, citing the grand jury's ongoing investigation.
But Gonzalez, who took the district's reins in April 1998, stressed
that the district should spend the bulk of its dropout efforts on
keeping kids in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus should be on the quality of the educational system
we are providing students, and not how to focus on refinements to
make ourselves look better,'' Gonzalez said. ``There is a very
legitimate function for us to be getting information that is
correct, but the emphasis needs to be on the success of children,
not on a particular score or rating.''

 &HT;    Whirlpool to expand Ohio plant
 &HT;    By Scott Elliott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Whirlpool Corp. will expand its Greenville plant
to add 180 jobs, thanks in part to a $500,000 state grant.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Development on Tuesday awarded the Darke
County Community Improvement Corp. $150,000 to acquire land and
$350,000 for road work to expand KitchenAid Way, a small access
road near Ohio 127 and Children's Home-Bradford Road that serves
the Whirlpool plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to build a 70,000-square-foot building to
house a production line for its new generation stand mixer product.
Whirlpool is the world's leading manufacturer of home appliances,
including washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers and electric
mixers.
</P>
<P>
   The 181,000-square-foot Greenville plant is the exclusive maker
of KitchenAid small appliances, including mixers, toasters and
blenders.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool consolidated four Greenville plants at the KitchenAid
Way location in 1996 and has since added 200 jobs. Employment at
the plant ranges from as many as 850 workers during its peak season
near the end of the year to as few as 600.
</P>
<P>
   With the new $9.4 million building, the company plans to add 180
more jobs in the next three years, plant manager Stan Kinnett said.
At its peak employment, Whirlpool employs more workers than any
other business in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had great growth. It's time for an addition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnett said the expansion could not take place without better
road access. The company does not have a date for when work will
begin.

NYC POLICE UNION REBUKES COMMISSIONER, URGES HIS SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The union representing city police officers cast a
vote of no confidence in Police Commissioner Howard Safir on
Tuesday, questioning many of his actions in recent months and
saying that officers are under tremendous pressure to make arrests
and issue summonses.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president James Savage said
the Giuliani administration's zero-tolerance approach to crimes,
particularly quality-of-life offenses, had outlived its usefulness
now that crime has gone down. Further, he said that officers were
being pressured to make arrests and issue summonses in every
incident, which he said has harmed the public's perception of
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When zero-tolerance tactics were first introduced by the
department, crime was at an all-time high,'' Savage told the
delegates. ``Now that crime is way down, an adjustment of the
strategy is required. If we don't strike a balance between
aggressive enforcement and common sense, it becomes a blueprint for
a police state and tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote has no practical effect and comes from a union that has
frequently clashed with the Giuliani administration over pay and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the unanimous vote by the PBA's delegates signals that
the commissioner has lost the public support of many of his
officers at a time when the department itself is on the defensive
for its aggressive tactics in the wake of the Feb. 4 shooting of
Amadou Diallo, who was killed in a barrage of 41 police bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote by the 400 delegates also comes as Safir's
leadership of the department has increasingly been called into
question after several incidents, including his acceptance of a
free trip to attend the Academy Awards and his use of detectives to
investigate a car accident involving his wife and to provide
security at his daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, the union cited these incidents in calling on
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to suspend the commissioner from duty until
these incidents can be investigated for possible ethical
violations. Savage, who faces a hotly contested election campaign
to keep the union's presidency, said that officers who engaged in
such actions would be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are actions that ordinary police officers can be and
have been suspended for,'' he said. ``This is a police commissioner
who boasts that he has disciplined and fired more cops than his two
immediate predecessors combined. But he has a double standard _ one
for our members, and one for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has strongly defended Safir as the commissioner's
actions have been questioned in recent weeks, continued to stand by
Safir on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to appoint the commissioner, not the PBA, so it's my
vote of confidence that counts,'' Giuliani said in Austin, Texas,
where he was meeting with Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Safir accused Savage of using the no-confidence vote to bolster
his campaign for the union presidency, calling the vote ``a
desperate act by a desperate man who is in trouble in his
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is facing a contested election for the first time in
years. Savage, the acting president, is running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   One of his opponents, Jimmy Higgins, the union's recording
secretary, criticized Tuesday's vote, saying, ``I think it was a
publicity ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the department's crackdown on quality-of-life crimes _
minor offenses, usually misdemeanors, like subway fare beating,
reckless bicycle riding and shoplifting _ Safir again denied that
the department has quotas for summonses and tickets. ``Part of the
reason crime continues to be reduced is the enforcement of
quality-of-life crimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of union delegates at meeting Tuesday in Queens
complained that police officers have been driven to make arrests
and write tickets by commanders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officer Michael Wilson, a delegate at the Police Academy, said
the increase in summonses written by officers had harmed their
relationship with the public and cast cops as the heavies in many
of their interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Rosenthal, a former police chief who now teaches at John
Jay College, marveled at the recent turn of events. ``It's really
fascinating times when the PBA is setting the standard for values
and conduct and the police commissioner is the target and subject
of the investigations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Reppetto, head of the Citizens' Crime Commission, said
that tension between police commissioners and the police union was
nothing new, noting that the union booed Commissioner Stephen
Kennedy in the 1950s and picketed the home of Commissioner Michael
Codd in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The normal condition of the police commissioner is to be
embattled,'' he said. ``I calculated that 85 per cent of
commissioners were either dismissed or resigned. So I say to
Commissioner Safir, `Welcome to the club!' ''

 &HT;    Two former Tarheel Klansmen indicted for attempted murder
 &HT;    By Jason Spencer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A pair of North Carolina Klansmen involved in a
shootout and high-speed chase with area law officers were indicted
Tuesday by a Bastrop County grand jury on two charges of attempted
capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Jimmy Ray Shelton, 40, and Eddie Melvin
Bradley, 24, tried to kill a Williamson County sheriff's deputy and
an Elgin patrolman during the 30-minute chase on March 26. Bullets
allegedly fired by Bradley shattered the windshields on patrol cars
driven by Deputy Julius Matus and Patrolman Brian Garvel, who was
grazed across the chin by a bullet fragment or glass shard.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and Bradley are both being held at the Bastrop County
Jail in lieu of $275,000 bail. They face maximum penalties of life
in prison for each charge.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the jail, Shelton said he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, who until recently was a high-ranking member of the
American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, has a history of run-ins with
federal and local law officers in North Carolina. Klan experts call
the American Knights the fastest-growing Klan organization in
America, with members in 27 chapters nationwide, including the
Texas towns of Arlington, Odessa and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an organization of gangsters, and most of the leaders
have criminal records,'' said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which tracks Klan
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's chase began in Taylor when officers say they
spotted Shelton driving his pickup on Main Street at about 85 mph.
Williamson County sheriff's deputies tailed the pickup south on
Texas 95 to U.S. 290 in Elgin, where local police joined the chase
and Bradley allegedly fired the first of eight to 14 gunshots from
his passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit continued east on U.S. 290 and ended when a
Department of Public Safety trooper shot out the truck's tires east
of McDade. Inside the pickup, officers found four rifles, a hand
gun, ammunition, a cord capable of detonating explosives, seven
knives, night-vision goggles, four Confederate flags and a small
amount of methamphetamine. What initially were suspected to be ten
armor-piercing bullets instead turned out to be standard
ammunition, according to Texas Ranger Lynn ``Rocky'' Wardlow, who
is heading up the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found a Bible with an inscription dated last
year that identified Shelton as the Imperial Wizard of the Church
of the Confederate Ghost Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton says he was in Texas looking for work in the
construction industry and blames law officers for initiating the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just looking for a place to live,'' Shelton said. ``The
police fired first and they rammed me first, so I didn't know what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said he left his position as head of security _ known as
``nighthawk'' _ of the North Carolina chapter of the American
Knights to form a new Klan group and recruited Bradley, along with
more than 1,000 others nationwide, to join. ``They're about hate
and I'm not,'' Shelton said. ``I'm just a plain ol' country
preacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton's claim to have voluntarily left the American Knights
three years ago is contradicted by others.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton was quoted in an Asheville, N.C. newspaper discussing
his participation in an American Knights courthouse rally in
October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton also was at an American Knights rally last August in
Lexington, N.C., where he was arrested for carrying a concealed
weapon and sentenced to 5 years probation, law officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Berry, the American Knights' national leader, says Shelton
was forced out of the Indiana-based organization last August
because he ``wasn't American Knights material.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who has appeared on the Jerry Springer Show, laughed when
told of Shelton's claim to more than 1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only three of them and you guys got two of them in
jail,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   A Charlotte, N.C. FBI agent specializing in hate crime
investigations says Shelton was often spotted conducting Klan
activity with Berry. He said Bradley has been identified as a Klan
``wannabe.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent, who asked not to be identified, agreed with Berry's
assertion that the Confederate Ghost Knights has few members.
</P>
<P>
   He also said other racist organizations, such as skin-heads and
Neo-Nazis, are typically more violent than Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton has had several other altercations with law officers,
according to Lt. Philip Byers of the Rutherford County Sheriff's
Department in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Although Shelton has not been charged in the crime, two of his
associates are set to stand trial in federal court this week on
charges they fired gunshots into the home of a black family in
Rutherfordton, N.C. last May, Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Shelton has been a suspect in a lot of different cases and
has been arrested for carrying a concealed weapon at a Klan rally
here in North Carolina as well as had numerous weapons seized from

MARKET PLACE: DAY TRADERS ARE FORMIDABLE FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: In references to E(ASTERISK)Trade, replace (ASTERISK) with

<P>
   Having evolved from a nation of savers to one of investors,
America is rapidly becoming a country of traders.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, several brokerage firms have just reported record
profits, fueled in large part by a surge in stock trading among
both individuals and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the frenzy comes from day traders, who take advantage of
the low cost of trading stocks over the Internet to buy and sell
rapidly and profit from small changes in stock prices. A formidable
market force, this group has recently focused on one of the areas
they like best, brokerage firms, bidding up the stocks of the very
companies profiting from their business.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest stocks belong to Charles Schwab, E(ASTERISK)Trade,
Ameritrade Holding and the Knight/Trimark Group, which profit from
the growth in online trading by individuals. But traditional
brokerage giants like Merrill Lynch and Paine Webber, which
reported record first-quarter profits Tuesday, are also being swept
up in the enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price of Schwab, which operates the largest online
brokerage, has soared 40 percent in the last five days. Tuesday, it
gained $15.50 a share, to $150.50, giving the company a total
market value of more than $61 billion _ more than the combined
value of four old-line Wall Street firms, Merrill Lynch, Lehman
Brothers, Paine Webber and Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Ameritrade, another online discount broker, have more
than doubled in the last five days, climbing $31 Tuesday, to
$173.25; since the depth of the global financial crisis last
October, the shares have risen more than thirtyfold, from $5.625.
E(ASTERISK)Trade, another online broker, and Knight/Trimark, which
executes many of the trades placed with the online brokerage firms,
have each gained more than 50 percent in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the online brokerage firms have yet to post results for
the first quarter. But the surprising strength of the early group
has investors salivating over the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts had expected Paine Webber and Merrill Lynch,
for example, to earn less in the first three months of this year
than they did a year in the comparable period a year earlier. But
Paine Webber said Tuesday that its profit surged 31 percent, to
$1.01 a share from 77 cents a share in the first quarter of last
year, as commission income, the company's largest source of
revenues, climbed 17 percent. Paine Webber also said it would begin
offering online trading in the third quarter; the company's shares
gained $3.6875, to $47.25.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, marked a rebound from the global
downturn in financial markets last year by reporting first-quarter
earnings of $1.44 a share, up 14 percent from $1.26. The company,
which recently introduced online trading for some customers, saw
its commission revenues jump 7 percent, to a record $1.6 billion.
Merrill Lynch's share rose as high as $102.50 early Tuesday, their
highest level since last July, but finished the day down $2.5625 at
$97.375.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement about brokerage firms that do business online is
part of the broader enthusiasm for any company linked to the
Internet. But unlike their peers in many other industries, several
of the online brokers are already profitable.
</P>
<P>
   And their valuations are exponentially larger than those of
traditional brokerage firms. Schwab, which said Tuesday it was
seeking to hire 1,000 additional people, is trading at 170 times
earnings and 42 times book value, which is the value of the
company's assets minus its liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, shares of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, whose
market value of $65 billion makes it the only pure brokerage firm
with a value bigger than Schwab's, is trading at less than 18 times
earnings and 5 times book value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the investors who are paying those prices are not
relying on the valuation models that have been taught in business
school for the last 30 years,'' said A. James Ellman, manager of
the AIM Global Financial Services fund, which owns shares of Schwab
and Knight/Trimark. But the online firms are attractive because the
potential return on every dollar they invest is far higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have brokers sitting around in branch offices,''
Ellman said. ``They're trading human capital for technological
capital. It's akin to moving from a craftwork factory to an
assembly line factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have reacted, however, as if those factories are
spinning gold from dross. Schwab's market value is more than double
the $26 billion that will be assigned to Goldman, Sachs _
traditionally Wall Street's most profitable firm _ if Goldman's
initial offering is priced at $55 a share, the top of the predicted
range.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, if the stock market cools and day traders take a break,
the online brokerage stocks could be vulnerable. That goes for a
Schwab, which has a big mutual fund business to fall back on, and
more so for transaction-oriented firms like E(ASTERISK)Trade and
Ameritrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The margin of safety in owning Schwab has been removed,'' said
Kenneth Feinberg, co-manager of the Davis Financial fund, which
owns shares of Schwab but has a bigger stake in Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``But anyone who has ever sold their shares of Schwab has
regretted it.'' &QL;

AS FOURTH LYNX DIES, COLORADO SCALES BACK REINTRODUCTION EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Colo.)  (rk) 
 By   MINDY SINK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ An effort to reintroduce the lynx to Colorado suffered
another setback this week after a fourth cat died of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   The adolescent female cat, which died on Saturday, had been in
the wild in southwestern Colorado for about six weeks, wildlife
officials said on Monday. Since early February, 12 Canada lynxes
have been released in the wild with radio collars for tracking. The
first two females released have died of starvation. A male also
starved in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised and saddened'' by the latest death, said
Todd Malmsbury, a spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
``But we did tell people there would be mortality with any
reintroduction, maybe even as high as 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary diet of the elusive, large-pawed wildcats, which
weigh about 18 to 25 pounds as adults, is snowshoe hare. Malmsbury
said there was evidence that the most recent cat to die had eaten
rabbits and squirrels, but not enough to survive.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of trapping, the lynx was believed to have become
extinct in the state after 1973, when the last sighting was
reported, near Vail.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Division of Wildlife had planned to release about
50 of the small cats this year in the first phase of a three-year,
$750,000 reintroduction program. The project is being scaled back
to 42 releases this year because of the deaths and because the
animals trapped for the program were not the strongest specimens.
</P>
<P>
   No more animals will be trapped for the program this year in
Alaska and Canada, after the arrival of seven more Tuesday from
Alaska. The new arrivals brought to 30 the number of animals
awaiting release next month.
</P>
<P>
   Malmsbury said the lynxes would be held in captivity for about
21 days so that they could put on more weight before their release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those changes were made to make sure the animals are in the
best shape before they're released,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the project has drawn criticism from animal
rights advocates and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It breaks my heart,'' said Marc Bekoff, a biology professor at
the University of Colorado at Boulder who is organizing a protest
rally there this weekend, his third since February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the reintroduction program is in serious need of
a very, very deep reassessment,'' Bekoff said. ``I'm not against
reintroduction, but I've argued against this all along because I
feel it's been hastily put together. They haven't done their
homework on the basic biology of the lynx.''
</P>
<P>
   Malmsbury conceded that ``with any reintroduction effort there
are no guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time,'' he said, ``there is no way to restore a
population that has been eliminated by humans without a
reintroduction effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Bekoff said the predicted 50 percent mortality rate was too
high. ``I hope I have egg on my face, but I really think many more
are going to die,'' he said.

After near-fatal accident, Rolf finds her way back
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Laura Rolf doesn't remember anything about the night of Dec. 20,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she recalls nothing about the six months before that
date. Or several weeks after it, part of which were spent in a
coma.
</P>
<P>
   All Rolf knows about that hole in her memory is what friends,
doctors, nurses and her mother have told her. What they have said
is that by all rights she shouldn't be gearing up for the
PaineWebber Futures Classic this week at Cypresswood Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she shouldn't be here at all. She's playing golf this
week when almost everybody thought she would never survive the
injuries suffered in a horrible auto accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody calls me the miracle girl,'' Rolf said Wednesday
before a practice round at the Tradition Course at Cypresswood.
</P>
<P>
   On that fateful night 16 months ago, Rolf was driving home from
Florida to Boling, the little town 50 miles southwest of Houston,
to see her parents for Christmas. Less than seven miles from home
on a rainy evening, an oncoming car hydroplaned, turned sideways
and slid over into Rolf's lane. Her car, going about 55 mph, plowed
broadside into the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The other driver died before emergency crews arrived. Rolf
suffered a severe brain injury, in addition to a punctured lung,
broken leg, dislocated ankle and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the injury, there wasn't time for thoughts of
Christmas. The Rolf family was too busy praying that Laura would
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The injury I had can cause the brain to bleed and swell,''
Rolf said. ``You can get a lot of high pressures inside it. I was
bleeding in the middle of the brain. The nurses wouldn't give any
of my family or friends any hope because that's not a good place to
be bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   For 13 days, she was in a coma. Her mother remembers the eerie
moment when her daughter woke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time she opened her eyes, she looked straight
through me,'' Carol Rolf said. ``It was like I wasn't there. I
didn't have much hope. She should not be here today.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laura Rolf's story is one of beating the odds. With help of
doctors and therapists at Herrman Hospital and The Institute for
Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR), she not only survived, but has
returned to a virtually normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf, who will turn 25 on April 27, played golf at the
University of North Texas until she graduated in the spring of '97.
She then began playing the SBC Futures Tour. Later that year, she
moved to Florida to play on a winter tour and have more time to
devote to working on her game.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers nothing after graduating from UNT. She doesn't
remember living in Florida at all.
</P>
<P>
   But what wasn't lost was her passion for golf. After she
regained consciousness and began an arduous regimen of therapy, she
committed herself to getting back on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it's amazing for me to be playing golf, much less
to be on the tour,'' Rolf said. ``But golf has been my life and my
goal. It's just what I want to do. I need to do it. It's funny to
hear people say it's unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf began playing golf at age 9. She has a goal of playing on
the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not she ever makes that, her progress since
returning from the near-fatal injuries of the car wreck are nothing
short of extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's come a long, long way,'' says Carol Rolf. ``She was in a
coma for 13 days at Herrman. And we weren't given a whole lot of
hope. But she struggled through there and came out of the coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had the best of care we could have hoped for. When we
got to TIRR and the therapist started working with her, we saw a
lot of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Laura would always tell me that whatever she had to do to
get better, she would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, she made it back. Now, Laura is almost completely
recovered. She still has some lingering problems. She cannot smell
anything. The muscle tone on the right side of her body, which
suffered the brunt of the damage in the wreck, is not the same as
the left.
</P>
<P>
   But when she began playing golf about five months after the
wreck, everything seemed to be getting better. At the time, the
doctors and therapists told her she should be happy that she ever
got back on the golf course again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's playing in tournaments again and credits the
attention she got during rehabilitation as a prime factor.
</P>
<P>
   The TIRR people were fantastic,'' she said. ``Dr. (Gerard)
Francisco and Dr. Levin (Ellen Levin, the clinical director for
TIRR's outpatient brain injury program) and everybody else was just
great.''
</P>
<P>
   The TIRR program was designed to get Rolf's mental and physical
capacities rehabilitated as much as possible. Clearly, the therapy
was successful.
</P>
<P>
   As for her golf game, Rolf did not play well in her first
competitive tournament back. She played in the Futures Tour event
near Dallas last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right,'' she said of her game. ``I'm hitting it
fairly good. I started playing again competitively last week in
Dallas and I'm going to play these two weeks, then see what I need
to work on. I wanted to play a couple of times to see what it'll
take to get back shooting well. After this, I'm not scheduled for
another tournament for three or four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But starting in late May and through June, I'll play all the
Futures Tour events.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rolf didn't remember, she said, was the competitiveness of
playing on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is that I just didn't remember the nerves and
pressure, the nervous energy that you have,'' she said. ``And I'm
finding out that, since the wreck, I don't have as much energy as I
used to. I can't do as much without getting really tired fast.
Because of that, I haven't been able to practice as much as need
to. It's just going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Her energy is returning slowly and everything else about Rolf's
recovery has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had a little bit of a personality change,'' her mother
said. ``Otherwise, she's back 96 percent of what she was before.
But we still notice little changes in her daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Her memory of those six months in her life before the crash
probably will never return, although her mother was encouraged when
the two of them attended the LPGA Qualifying School as spectators
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pulled through the gates of the complex, Laura said,
`I recognize this place,' and she had only been there when she was
living in Florida,'' Carol Rolf said. ``I'm hoping there will be
other things that jog her memory.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if that hole in her memory bank is never filled, it
can't take away from the fact that Laura Rolf is here.
</P>
<P>
   As her mother said, ``She's my walking miracle.''

USE OF VOLUNTEER WORKERS BY AOL IS CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.C.)  (mk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, America Online Inc., the nation's largest
online service, has relied on volunteers to help maintain the
virtual community it offers its members. The volunteers, who are
known as ``community leaders,'' perform tasks like answering
questions from subscribers, supervising chat rooms and enforcing
the service's rules.
</P>
<P>
   The reward has been a free account with the service and, America
Online says, the opportunity to play a more active role in its
community of 16 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Now at least seven former volunteers are challenging the
practice, and have asked the Labor Department to look into whether
the use of volunteer labor by America Online and its subsidiary,
America Online Communities Inc., violates the federal Fair Labor
Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Labor Department spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that
AOL was under investigation, but several former volunteers provided
copies of a letter from the department's Employment Standards
Administration saying it would look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the investigation was published two weeks ago
on Observers.net, a Web site set up last September by former
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for America Online, Ann Brackbill, said on Friday
that she was aware of the Web site and the information about an
investigation, which she said had prompted the company to
``initiate contact'' with the Labor Department. But she added, ``We
do not elaborate on discussions we have with regulatory agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which has 12,000 employees, also has more than
10,000 volunteers, Ms. Brackbill said. Volunteers commit to a
minimum of four hours a week of work, in addition to training time
and time spent on required paperwork. Some of the former volunteers
said they devoted much more time to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Perkins of Chicago, a co-founder of Observers.net, is
one of at least seven people who have registered separate
complaints with the Labor Department. Ms. Perkins and other
volunteers acknowledge that they signed on to work for AOL in
exchange for a free account, which now costs $21.95 a month. But
many volunteers signed up when the value of a free account was
potentially much higher, because the online service billed users at
an hourly rate and charges for heavy users ran in the hundreds of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although their complaints vary, the former volunteers say that
AOL relies on volunteers to do work that should be paid. Ms.
Perkins says the company has dismissed volunteers who have asked
for compensation or complained about the program, and has taken
away their free accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In their complaints to the Labor Department, the former
volunteers do not make explicit demands for back pay. The issue,
they said, is to publicize the situation and to change the way the
online service uses unpaid labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are filing for revenge, some are filing to stop AOL from
abusing others, some simply want their AOL accounts returned to
them,'' said Kelly Hallissey, a former volunteer who lives in
Greensboro, N.C. ``I'm filing to support others' allegations and
also to object to how AOL has treated myself and many others.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, a person must be compensated
for time spent at job-related activities that benefit the employer,
regardless of how the job is classified. There is a difference
between volunteering for a charitable cause and volunteering to
perform work that is critical to a company's business, said Jeffrey
Chamberlain, an employment lawyer based in Albany who is not
involved in the AOL dispute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a claim like the one made by the former AOL volunteers,
Chamberlain said: ``The more it looks like a real job, the less
likely it is to be deemed volunteer. The kinds of things they are
describing would make lawyers' bells go off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Brackbill defended the volunteer program, saying it was
a formalization of contributions that AOL subscribers have made to
the service since it began in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an organic thing that sprouted from what people love to
do online,'' she said. ``Community and participation are the DNA of
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is not the only online company to use volunteers. Many
Internet companies that offer community features rely on members to
enforce standards and to contribute to the community in some
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ivillage, an online women's network, uses more
than 1,000 volunteers to manage message boards and chat
communities.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 volunteers have moved up to paid positions as remote
staff members who manage the volunteers, said Macdara MacColl,
Ivillage's vice president for member services and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rubin, an employment lawyer in San Francisco, says the
nature of work is being redefined because of computer and Internet
connections that are readily available in homes, potentially
creating new legal issues for companies that use remote help.
</P>
<P>
   If found in violation of wage and hour laws, an employer could
be required to pay double the compensation to which the workers
should have been entitled, Rubin said. If it is found that the
violations were willful _ that the employer intentionally did not
compensate workers _ the employer could be subject to civil
penalties and possibly criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation of AOL and any resulting decision could set a
precedent for the online industry that might force companies to
rethink the way they use volunteers, Rubin said, adding, ``If the
industry in fact was kept operating because of volunteer workers,
it may have to reconfigure.''

BUSH AND GIULIANI EXTOL EACH OTHER'S CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Republican Party's most-talked-about
potential presidential contender and its most-talked-about
potential candidate for U.S. Senate met for 90 minutes Tuesday
afternoon at the governor's mansion here.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping outside to meet the press amid thick humidity, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
said they had spent the afternoon talking about education, about
baseball and _ oh, yes _ about politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has formed an exploratory committee to consider running for
president next year. Giuliani has formed a similar committee to
plan a run for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Standing shoulder to shoulder, smiling and joshing like old
pals, Giuliani and Bush each promoted the other's prospective
candidacy Tuesday afternoon, exchanging hearty praise and firm, yet
respectfully restrained, encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the real hopes that the Republican Party has of
regaining control of the United States and moving it in the
direction that it should move,'' Giuliani said of Bush. ``So, I am
very very hopeful that it all turns out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Giuliani's Senate prospects, Bush said, ``I think
he'd make an excellent candidate.'' He added, ``The mayor has got a
record, a strong record that he can run on, and he's a good, tough
campaigner.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush ducked the most obvious question raised by the
spectacle of two of the most prominent, well-known and ambitious
Republicans sharing a microphone on a random April afternoon:
whether their futures might be fused into a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the first thing that I have got to do is get the
nomination, should I decide to run,'' Bush said. ``I am leaning
that way, obviously. I have got an exploratory committee that's up
and running.'' But, he added pointedly: ``It's too early to be
talking about the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said at a news conference outside the governor's mansion
after the meeting that after visiting New York City Hall in 1997,
he had given the mayor a standing invitation to come to Texas. ``I
said, if you ever come back to Texas, knock on my door. And today
he did, and I opened it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would begin traveling around the country after the
close of the Texas state legislative session this spring. He is
scheduled to go to Iowa in June. The governor also noted that the
mayor could face Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``It could be one of the
great campaigns in the history of the United States Senate, the way
the rumors are shaping up,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But they each stopped short of calling their comments an
endorsement. ``I don't know,'' Bush said when asked if he was
endorsing Giuliani. ``Put it down as people liking each other.''
The mayor piped up, ``That's a good way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the mayor also hedged when asked if he was endorsing
Bush. ``Well, it's an encouragement,'' he said. ``I think it's
premature to endorse anybody for president at this point. The
governor hasn't announced. I haven't announced for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Giuliani if he had specifically urged Bush
to run for president, Bush suddenly thrust his arm behind his back
toward Giuliani. ``He twisted my arm,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the cue, the mayor grabbed Bush by the wrist. ``Run!'' he
shouted, jokingly. ``Run!''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR COACHES, INDULGENCE IS A BAD RECIPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The psychiatrist called the hotel room 10 minutes
after Larry Brown had finished talking about Allen Iverson on
sports talk radio Tuesday. He was offering a personality quiz that
would help Brown understand himself so he could then determine the
best approach to take with his young star.
</P>
<P>
   Brown took his number, thanked him, hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept it,'' he said, never knowing when the next Iverson
crisis would come, where he might have to turn.
</P>
<P>
   The spindly guard with the jet fuel in his calf muscles leads
the National Basketball Association in scoring and markets himself
as The Answer, which he might yet be if he ever acknowledges the
questions. Brown, at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night with
Iverson and his Philadelphia 76ers to play the Knicks in a game
laced with playoff implications, may not survive long, or even want
to, by standing up to Iverson, as he recently did. But he is
pushing 60 and has been around long enough to know this: He has no
chance unless he does.
</P>
<P>
   So Brown reclined in his courtside seat while his players _
without Iverson _ loosened up with pre-game jumpers, and continued
to sound more like Iverson's tough-talking guidance counselor than
his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear him comment that people don't want to see him do well
_ the media, the league,'' Brown said. ``That's baloney. I think
people in the league really want him to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown tries not to forget that Iverson is 23, and that he has
already come a long way, from being virtually uncoachable. He
remembers that not many of the young and gifted come bounding into
the pros, onto bad teams, off the college assembly line like Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these players will remain rooted in self-absorption
until it becomes their personal prison and there is no escape, and
no chance to win. Iverson is a long way from there, but every time
he curses his coach for having the audacity to remove him from the
game, or whatever he interprets as an unproductive show of
disrespect, he most surely takes one step closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've taken Allen out since I've been here, I've had
the same response,'' Brown said. ``And I understand he just wants
to play, but he doesn't understand how it affects his teammates or
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days ago, Iverson sat on the bench too long to suit him
and gave Brown an earful. Brown benched him for the remainder of
the first half. Iverson had to be talked out of leaving the arena
by, of all people, his bodyguard. Brown later had to throw the
bodyguard out of the post-game locker room, where he didn't belong.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a season of dramatic improvement, the 76ers are
combustible at the core, with Iverson and his moody, would-be
mentor, a disciple of Dean Smith who has always been hardest on
point guards. Brown, with a long-term contract and a front-office
title, took the position knowing the baggage Iverson brought. The
teacher and reformer in Brown couldn't resist the biggest challenge
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He knows Iverson was indulged everywhere he played, even at
Georgetown. ``I watched him play there, and that wasn't the way
John Thompson coaches,'' Brown said. Thompson didn't handle Iverson
the way he did Patrick Ewing, but then, as Brown said, ``He only
had Allen for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, always an admirer of Ewing's, knows Ewing would never
curse Jeff Van Gundy, which means, from the view on the 76ers'
bench, Van Gundy seems blessed. Ewing, of course, has wielded his
own institutional leverage around the Garden for years. He's just
done it with less attitude and lip.
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing was Iverson's age, he rebelled against his first
coach, Hubie Brown, and when he was supposedly all grown up, he
tuned out the only other coach who came along and told him things
he didn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't move with a posse and never tried to storm out of the
building. He just stopped playing hard and gave the team no choice
but to fire Don Nelson in early 1996. Even William Goldman knows
that when Van Gundy was promoted, he was hired to be the
anti-Nelson, restorer of the Knicks' offense to what it had been
and still too often is.
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable as they are, these Knicks play their best when
their smaller players drive the ball, and Ewing gets his shots as a
spot-up shooter. Sooner or later, Van Gundy will have to admit
this, refocus his offense and explain why to Ewing. Before he does,
he may want that psychiatrist's number Brown is saving for another
bad ear day.

 &HT;    Giuliani stops by, says Bush should run
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The most famous Texas Ranger fan and one of the
most prominent backers of the New York Yankees met Tuesday at the
Governor's Mansion and agreed to disagree _ not just on baseball,
but on a potentially explosive issue in the fight for the
Republican presidential nomination: abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who used to own a piece of the Texas
Rangers, and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a diehard Yankee fan,
met for more than an hour to discuss a range of issues, including
Bush's presidential run, education and the crisis in Kosovo. Asked
what he thought of Giuliani's moderate brand of Republicanism, Bush
said he wasn't troubled by the mayor's support for abortion rights.
The governor, who opposes abortion, recently drew fire from some
conservatives when he said he wouldn't push a constitutional
amendment outlawing abortion because most Americans wouldn't
support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that good people can disagree on certain
issues and that there's far more that we agree on than we don't
agree on,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in Texas to address the Greater Dallas Crime
Commission, was the latest in a long line of Republicans who have
come to Austin to express their support for a Bush candidacy. But
the mayor characterized the visit as ``encouragement'' rather than
an endorsement, which he said would be premature since Bush hasn't
officially announced his intention to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush has the capacity to organize the Republican Party in
a way where we can avoid some of the mistakes we've made in the
past,'' Giuliani said. ``There are other good candidates, but I
think he's one of the real stars of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is fertile fund-raising ground, and Giuliani would be a
valuable ally for Bush as he strives to raise the more than $45
million it would take to be able to skip federal matching money and
the spending caps it brings.
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent New York Republicans reportedly have declined
thus far to open their checkbooks for the Bush campaign because New
York Gov. George Pataki still hasn't ruled out a bid for the GOP
nomination. But Giuliani said Bush is likely to enjoy strong
support in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it's seen very often as a Democratic stronghold,
Republicans can win,'' Giuliani said. ``I've won New York City
twice in a row, and I believe he would be a very strong and
competitive candidate in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Tuesday, Bush expressed support for raising the
federal individual contribution limit above $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers have collected more than $7 million for his
campaign despite the fact that the governor has stuck to his pledge
to remain in Austin until the end of the legislative session on May
31. Aides to Iowa Rep. Greg Ganske said Monday that Bush would be
in the congressman's district on June 12 to help him raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also defended Bush's foreign-policy credentials, noting
that former President Ronald Reagan, who was former governor of
California when he ran for president, also lacked foreign-policy
experience when he went to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was criticized for being slow to express his views on
Kosovo, promised Tuesday that he'll be ``up for the task'' of
foreign relations if he reaches the White House. Bush declined to
directly criticize President Clinton's Kosovo policy but said
Clinton ``better have a plan to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America ought to be slow to engage our military. But once
engaged, we've got to engage to win,'' Bush said. ``I hope the
president has a plan to do so, and I hope the president has a plan
to get us out.''

EX-AIDE TO LENNON IS SUED BY WIDOW OVER USE OF PHOTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frederic Seaman was a close friend of John Lennon, at
least according to a television special on the murdered Beatle that
was broadcast in February. During the Fox Family Channel program,
which featured him as a ``an expert on Lennon's childhood and adult
life,'' Seaman showed off snapshots of Lennon taken in the two
years before his murder in December 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem, according to lawyers for Yoko Ono, Lennon's
widow, is that the photographs were stolen from the Lennon
household and that Seaman, the singer's former personal assistant,
is a confessed swindler, not a trusted confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman admitted as much to the Manhattan district attorney in
1983, and he agreed to return the cartons of photographs, personal
letters and private journals he had carried out of the Lennon
residence in the Dakota apartment building on Manhattan's West Side
during the two years he worked for the family.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Ono filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan claiming that Seaman failed to return everything and that
he plans, once again, to profit from his crime.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ono, Paul LiCalsi, said Seaman threatened to sue
Capitol Records in February, saying that liner notes accompanying a
new boxed set of Lennon recordings included a photograph that he
owns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has extraordinary gall to continue to take advantage of the
Lennons after all he did to them,'' said LiCalsi, who added that
Ono decided to file the suit after learning of Seaman's threatened
suit against the record company.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman, a Brooklyn resident, denied that he had any of the
stolen items. ``I don't know what she's talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble between Seaman and Ono began soon after Lennon was
shot on Dec. 8, 1980, as he entered the Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   According to LiCalsi, Seaman told Ono he was too devastated by
the murder to work and asked for some time off. But instead of
mourning, LiCalsi said, Seaman spent the time formulating an
ambitious plan to publish books about the Lennons.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the scheme ``Project Walrus,'' he and his college
friend, Bob Rosen, came up with merchandising ideas like a ``John
and Yoko'' doll, LiCalsi said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, Seaman stole hundreds of family photographs,
piles of private letters, unreleased recordings and journals that
Lennon kept between 1974 and 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Ono, who was deep in mourning, never noticed the thefts. She
dismissed Seaman only after she found him taking a bath in her
private bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman was caught after Rosen, angry that his co-conspirator was
trying to cut him out of the project, turned him in to Ono, who
called the police.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman was arrested in April 1983, and he pleaded guilty to
second-degree larceny.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for receiving five years' probation, he agreed to
return ``any and all property,'' which he says he did. ``I don't
have anything,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Seaman published ``The Last Days of John Lennon: A
Personal Memoir,'' an unflattering portrait of Lennon and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Seaman, who served no jail time for the thefts, said he was not
aware that the lawsuit had been filed until he was called by a
reporter Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have hundreds of photographs that I took with my own camera
and they're copyrighted,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   LiCalsi disagreed, saying a pre-employment contract that Seaman
signed stipulated that any photographs he took of the family are
the property of the Lennons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how after admitting that he betrayed the
family, he still thinks he has a right to the Lennon legacy,''
LiCalsi said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Seaman, Paul Karl Lukacs, said the lawsuit was
meritless. ``The bottom line is that Yoko does not like Fred Seaman
and this is an attempt to smear him,'' he said.

 &HT;    University announces annual award
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The University of Dayton and its national alumni
association Tuesday unveiled a ``Leadership with Virtue'' award
that will be presented annually to a nationally or internationally
recognized leader who blends a high level of personal honor with
professional achievements.
</P>
<P>
   UD will sponsor a leadership symposium to accompany the
announcement of the first award, scheduled for February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   An eight- to 10-member award selection committee will be named
in the next few months. The committee will accept nominations and
will generate possible nominees of its own, said Jack Proud,
president of UD's national alumni association.
</P>
<P>
   Proud said the Leadership with Virtue award has been in the
works for 18 months, before the name Monica Lewinsky blazed into
the national consciousness. But he acknowledged that ``the amount
of noise from Washington probably reinforced our belief that this
was important to do.'' The diverse and bipartisan nature of the
selection committee will help prevent partisanship from affecting
the award, Proud said.
</P>
<P>
   A full-page advertisement UD placed in today's Midwest edition
of USA Today and in the Dayton Daily News, and which UD officials
released Tuesday, seems to seize upon the scandals in Washington
and elsewhere. ``It's time to take a stand,'' it reads. ``It seems
now, more than ever, there is a national hunger for leaders
throughout all walks of life with high moral and ethical
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   UD's president, Brother Raymond Fitz, said the award does not
imply UD officials believe there are leaders who have no faults.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be human is to have failed and perhaps often,'' Fitz said.
``We want to identify persons who have undertaken a personal
journey in which they strive to integrate moral commitment in the
ways they lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud said the award ``is about virtue, not about sainthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Selection committee members will look for national and
international leaders who exhibit characteristics such as
integrity, vision and emotional balance, although Fitz said the
criteria will likely evolve in future years.
</P>
<P>
   UD chose Joan Swedlund to serve as project director for the
award and symposium. Swedlund served as administrative director of
Hauer Music Co., chief of public affairs for Five Rivers MetroParks
and marketing manager for the Downtown Dayton Association.
</P>
<P>
   UD also plans to endow a one-year scholarship in each
recipient's name to be awarded to a UD junior.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The name John Deere conjures up tractors, farm
equipment and big green machines lingering in the distance, on a
huge cornfield somewhere in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   While it receives most of its revenues from the farm, Deere &AMP;
Co., the world's largest maker of agricultural machinery, also
peddles lawn and turf products. Case Corp., a rival in farm
machinery, has broadened its reach as well, financing dump trucks
and marine equipment. And Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest
maker of earthmoving equipment and a major agricultural supplier,
is selling truck engines while leveraging its vast distribution
network to move Chrysler auto parts and Puma sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   All three heavy-equipment makers _ the biggest names in farm and
construction equipment _ are moving into new fields in an effort to
buffer themselves from the wrenching up-and-down cycle of their
core businesses. At the moment, they are trying to break out of a
nasty slowdown that in the last few quarters has sapped the profits
of virtually every maker of farm equipment. When the farm economy
here in the Midwest sagged with the Asian economic crisis and the
construction business showed signs of slowing late last year, the
big-equipment makers stepped up their efforts to diversify in hopes
of maintaining profitability, even in a down cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The sector has been upgraded recently by some Wall Street
analysts who believe that the heavy machinery cycle is very likely
to start moving upward, but most analysts are unimpressed by the
steps toward diversification. Fundamentally, the companies are
defined by their core businesses _ and so are still captives of the
business cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what they're trying to do, but it's just not showing up
in the numbers,'' Tobias Levkovich, an analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, said about Case. ``They've gotten reamed by the cycle, and
that's with the U.S. construction business doing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most recent downturn has been a big impetus in a
trend that has been in place for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Case, for instance, now receives about a third of its revenue
from sales of construction equipment. Deere receives nearly
one-fifth of its revenues from lawn and consumer products.
Caterpillar, which originated in 1925 with the merger of two farm
tractor companies, is dominant in excavating and earthmoving
machines, but now receives a third of its revenues from engine
sales and about 5 percent from financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies say they are also outsourcing more
operations to cut fixed costs and venturing further afield into
unrelated businesses, such as health care, distribution management,
toys and clothing. Caterpillar has a new line of ``Cat'' boots,
caps and jeans. Deere likewise has a major licensing deal involving
toys and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar executives are hammering away at a consistent
message. ``If the U.S. construction market slows down we've been
telling people, `Look, we are not a U.S. construction industry
business,''' said F. Lynn McPheeters, chief financial officer at
Caterpillar. ``This is a global, multifaceted company that has
taken a lot of the cyclicality out of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street remains skeptical, however. Despite diversification,
when the farm and construction economies weakened last year,
particularly in Asia, so did the profits of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   At Case, earnings dropped 80 percent in 1998. Deere, which has
laid off at least 300 workers in the last six months, saw profits
decline 75 percent last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar, by contrast, had a year of record revenues, $21
billion. But profits are expected to slip 50 percent when it
reports quarterly results this week compared with the similar
quarter a year earlier because of weaker sales of agriculture and
mining products and a slump in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been dumping the Big Three stocks until recently,
when the shares began to recover somewhat on hopes that the cycle
might be on the verge of an upturn. But it was a long plunge
downward: Case stock, for example, fell below the price of its 1994
initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Case says it has drastically changed its operations since it was
spun off from Tenneco that year. Now, the company says, it is
quicker to react to downturns. Executives also say the company has
cut fixed costs in recent years and moved rapidly to idle plants.
And it has counted on geographical diversification and benefited
from stronger sales of construction equipment and growth in its
financing of marine and commercial vehicles, such as municipal
garbage trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely convinced we're a dramatically different
company than we were in the last down cycle,'' said Steven Lamb,
president and chief operating officer. ``In the last downturn we
weren't profitable. But since then we've grown our construction,
credit and international businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Wall Street analysts, however, are far from convinced that
either Case or its competitors have fundamentally changed their
reliance on cyclical businesses. When Lisa Shalett, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., raised doubts about the new efforts,
executives at Case summoned her to their offices in Racine, Wis.,
for a review of the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, it's great these companies have
attempted to diversify,'' Ms. Shalett said. ``But the key struggle
for investors is that they don't make tons of money outside of the
core business.''
</P>
<P>
   When the farm equipment market turned down in the early 1990s,
Case lost more than $2 billion, including restructuring charges;
Deere lost $920 million in 1993 alone. Caterpillar was also
hemorrhaging. Though the farm slump could deepen in 1999, Lamb says
Case executives are comfortable with Wall Street projections that
Case will be ``solidly profitable'' in 1999, despite a slowdown in
earnings growth over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Rosso, the chief executive at Case, says his
company's stock has fallen far too sharply. ``At $25 it's still
undervalued,'' Rosso said a few weeks ago, just days after shares
of Case bounced back from their low of $18. ``At $20 it was so
grossly undervalued for a company with $6 billion in sales and
excellent assets.'' On Tuesday the shares closed at $28.75.
</P>
<P>
   Deere is more diversified. Its commercial-equipment division,
which includes lawn and turf products, saw an 88 percent jump in
operating profits in 1998. Its diesel engine business is also
strong, and its managed health care operation improved greatly in
1998, after a large loss in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar is the most diverse of the three, but falling demand
in Asia has hurt crucial sales of earthmoving equipment, used for
construction projects like the Hong Kong airport. The company is
expanding its agriculture business, making a run at Deere in the
sale of giant combines, but the biggest growth area for Caterpillar
may be engines.
</P>
<P>
   With its acquisition last year of Perkins Engines, the former
subsidiary of Lucas Varity PLC, Caterpillar is now one of the
world's largest makers of diesels for construction. Caterpillar
engines are also under the hood of about one-third of all big
trucks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar is also promoting mobile electric generators, which
are in high demand in the developing world. And it has leveraged
its distribution network, called the Caterpillar Logistics
Services, founded in 1986. The division now has 2,600 employees and
handles, warehouses and distributes more than $4 billion worth of
products each year, including parts for Sun Microsystems and Land
Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins are much richer in farm vehicles than in the
affiliated businesses, analysts say, and that means profit
downturns in that business can be disproportionately sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest margins business at cyclical peaks is farm
equipment,'' said Levkovich of Salomon Smith Barney. ``They're
trying to grow all those other things, but the buck still stops in
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The last big pure farm-equipment maker in the United States is
Agco Corp. of Duluth, Ga., which had $2.9 billion in sales in 1998.
The company says that because it outsources most of its business
and focuses primarily on assembly, it is less susceptible to sharp
downturns. Nonetheless, for the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, Agco's
revenues fell 9 percent, to $2.94 billion, and the company
announced that it was cutting 1,400 jobs. Its shares are now
trading at $6.9375, down from $27 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is cyclical, and since that is our primary
industry, so are we,'' said Robert Ratliff, the company's chief
executive. But Agco, which has grown in recent years by acquiring
companies like Massey-Ferguson, said it would continue to seek
acquisitions and would diversify to mitigate downturns.
</P>
<P>
   In diversifying, however, Case, Deere and Caterpillar are
poaching in one another's backyard. Construction companies and farm
companies are now construction-farm companies with a growing
interest in peripherals, like forestry equipment. Caterpillar and
Deere are both selling diesel engines, in the hope that they will
be a cyclical antidote.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the industry talk about Caterpillar taking
on Deere with big combines, Deere and Caterpillar taking on
Ingersoll-Rand in a mechanism called the skid-steer loader, a small
and easily adaptable multipurpose construction vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   These searches for a cure, some analysts say, involve
considerable risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to diversify their exposure so they're not
dependent on the farmer,'' said David Bluestein, an analyst at
Paine Webber. ``But these guys are all diversifying into other
companies' core markets and that's going to lead to overcapacity,
which causes pricing pressure.''

N.Y. DEMOCRATS DROP NOVEL FUND-RAISING IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concerned about perceptions that campaign finance
laws could be violated, an adviser to Hillary Rodham Clinton now
says it is highly unlikely that Democrats will form a committee to
raise money for an unspecified Senate candidate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Any money raised by such a committee, first proposed by New York
Democrats last month, could theoretically have been used for the
campaign of whoever the Democratic candidate for Senate turned out
to be. The committee was planned to ease the concerns of those
Democrats who said Mrs. Clinton's prospective Senate campaign was
disrupting the fund-raising efforts of other potential candidates
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Mrs. Clinton announced her interest in the seat to
be vacated in 2001 by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, but threw
Democrats into a minor uproar when she said she would not announce
her decision until ``later this year.'' Rep. Nita Lowey of
Westchester County has said she wants to run if Mrs. Clinton does
not.
</P>
<P>
   Last month New York Democrats cited a 1977 advisory opinion from
the Federal Election Commission that approved the formation of a
fund-raising committee for an unspecified Republican candidate for
the Senate from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers now say that two of six election commissioners
dissented in the opinion, and that it is not necessarily relevant
in Mrs. Clinton's situation and under current election laws, which
have changed in the 22 intervening years.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser to Mrs. Clinton said he was not inclined to ask the
election commission for a new ruling that might not be in Mrs.
Clinton's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fraught with a lot of difficulties and probably more
trouble than it's worth,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's advisers are eager to avoid anything that
resembles the kind of campaign finance scandals that consumed the
White House after the last presidential election. The party's
practices led to criminal charges against some Democratic
fund-raisers and the return of $3 million that had come from
questionable sources.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform
and a critic of the Clinton White House fund-raising practices in
1996, said Tuesday that Mrs. Clinton's advisers were being being
highly cautious to avoid potential criticism from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be not wanting to raise any kind of opportunity for
questions at this stage of the game,'' Wertheimer said. ``Because
they don't need it for something that's not necessary in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has apparently decided to quiet Democratic concerns
about fund-raising by raising money specifically for New York
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In May she is to appear at a $1,000-a-plate dinner in Manhattan
for Mrs. Lowey, who expects to raise $500,000 to $1 million from
the event. During three days in New York next week, Mrs. Clinton is
to appear at a fund-raiser for Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the Manhattan
Democrat who was one of President Clinton's leading defenders
during the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say Mrs. Clinton will have no trouble raising money on
her own should she decide to run for the Senate seat.

IN MAJOR SHAKEUP, NORWAY'S KVAERNER WILL SELL SHIPYARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The reorganization of European industry
reached into the heartland of Norway on Tuesday, when Europe's
biggest shipbuilder announced plans to sell all its shipyards and
other money-losing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Kvaerner SA, an engineering conglomerate
troubled by poor management and bad acquisitions, is the latest
example of a revolution in European corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   After snubbing shareholders for years by pursuing murky
strategies and producing mediocre profits, many of Europe's biggest
industrial companies are now slashing costs and getting rid of
businesses that don't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Siemens AG of Germany unveiled plans to jumpstart
profits by selling off businesses with sales of $10 billion.
Alcatel SA, the huge French manufacturer of telecommunications
equipment, announced plans last month to eliminate 12,000 jobs by
the end of the year 2000. ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG, the
Swiss-Swedish engineering firm, eliminated more than 12,000 jobs
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the shakeup at Kvaerner is one of the most drastic. If
carried out in full, the company would abandon a business that had
also been a bedrock of Norwegian industry. It would shrink itself
to about one-third of its current size, shedding 25,000 of its
80,000 workers. The moves are likely to lead to job cuts at
shipyards around Europe and possibly in the United States as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kvaerner, which builds everything from offshore oil rigs to
cruise ships, had been planning to build ships at the old
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and employ about 1,000 people there.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans could change abruptly, depending on what the
shipbuilder's new owners decide to do. Kvaerner executives said
they have not decided whether to simply sell the shipyards, spin
the business off as a separate entity to shareholders or retreat
more gradually by putting them into a joint venture with some other
shipbuilder.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever course prevails, the changes will be drastic. Kjell
Almskog, who took over as chief executive last December, said the
company had set aside 4 billion kroner, or about $500 million, to
cover reorganization costs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to unloading the shipyards, which employ about
10,000 workers, the company plans to sell businesses with another
11,500 workers in areas like metal equipment, mechanical
engineering, pulp and paper products and a real estate development.
Several thousand other jobs would be eliminated in the companies
that remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that this is an old, traditional Norwegian
company,'' said Ottar Haugerud, an analyst at Orkla Securities in
Oslo. ``They have turned the company upside down. It is a
completely different company today than it was yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost any change would be an improvement. Under Kvaerner's
previous chief executive, Erik Tonseth, the company's 1998 losses
totaled 1.4 billion kroner, or $290 million. The company's stock
plunged nearly 80 percent last year, though it had partly recovered
since Almskog took over and made it clear he would shift course.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the problems can be traced to Tonseth's disastrous
purchase of Trafalgar House, a sprawling British engineering
company that also owned the Cunard Line of cruise ships, for $1.38
billion in 1996. Trafalgar was loaded with debt and problems, which
drained capital at a time when the shipbuilding industry was in a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kvaerner sold off numerous chunks of Trafalgar, including
Cunard Line and the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship, it still ran up
big losses last year and was plagued by high costs and its
disjointed mish-mash of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Almskog, a former top executive at ABB Asea Brown Boveri, is now
trying to refocus the company and return it to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to be a world champion, or in the world class
anyway, we need to scale back,'' he told a news conference in
London today. ``The plan for this `new Kvaerner' is to create a
group that is significantly smaller and much leaner, but infinitely
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Though investors had been expecting a fairly broad
reorganization plan, most were surprised by the decision to abandon
shipbuilding. In Oslo, Kvaerner stock dropped 3 kroner, or 2.2
percent, to 136 kroner Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult to find buyers for Kvaerner's
12 European shipyards. Beyond that, Almskog's description of the
problems at other businesses was bleaker than some analysts had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is positive, but the state of the company was
worse than expected,'' said Haugerud, of Orkla Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most said the plan was a step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to get rid of shipbuilding yards in Europe these
days, but in the long run this is the right decision,'' said Olof
Jonasson, an industry analyst at Handelsbanken Markets in Oslo.

 &HT;    Public schools feeling pressure to raise test scores
 &HT;    By Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In May 1996, the Texas Education Agency notified
Lanier High School it would be rated ``low-performing'' _ a
designation that Texas public schools receive when their students
score poorly on the state achievement test or when too many
students drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Kane, who was principal at Lanier at the time and who
subsequently led the campus to its ranking as a national ``Blue
Ribbon School,'' found that clerical errors in administeringthe
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills caused the low-performing
label. A mismatch between birth dates and Social Security
numberscaused the tests of two students to be eliminated from
consideration. That _ the removal of two passing scores from the
school's overall average _ prompted the low-performing label.
</P>
<P>
   The school district appealed, and the education agency raised
Lanier's ranking to ``acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two and a half years since then, the Austin Independent
School District's handling of TAAS data has evolved from simple
cleanup to criminal tampering, a Travis County grand jury charged
last week as it indicted the district and its deputy
superintendent, Kay Psencik. Psencik has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of ``tampering with governmental record'' against
Psencik and AISD _ believed to be the first school district in the
country to be indicted _ illustrate the increasing pressure on
public schools to perform. The TEA has investigated high numbers of
erasures on the TAAS test in 11 school districts, and prosecutors
are investigating the Houston Independent School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was never said but was an underlying message all
of us felt,'' said Suzzie Bragg, who was principal at Johnston High
School during the 1997-98 school year and who testified before the
Travis County grand jury recently. ``The message is, `You will not
be low-performing.' At no time did I feel like I was told, `Suzzie,
do what it takes,' but I do think the pressure is there, and it
depends on how people internalized it.''
</P>
<P>
   Determined not to have another school mistakenly get a low
rating, the district hired Ricky Arredondo in July 1996 from TEA.
</P>
<P>
   At the education agency, Arredondo had worked with Kaye
Contreras, who left TEA in 1995tobecome the executive assistant to
former Austin Superintendent Jim Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay Psencik had talked to Fox about a position for an analyst.
She was looking for an analyst and was asking everybody for
recommendations for a good person for the job. I had given her that
recommendation,'' Contreras said. ``She (Psencik) interviewed him,
and she hired him, and I was not even in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 25 of this year, Arredondo pleaded no contest to the
same tampering charge for which AISD and Psencik are being
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   When they hired him, Arredondo had a reputation in education
circles as a computer whiz. Many considered him a ``magician'' with
numbers _ a research analyst so skilled that he could do in minutes
what would take others hours.
</P>
<P>
   A year after Arredondo was hired, the school district again was
appealing the ratings of schools. Fox wrote a letter to Texas
Education Commissioner Mike Moses on July 16, 1997, and said Bailey
Middle School and Brown and Summitt elementary schools deserved to
be rated ``recognized'' _ one step above ``acceptable'' _ and that
errors by the company that developed and graded the test cost those
schools a higher rating. Fox, in his appeal, said the district
needed to make changes to demographic and ethnic data of some
students.
</P>
<P>
   Moses denied the appeal in August.
</P>
<P>
   Fox pressed the issue in a Sept. 11, 1997, letter. ``I have
attached copies of 18 documented cases of erroneous Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills data. . . . It is precisely these
types of errors which have caused me to appeal three campus
ratings,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Moses stood by his decision but in November agreed to have a
third party review it.
</P>
<P>
   John Stevens, executive director of the Texas Business and
Education Coalition, reviewed the 1997 Austin appeal and came away
believing AISD was trying to manipulate the system.
</P>
<P>
   In rating a school, the TEA considers not just how the student
body as a whole scores on the TAAS but also how ethnic and other
demographic subgroups perform. At schools with fewer than 30
students in a particular subgroup, those tests are not counted
toward the school rating.By reducing the numbers of a
low-performing subgroup to fewer than 30, a campus' rating can be
elevated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went through and scrutinized information but did it only
for students they believed would affect the TAAS results. It was
pretty clear what was going on that year,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Moses had echoed the sentiment to Fox in an Aug. 11, 1997,
letter: ``Given your expressed concerns in past meetings . . .
about the potential for manipulation of accountability indicator
data by school districts, I want to make you aware of TEA findings
regarding student information changes . . . made by Austin ISD
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly, economic status and special education status can
easily change between the end of October and the end of April
within a given school year. However, ethnicity is not a transient
characteristic,'' Moses wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Fox declined to be interviewed for this story. The school board
bought out his contract last year forabout $258,000, for issues
unrelated to the TAAS data tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The TEA didn't move to discipline Austin for what happened in
1997, but the agency was on alert.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when the Austin district wanted to make more
changes,the TEA took a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes up a second time, that adds more credibility to
the position that this is something that was a real manipulation of
the system because it demonstrated a pattern,'' said Joe Neely, a
former deputy education commissioner who currently is the
superintendent of the Rockwall school district, east of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving preliminary TAAS scores, the district made
changes to the student identification numbers of 16 students by
swapping them with the students' Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The swap created a data mismatch, and once again, the computer
eliminated tests from accountability calculations. Not all the
students performed poorly. In many cases, a student in a subgroup
was targeted so his or her test would be eliminated, bringing the
subgroup to less than 30. That would disqualify the group
altogether. For Blackshear, Bryker Woods and Travis Heights
elementary schools, the fewer tests counted in the system produced
higher ratings. AISD also attempted to change data at McCallum High
School, but the changes inadvertently were not reported to the
education agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin district called the testing company to find out why
the changes at McCallum weren't reported. The testing company
notified the TEA, and the agency _ already suspicious because of
1997 _ began asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made us look,'' Moses said. ``We determined we were going
to ask questions about it, and we were going to ask for an
explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Austin interim Superintendent A.C. Gonzalez hired
consultant Lynn Moak for an independent audit.
</P>
<P>
   Moak concluded that the changes were intended to falsely
increase the ratings of the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management established a perception that the only reason to
correct data was to achieve a ratings change,'' the report said.
``There was clearly a climate in which changes for the purpose of
changing a rating were understood to be an acceptable practice if
they stayed within the law, which is what they believed they were
doing,'' Moak said.
</P>
<P>
   The district and county attorneys' offices began investigating
the district after the Austin American-Statesman reported on the
TAAS controversy in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their zeal to produce the best ratings possible for the
Austin school district, several of our employees took liberties
with student data that was, at best, unprofessional,'' Gonzalez
said in September.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, the grand jury found it was more than unprofessional
when it returned 16 indictments against the school district and one
16-count indictment against Psencik.
</P>
<P>
   Arredondo is scheduled for sentencing June 11 and faces up to a
year in jail and a fine of up to $4,000. No date has been set for
Psencik's court appearance. If convicted, she also could face a
year in jail and a fine of up to $4,000. The Austin school district
faces a fine of up to $160,000.

CLINTON MOVES TO RESTART TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Tuesday night's dinner at
Economic Club in New York, ADD fresh Zhu quote; Pickup 3rd graf
pvs, `They were happy ...'; Combines 2nd take, which has no
changes.) 
 (ac) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After coming under strong criticism that he backed
away from a trade deal with China because of domestic politics,
President Clinton telephoned China's prime minister Tuesday
afternoon to restart the negotiations in Beijing this month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced the effort as Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji, who has complained repeatedly about the failure to reach a
deal during his tour of the United States, was visiting New York
before heading to Canada. Zhu had spent much of his day lobbying
business executives about the benefits of an accord on trade.
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner in New York on Tuesday night sponsored by the
Economic Club, Zhu said he had told Clinton during their phone call
that ``I feel very confident that in the near future we will see
the successful conclusion of negotiations that are favorable to
both sides _ but especially to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's phone call to the Chinese leader followed a meeting on
Monday in which nearly two dozen business executives lobbied the
White House to emphasize how important the deal was to American
companies seeking access to the world's largest market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were happy with the progress we made but were worried
that the deal would not come to fruition,'' an administration
official said. The official said that Clinton's telephone call,
which lasted about 20 minutes, was intended to send a signal to the
business community that the White House was doing all it could to
seal the deal and as a signal that it intended to lock China into
concessions it had made on numerous trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the two countries said they would ``move
intensively'' to resolve the remaining issues that blocked them
from reaching a deal last week while Zhu met with Clinton in an
official three-day visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the group that
determines the rules for global commerce, was the prize that Zhu
came seeking but was denied after talks collapsed at the last
minute. Some administration officials said that anti-China
sentiment on Capitol Hill was so intense that they thought they
could not get any deal through. At the same time, officials
familiar with the negotiations said, Clinton was distracted by the
Kosovo conflict and had not fully conveyed to his negotiators how
much he wanted to complete the deal himself.
</P>
<P>
   And some Democrats in Congress were leery of an accord with
China, predicting it would trigger a divisive battle in their
party.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said during his visit here that he believed the deal fell
through because of domestic American politics and that Washington
had politicized what was essentially an economic issue. Republicans
on Capitol Hill have been furious over Clinton's policy of
engagement at a time when China has reportedly stolen military
secrets from the United States, is cracking down on political
dissidents and was accused of making illegal financial
contributions to Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, said last week during
Zhu's visit that he strongly opposed a deal and was suspicious of
whether China would commit to fair trade practices. The United
States has a $57 billion trade imbalance with China.
</P>
<P>
   China made several broad concessions last week in order to gain
entry to the trade organization, a step it has been working toward
for 13 years. Entry would require China to demolish its tariffs and
trade barriers but would give it broad access to the markets of
many other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese concessions included allowing foreign companies to
sell their products directly to consumers, an enormous opportunity
in a land of 1.2 billion people. China also agreed to allow foreign
companies to invest as much as 49 percent in telecommunications
industries and to give greater access to foreign-owned insurance
companies. In a separate civil aviation deal, it agreed to allow
more flights from the United States. And it signed an accord to
lift restrictions on imports of U.S. wheat, citrus fruits and meat.
</P>
<P>
   But still outstanding were areas such as trade in financial
services and assurances that the United States could enforce its
agreements with China.
</P>
<P>
   After Zhu left Washington on Saturday, he criticized Clinton,
saying in cities across the United States that the president ``does
not dare'' take a political risk in allowing China to join the
trade organization. One senior official traveling with the prime
minister said, ``We had a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton called Zhu, Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade
representative, said on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the president was
committed to seeing that negotiations would be finished in time for
China to join the WTO this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will re-engage with the Chinese shortly,'' she said in
testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, promising to ``work
on each of the issues that are open to bring this full agreement to
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   While some senators were hostile, others said they were worried
that the deal would unravel and that China would withdraw the
concessions it made last week. Zhu himself complained that the
administration had ``made public many documents and said we had
agreed to them, but in fact we have not agreed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, accused the administration of ``raw,
rotten protectionism'' at the behest of American textile and steel
companies, which are worried about the low price of Chinese
imports.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration was trying to force China to keep
limits on textile exports to the United States for five years
longer than currently allowed under the trade organization's rules.
And he said that America's high barriers in this area had already
cost the average family of four $700 more in clothing bills each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to lose more jobs by protecting noncompetitive
American industries than we are going to possibly gain in those
areas,'' Gramm said.

Mack finds life's niche as a Rocket
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Sam Mack's thumb was still aching. He had missed the previous four
Rockets games after taking a hard fall in Dallas, absent-mindedly
using his right hand, his shooting hand, to cushion the impact.
</P>
<P>
   He had joined the Rockets in Utah and was giving himself a final
pre-game test, firing shot after shot until the sweat poured off
him and his thumb throbbed.
</P>
<P>
   He had reached the left corner, having circled the 3-point line
with shots. Taking passes from a Jazz ball boy, he had found his
touch. Shot after shot fell. Every motion was smooth, efficient, at
the same time workmanlike, like a carpenter hammering nails with
the practiced combination of work and art.
</P>
<P>
   He could have stopped, and probably should have. But each arc
was too true, the shots too sweet to leave that stroke
unappreciated by walking away. Finally, he turned and smiled and
announced his return to the Rockets' arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's changed,'' he said, and walked to the visitors'
locker room, the swagger of a gunslinger realized.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets reacquired Mack in a last-minute trade-deadline
deal for Rodrick Rhodes, ESPN didn't blink, newspapers reported the
news in small type on the pages that carry bowling scores and
soccer standings. In contrast to the signing of the Rockets' other
small forward, whose acquisition inspired the nation's basketball
media to encamp in Houston for however long it took to place a
`Scottie Pippen' on the bottom line, Mack's return to Houston was
barely noticed outside the Loop.
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen signed his five-year, $67 million contract, he
whisked around town in a stretch limousine with a police escort
befitting his place as one of the game's most celebrated champions.
With Mack, the Rockets picked up the last months of a Vancouver
contract and laid down the law, detailing the professionalism and
dedication that was expected in his second tour of duty with the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, 28, offered his deliverance from Vancouver to a
championship contender and to a city he had made his home, quickly
agreed. Six weeks later, it is unclear whether the Rockets or Mack
are happier with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's in paradise,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, no question,'' Mack replied. ``This is paradise
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After Mack, who will play his former team tonight for the first
time since the trade, finished off the Timberwolves on Monday,
Tomjanovich and his assistants found themselves musing to one
another about their good fortune. They landed Mack almost as an
afterthought, then found themselves with a player who beyond his
role as a game-winner Monday, has become one of the keys to the
Rockets' chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches were just talking about how big that trade was for
us,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I love Michael (Dickerson) and Cuttino
(Mobley). But here's a guy that gives us a chance to rest the
rookies, a guy who had all that experience in Vancouver, and has
been out there. That experience is so valuable because he had to go
against front-line players starting those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was gone, you've got to put a lot of those things in
the past, but we were thinking, `If that guy applied himself and
did it the right way, this is the best place to be for him.'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expected offensive lift off the bench, Mack
has provided protection for the nights the guards' shots are not
falling. He has even provided time for Pippen to reclaim his
offensive strut. Pippen has averaged just 8.8 points in April. But
in the five games since Mack's cameo upon his return in Utah, he
has averaged 10.5 off the bench, making 20 of 35 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's 3-pointer with 1:17 left on Monday ended a fourth-quarter
Rockets collapse and gave them a win they had to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the shots they brought me here to make,'' Mack
said. ``The last couple of games, I've made my shots. Every time
they double or on a fast break, I can get open for my shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack always has been a shooter. His touch from the 3-point line
earned his initial escape from the Continental Basketball
Association to his shot with Rockets. But he and Rockets teammates
said that three seasons ago, he probably would not have made the
shot that would have shocked them had it missed in Minnesota on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Mack said when asked if that shot would
have gone in during his first stint with the Rockets. ``By them
trading me away, I got out and had to prove myself. I had to work
hard to make things work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in Vancouver, (opposing teams) did not have to double.
I had to get my own shots, and gain confidence. In Vancouver, I was
the first 3-point shooter there when they brought me in. They
needed my 3s at the end of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Said forward Othella Harrington, a Rockets teammate then and
now: ``When he was here the first time, he would miss shots with
the game on the line. Now, he's making the big shots. He's expanded
his game. He can put the ball on the floor and he's going to the
hole more. He's really playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Mack has fit perfectly into the Rockets' system,
but he has gone beyond simply making the shots earned by defenses'
obsession with Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon inside. He has
started with the 3s, but then built a well-rounded game around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Where Pippen must work to get shots off the dribble in the hope
a groove will enable him to make the 3-pointers always available in
the Rockets' offense, Mack has gotten on a roll outside, then used
that confidence and outside threat to broaden his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was gone,'' Mack said, ``I worked on improving my
overall game, handling the ball, playing defense and making big
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he has improved his overall game, he has been more than
the Rockets expected. But as happy as they are with his development
and play, it remains unclear whether the Rockets will be able to
bring him back next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have 11 other players who will remain under contract
beyond this season (only Barkley and centers Antoine Carr and
Stanley Roberts signed one-year deals). If the Rockets want to do
any larger free-agent retooling, there is little flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Mack has improved so much, especially defensively, and has
so lived up to the criteria given him the day of the trade, the
Rockets seem likely to repeat the postgame conversation Tomjanovich
and his assistants shared Monday in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question about Mack's interest in his future in a
Rockets uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know so many people in Houston. I have family there,
relatives there, I went to school and still have a lot of people
and business friends there,'' Mack said. ``There are so many things
I like to do there. That's where I want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, every night is another chance to fill whatever need
arises, another circle of open 3-pointers to swish. In that sense,
nothing has changed. For now, every night is another day in
``paradise.''

SERVITE LINEMAN COMMITS TO USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment from offensive
lineman Joe McGuire of Servite High in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire (6-foot-6, 275 pounds), considered one of the top
juniors in the state, is the second prep player to commit to the
Trojans in recent weeks. Quarterback Matt Cassel of Chatsworth
previously committed to USC.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard has surgery: As expected, sophomore linebacker Mike
Pollard underwent knee surgery Monday for a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee and will be lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard will redshirt this season and have three years of
eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle: With Pollard out, USC's depth at middle
linebacker has suddenly become an issue. USC coach Paul Hackett
said freshman Armand Holland would probably be the current No. 2
linebacker behind starter Zeke Moreno. Holland redshirted last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is John Fox. After starting at quarterback, moving to
tight end and returning to quarterback last season, Fox is now at
middle linebacker and had five tackles in Saturday's scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was OK,'' Fox said. ``Those tackles weren't all by myself. I
should have been on a lot more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he is more comfortable now than at any other time in
the past year, finally settling in at a position. But his days at
quarterback may not be over.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Fox is USC's emergency No. 3 quarterback, now that
Jason Thomas has decided to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   And on the outside: With Sultan Abdul-Malik moving to outside
linebacker, there is some curiosity about where Long Beach City
College linebacker Markus Steele will end up when he arrives this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Steele was rated the No. 1 JC linebacker in the country by most
recruiting services, and it's expected he'll start. But where?
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Abdul-Malik and sophomore Darryl Knight are the
starting outside linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really counting on him,'' Hackett said of Steele. ``I
think he's going to battle with whoever comes out of spring. I
think he's a tremendous athlete. He's tall and lean.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Steele would not be moved to middle linebacker to
compensate for the loss of Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to compromise his career,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer calls: Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer called Hackett to
inquire about Thomas. Tennessee, Nebraska and Nevada-Las Vegas are
among the schools vying for Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Split-back formation: Malaefou MacKenzie participated in drills
for the first time Tuesday since undergoing knee surgery last
September. Hackett said he envisions MacKenzie, Jabari Jackson and
Frank Strong playing in split-back formations next season.
</P>
<P>
   That means they might line up along with Chad Morton, but would
not be considered fullbacks. Hackett said MacKenzie is strictly a
tailback.
</P>
<P>
   That means junior Brennan Ochs, sophomore Charlie Landrigan and
freshman Chad Pierson will try to win the fullback position.
</P>
<P>
   Perry nears decision: Former USC wide receiver Rod Perry is
expected to make a decision this week on where he will play
football next season. Perry, who quit the Cal State Fullerton
baseball team last month, is considering USC, UNLV, Penn State and
Wisconsin.

ADVERTISING: A VOLKSWAGEN SPOT HAS TWO PUNCH LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unconventional commercial for the Volkswagen Passat, with a
twisty plot that curves more than a rain-slicked highway in a
traditional automotive spot, has people talking _ and buying, too.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, which began running in January, returned to
television this month. The 30-second spot, titled ``Brief
Encounter,'' tells the tale of a man engaged in a pastime that is
almost as old as the internal combustion engine: flirting with a
woman whose car, identical to his, is momentarily stopped next to
him at a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   But in this instance, the commercial, created by Arnold
Communications in Boston, takes not one but two surprising turns,
for the drivers are not who they seem. The one-two punch lines are
a key reason for the continuing appeal of the spot among both
viewers and car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial for Passat, a family sedan that was recently
redesigned, is indicative of the efforts being made by the big
automakers and their agencies to walk the fine line between the
hard and soft sells. The goal is to strike the right balance
between advertising that entertains but also moves the iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's worked for us is creating a great brand image that
makes people really want to check out our cars,'' said Liz Vanzura,
director for marketing and advertising at Volkswagen of America in
Auburn Hills, Mich., a unit of the German automaker Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to ``create an image or vibe around the car,'' she
added, ``and let the car sell itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen of America is increasing its 1999 sales projections
for Passat by 14.3 percent, to 80,000 from 70,000. March was the
best month ever for Passat as sales totaled 5,782, up 80.8 percent
from March 1998. Sales for the first quarter totaled 13,239, up
55.9 percent from the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Passat contributed to a strong month and
quarter for Volkswagen of America, which sold 26,488 cars in March,
up 52.1 percent from March 1998, and 63,525 cars in the first three
months of 1999, up 60.6 percent from the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The designation last month of Passat as the ``best family
sedan'' in the annual automotive issue of Consumer Reports will
obviously help sales. But so does the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of our ads as a little more cerebral, a
little more intuitive,'' Ms. Vanzura said, ``showing the people who
drive the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We take our cars seriously,'' she added, ``but we don't take
ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of that approach include a 1997 commercial for
the Volkswagen Golf, which featured two 20-something people
aimlessly driving around to a tune called ``Da Da Da,'' and a
recent spot for the Volkswagen Jetta, known as ``Synchronicity,''
in which a stylish couple cruising the streets of New Orleans
notice that passers-by are moving to the beat of the rhythmic song
playing on their cassette deck.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Clio Awards organization, part of VNU NV, will name
Volkswagen advertiser of the year, for campaigns for the last three
years in five countries including Arnold's work in the United
States. The award will be presented at the annual Clios ceremonies
in New York, scheduled for May 19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat commercial begins as the man and the woman drive up
to the traffic light in matching Passats. They exchange flirtatious
glances, seemingly encouraged by the music on the soundtrack, a
tango titled ``Palomita Blanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the first punch line comes. A toy octopus hits the man,
interrupting his amorous reverie. The camera cuts to the back seat
of his car, where a child is seated. The man drives away with a
sheepish expression.
</P>
<P>
   The woman is seen smiling as she drives away. Then the second
punch line comes. The camera cuts to show that she, too, has a
child in her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize both of them actually have kids,'' Ms. Vanzura
said. ``You may not catch that the first time you see the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advertising is meant to be seen over and over again,'' she
added. ``And every time you see it, you'll notice something more.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise of the commercial is intended to ring a bell among
members of the target market for Passat, drivers in their 30s and
40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a car for people who haven't stopped living, who aren't
ready for minivans, who've still got it going on a little bit,''
said Ron Lawner, managing partner and chief creative officer at
Arnold, a unit of Snyder Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's easy for them to relate,'' he added, ``to the idea of
an innocent glance at someone who's driving the same car you are.''
</P>
<P>
   While the commercial could be read as the title suggests _
``Brief Encounter'' is the 1946 film about an affair between a
couple who part at the end _ it could also be interpreted in a more
contemporary way.
</P>
<P>
   What if the man and woman at the traffic light are both single
parents, free to go beyond flirtation?
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be single parents,'' Lawner replied when that was
suggested to him. ``Who could say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we need to see them again,'' he added, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vanzura said: ``They could be single parents. We kind of
leave that to your imagination. They could even be married to each
other.''

L.A. JEWS PAUSE TO RECALL HOLOCAUST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Maria Julianelli remembers the Holocaust all too
well.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers tucking her skinny arms between her body and a
rough cement floor and trying to muffle her breath because one
word, one whisper could have meant death for her, her family and
the dozen or so Jews she was helping to hide from the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would wake up to the sound of crying and screaming from the
streets,'' Julianelli, 65, recalled Tuesday, Yom HaShoah, the day
of remembrance for those who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things you don't forget. But many people don't remember.
The atrocities are here again, right now in Yugoslavia and
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she helped hide Jews from the Nazis during World War II,
Julianelli will be honored as part of the observance of Yom
HaShoah. But for her and others who took part in ceremonies
Tuesday, the day takes on special significance as a war of ``ethnic
cleansing'' again rages in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in Kosovo shows people do forget, or some
people did, because it's happening now,'' said 12-year-old Shaina
Goelman, a student at Adat Ari El School. ``It's awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaina was among the nearly 1,200 schoolchildren who held a
vigil Tuesday at the Los Angeles Holocaust Monument in Pan Pacific
Park. Singer Barry Manilow took part in the vigil and presented an
award of $10,000 from the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles
to the Kosovo Refugee Relief Fund of the American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Money being raised by the committee is used to provide food,
medicine and shelter to refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour vigil in English, Czech and Spanish featured
accounts by child survivors of the Holocaust and the traditional
lighting of the monument's Flames of Memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes people really understand what happened and how many
people died,'' Shaina said. ``We shouldn't let it happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Julianelli said it is a responsibility of her generation to tell
the next what happened in Europe about 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans were just slaughtering everyone and everything,''
she said. ``That's happening again. It's our responsibility as
grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles to inform a new generation
that yes, it did happen, and if we don't take care of things it
could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Julianelli helped fellow Christians hide Jews in a cottage at
the base of the Apennine Mountains. For three years, she carried
wheat and potatoes by the handful to those hiding, washed the
refugees' clothes and kept on eye out for Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was imprisoned by the Germans for nearly seven years.
Her mother and aunts were beaten by Nazis. Her childhood was
savaged by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were wall-to-wall people in my house,'' Julianelli said.
``We wanted to get them inside, get them warm and help them move on
to safety.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of World War II in 1945, about 6 million Jews -- more
than two-thirds of the Jewish men, women and children in Europe --
had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   By last count, 631,000 ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo,
leaving behind their homes and an unknown number of mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Valley Beth Shalom in suburban Encino plans to honor
Julianelli, a resident of Los Angeles since 1949, and many
Italian-Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. While the celebration
will commemorate their heroic efforts, Julianelli hopes it will
also educate generations about the atrocities of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life was enriched because we did what we were supposed to
do,'' Julianelli said. ``It wasn't just one family or one town or
one city. It was everyone helping to save the lives of those in
need.''

   The worlds of cyberspace and traditional telecommunications
continued their clash Tuesday as the leading maker of
data-networking equipment announced a $2 billion acquisition to
expand into telephone software while two of the biggest makers of
traditional phone systems said they would acquire private
data-networking companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of the
equipment that forms the synapses of the Internet, said that it had
agreed to buy the Geotel Communications Corp., which makes software
for telemarketers and customer-service call centers, for $2 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ericsson of Sweden, the maker of cellular phones and
both wireless and traditional telephone networks, said it had
agreed to acquire the Torrent Networking Technologies Corp., a
private maker of advanced data switches based in Silver Spring,
Md., for $450 million in cash. Ericsson also agreed to acquire
Touchwave Inc., a private developer of telephones that use Internet
technology based in Palo Alto, Calif., for $46 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   After major financial markets closed, Northern Telecom of
Canada, the No. 2 maker of traditional telephone gear in North
America after Lucent Technologies Inc., said that it had agreed to
acquire Shasta Networks Inc., a private data-networking company
based in Sunnyvale, Calif., for about $340 million in stock and
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's four deals were the latest salvos in a battle that is
sure to pit young networking companies reared on the Internet
against decades-old telephone giants for years to come. As the
technical barriers between voice communications and data have begun
to fade, so too have the business barriers separating the two
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco has been one of the key drivers of the convergence between
the voice and data-networking industries. Having basically defeated
its main initial rivals in data networking _ Bay Networks and 3Com
_ Cisco, along with Ascend Communications, became a leader in
selling data-networking equipment to traditional telephone
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ascend has agreed to be acquired by Lucent for about
$20 billion, Cisco has become perhaps even more aggressive in
trying to win business away from the old-line communications
equipment makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that an Old World provider provides to this customer
base, we think it's important to provide a New World version of
that,'' said Donald J. Listwin, a Cisco executive vice president,
using the company's jargon for traditional communications and
Internet-based systems. ``The key issues that we have not delivered
to our customers yet are messaging technology and call center
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Geotel will help with that. Geotel, based in Lowell, Mass.,
makes software that helps distribute calls among corporate
operators and helps keep telemarketers operating at peak
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco agreed to trade 0.5138 of its shares for each share of
Geotel. Based on Cisco's closing price of $117.75 on Monday, that
represents a 36 percent premium over Geotel's closing price of
$44.25.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco was advised by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Geotel was advised by
Dain Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Cisco tries to extend its reach into telephone
systems, the traditional telecommunications manufacturers are
trying to expand their capabilities with Internet technology.
Nortel, for instance, hopes that Shasta's technology will allow it
to deliver reliable and flexible services to business customers
using Internet systems rather than older technologies. &QL;

BOXCAR WILLIE, COUNTRY MUSIC'S `HOBO,' DIES AT 67
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo., Iowa, Tenn.)   (nk) 
 By JON PARELES

<P>
   Boxcar Willie, a country singer and songwriter who fashioned
himself as a hobo, died on Monday at his home in Branson, Mo. He
was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   With an image built through performances and television
commercials, Boxcar Willie turned a lifelong fascination with
trains, train songs and hobos into a career. He was a country
traditionalist whose trademark was an imitation of a train whistle
and whose most popular song was ``Train Medley.'' In 1986 he
settled in Branson, the emerging country music center, and became a
mainstay there, performing year-round at the Boxcar Willie Theater
and often playing six shows a day. One of his hobo outfits now
hangs in the Country Music Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Boxcar Willie was the name adopted by Lecil Travis Martin, who
was born in Sterrett, Texas, in 1931. His father was a railroad man
who played the fiddle, and the family home was said to be six feet
from the tracks. He began performing in jamborees across Texas, and
at 16 he was appearing regularly in the Big D Jamboree in Dallas.
Then he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, where he spent two decades.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired from the Air Force, he went into radio with the
``Cowtown Hoedown,'' which was broadcast from Fort Worth. He began
performing in the 1950s as Marty Martin. In the mid-60s in Lincoln,
Neb., he saw a hobo on a freight train who looked like Willie
Nelson. He wrote a song about it, ``Boxcar Willie,'' and went on to
adopt the name and image for himself. Onstage he wore overalls, an
old jacket, a crumpled hat and two days' worth of stubble.
</P>
<P>
   He kept working as a disk jockey until the mid-70s, when he went
into performing full time. Nelson made a guest appearance on an
album he made in 1976. After a 1977 deal with a Scottish booking
agent, Boxcar Willie began touring Britain regularly. He became the
most successful country music performer there. He also began
appearing on the country circuit in the United States and in 1981
joined the Grand Ole Opry. He was named World Ambassador for the
Hobos at a hobo convention in Britt, Iowa, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing mainstream record labels, Boxcar Willie marketed his
1982 album ``King of the Road'' (Suffolk Marketing) through
television commercials. He was a regular on the television show
``Hee Haw'' in the early '80s, and appeared in ``Sweet Dreams,''
the 1985 movie based on Patsy Cline's life.
</P>
<P>
   In Branson he became one of the town's most dependable tourist
attractions, operating a motel and a train museum along with the
theater. The Associated Press reported that flags are to be flown
at half staff in Branson until his funeral this weekend. He is
survived by his wife, Lloene, and three children, Tammy, Lorri and
Larry.

A TWISTING HUNT FOR AN OFFICER'S KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pursuit of the killer of an Orange, N.J., police officer, a
case that at first seemed so linear and logical, has evolved into a
perplexing tangle of events that are billowing to transform the
matter into something well beyond the death of an officer in a city
where police officers do not get killed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than resolution, three arrests have produced riddles and
unanswered questions, charges and countercharges. Even some of the
police officers immersed in the case are wondering: Do they have
the right man? How many men are they really after?
</P>
<P>
   So many questions lingered Tuesday because officials involved in
the investigation were not willing to provide even some of the most
rudimentary answers about what happened when and why.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that three men were brought into custody over
the weekend, either directly or indirectly because of the quest for
the killer. One of the men died an hour after being arrested. Law
enforcement officials, who said the man was not a suspect in the
killing, suggested Tuesday that he suffered an asthma attack. His
father contended that he was beaten to death by the police, even
though an initial examination by the Medical Examiner's office
found no evidence of a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, the only one of the three who has been charged with
the crime, showed up in court with a bruised eye. No officials
would comment on how it happened. The third man was charged with
drug possession, but some police officers said he may have been
involved in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The series of events unfolded quickly. Officer Joyce Anne
Carnegie, 38, of the 113-member Orange police force, was shot to
death last Thursday evening when she got out of her squad car to
question a man who fit the description of someone who committed
armed robbery nearby. One Orange police officer said Officer
Carnegie was first shot in the stomach and, while on the ground
clutching the gunman's foot, was shot a second time point-blank in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first officer killed in the line of duty in 33 years
in Orange, a pinpoint of a town of 29,000 people just northwest of
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Carnegie's death prompted a manhunt by dozens of
investigators from the Orange police, the Essex County prosecutor's
office and the Newark police, and it produced quick results.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, police found Terrance Everett, 24, at a
well-kept white stucco house he shares with his mother in East
Orange. There was a late-model pearl-colored Cadillac El Dorado
parked in front of an old sedan in the driveway. Two girls who
lived nearby said that Everett drove a red two-door car of a make
they could not identify. Authorities said that Officer Carnegie's
killer fled in a 1986 blue Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have not said why they homed in on Everett. He
was charged with robbery and weapons possession in addition to the
murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   Raids as part of the hunt for Officer Carnegie's killer
continued Sunday, though it unclear why, if investigators believed
that they had found the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Two more men were arrested Sunday night. James (Malik) Coker,
29, of Newark, was taken into custody at the Douglass-Harrison
Homes, where he was visiting his aunt. Police charged him with
possession of crack and with trying to swallow the drugs when
officers came to the apartment. It is not known what led
investigators to Coker, and he has not been formally linked to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But one Orange police officer said that he and some colleagues
were unconvinced that Everett was the killer and were looking hard
at Coker. Essex County Prosecutor Patricia Hurt refused to answer
questions about the case Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The most bizarre twist in the case involved Earl Faison.
According to investigators, the 27-year-old Faison inadvertently
came to their attention Sunday night when he was hailing a cab at
South Day Street and Freeway Drive West, a block from where Officer
Carnegie was shot. Feeling he bore a resemblance to a composite
police sketch of the killer, authorities said, officers working the
area approached him. A police officer said Faison ran and was
chased for three blocks before he was caught. When he was frisked,
officials said, they found a semiautomatic gun, and they arrested
him on gun possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Essex County prosecutor's office, Faison
collapsed and died an hour later as he walked into the warrant room
at Orange police headquarters. The prosecutor's office said Tuesday
that the Medical Examiner's office had been unable to determine the
cause of death and was doing further tests. But officials said the
medical examiner ruled out blunt force trauma as a possible cause
and found no evidence of kicking, beating or strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official said Faison had an asthma attack at
the police station, which can be fatal if not treated quickly. Earl
Williams, Faison's father, confirmed his son had asthma but said he
had never suffered a seizure and the condition was under control.
Faison's girlfriend, who did not want to give her name, said he did
not have a regular doctor but took medication and occasionally went
to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that he went to the morgue Monday but was not
allowed to see his son's body. Instead, he was shown a picture of
him. ``From the moment I saw the picture, I knew he was beaten to
death,'' he said. ``He was beaten very badly. It looked like he was
dragged by a truck.'' Williams said there were multiple cuts and
bruises on his face, and his face was swollen.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Weiss, a spokesman for Ms. Hurt, would not comment on the
case beyond saying that the investigation is continuing. First
Assistant Essex County Prosecutor Patrick Toscano said, ``It is my
understanding that the Orange police officers did nothing wrong in
this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his girlfriend, Faison was on probation and had
served 10 months in jail before being released in June. She said
she did not know why he had gone to jail or whether he owned a gun.
She said he was with her on the night the officer was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Faison was an aspiring rap singer, according to his sister,
Kytria Faison. And over the weekend, relatives said, he took a bus
to Virginia with another rap group, Naughty By Nature. He returned
Sunday afternoon, they said, and spent the rest of the day moving
his studio equipment from his aunt's house in Newark to his
girlfriend's house in Orange. He was leaving his girlfriend's
house, getting into a cab, she said, when police approached him.
</P>
<P>
   Little was immediately known about Coker. Ursula Scott, 37, the
aunt he was visiting when he was arrested, said he was unemployed,
but she did not know where he was living or much else about him.
She said he did look like the sketch of the killer. ``He did say,
because he had a bald head and some weight, he was afraid to go out
on the street,'' Ms. Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   When Everett, the man charged in the killing, appeared in court
on Monday and pleaded not guilty, he had a blackened left eye.
Raymond Hamlin, his lawyer, told the judge that his client had
incurred facial bruises since he was arrested, though he did not
accuse the police of inflicting them. Later, he told reporters that
he could establish that Everett was elsewhere at the time Officer
Carnegie was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt has indicated that she had four people who have
identified Everett. Like so many other things in this twisting
case, it is not known who they are and what they identified him for
_ robbing someone or killing a police officer.

BELL ATLANTIC SAYS ITS NETWORK IS FULLY OPEN TO COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing its long march toward the $80 billion long-distance
market, the Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's biggest local
telephone company, told New York state regulators Tuesday that it
had fully opened its network to competition.
</P>
<P>
   While Bell Atlantic, along with other Bells, routinely describes
its markets as open in informal contexts, Tuesday's filing with the
New York Public Service Commission formally signaled the last
chapter in negotiations and testing that began last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the New York commission and the Justice Department
said they would support Bell Atlantic's long-distance goals if the
company complied with a highly technical plan to prove that its
local network was open to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting firm, has tested Bell
Atlantic's computer systems to determine if they work easily with
its competitors'. Such compatibility is important to ensure that a
customer can switch local phone companies quickly and without
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Draft reports from KPMG in recent weeks have said that Bell
Atlantic passed more than 90 percent of the tests, but that it
failed as many as 50 specific exercises, according to executives
with access to the reports. Bell Atlantic must fix those problems
by late May or early June, when the New York commission is likely
to hold its final hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic has accurately judged its progress, and if it
convinces the New York regulators, this fall Bell Atlantic could
become the first local Bell phone company admitted into the
long-distance business. To get there, Bell Atlantic would also have
to pass a three-month review by the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Bell Atlantic said Tuesday that a
long-distance petition to the federal regulators would come perhaps
two weeks after the New York commission signed off on the
application.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about a year later than Bell Atlantic originally
predicted. Last spring, the company said it expected to be in the
long-distance market by the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it does not appear that any other Bell company is close
to winning long-distance approval. Bell Atlantic has followed an
extremely cautious approach, delaying applying to the FCC until it
believes that the petition will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   After this apparently rigorous process, when the company finally
applies, the FCC will come under enormous pressure to approve the
petition.
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth Corp., in contrast, has filed numerous
applications with the FCC that few people in the industry outside
of BellSouth thought had any chance of success. All have been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the Justice Department only advises the FCC on
long-distance applications, but in practice the two sides rarely
differ. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has been working closely
with the New York state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   While it would not be fair to view the New York commission as a
functional proxy for the Justice Department, it is unlikely that
the state regulators would approve a petition that the Justice
Department might reasonably reject. Such a conflict would be highly
embarrassing for the New York commission.

Quiet Giants remain NL West threat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers opened their checkbook this
offseason, signing baseball's first $100 million player and staking
a claim as the team to beat in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to shed its expansion label, Arizona joined the spending
spree and landed free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson, among others.
Colorado added one of baseball's best managerial masterminds with
the hiring of Jim Leyland.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the San Francisco Giants, with the lowest
payroll in the five-team NL West at $45 million, remained
relatively quiet this winter. Guess who is near the top of the
standings after the first week of the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Money helps,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``Money
doesn't always prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants might not need much of the green stuff. Armed with an
explosive offense, a solid pitching staff and the guidance of
Baker, there is no reason to believe the Giants can't contend for a
division title. Heading into Tuesday's late game with the Astros at
3Com Park, San Francisco (6-1) was off to its best start since
1973.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a team picked to finish as low as fourth in several
preseason publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole offseason, with all the signings in our division,
it's going to be like the last two years,'' first baseman J.T. Snow
said. ``We'll be in the background. We'll be overlooked. Maybe
that's the best way to go into the season. That's the way it went
the last few years. I think the guys are confident we can be there
at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Giants were the laughingstock of the NL
West, finishing last at 68-94. Since that disaster, the Giants
quietly have established themselves as one of the top teams in
baseball, winning the division in 1997 and coming within a one-game
playoff of the NL wild card last year.
</P>
<P>
   Only three teams _ the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and
Astros _ have had more success than the Giants' 179-146 record the
past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   A major part of the Giants' resurgence is Baker, who took the
job in 1993 with no managerial experience. Baker has twice won NL
Manager of the Year honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be a club that has to be reckoned with,''
Leyland said. ``When you have Dusty Baker and the caliber of
players he has, they go quietly about their business, but they've
become as professional as any team in the league the last couple of
years. Dusty gets the most out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got Dusty Baker, they're going to be in the hunt.
You can take that to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on this winter's transactions in the NL West, it would
appear the Giants did nothing to help themselves while several of
the other clubs made considerable improvements. The Dodgers made
the most noise with the signing of pitcher Kevin Brown to the
richest contract in baseball history. Along with Johnson, the
Arizona Diamondbacks spent close to $100 million alone on pitching,
adding Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso and Greg Swindell.
</P>
<P>
   Defending NL champion San Diego actually got worse, saying
goodbye to many of the players that helped the Padres get to the
World Series _ Brown, Greg Vaughn, Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and
Joey Hamilton among them.
</P>
<P>
   But Padres general manager Kevin Towers isn't ready to anoint
the Dodgers as division champions just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a team like the Dodgers spends more money, it
doesn't mean they're going to be a better club,'' Towers said. ``It
just means the Padres and Giants need to be a little wiser. I'll
say it right now, and I'll go on record with it, that either the
Giants or the Padres will finish in front of the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants are to contend, they will do so with the same cast
of characters that has stayed intact the past three years. San
Francisco's biggest moves this offseason were spending $15 million
to keep right fielder Ellis Burks and pitcher Mark Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants feature an explosive offense led by sluggers Barry
Bonds, Jeff Kent and Burks. Offensively, Bonds and Kent combined
for 68 home runs and 250 RBIs last season. Shortstop Rich Aurilia
is off to a sizzling start, batting .467 with one home run and
seven RBIs through seven games; center fielder Stan Javier has
three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of firepower has the Giants believing they can win any
time. During a season-opening sweep at Cincinnati, San Francisco
rallied on three consecutive days, including overturning a six-run
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe from the bottom of my heart that this is supposed to
be our year,'' Baker said. ``No explanation. I just feel it. I just
think we've got things going in our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rotation, Gardner, Shawn Estes and Kirk Reuter are a
formidable threesome, along with second-year pitcher Russ Ortiz.
Estes is the biggest question mark in the rotation. After becoming
a 19-game winner in 1997, he struggled to seven victories last
year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bullpen, All-Star Robb Nen became only the second
Giants closer to save at least 40 games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   After coming so close to making the playoffs last season, the
Giants have unfinished business in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players who were here last year have an unsatisfied
feeling,'' Kent said.

<P>
   STENKOVAC, Macedonia _ In the week since President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia announced that he had halted offensive
military operations in Kosovo, Serbian paramilitary groups and
Yugoslav soldiers have systematically expelled tens of thousands of
Albanians from a swath of southeastern Kosovo, according to
refugees arriving here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, among a group of 800 Kosovo Albanians allowed to
cross the border near here, described methodical attacks by
Milosevic's forces that cleared out a 10-mile-by-12-mile area that
appears to have little military value.
</P>
<P>
   In each account, Serbian paramilitary units or Yugoslav soldiers
were said to have expelled civilians and burned or shelled homes in
at least 15 villages around the town of Urosevac, in southeastern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With access to Kosovo limited by the Yugoslav government, the
accounts could not be confirmed. Each refugee was interviewed
individually about personal experiences. A comparison of their
accounts indicated the pattern of alleged Yugoslav attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials fear the actions signal a continuing attempt
by Yugoslavia to shift the ethnic balance in Kosovo; before the
NATO bombing began, on March 24, Albanians made up 90 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats said the rural area the refugees have described as
the focus of the attacks has not been a base of operations for the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla group fighting for
independence. It is not close to the border, and the villages
cleared are miles from the major roads, making it unlikely that the
area was cleared for military reasons, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees described well-organized attacks in which masked
Yugoslav soldiers descended on an Albanian village, ordered
everyone to leave, then shot or burned to death the defiant, infirm
or aged who stayed in their homes. It was impossible to determine
how many Albanians were forced from their homes, but about 50,000
people lived in the area before the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians have been
sent fleeing into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro since the
bombing started, few people had been forced out of Urosevac.
Yugoslav forces essentially sealed the border with Macedonia last
week, but on Friday refugees began to straggle across again, saying
that thousands of villagers had been forced into the city. On
Friday, about 400 refugees arrived from the area, and the number
increased to about 800 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees, said the renewed flow could signal that vast numbers more
may soon try to flee Kosovo. ``It does sound very clear from the
refugees that there is a much larger number of people who want to
come in,'' she said. ``But we never know what to expect. The last
time, it was 40,000 people in 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with about two dozen of the refugees arriving
Tuesday, they described methodical attacks by Yugoslav forces and
paramilitary units to expel civilians.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, similar groups were accused of
systematic efforts to move Muslim civilians from areas controlled
by Serbs, including rape, torture and looting.
</P>
<P>
   All of the refugees said they ended up fleeing to Urosevac after
the village attacks, and believe they were intentionally driven
into the town. They said thousands of other ethnic Albanians are
hiding in Urosevac and the surrounding hills, and are running out
of food. The refugees all used the Albanian names for their
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Luzlim Shala, a 28-year-old teacher who arrived Tuesday, said
Yugoslav army soldiers in armored personnel carriers descended last
Monday on his village, Mirash. Nestled at the base of a 2,500-foot
mountain, the quiet farming village of 1,000 people is five miles
from the main road through the area. The soldiers ordered all
civilians out of their homes and burned some homes before
departing, the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Yugoslav soldiers arrived in Prelez i Jerlive, on
the main road north of Urosevac, said Fadil Zeqir, a 32-year-old
agricultural engineer. The town's 300 families were told they had
20 minutes to leave, he said. Residents scurried into the
surrounding hills and no homes were burned.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Tuesday, two adjacent villages five miles
southeast of Urosevac were attacked by paramilitaries, the refugees
said. Sami Tahiri, a 61-year-old retired teacher, said regular
Yugoslav army soldiers first came to his village, Sojeve, and
warned the 230 families over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Tuesday, Serbian paramilitary soldiers in black masks
roared into the village in jeeps. Most of the villagers fled into
the hills, but two young men were captured, an Albanian and a
Muslim who had fled the war in Bosnia. Both were killed, he said,
and an elderly couple were burned alive in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who stayed were killed,'' Tahiri said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Albanians watched from surrounding hills, the
paramilitaries set fire to two-thirds of the homes in the village,
he said. That same day, he added, houses in Terstenik, a nearby
village, were also set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Wednesday, Yugoslav forces shelled the
Albanian village of Preshtine, which lies five miles in the
opposite direction of Urosevac, to the west. Jonuz Bytyqi, a high
school teacher from Urosevac who had fled to the area after NATO
bombing began, said he woke to the sound of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Six shells hit Preshtina, he said; no one was injured. But 30
shells fired on an adjacent village, Zaskok, killed at least four
people, refugees said. Residents of both villages fled immediately
after the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the shells hit a tractor near where I was,'' Bytyqi
said. ``I couldn't sleep at all after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Serbian paramilitary units carried out a
separate attack on Varosh, on the main road three miles south of
Urosevac, refugees said. Zeqir, who was sleeping in a nearby field
after fleeing the earlier attack on his village, said one young man
who refused to leave his home was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the pattern of attacks on Thursday, Yugoslav forces
shelled and then burned Zlatar, seven miles west of Urosevac, said
Shala, who fled the village with his wife and two young daughters.
This attack was the farthest from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Shala said he and his family then fled to Mirosale, but that
village was attacked over the weekend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a surreal end to their cat-and-mouse game with Yugoslav
forces, the refugees said they were allowed simply to buy a $20
train ticket in Urosevac on Monday morning and ride in a packed
train to the border. Many Serb-run stores refused to sell food to
them before they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot stand it psychologically,'' Bytyqi said. ``For 21
days, I never knew what was going to happen next. I promised myself
I would not leave. But my daughter lost ten pounds from the tension
and I have two sons. I came here for them.''

COUPLE IS CONVICTED OF STEALING PIECE OF CRASHED JET
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ A federal jury convicted a Virginia couple
Tuesday of conspiring to steal evidence from the wreckage of Trans
World Airlines Flight 800 to back up their theory that the jetliner
had been hit by an errant Navy missile.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, James Sanders, 53, the author of a 1997 book
promoting the theory, and his wife, Elizabeth, 52, a former TWA
flight-attendant instructor, appeared stunned when the jury
delivered its verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   The two were found guilty of conspiracy, as well as aiding and
abetting in the theft of two small strips of passenger-seat fabric
that contained a reddish-orange residue they said was left by a
missile.
</P>
<P>
   They each face up to 10 years in prison when sentenced on July
9, but the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, David B.
Pitofsky, said that under federal sentencing guidelines, they would
probably be sentenced to far less time.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple left federal District Court here Tuesday
afternoon, Sanders said: ``We were surprised by the verdict and
that the jury rendered it so quickly. It can't help but send a
strong and obvious message to journalists seeking to tell the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sanders, who clutched her husband's hand, said only, ``We
did nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   They remain free, each on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' lawyer, J. Bruce Maffeo, said he planned to appeal,
arguing that the court had not adequately addressed his argument
that the couple's actions were protected by the First Amendment.
``This verdict,'' he said, ``has to be a chilling one for any
journalist seeking evidence of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd Abrams, a constitutional lawyer and First Amendment
expert, said he doubted such an appeal would succeed. ``It's an
extremely tenuous First Amendment claim, absent any extraordinary
showing that the prosecution was engaged in the purpose of
suppressing the book or some other purpose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Downing of TWA Flight 800,'' Sanders
contended that tests indicated the reddish-orange substance on the
seat fabric was residue from missile exhaust _ evidence that the
plane had been accidentally fired upon when it exploded only 12
minutes after taking off from Kennedy International Airport on July
17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The government has yet to determine the cause of the crash, but
has rejected the missile theory and says its tests show that the
residue is fabric glue.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanderses were charged under a law approved by Congress in
1996, after the Valujet crash in Florida, that makes it illegal to
remove, conceal or withhold parts of a civilian aircraft involved
in an accident.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the actual theft of the seating material from a government
hangar in Calverton, N.Y., where the wreckage was being
reassembled, was committed by Capt. Terrell Stacey, a TWA pilot
who, like Mrs. Sanders, knew many of the crew members who were
among the 230 people who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey appeared as the chief government witness against the
couple, testifying that the three of them had conspired to steal
the evidence. He told the jury that Mrs. Sanders had pleaded with
him to help provide evidence for her husband's investigation of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Stacey pleaded guilty
to theft of government property, a misdemeanor. He faces up to a
year in prison, but prosecutors are expected to recommend leniency
when he is sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Pitofsky insisted that the case was not about
what caused the plane to explode or about First Amendment rights,
but ``simply about the theft of wreckage from a civil aircraft
involved in a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joanna Seybert agreed, barring testimony on those other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky said Tuesday that First Amendment rights were never in
question during the case. ``Mr. Sanders published a book and no one
stopped him from saying whatever he wanted to say,'' he said. ``And
the jury understood that no responsible reporter would believe they
could break into a place to get a story.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day trial drew nearly a dozen conspiracy theorists,
who insisted that the Sanderses were being prosecuted as part of a
government cover-up of the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were only trying to inform the American people, and the
government wants it covered up,'' said one supporter, Howard Mann,
a mechanic and pilot who worked for TWA for 40 years, as he waited
for the couple in front of the courthouse.

THE GREAT GRETZKY RETIREMENT WATCH BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late last week, as speculation increased about his
possible retirement, Wayne Gretzky said that ``I don't want to be
the center of attention,'' and that John Muckler, the Rangers'
coach, would be the first to know of Gretzky's decision.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Rangers management would be willing to pick up his
$5 million contract option for next season, Gretzky said, ``I don't
think either one of us wants to embarrass the other side. So,
that's not a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, Gretzky had made no definitive public statement
regarding retirement. Although the Rangers announced that they want
him back and would pick up his contract option, the news media were
filled with speculation that Gretzky would soon announce the end of
his great career, perhaps this week, as the NHL completes its
regular season and prepares for the Stanley Cup playoffs without
Gretzky's Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The most definitive statement of the day came from Gretzky's
father, Walter. According to The Associated Press, he told radio
station CKGL in Kitchener, Ontario, that he strongly suspected that
Sunday would be his son's final game. The Rangers end the regular
season that day against Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to him personally,'' Walter Gretzky said of
his son. ``He's talked with his mom, but most likely he will
announce a retirement. He's 38 now.''
</P>
<P>
   So as the Rangers prepared to play in Ottawa Thursday night
Gretzky was indeed the center of attention he didn't want to be.
And if Walter Gretzky sounded pretty certain of how his son was
leaning, Muckler, who was supposed to be the first to know, didn't
seem so sure if Gretzky's 20th season in the NHL and his 21st as a
professional, would be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not mentioned a word to me,'' Muckler said in a
telephone interview. ``And I have not mentioned a word to him
because I just didn't think it was proper. We just want to let him
get through this year and then let him make the decision he will
make.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked if he had a gut feeling about Gretzky's plans,
Muckler replied: ``I still think he's going to come back. That's
still my opinion. Maybe that's wishful thinking on my part, I don't
know, because I'd like to see him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Gretzky and to his agent, Michael Barnett,
were not returned Tuesday. On Monday night, after a 2-1 Rangers
victory over Tampa Bay at the Garden, Gretzky said of retirement
speculation: ``It's become a hot topic. We'll see what happens over
the next five or six days. Nothing has been decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Neil Smith, the general manager of the Rangers, said
Tuesday that the Rangers, in writing, would offer Gretzky a
contract extension this week for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Will Gretzky accept the offer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving that up to him to make his own personal
decision,'' Smith said. ``He has not informed the club.'' Smith
said that he had placed a call to Gretzky Tuesday ``to have a
personal conversation about the issue'' but that Gretzky had not
returned it by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have him back,'' Smith said. ``To formalize it and
put it so that it is a legal thing, that will say more than all my
words can say. We're making the declaration that, yes, we are
taking up the option.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Should Gretzky retire, his departure would come within a year of
Michael Jordan's retirement from the Chicago Bulls of the NBA.
Although Gretzky's hockey career began when Magic Johnson and Larry
Bird started their careers in basketball, it is Jordan to whom
Gretzky is most often compared as a singular icon of a sport and an
era.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky began his career with one season in the defunct World
Hockey Association, 1978-79. In both major leagues combined, he has
scored 1,072 goals, regular season and playoffs, one more than
Gordie Howe. No player has scored more.
</P>
<P>
   Howe, Gretzky and Bobby Orr are generally considered to be the
three best players in the history of their sport and Gretzky holds
most of the scoring records of significance in the N.H.L.,
including 894 regular-season goals, 1,962 regular-season assists
and 2,856 regular-season points.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are Gretzky's fourth team in the NHL and this is his
third season here. In his first nine seasons in the league, he
played with the Edmonton Oilers, who won the Stanley Cup four times
while he was there and one time after he left. In 1981-82, Gretzky
scored 92 goals, the most ever of any player in a single season. In
1985-86, he scored 215 points, goals and assists combined, the most
ever by any player.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he has only nine goals, along with 52 assists. He
missed 12 games with a disk injury in his neck, the first games he
missed as a Ranger. During his absence, the Rangers went 6-3-3 and
played with considerable spirit. In the plus/minus ratio that
measures a player's presence on ice for goals scored for or against
his team at even strength, Gretzky is minus 23, the worst on the
Rangers and among the worst in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of this season, both Gretzky and Smith said they
expected Gretzky to return for 1999-2000. But certain events have
indicated that it was not such a sure thing. Despite Gretzky's wish
for more veteran players to take advantage of his setup passes from
the center position, Smith made no major trades for scoring wings.
</P>
<P>
   And when Gretzky suggested in February that the Rangers bid for
veteran free agents this summer, Smith reiterated, in a general way
that wasn't critical of Gretzky, that the Rangers are committed to
rebuilding with youth.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Gretzky, although smaller than most
hockey players, has been more agile than fragile, able to avoid the
hardest collisions from opposing checkers. But this season, Gretzky
has been hit hard many times and often has left the ice wincing in
pain.
</P>
<P>
   On some of Gretzky's teams, especially in early stages of his
career, such disrespect would have been met with retaliation by
Gretzky's teammates. In Philadelphia last week, with this team,
there was no response when Luke Richardson flattened him along the
boards, except for Gretzky's compliment to Richardson. ``I told
him, `Good hit,''' Gretzky said. ``I was vulnerable. He got me
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Messier played for the Rangers, his teammates would
retaliate vigorously when opponents even jostled him legally, even
though Messier was big and tough on his own. Although his Rangers
teammates always speak of Gretzky with respect and admiration, he
has never had Messier-like stature on the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As speculation about retirement has grown through the season,
fans and players, especially on the road, have paid tribute to
Gretzky, particularly in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In Calgary, Gretzky said the cheering left him with tears in his
eyes. In Chicago last Thursday night, when the scoreboard showed
highlights of Gretzky's career, the fans stood and applauded while
players from both teams tapped their sticks on the ice in tribute.
Gretzky smiled and waved from the bench. After the game, his father
and his wife, Janet, were there to greet him, not an every-game
scene, especially on the road.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas the next night, Gretzky was walking down a corridor
after the game when he was stopped by Brett Hull, the Stars'
sharpshooter, who put his arm around his shoulders and shook his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has been saving sticks and pucks from most of his games
this season and giving them as mementos to people close to him. An
extra-large contingent of reporters is expected Thursday night when
he plays in the Canadian capital, in a country where he is a
national hero. And then comes Sunday's final game, in the Garden,
where his stature over the last three years has never quite reached
that level. &QL;

SEX MISCONDUCT GRIEVANCE FILED AGAINST SKATING COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Maurizi, who has accused his former coach and colleague,
Richard Callaghan, of sexual misconduct, filed a formal grievance
Tuesday with the U.S. Figure Skating Association, seeking to revoke
Callaghan's membership in the sport's national governing body.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recent interviews, Maurizi has said that he does
not believe Callaghan should be allowed to coach anymore. If
Callaghan's membership in the skating association were revoked, he
would still be able to coach, but he would not be allowed to
participate in any of the Olympic-style competitions that the
national governing body sanctions. Tonya Harding faces such a
lifetime ban for her role in the clubbing attack of Nancy Kerrigan
in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi declined to be interviewed Tuesday, saying he had been
advised by his lawyer not to speak to reporters and that he needed
to spend time with his family during what he described as an
emotional period. He has said previously that he hoped rinks will
be reluctant to hire Callaghan in the future, thus effectively
derailing his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, 53, one of the dominant figures in figure skating for
years, has vehemently denied having a sexual relationship with
Maurizi. He has dismissed any suggestion that he behaved improperly
during his association with Maurizi, who was a student and coaching
colleague of Callaghan's for two decades and rose through the ranks
of pairs skating to finish fifth at the 1986 national
championships. Until now, Maurizi has never filed a formal
grievance against Callaghan.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan has resigned as director of competitive skating at the
Detroit Skating Club and has announced his retirement from the
competitive side of the sport, saying he was tired of the incessant
travel. He plans to remain in the sport as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   USFSA president Jim Disbrow said Maurizi's grievance was filed
with its ethics committee. The association has 30 days to decide
whether the complaint is valid and whether a grievance process
should be initiated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Shulman, executive director of the Professional Skaters
Association, a national coaches unit, said it also received a
formal grievance Tuesday from Maurizi and that it would have 20
days to decide whether a grievance process was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Groulx, Callaghan's lawyer, said that neither he nor his
client had been notified of the grievances. ``At this time we don't
have anything to say,'' Groulx said. ``As far as we know, nothing's
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The grievance filed with the USFSA is considered the more
significant one.
</P>
<P>
   Disbrow said a statute of limitations regarding alleged
misconduct could complicate matters. He said that according to the
skating association's guidelines, a grievance must be filed within
60 days or six months _ he could not remember which _ of any
alleged violations of the organization's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who is now 36, has accused Callaghan of engaging in
inappropriate sexual conduct with him when he was 15 and has said
that Callaghan later abused his position of authority to initiate a
full sexual relationship when Maurizi was 18 and barely out of high
school in 1981. The sexual relationship, Maurizi said, continued
off and on until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't be looking at all rumors running around left,
right and center for 100 years,'' Disbrow said. He added, however,
that the skating association would examine Maurizi's allegations to
determine whether extenuating circumstances made them actionable
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we look at this realistically,'' Disbrow
said. ``Anything that gets this much publicity, we want to make
sure we act properly.''  &QL;

ABORTION DOCTOR'S KILLER HID GUN NEAR SCENE, INVESTIGATORS
THEORIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say they think that the killer of an
upstate New York doctor who performed abortions probably buried the
rifle in the ground days before the shooting, unearthed the weapon
to fire the fatal shot, then hurriedly reburied it before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark said investigators
reached that conclusion after agents discovered a high-powered
rifle last week. The gun was buried a foot deep in woods 200 feet
behind the stately brick house in Amherst, N.Y., where Dr. Barnett
Slepian was slain about 10 p.m. on Oct. 23 by a bullet fired
through his kitchen window. The rifle, which the authorities have
refused to describe, has been sent to the FBI laboratory in
Washington for ballistics tests and fingerprint checks that could
determine whether it was the murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Clark said that in the days
after the killing, police assumed that the sniper had fled with the
weapon, and did not consider the possibility of a buried weapon.
They used a metal detector, he said, but scanned only the area
around the tree where they presumed the sniper had fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this business 27 years and worked directly or
indirectly on thousands of homicides, and in not one did the
perpetrator bury the gun at or near the scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as no rifle turned up, he said, investigators began to
theorize that the killer carried the gun into the woods at a time
when no one was on the streets, probably after midnight, and came
back on another day to shoot Dr. Slepian when he would be at home
and awake. Clark described the neighborhood as an affluent
community ``where people are leery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How a person got out carrying a weapon puzzled'' the
investigators, he said. ``And it puzzled them to the point that
they started wondering, what if he didn't take it out? What if he
left it there?''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, investigators decided to sweep a broader
area with metal detectors, but had to wait until the ground thawed
or until the heavy snowfall melted.
</P>
<P>
   Police have not formally identified a suspect, but have focused
their manhunt on James Kopp, an abortion opponent who drifted
around the country from demonstration to demonstration. Clark said
that about 10 days before the slaying, a jogger became suspicious
of a black 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier with Vermont plates that was
parked in the area at 6 a.m. The jogger wrote down the license
plate number, which was traced to Kopp.
</P>

 JAMES McCAWLEY, 61; LINGUIST SPARKED RIFT AMONG COLLEAGUES  
 (bl)  
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James D. McCawley, an internationally renowned linguist who
sought wherever possible to combine in his work his three consuming
passions _ language, music and ethnic food _ died April 10 after
collapsing on the campus of the University of Chicago, where he had
taught for more than three decades. He was 61 and lived in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cause was a heart attack, said university
officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCawley helped instigate the first big ideological rift in
modern linguistics. Until 1957 the field had been defined by
Chomskyan generative grammar, a theory that focuses almost
exclusively on syntax, or the rules of sentence formation. In the
late 1960s, McCawley and several young colleagues developed a new
theory called generative semantics, which held that the study of
grammar must necessarily involve the study of logic and meaning as
well. Originally conceived as an extension of Noam Chomsky's work,
generative semantics was regarded by many hard-line Chomskyan
linguists, including Chomsky himself, as a theoretical slap in the
face.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing scores of technical publications,
McCawley, the Andrew MacLeish Distinguished Service Professor of
Linguistics and East Asian Languages, was the author of ``The
Eater's Guide to Chinese Characters'' (1984), which helped Western
diners avoid the embarrassing necessity, as Calvin Trillin once
wrote, of carrying a wallet card in Chinese that read, ``Please
bring me some of what that man at the next table is having.''
</P>
<P>
   McCawley was a rumpled bear of a man, with a bristling black
mustache and chin-length dark hair; his sartorial style ran to
corduroy jackets with threads sprouting from the hems. His speech
was a deeply idiosyncratic amalgam of Scotland, where he was born,
and Chicago, where he grew up, further complicated by a residual
trace of the stammer that had plagued him when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   He possessed a rigorous yet playful intellect, a prodigious
memory and a host of artistic talents, colleagues recalled. ``In my
entire 30 years of association with him, I rarely told him anything
he didn't know,'' said linguist Jerrold Sadock, also of the
University of Chicago. ``He had thought about everything and he
knew everything.''
</P>
<P>
   McCawley might think, on any given day, about East Indian
writing systems, Japanese phonology, Korean gastronomy, Spanish
soap operas, microtonal music, mathematics, logic and
libertarianism. Name any city in the world and he would direct you
to the best Chinese restaurant there. He was a first-rate Chinese
cook _ his pigs' ears in garlic sauce remains etched in colleagues'
memories _ and an enthusiastic host. He sang, played the piano,
harpsichord, guitar and clarinet and composed a bit. He spoke
Spanish, French, German, Yiddish, Dutch, Russian, Mandarin Chinese,
Hungarian, Japanese, Swedish and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   He was preternaturally unphysical and did not know how to drive
a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tie-ins between linguistics and virtually
everything,'' McCawley said in an interview last year. ``It's an
excuse for me to be a perpetual student.''
</P>
<P>
   James David McCawley was born in Glasgow on March 30, 1938,
immigrating with his family to Chicago when he was 7. He studied
mathematics, ``for no particularly good reason,'' as he later
recalled, earning a master's degree (and a de facto bachelor's)
from the University of Chicago in 1958. Having always enjoyed
foreign languages, he found his way into the first doctoral class
of the newly formed linguistics department at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where his teachers included Chomsky. He
received his Ph.D. in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   McCawley, who had joined the faculty of the University of
Chicago the previous year, was famous for his parties, which
included annual celebrations of Bastille Day (guests had to bring a
dish from a country liberated from French domination; you could
cheat and bring a six-pack of Stroh's, brewed in Detroit), and a
celebration of Hongul Day, which commemorated the creation of the
Korean alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   McCawley's generosity also took more intimate forms. The
linguist John Goldsmith, a Chicago colleague, recalled: ``He was
singing Yiddish folk songs with a student from Uruguay, who said
all her Yiddish folk song books had been confiscated by the police.
The next day she found two Yiddish folk song books in her
mailbox.''
</P>
<P>
   McCawley's marriage to linguist Noriko Akatsuka ended in
divorce; he is survived by his sisters, Caroline Podvin, of Monee,
Ill., and Monica Cox, of Culver, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Among his honors were the presidency of the Linguistic Society
of America in 1996 and election to the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences in 1983. His books included ``Adverbs, Vowels and Other
Objects of Wonder'' (1979), ``Everything That Linguists Have Always
Wanted to Know About Logic (but Were Ashamed to Ask)'' (1981) and
``Thirty Million Theories of Grammar'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   ``Languages are weird and wonderful things,'' McCawley said last
year. ``As long as you are perceptive enough there is plenty to
keep you happy and busy.''  &QL;

WHITMAN SIGNS BILLS CUTTING PROPERTY TAXES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVILLE, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bipartisan
package of bills Tuesday giving New Jersey residents the first
installment of promised property tax relief and giving herself a
powerful new talking point in her race for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is about helping local officials across the state find
efficiencies; it's also about honoring a promise I made to the
taxpayers of the state of New Jersey to relieve them from higher
property taxes,'' Whitman said at a bill-signing ceremony at a
public library here.
</P>
<P>
   The four bills she signed into law Tuesday amount to a modest
$35 million in spending and are intended to encourage the 1,600
local governments in the state to consolidate services like schools
and fire protection in order to save money and hold down property
tax increases. That legislation is likely to help her senatorial
prospects, as is a bill giving residents $1 billion in direct
property tax relief, the installments timed to arrive within weeks
before Election Day for the next five years. The governor intends
to sign that bill on Thursday, the deadline to file tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman tried to play down, at least for the day, any
political advantage she might gain from the property tax cuts,
which took seven months from the time they were proposed to reach
her desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For government work, it's not bad to take ideas from a
commission and get them into legislation that is actually signed
within seven months,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In her first term as governor, Mrs. Whitman delivered on a
campaign pledge to cut the state income tax by 30 percent for most
middle- and low-income taxpayers. But in November 1997 the
notoriously restive New Jersey electorate came close to turning her
out of office in favor of a long-shot Democratic candidate,
Woodbridge Mayor James E. McGreevey, and much of that voter anger
was over paying some of the highest property taxes and automobile
insurance rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first three months of this year, with the help of a
Legislature controlled by her fellow Republicans, Whitman has moved
swiftly to shield her political weak spot on property taxes as she
turns her attention toward a race for the Senate seat being vacated
next year by Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat who is retiring after
three terms.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Whitman established a property tax commission to
provide her with ideas for controlling property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate shouldn't be about relief vs. reform,'' Whitman
said Tuesday. ``I believe anything that we can do to help ease the
property burden is worth doing, and we can do all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   One bill that Whitman intends to sign on Thursday _ a week after
she announced that she was forming a fund-raising committee for a
Senate race _ is clearly the highest-profile piece of legislation.
It will provide $1 billion over five years for property tax relief,
eventually giving homeowners, regardless of income, an average
annual rebate check of $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax reduction to individuals is simultaneously a tax bill
and a statement of political philosophy,'' said Joseph J. Seneca,
the chairman of the N.J. Council of Economic Advisers, a
five-member panel that analyzes economic conditions and forecasts
trends. ``It's a response to the perceived request of homeowners
for direct property tax relief. That concern has been expressed for
many years, especially at the ballot box on many Novembers.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SMITH IS THE BEST QUARTERBACK IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NFL-DRAFT) 
(rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so Tim Couch is 6 feet 4 inches and the golden boy. He was
the darling quarterback throughout the college football season, and
for good reason. Full of range. Throws the short stuff with
precision. Smart. An aw-shucks, down-home Kentucky fella. I would
draft him No. 1, too, if not for one other quarterback: Akili
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In a season and half as the starting quarterback at Oregon,
Smith turned the Pacific-10 inside out. He will eventually do the
same in the NFL. That is why the Cleveland Browns must select him
with the draft's first pick.
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply Smith's size (6-3, 221 pounds), arm strength,
intelligence or presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football in the next decade will become a game where
quarterbacks must be mobile. Today, that quality is a luxury.
Tomorrow, it will be a necessity. Mobility and athleticism are
becoming essential because pro defenses are faster and are more
insistent on rushing the passer from all positions, employing an
assortment of tricky tactics.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, a quarterback not only must be able to think
quickly on his feet, but he had better have quick feet. Murderous
mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith is this draft's best quarterback when combining
thunderous arm and magical feet.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking, truly, a thunderous arm. Football veterans say
the only quarterback they have seen who throws a ball similar to
Smith's tight, multirevolution, swift ball is Warren Moon. And
several others say his passes are better than Moon's. Smith passes
will cut through the fierce Cleveland winter winds. And he
possesses the size and stamina to excel in cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Mobility? This guy scrambled for a long run of 58 yards as a
junior, and then for 62 yards as a senior. Couch's long runs in the
last two years were for 31 and 14 yards. The yardage, however, is
not the thing. It is his ability to escape, and the threat that
poses. Smith is a passer first, scrambler second. But scrambling on
his terms, in his manner, keeps defenses on edge. In fear.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so there are the issues of his draft testing (supposedly not
impressive) and of his college background (scrapes with the law in
Oregon). Really, now, can a guy direct an offense in the Pac-10 and
throw for 3,763 yards, for 32 touchdowns and only eight
interceptions in his senior season and be dumb?
</P>
<P>
   And really, now, Smith had an altercation with some guys outside
a bar (unfortunate) and a driving-under-the-influence charge
(terrible judgment) weeks after he first arrived at Oregon. He was
a model student and citizen afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The key is that Smith made initial mistakes and learned real
lessons. He grew up.
</P>
<P>
   He is 24, and there is concern that he only played a year and a
half of big-time football at Oregon because he tried two years of
pro baseball first. Hey, give me a football player, any player,
willing to step out and to live, who took a challenging route to
greatness. He will appreciate it later in his life, and show it.
Smith does.
</P>
<P>
   That trait is the real bonus in drafting Akili Smith at No. 1.
He will have an impact on his teammates in real and lasting ways.
They will love playing for and with him. They will latch on to the
real, tangible and touchable person that he is. He has charisma, a
winning smile and attitude, the kind of personality that says jump
on board.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns will love him, and so will the town.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is building a new franchise on old, historic soil.
Picking Smith sets the foundation for this franchise for the next
decade, a decade for which he is primed because of the way he plays
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderous arm, murderous mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Come draft day, Smith should go to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Aw-shucks. Because Smith is golden.  &QL;

ANGELS BULLPEN HAS PICKED UP SLACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ How have the Angels survived the big losses to their
lineup (Mo Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and Gary DiSarcina) and the poor
performances by their starting pitchers?
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday's game against the A's, the seven Angels
relievers were a combined 2-0 with a 2.17 ERA. Five of the seven
hadn't allowed an earned run, including Al Levine (two appearances,
6 2/3 innings), Mark Petkovsek (two appearances, five innings) and
Mike Magnante (three appearances, 4 2/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   All three played for other teams last season -- Levine with the
Rangers, Petkovsek with the Cardinals and Magnante with the Royals.
But all have come together with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to pitch, Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``One thing they have is they know what they've got -- they don't
try to do what they can't.
</P>
<P>
   With closer Troy Percival serving as the bullpen's anchor,
Collins says he manages an eight-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best bullpen we've had in the three years I've
been here, set-up man Shigetoshi Hasegawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Angels starters completed five innings in only two of
their first seven games, the Angels are benefitting from carrying
12 pitchers. But Collins said he doesn't know how long he'll be
able to have that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no telling when he might have to make a change, he
said. ``Sometimes you run into the problem of finding enough work
for all of them. ... But I tip my hat to the pitching coaches. They
were absolutely correct in saying we needed 12 pitchers out of
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Jim Edmonds is eligible to come of the disabled
list today, but he won't. And he will not join the team here.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds has not played this season because of a strained groin
and a cyst in a muscle in his right shoulder. It's the shoulder
that continues to bother him, and there is no prognosis on when he
might be able to return.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ned Bergert only shrugs when asked about Edmonds.
Collins said he's through guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done very good at predicting that stuff, Collins
said. ``I said Gary would be back opening day, and he's out four
months. I said Jimmy would be playing (today), and he's not even
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels certainly didn't envision it, but Jeff Huson was
their starting left fielder Tuesday, and Tim Unroe will be the
starting left fielder tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Without Edmonds and Vaughn, the Angels have had to move things
around. Orlando Palmeiro had started the previous six games in left
field before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to get the bench guys a game, Collins
said. ``I can't tell you how important that's going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Unroe, a longshot to make the team, led the team with five
spring homers.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Todd Greene, who caught six innings Monday in
Texas, felt good and had no stiffness in his shoulder Tuesday.
He'll likely get another start behind the plate toward the end of
the week. ... In the third inning Tuesday, the A's Mike Macfarlane
hit a foul popup to the first base dugout area, where first baseman
Darin Erstad gave chase. But unlike on Mo Vaughn's injury, when the
opposing team occupied the first base dugout, about seven or eight
Angels got off the bench and prevented Erstad from falling into the
dugout. ... The Angels and A's resume their series tonight (7:05)
at the Oakland Coliseum. Chuck Finley (1-0, 6.00 ERA) will start
for Anaheim against Oakland's Kenny Rogers (0-1, 5.79).

MARY JANE RATHBUN, 77, KNOWN AS `BROWNIE MARY'

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Jane Rathbun, who became known as the grandmotherly Brownie
Mary who handed out brownies laced with high-grade cannabis to sick
people to relieve their pain and nausea, died on Saturday at a
hospital in San Francisco. She was 77 and lived in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun campaigned on the local, state and national level to
legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. She baked the brownies
in the small kitchen of her home in a housing project for the
elderly in the largely gay Castro neighborhood of San Francisco.
She called them ``original recipe brownies'' and ``magically
delicious.'' In one raid on her home in 1981, police confiscated 54
dozen of them, along with more than 18 pounds of the marijuana,
donated by growers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rathbun was arrested three times and was ordered to perform
hundreds of hours of community service, which she spent with AIDS
patients. Her base of operations in the early years of the AIDS
epidemic was San Francisco General Hospital. Working as a volunteer
for some 10 years, she devoted untold hours to help care for ``her
kids,'' as the patients came to be known.
</P>
<P>
   Her role as a baker was but a small part of her activities. She
became a San Francisco fixture for whom the city fathers proclaimed
an official Brownie Mary Day in 1992 to honor her work with dying
patients in the AIDS ward.
</P>
<P>
   With Dennis Peron, a longtime comrade and prominent marijuana
advocate, she published ``Brownie Mary's Marijuana Cookbook and
Dennis Peron's Recipe for Social Change,'' which did not include
the brownie recipe. They also founded the San Francisco Cannabis
Buyers Club, which is now defunct.
</P>
<P>
   Her first arrest on marijuana charges and a judge's order to
perform community service prompted Ms. Rathbun to join the Shanti
project, one of the first AIDS support groups. The court action
spawned ``Free Brownie Mary'' groups, but two more arrests for
marijuana possession went unprosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jane Rathbun was born in Minnesota and grew up in Chicago.
She settled in San Francisco in World War II, briefly married and
had a daughter who died in a car accident. There are no immediate
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, Ms. Rathbun could no longer bake because of
arthritis and other ailments that kept her in constant pain. She
had two artificial knees and, she said, only her own sweet medicine
enabled her to walk at all.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaigns and arrests helped build support for the 1996
California state initiative that made the use of marijuana
conditionally legal. The measure allowed use with a doctor's
consent for patients suffering from AIDS, cancer and certain other
serious conditions whose symptoms are said to be alleviated by the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   But the law has led to numerous skirmishes between advocates of
marijuana and local and federal authorities who say that a voter
initiative cannot override a federal ban on marijuana.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, April 14:
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's presidential election Thursday offers an opportunity
to end a seven-year civil war between the army and Islamic
guerrillas that has cost more than 80,000 lives. But for that to
happen, the ruling generals must permit an honest vote count and
allow the winner to govern freely.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign has proceeded, the army has made clear its
preference for former Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika, making
him a strong favorite. Surprisingly, however, several serious
opposition candidates have been allowed to wage competitive
campaigns. The leading challengers are Ahmed Taleb-Ibrahimi, who is
endorsed by many of the Islamic groups that began the insurgency,
and former Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche, who advocates
democratic and market reforms. Unless the front-runner gets more
than 50 percent of Thursday's vote, he must face the next-highest
finisher in a runoff election later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's last seriously contested campaign ended abruptly in
January 1992 when the army blocked a runoff parliamentary vote that
an Islamic fundamentalist party seemed certain to win. Radical
Islamic guerrillas then unleashed a campaign of terror that
targeted secular civilians, intellectuals and foreigners as well as
soldiers. Army leaders responded with violent repression and
blocked all attempts at a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Violent incidents peaked early last year. Yet more than 200
people are still being killed every month. As some generals and
Islamic leaders now seem willing to recognize, force alone cannot
bring Algeria lasting peace. Having sanctioned democratic
competition, both sides are now obliged to honor the results. The
elections should proceed without tampering or interruption.

WAVES INTERVIEW NAIA'S MEYER

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don Meyer, one of college basketball's winningest
coaches, interviewed on campus Tuesday for the vacant men's head
coaching position at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer's interview was his second for the job. Pepperdine
athletic director John Watson flew to Nashville last week to meet
Meyer and former Vanderbilt coach Jan van Breda Kolff.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, 54, is 665-179 in 24 seasons at Lipscomb University, an
NAIA school in Nashville, and 702-220 overall. The Bisons won the
NAIA national championship in 1986 and have averaged almost 28 wins
per season under Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, whose motion offense has produced two players who scored
more than 4,000 points in their careers, presents a coaching
contrast to another leading candidate for the job, Pepperdine
assistant Randy Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's specialty is defense; the Waves were second in the
West Coast Conference in scoring defense this past season, giving
up an average of 63.2 points per game. Pepperdine also held its
opponents to 29.2 percent shooting on 3-point attempts, an all-time
conference low.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who was inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame in 1993, may
be an unknown on the national scene, but he is well-respected
within the coaching community. He runs the largest summer
basketball camp in the nation _ from which he earns a reported
$300,000 to $400,000 _ and he has put out 30 instructional
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   He also runs a coaching academy that draws 300 high school and
college coaches each year. Besides his impressive coaching resume,
Meyer has another factor in his favor: Lipscomb, like Pepperdine,
is affiliated with the churches of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who earned a Ph.D. from the University of Utah in 1972,
was turned down for the Vanderbilt job last month. He reportedly
wants to leave Lipscomb because the school is considering a move up
from NAIA to NCAA Division I.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to go through that probationary period and
build from scratch,'' a source at Lipscomb said.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates for the job are UC Santa Barbara assistant
Marty Wilson, Biola head coach Dave Holmquist, Rhode Island
assistant Jim Harrick Jr. and UCLA assistants Michael Holton and
Jim Saia.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine is expected to introduce its new head coach by the
end of next week. Former coach Lorenzo Romar resigned March 5 to
take the head coaching position at Saint Louis University.

YANKEES' WINNING BLUEPRINT IS A BOUNCE AND A BASH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' principal
owner, thought that along with being a very good team, the Yankees
have been very lucky, and it would have been hard to argue with him
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A ground ball that should have ended the eighth inning took a
fortunate bounce for the Yankees, extending their rally and
permitting them to go on and score four runs in the inning, for a
6-3 victory. The Yankees have won six consecutive games since
losing their first game of the season, while the Orioles find
themselves in a familiar position. They have lost eight consecutive
games at Yankee Stadium and already the Orioles _ an old team that
could use a quick start _ are four games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the game in the bottom of the sixth, 2-2, and
in the bottom of the seventh, Baltimore Manager Ray Miller, needing
to win the first game of this series, inserted left-handed relief
pitcher Arthur Rhodes, whose power stuff matches up well against
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes stifled the Yankees in the seventh and retired the first
two batters in the eighth, before Bernie Williams worked a two-out
walk. Tino Martinez poked a grounder down the third base line,
where Cal Ripken set himself to catch the ball and throw out
Martinez at first. But the bounder hit the bag and skipped over
Ripken's head, rolling down the left field line, a fluke double.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles elected to walk Chili Davis _ the American League
player of the week _ and load the bases, bringing Jorge Posada to
the plate, with an .067 batting average. But Posada would get to
bat right-handed, his strong side: In 1998, he hit .357
right-handed, .228 left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   On the seventh pitch of the at-bat, Rhodes skipped a ball in the
dirt, allowing Williams to score the lead run and thrilling the
crowd of 25,254. Once the fans settled, however, Posada smashed a
three-run home run to right, finishing off the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not commit an error in their first six games,
and in fact, they have only 13 in their last 47 games, dating back
to Aug. 29 and including the post-season. Placing that rate of
efficiency in perspective, the Yankees would commit only 48 errors
over a full season, or little more than half of the existing major
league record for fewest errors in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees played the first four innings last night as if
it were the first week of spring training. After Brady Anderson led
off the game with a single, Baltimore's Mike Bordick hit a bouncer
right to the third baseman Scott Brosius, who deftly gloved the
ball, turned and threw to second for the start of what should have
been a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, caught the ball
with plenty of time but threw the ball into the dirt and past
Martinez at first.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the inning, Albert Belle swung and missed at a
sinking fastball, strike three _ but the pitch glanced off the
glove of catcher Jorge Posada as Bordick took second and the inning
continued. Harold Baines pulled a single to right and Bordick
scored.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeter lifted a fly toward right, Belle slowly retreated,
appearing as if he might catch the ball well in front of the
warning track. But Jeter's fly drifted a few feet over the right
field fence, Jeter's third home run of the season. Yankees 1,
Orioles 1.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's second fielding gaffe cost the Yankees' another run.
Leading off the third inning, Will Clark hit a grounder to second,
where Knoblauch bent over and watched the ball go between his legs,
the Yankees' first error of the season. Belle singled and, once
more, Baines drove in a run with a single to give the Orioles a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had tied the score in the first, and he countered again in
the sixth, opening the inning by hammering a changeup to
straightaway center field. This one landed short of the wall,
leaving Jeter with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill then smashed a grounder that Clark at first speared
with a lunge, a play so difficult that Jeter rambled home from
third with the run that evened the score at 2-2.

 EDITORIAL: MISINFORMATION FROM HMOs  
 (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, April 14:
</P>
<P>
   Two troubling reports by the federal General Accounting Office
show how difficult it can be for Medicare beneficiaries to get
accurate information about their health coverage from their
managed-care plans. These plans now provide health care to about 7
million out of 39 million Medicare recipients, a figure that has
doubled in the past three years. Yet a spot check of 16 plans found
that all of them provided enrollees with either inaccurate or
misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   Congress revamped the Medicare managed-care program in 1997 to
expand choices for beneficiaries, with the expectation that more
competition among managed-care plans would provide better benefits
and lower out-of-pocket fees. A recent federal survey found that
most Medicare enrollees were satisfied with their health plans. But
for beneficiaries to make informed choices, they have to be able to
get truthful, understandable information about benefits and the
rules of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO examined 16 out of more than 340 managed-care plans
serving Medicare enrollees. Nearly half of the study group
misstated benefit coverage. For example, several told enrollees
they needed to get a doctor's referral to obtain a mammogram, when
in fact Medicare policy explicitly prohibits plans from requiring
such a referral and even requires health plans to notify enrollees
of this benefit. Some plans simply did not give out detailed
benefit information. One plan provided enrollees with a
prescription drug benefit that was substantially less than what it
had promised to provide in its Medicare contract with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Such abuses may not be surprising in the unregulated private
sector. But these failures took place even though federal Medicare
officials were supposed to review and approve all marketing
brochures and materials sent out by the managed-care plans. The
lack of standard terminology about benefits makes it hard for
government reviewers, not to mention Medicare recipients, to
determine the actual scope of benefits offered or to compare
competing plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the GAO found that even though Medicare
recipients have extensive rights to appeal benefit denials, health
plans often failed to inform them of those rights. In some
instances enrollees were not told the reason for the denial.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials say they are moving toward requiring
standardized benefit information, and will improve oversight of the
appeals process. Despite these problems, Medicare enrollees still
have far more rights against unfair health plan decisions than
people covered by private insurance. But the GAO reports show the
need for stronger enforcement in Medicare, even as Congress debates
whether to extend similar protections to privately insured
individuals.

 McCAIN REJECTS INTERNET PROVIDERS' DEMANDS ON HIGH-SPEED DATA  
 (bl)  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle over access to high-speed Internet
connections moved Tuesday to the Senate Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would seek a study on how
to make the technology more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three hours of testimony from industry leaders,
McCain rejected calls from America Online Inc. chief executive
Stephen Case and others that cable companies be forced immediately
to open their networks to competitors for high-speed data, or
broadband, services. Instead, McCain said he would file a proposal
with bipartisan backing that would require the Commerce Department
and the Federal Communications Commission to ``analyze the facts
and issues on the deployment of broadband technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC decided in February not to conduct a formal study of
cable broadband services but said it would continue to monitor the
evolving marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, McCain said, he wants to make sure rural and
low-income Americans are not left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-speed Internet access is only available to about 2
percent of all America households today,'' said McCain. ``Given the
huge investments necessary to build these networks, there is
growing concern that rural and disadvantaged areas will lag behind
the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement followed a hearing that focused largely on
whether cable companies should have to play by the same rules as
telephone companies and open their network to competitors. Cable
lines offer Internet connections at speeds dozens of times faster
than a standard telephone line. As consumers move their Internet
connections from telephone modems to high-speed services offered by
cable companies through a single provider, companies like America
Online are concerned that their business will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Case said Tuesday: ``Instead of offering consumers choices,
cable is requiring consumers who want a high-speed cable connection
to the Internet to buy the Internet service affiliated with the
local cable company _ even if they have another Internet service
they like and want to keep it. Consumers who want any Internet
service other than cable's will have to pay twice or not get it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Brewer, chief executive of Mindspring Enterprises, an
Internet service provider based in Atlanta, echoed Case, insisting
that the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which forced telephone
companies to open their lines, should be imposed on any industry
offering telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   But James Robbins, chief executive of Cox Communications Inc., a
leading cable company, argued that government intervention would
slow investment by companies like his and only increase the cost of
access for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere suggestion from government that such risky
investments could be subjected to old-fashioned cost-of-service
regulation would have a chilling effect on going-forward
investments and would slow down the roll-out of these new advanced
Internet services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members, for the most part, were careful not to take
sides in the debate, emphasizing repeatedly that their focus was on
what was best for consumers, not for any particular segment of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, however, complained that they had been excluded
from the hearing. McCain, responding to suggestions that they had
been intentionally left out, said he planned to call their leaders
to testify at future hearings.

SLANEY SUING IN DISPUTE OVER A DRUG TEST
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ind.)  (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle between Mary Decker Slaney, the former world champion
middle-distance runner, and international sports officials over her
testosterone level has extended to two continents, with neither
side backing down.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis, Slaney sued
the International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's
world governing body. The suit also named the U.S. Olympic
Committee as a defendant. Jim Coleman, Slaney's lawyer, called the
1996 drug test that Slaney failed ``totally dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the IAAF said it would defend itself in the suit. It
also reaffirmed that its arbitration panel would convene April 24
in Monte Carlo, Monoco, as scheduled, to resume hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Slaney, now 40, was the 1983 world champion at 1,500 and 3,000
meters and once held every American women's outdoor record from 800
through 10,000 meters. During the 1996 U.S. Olympic trials in
Atlanta, she was one of the athletes routinely tested by the U.S.
Olympic Committee for illegal drugs. The report on her test said
she had a testosterone-epitestosterone level higher than the 6:1
ratio that international rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone and epitestosterone are hormones that occur
naturally in the body. Testosterone, which helps build muscle mass
and allows an athlete to train harder and longer, can also be
produced artificially. Slaney said she has not taken artificial
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspended her in 1997, but an appeals panel
reinstated her. Angered international officials then took the case
to arbitration, and that procedure was adjourned last week.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF considers a T-E ratio of 1:1 normal for men and women,
and the 6:1 ratio was adopted to account for natural variations.
Slaney contends that the test is invalid for women, and her suit
asks that it be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the USOC and IAAF know that things other than doping can
cause a woman's T-E ratio to go above 6:1,'' Coleman said. During
the first arbitration hearing, her lawyers presented research from
endocrinologists and statisticians at Duke University that
suggested that the testosterone test is flawed for women in their
late 30s and early 40s who take birth-control pills, as Slaney
does.
</P>
<P>
   In Monte Carlo, Giorgio Reineri, an IAAF spokesman, talked of
jurisdiction, not testosterone levels. He said: ``In whichever
country, civil justice does not have the right to judge sporting
rules of an international federation. The IAAF cannot be under the
jurisdiction of a court in Indiana. IAAF rules are enforced in 209
countries, and the rules are the same for everyone. Otherwise,
there would be confusion and chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said inaction by the IAAF prompted the suit. ``The IAAF
has no other way to detect the use of testosterone,'' the lawyer
said. ``Rather than trying to find a valid way, they are willing to
take the chance that they will prosecute and damage an innocent
athlete.''

FAA ORDERS TIGHTER SAFETY CHECKS AT BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Federal Aviation Administration has told The
Boeing Co. that it cannot deliver any airplanes to customers until
it does more to verify that it has complied with safety changes
mandated by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Boeing, the FAA said it was taking the action
after two planes _ one still in production and the other already in
service _ apparently did not have changes required by FAA
airworthiness directives.
</P>
<P>
   One of those directives was issued after a 20-foot section of
wing flaps tore off a Boeing 767 while it was landing at
Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The other directive was issued after fasteners on 737 rudder
pedals worked lose, resulting in a loss of rudder control.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing official on Tuesdsay questioned the FAA's findings and
said the order will not affect production or delivery of any
airplanes. Scott Peterson, director of quality assurance for
Boeing, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that the company
already verifies that applicable changes called for in
airworthiness directives are incorporated in the company's
passenger jets before they are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Boeing does not believe ``that we have delivered
any airplanes that have not had the airworthiness directive
requirements incorporated.''
</P>
<P>
   An airworthiness directive is an FAA order to aircraft operators
or the manufacturer to take some safety action.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Creedy, FAA spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., said
Tuesday that agency officials could not comment on the Boeing
letter because the matter is under investigation. But she did say
the FAA intends to make sure all Boeing jetliners include
airworthiness safety changes before they are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not fail to verify full compliance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter notifying Boeing that it is under investigation was
sent to Peterson on April 8 by the FAA's James Robinson in the
aircraft certification office in Renton, Wash. Peterson said he did
not receive the letter until two days later, on Saturday, and that
he and others at Boeing are still trying to make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the letter is ``very confusing'' and contains
inaccuracies. He said Robinson was out of the office Tuesday and
could not be reached to clarify what he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is some question whether the letter is
accurate enough to not be retracted and rewritten in an accurate
fashion,'' Peterson said. The Renton FAA office, he said, also has
concerns about the letter, and those concerns had been passed along
to the Washington, D.C., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the FAA on April 6 conducted an
airworthiness inspection of a Boeing 767 in production at the
Everett, Wash., plant to determine if it complied with an
airworthiness directive that was issued in 1998. It did not, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   That directive required airlines and Boeing to make a one-time
inspection of planes in service or in production to check fasteners
that connect pushrods to the rudder pedal assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the airworthiness directive, the FAA said the captain
of a Boeing 737-400 had reported that after his plane landed, the
right rudder pedal moved to its full position when it was pushed,
but failed to return to its normal position when released. The
rudder, however, remained in its neutral position.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation revealed that the pushrod on the right rudder
pedal was not connected to the rudder pedal assembly. The bolt and
nut that holds the pushrod to the assembly had come lose.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, in its directive, said another 737 operator reported
that a pilot felt a loose rudder pedal and a subsequent
investigation revealed that the fastener connecting the pushrod to
the rudder assembly was loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions, if not corrected, could result in potential
loss of rudder control, jamming of the rudder system, uncommanded
movement of the rudder system and consequent reduced
controllability of the airplane,'' the FAA said in its directive.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rudder assembly on some models of the 747, 757, 767
and 777 are similar in design to the 737, the FAA said its
directive would apply to all Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Peterson, the FAA's Robinson said the 767
inspected on the Everett production line on April 6 did not have
the proper fasteners that connect the pushrod to the rudder pedal
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing inspectors had signed off on paperwork that showed
the directive had been met, Robinson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the FAA inspector was confused about the
requirements of the airworthiness directive.
</P>
<P>
   That directive only mandates that Boeing make a one time
inspection of planes in production to verify the nut and bolt are
tight, Peterson said. But after the directive was issued, he said,
Boeing engineers redesigned the nut and bolt to include a cotter
pin, which further ensures it will not come loose.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 plane inspected was line number 751. It was supposed to
have the redesigned fastener, Peterson said. All 767s starting with
number 750 on the production line are to have the new fastener, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the paperwork show the new fastener was installed,
when it was not?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an oversight by the mechanic installing the bolt and
he went ahead and installed what he had always installed,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing was never required as part of the airworthiness
directive to install the redesigned fastener, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also also took issue with the second case cited in Robinson's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wrote that on March 30 the FAA received correspondence
from a 767 operator that shims had not been installed in the flap
assembly as required by an airworthiness directive issued by the
FAA in 1997. The 767 in question was delivered by Boeing on March
2, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the airworthiness directive after a 20-foot
section of wing flaps tore off a Delta 767 while the plane was
landing at Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport. The plane,
with 198 passengers and crew, managed to land safely.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation revealed that bolts holding the flaps to the
wing had failed. The airworthiness directive ordered 767 operators
to inspect the bolts for fatigue. Also, Boeing had to include
what's known as shims in its production 767s. And whenever the
bolts are replaced on planes in service, the shims have to be
added. Shims act like a washer on the flap bolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that this airplane was delivered without the shims
installed as required...,'' Robinson wrote in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson said Boeing has not been able to verify that the
shims were not installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to track down information to see what actually
was installed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wrote that as a result of the two cases cited in his
letter, ``Effective April 8, 1999, the FAA is requiring that all
aircraft deliveries be withheld pending verification'' that
airworthiness directives are incorporated on Boeing's planes.
</P>
<P>
   This new policy will continue until Boeing can demonstrate to
the FAA that it has improved its verfiication procedures, Robinson
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a second letter to Boeing dated April 9, another FAA official
in the Renton office notified Boeing of the additional steps it
must take before the FAA will issue an airworthiness certificate
for Boeing airplanes. Such a certificate is required before a plane
can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This added requirement in the delivery process is necessary
until Boeing provides corrective action ... that is acceptable to
the FAA,'' the sceond letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the additional steps cited by the FAA involve
mostly paperwork and will not delay the delivery of any airplanes.

EDITORIAL: THE POLICE COMMISSIONER'S GAFFES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, April 14:
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Police Commissioner Howard Safir needs to repay
New York City the $3,600 that it cost taxpayers to provide eight
on-duty detectives for his daughter's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Then he needs to either explain more fully or apologize for an
earlier blunder. That was the charge made in a lawsuit against one
Monica Nascimento that she was intoxicated when she ran into Mrs.
Safir's car. The Safirs have already dismissed the lawyer who filed
their original lawsuit. The new attorney said the charge is not
included in the amended suit because it does not ``comport with
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger reality, of course, is that Safir is at a critical
juncture in his public career. He needs to reassure the public that
he is not abusing his office and can provide an example of stable
leadership to a troubled Police Department. The steps outlined
above would be a start. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association has
just given Safir a vote of ``no confidence.'' Some critics and
journalistic commentators are calling for his removal. Those
responses seem extreme to us, for the time being. But it is clear
that Safir has to end the pattern of misjudgments and
public-relations gaffes that have made it difficult for him to deal
with the fallout from the Amadou Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Both Safir and his boss, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, need to take a
placatory rather than a defensive tack. Before he flew to Texas on
Tuesday to talk national Republican strategy, Giuliani was in
reflexive counterpunching mode. He praised the commissioner as ``a
very ethical man,'' ``a terrific police commissioner'' and ``the
most loyal police commissioner I've ever seen.'' The endorsement
came salted with criticism of the commissioner's critics, including
the media and the police officers' union. In particular the mayor
called Tuesday PBA vote ``one of the more treacherous things that's
being done in the name of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, of course, such criticism always comes with
political and labor-management spin. But it cannot be dismissed
entirely, because Safir has been on a run of executive
misjudgments. First there was the all-expense-paid trip to Los
Angeles for the Oscars when he should have been at home stabilizing
the department after the Diallo shooting. Then came the messy
lawsuit against Ms. Nascimento. The use of city detectives to
investigate her looked suspicious, but she had given a fake name at
the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, blaming the dismissed lawyer for what was said
about the woman in a lawsuit bearing his name is not acceptable for
the city's senior police officer. Even in private legal matters he
has a duty to provide a public example and to eschew claims of
naivete or ignorance. Amending the $1.25 million lawsuit to
eliminate unsubstantiated charges that Ms. Nascimento was
intoxicated from drugs or alcohol was a correct if belated step.
</P>
<P>
   As for the use of city detectives for 119 man-hours at his
daughter's wedding, the writing of a reimbursement check should be
only the first step. The commissioner needs people on his staff
with the duty and authority to remind the boss of the lines between
public and private use of police personnel. When there are gray
``security'' areas, as Safir said there were at this celebration,
he should err on the side of paying his own way. After all, he
commands a force of 40,000 officers who are not supposed to take a
free sandwich at the corner coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   Safir has just received a vote of confidence from Giuliani. He
needs to work hard and fast to make sure the rest of the public has
reason to share that confidence.  &QL;

UCONN HOOP STAR FACES MARIJUANA CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Khalid El-Amin, the star point guard who
helped lead the University of Connecticut to the national
basketball championship, was charged with possessing marijuana
Tuesday night after police here had stopped him on suspicion of
running a red light.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton, the team's all-America forward, was riding in
the red Cadillac driven by El-Amin but faces no charges, police
said. Lt. Michael Manzi said El-Amin had a ``nickel bag'' of
marijuana _ a plastic bag containing $5 worth of the drug. Police
said he had ``a very minor amount,'' less than an ounce.
Connecticut officials say that possession of less than four ounces
is a misdemeanor, and that was the charge against El-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very reserved and somber,'' Manzi said of El-Amin's
demeanor as he was arrested on Vine Street at 5:30 Tuesday evening
in the city's North End, a crowded, busy neighborhood where dozens
of curious residents gathered immediately as it became clear who
had been stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered as El-Amin vaulted past reporters into a
cruiser for the trip from a police substation to the city's booking
unit, where he was fingerprinted and photographed. El-Amin was
released at 7:05 p.m. on his written promise to appear in court,
which is standard when such a small amount of marijuana is
involved, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came only four days before UConn is to be honored
with a milelong parade through this city, which has been giddy with
Husky-mania since the team upset top-ranked Duke, 77-74, on March
29 in St. Petersburg, Fla., giving the school its first NCAA men's
basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, a sophomore who is 19 years old, is a crowd favorite,
in part because of his unusually stout stature for a basketball
player; he is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 203 pounds. He is a
business major.
</P>
<P>
   Amid speculation that he might leave the team for the National
Basketball Association, he announced last week that he would return
for his junior year to try to lead the Huskies to back-to-back
titles.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, his high school, Minneapolis North in Minnesota,
retired his jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 21, is widely expected to turn pro instead of playing
for UConn in his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   A wild scene unfolded on Vine Street when two plainclothes
officers from a narcotics task force pulled El-Amin over after they
said he had run a red light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two faces in the car were immediately recognized,'' Manzi
said, allowing himself a small chuckle after a tense evening.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know what led officers to search El-Amin. The
car, which apparently belongs to a friend of El-Amin's, was
searched and then towed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was left on the street to fend for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neighbors were extending offers of rides and to use the phone
and so forth,'' Manzi said.
</P>
<P>
   UConn athletic officials said Tuesday night that they were only
now learning details of the incident and had no immediate comment.
They said they believed El-Amin attended class Tuesday at the
campus in Storrs, about 30 miles northeast of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   A test at police headquarters confirmed that the substance found
on El-Amin was marijuana, Sgt. Daniel Meehan said. He said that
during the 35-minute booking process, El-Amin was ``very cordial,
very cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said El-Amin also got a summons for running a red light.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin was the fiery leader of UConn's championship team, which
often fed off his enthusiasm and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   He was only the third UConn player to score 1,000 points as a
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 14.9 points and 4.1 assists for the past two
seasons, finishing second in scoring to Hamilton by averaging 13.8
points this past season. He led the team in assists with 140.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin was named to the all-Final Four team after scoring 30
points and handing out 10 assists in the semifinal victory over
Ohio State and the championship game over Duke.

CLINTON LAWYERS SAID TO OPPOSE APPEAL OF CONTEMPT CITATION
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The following story, previously eliminated from The New
York Times News Service budget, is now restored) (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's legal advisers are strongly
leaning toward recommending that he not challenge a federal judge's
finding that he was in contempt of court for giving false testimony
in the Paula Jones case, a lawyer who has spoken with members of
the legal team said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that while the team had not presented a final
recommendation to Clinton, several members were inclined to urge
the president not to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton had decided whether to appeal, the lawyer
said, ``My guess is that he has not.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright of federal District Court in Little
Rock, Ark., declared on Monday that the president's testimony had
been ``false, misleading and evasive'' in the sexual-misconduct
suit brought by Mrs. Jones, a onetime Arkansas state clerical
worker who contended that Clinton, then governor, had made a crude
proposition to her in a Little Rock hotel room in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The judge cited Clinton for civil contempt, determining among
other things that he gave misleading answers in a deposition on
Jan. 17, 1998, in Washington. In that session, held before Wright,
the president said he had not had sexual relations with a former
White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Clinton acknowledged that he had had a
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The relationship was at the center
of a monthslong impeachment battle in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Tuesday night through a spokesman that it
had no comment on the thinking of the president or his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the civil contempt finding, Wright ordered Clinton to pay
``any reasonable expenses'' including legal fees incurred by Mrs.
Jones as a result of Clinton's misleading testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The people who are known to be advising Clinton are Robert
Bennett, who represented him throughout the Jones case; David
Kendall, Clinton's personal lawyer; Charles F.C. Ruff, another
White House lawyer, and Bruce Lindsey, a White House lawyer and
close friend.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment evolving among the advisers is said to be that,
having settled the Jones lawsuit last fall and having survived the
impeachment crisis, the president should put the episode behind him
for good by declining to appeal.

UNANIMOUS DECISION: PETTWAY DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO BEAT TRINIDAD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Felix Trinidad defends his IBF welterweight title against
Vincent Pettway next month, it could be an embarrassing mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Even HBO, which is televising the bout at Roberto Clemente
Stadium in San Juan, P.R., on May 29, acknowledged the potential
for a one-sided Trinidad victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time we made the deal for Pettway, I just remembered
that he was a former champion,'' Lou DiBella, HBO's senior vice
president of programming, said. ``We didn't really do the homework.
I have no possible explanation of how he could be the mandatory
after looking at his record.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is exactly what Pettway is: the IBF's mandatory
challenger to Trinidad. And though he has a creditable record of
41-6-1, Pettway also has the credentials to support all the
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he has not fought anyone with a winning record since
1995, and has not fought a welterweight with a winning record since
1991.
</P>
<P>
   In Pettway's last two fights, a journeyman named Gerald Reed
took him the distance both times, and in the first bout between
them Pettway broke his hand and was sidelined for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bottjer, a matchmaker for Cedric Kushner, who saw Pettway
fight Reed on Feb. 6 in Washington, said: ``I think Vincent Pettway
is a shot fighter. I saw him against Benji Singleton, a fighter
from North Carolina with a losing record, and Benji Singleton gave
him life and death. He rocked him a couple of times. He's still got
some skills, but his ability to take a shot has diminished
greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the fight against Trinidad, Bottjer said: ``On paper, he
definitely deserves a shot. But the reality is that Trinidad will
destroy him. They put him on that February card in Washington not
to showcase his skills, but to keep him busy. But his expiration
date expired a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettway believes that HBO is trying to move him out of the way
to keep alive its plans for a possible welterweight championship
showdown between Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't think I'm a worthy opponent, but I'm a
dangerous opponent,'' Pettway, 32, said in a recently from suburban
Baltimore, where he lives and trains. ``People say that I can't
take a punch. But Trinidad doesn't take a punch that well either.
HBO doesn't want me to have a big payday and they know that there's
a chance that I can knock Trinidad out and upset their plans for
him to fight De La Hoya.''
</P>
<P>
   Don King, the promoter for Pettway and Trinidad, said the
network was simply having a knee-jerk reaction to last month's
controversial Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of Holyfield-Lewis, all of a sudden it's like
they've gotten an echo from the heavens, a trembling coming out of
the sky that is saying `Don't do Trinidad-Pettway!''' King said.
``Pettway is a very capable opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pettway-Trinidad bout came about because it was a part of
HBO's negotiations with King for a Trinidad-Pernell Whitaker bout,
which took place Feb. 20 at Madison Square Garden. HBO had to take
Pettway as a mandatory challenger for Trinidad in order to make the
Trinidad-Whitaker fight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Pettway is a nobody as far as they're concerned,'' Mac Lewis,
who has trained Pettway since he was 9 years old, said. ``He's lost
a few fights, sure. A lot of people lose fights. But his record is
still good. Why is everybody trying to pull him back?''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Pettway fought someone with a winning record was
in 1995, when he lost his IBF junior middleweight title to Paul
Vaden by a knockout. The next year, Terry Norris knocked Pettway
out in a 154-pound WBC and IBF title fight.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway then fought Singleton in his first welterweight bout
since 1991. He beat Singleton. Singleton's record at the time was
13-18-1; he is now 20-46-4.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory over Singleton, Pettway moved up to No. 4 in
the IBF rankings at welterweight. Next, Pettway fought Harold
Bennett and knocked him out in the third round. It was Bennett's
fourth loss in five fights, three by knockout. That moved Pettway
up to No. 2. In 1997, Pettway moved up as the No. 1 contender
without lifting a glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was active, fighting guys,'' Pettway said. ``That's why I
moved up. Guys in front of me weren't busy, so I moved up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettway had been No. 2 behind Patrick Charpentier. But when
Charpentier announced he was going to challenge De La Hoya for the
WBC welterweight title he was dropped from the IBF's No. 1
contender spot to No. 5. Pettway moved up to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 13, 1997, Pettway fought Reed, who was 37 years old and
had a 15-19-3 record at the time. Reed took Pettway the distance
and Pettway broke his hand in the fight and had to have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerald Reed was a crafty fighter,'' Pettway said. ``People say
Vincent Pettway must not have been right, because he couldn't knock
this guy out. But the guy was a survivor. I hurt him a couple of
times, but he knew how to hold and head-butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettway was inactive all of 1998 after the surgery. That medical
suspension did not hurt his ranking. He remained No. 1 in the IBF
On Feb. 6, Pettway returned. He wound up fighting Reed again,
because his opponent backed out of the fight at the last minute and
was replaced by Reed, who was a year older and whose record was
15-23-3. Again, Reed took Pettway the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Pettway has remained atop the IBF rankings at welterweight _
ahead of other contenders like Vernon Forrest, Pernell Whitaker and
Ike Quartey.

MLICKI COULD BE ODD MAN OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna could rejoin the
Los Angeles Dodgers by the end of the weekend, which has caused
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson to run through a number of scenarios
on what to do with his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There are various paths the Dodgers could take, but the most
likely conclusion always seems to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know there's a lot of interest in (Dave) Mlicki,''
Johnson said before Tuesday's game with Arizona at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was referring to constant trade speculation that has
engulfed Mlicki since Kevin Brown signed his $105 million
free-agent contract in December. It effectively bumped Mlicki out
of the starting rotation and into the Dodgers' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would help the organization, not only today but down the
line, we would have to do that,'' Johnson said. ``I'd like to keep
him, but maybe in the best interest of the club and Mlicki, it's
something that has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna pitched one inning in his second rehab stint with Single-A
San Bernardino on Tuesday and in one inning walked one batter and
struck one out. He threw 23 pitches. Johnson said he wanted Osuna
to pitch two or three innings, but it was scaled back to one on the
advice of pitching coach Charlie Hough.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said it was possible the
Dodgers could send Osuna to Triple-A Albuquerque instead of
activating him, but that was just one of a few options. Malone
wouldn't comment on the trade interest in Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is going with 12 pitchers and sending one of
three catchers to the minors. The likely candidate is Rick Wilkins,
who has one at-bat this season and is clearly the backup to Paul
LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the Dodgers' new regime not being familiar with
Osuna's ability during a season, though Johnson said he'd be
inclined to use Osuna in a dual set-up role with Alan Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know him,'' Johnson said of Osuna. ``I heard what
he's like and I've seen him throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is in search of a second right-handed set-up man in the
bullpen because Mel Rojas is struggling. Rojas, who gave up five
runs in one inning Monday, has a 15.75 ERA in four outings.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth update: In a week or so the Dodgers will have
another roster decision to make. Johnson said he's eyeing April 23,
the beginning of a three-game series with the St. Louis Cardinals,
as a possible return date for Todd Hollandsworth, on the disabled
list with a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Hollandsworth would be sent to the minors for a
rehab stint before joining the Dodgers. That could happen when L.A.
returns from San Diego on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to hit the ball and show that he can run
and perform in a game,'' Malone said. ``We're not going to rush
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Runnin' the bases: The Diamondbacks stole two bases in the first
three innings against the Dodgers, meaning the only would-be base
stealer the Dodgers have caught this season came when Carlos Perez
picked off Colorado's Neifi Perez. Opponents are 10 for 11 against
the Dodgers and have been successful on all nine attempts against
Todd Hundley's reconstructed right elbow.... The Dodgers entered
Tuesday 14 for 75 (.187) with runners in scoring position, but
Johnson said not to fret. ``There hasn't been enough chances for a
reading to be taken,'' Johnson said.
