<HEADLINE> No Foreign Intervention: Wahid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid reaffirmed here Wednesday that Indonesia will not take any
form of foreign interventions in its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the annual session of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), Wahid also said that the government will not
tolerate any separatist movements in the country, saying that it
will take necessary measures to prevent disintegration threats
from spreading.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made the statement when he was explaining the country's
foreign policy particularly in connection with the ongoing
disintegration threats which have been faced by the government.
</P>
<P>
Following East Timor which was separated from the unitary state
of Indonesia in 1999, Aceh and Irian Jaya provinces have been
demanding an independence from the central government.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said, "The government will not tolerate and make a
compromise with any kind of separatist movements. The totality of
the unitary state of Indonesia is a mandate which is carried out
by the government and I will safeguard it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's statement seems to be aimed at answering the Assembly's
hesitancy that the incumbent President will let some provinces to
separate from the unitary state of Indonesia, following the
protracted conflicts in Aceh province and the rising demand for an
independence in the easternmost province of Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the government's commitment to soon
implement the special autonomy bill in Aceh and Irian Jaya
provinces in a bid to reduce disintegration threats there, citing
that the implementation of the bill will be carried out within
this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy Recovers From Crisis: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid insisted again here Wednesday that Indonesia's economy has
significantly moved toward recovery after almost three years of
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made the statement when addressing a plenary session of
the annual meeting of the People Consultative Assembly (MPR)
answering the factions in the Assembly which the day before gave
critical opinions on the implementation of the State Policy
Guidelines (GBHN).
</P>
<P>
"It is too bad that the president in fact has exacerbated the
crisis, instead of overcoming it. The president has not yet been
successful to recover the people's hope," spokesman of the Reform
Party faction Nurdiati Akmal said.
</P>
<P>
But, the President said, "the economic situation has showed
significant changes," citing that the country's economic growth in
the first quarter of 2000 was 4.13 percent.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the value of foreign investment during the
first half of this year increased by 25.7 percent against the same
period last year. But he admitted that the value of domestic
investment in the same period was down by 32.9 percent compared to
the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Privatize Another 28 Companies by September 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has planned to privatize 28
more companies in a year up to September 2001, Minister of State
for Public Business Sector Mokhtar Khatab said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial economic group met in the day under Prime
Minister Atef Obeid to discuss the program, which will be further
reviewed next week during a meeting chaired by President Hosni
Mubarak, Khatab was quoted as saying by the official Middle East
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The government is close to offering for sale all or partial
shares of 14 of the 28 companies and carrying out preparations for
the rest 14 companies, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Khatab said that according to preliminary evaluation, the
companies' assets are estimated at 1.8 billion Egyptian pounds
(over 520 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government is also considering selling part of the
shares of companies in the sector of electricity,
telecommunications, oil and trade through the stock markets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that this measure will further attract
investors to Egypt's stock markets as these companies are
successful with secure and stable revenues and their shares are of
high value.
</P>
<P>
Egypt began the privatization program in 1995 with 314 companies
chosen for the process. So far, 141 of the companies have been
fully or partially privatized, accomplishing 45 percent of the
targets.

<HEADLINE> UAE Colleges Facing Stream of High School Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented number of high
school graduates are applying for places in higher education
institutions of the United Arab Emirates, according to a report of
the official news agency WAM on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have the highest number of higher education admissions per
capita anywhere in the world, of which we are proud," the report
quoted Nahyan Bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, minister of higher education
and scientific research as saying.
</P>
<P>
"More than 90 percent of those leaving high school are applying
to the Higher Colleges of Technology, Zayed University and the UAE
University at Al Ain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed a record of 10,703 students, including
expatriates students, have applied for higher education places, of
whom 9,794 have been declared academically eligible, while 95
percent of UAE boys and 73 percent of girls are applying for a
place in higher education.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that a suitable place on collegiate courses,
which will start next month, could hardly be offered for every
candidate.
</P>
<P>
However, it is regarded as a great achievement that the UAE has
the world's highest percentage of higher education proposers,
although the continuing increase in the demand for higher education
has created great pressures on the physical and human resources of
the UAE's higher education institutions, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Barak Announces Another Cabinet Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday appointed senior legislator Roni Milo, a member of
the ruling partner Center Party, as acting health minister,
officials in Barak' office announced.
</P>
<P>
Milo, a former Likud member, was nominated after his party
colleague Dan Meridor refused to accept the portfolio, officials
revealed.
</P>
<P>
After consulting with Center Party leader Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
who currently holds both the Tourism and Transport portfolio, Barak
decided to award the ministerial post to Milo.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel's Channel 2 television, Milo denied
that he was negotiating with the leading opposition Likud about the
conditions for his rejoining the party.
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old Milo had acted as environment minister, labor
and social affairs minister, and public security minister in
previous governments in his political life.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was part of a cabinet reshuffle, which began
last Sunday with Barak's nomination of four ministers to hold
concurrent posts.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer now took up the
post of construction and housing minister, while Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon got an additional portfolio of
interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin would also head the Religious
Affairs Ministry, and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat would act as
national infrastructure minister concurrently.
</P>
<P>
Barak's Labor party Secretary-General Ra'anan Cohen was also
appointed as acting labor and social affairs minister on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami was
named as acting foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The Barak cabinet had been reduced from 23 ministers to 12
ministers in the past few months following a series of cabinet
crisis over the peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's Basic Law, Barak has no right to appoint new
minister to his cabinet without Knesset (Parliament) approval,
which had begun its summer recess on August 2 and will not
reconvene until the end of October.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister is empower to to appoint acting
ministers with a three-month temporary term or order ministers to
hold concurrent jobs.
</P>
<P>
Barak himself still holds three ministerial posts, including the
Education portfolio. He is hoping to fill the vacuum when he
finishes coalition talks with Shas, Meretz, or even the major
opposition Likud.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Never Give up Right to Jerusalem: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) stressed on Thursday that
no people and no country can force the Palestinian people to give
up their right to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian television, Qurei underlined
that the Palestinian people's claim to the holy city remains firm,
saying that "there is no force on earth" that can persuade them to
give in.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of Jerusalem is a bleeding wound in the body
of every Palestinian and Arab that will only heal when the holy Al-
Qods (Jerusalem) is restored.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War,
annexed it later and declared it its "eternal and undivided
capital." But under relevant United Nations Security Council
resolutions, East Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian
territories. The Palestinians want this part as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Qurei spoke highly of the firm support of the Egyptian
government and President Hosni Mubarak for the Palestinian people
in their struggles to restore their legitimate rights to Jerusalem,
self-determination and establishment of their own independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stressed repeatedly that it will never press the
Palestinians into making concessions on Jerusalem whatever pressure
is brought on it. It also says that it will recognize the
Palestinian state whenever it is declared.

<HEADLINE> Chile Denies Political Change of Pinochet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chile's government discarded
Thursday political change in the country following stripping of
impunity of former military head Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Chile is enjoying an "extraordinary" calm as both supporters
and opponents of  Pinochet await his eventual trial, Interior
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it was upholding
a lower court ruling lifting the immunity the former dictator
enjoyed as Senator for Life, a title he took upon leaving office,
some 4,000 demonstrators celebrated in the streets of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Concerning medical exams of Pinochet, Insulza said that
according to law, proceedings are necessary before a possible
trial of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Regarding possible repercussion of Pinochet's stripping of
immunity in the delivery of reports about the disappeared detained,
the minister expressed trust that military personnel will fulfill
their commitment for dialog.
</P>
<P>
Without his immunity, Pinochet faces trial on charges that he
ordered the "Caravan of Death," a group of military leaders that
traveled through the country, killing 74 political opponents in
October 1973, only a month after Pinochet began his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, Chile's Supreme Court rejected the retired general
's appeal and ratified the stripping of immunity sentence emitted
on May 23 in first instance by Santiago's Appeals' Court.

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian President Calls for Struggle Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani here on Thursday urged Palestinians to resort to
struggle against Israel to get back their lands and basic rights.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the Palestinian people have no option but to adopt
extensive struggle against the occupiers to get back their basic
rights and lands, Rafsanjani told visiting Palestine leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently chairing Iran's advisory State Expediency
Council, urged Palestinians to follow the path of the Lebanese
Hezbollah. The Lebanese guerrilla's resistance movement helped end
Israel's 22-year occupation in south Lebanon in May.
</P>
<P>
Experience shows that the "Zionists" do not believe in dialog as
a way to administer justice for the Palestinians, he said,
stressing that political discussions without a serious struggle and
Jihad (holy war) would be useless. Iran refused to recognize
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The former president reiterated that the issues of Palestine and
Jerusalem belong to the whole Muslim world, and the issues could
not be solved until all Palestinian refugees return home and decide
their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Arafat praised Iran's "principled and wise" positions toward the
Palestinian issue, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Rafsanjani on the outcome of last month's fruitless
Camp David talks and the future plans of the Palestinian National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Islamic countries will continue to support the
Palestinian people in gaining their inalienable rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, who arrived here Thursday, has been
making an extensive foreign tour to seek support following the
failure of the U.S.-sponsored Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, Arafat also held talks with Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami, who is currently the rotating chairman of the 56-member
Organization of the Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Watch Exports Reach Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's exports of watches
and movements in value reached a record level of 4.72 billion
Swiss francs (about 2.76 billion U.S. dollars) in the first six
months, 17.2 percent more than last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
In a press release Thursday, the Federation of the Swiss Watch
Industry in the Swiss city of Biel said that the Swiss watch
industry is currently experiencing a period of great prosperity
with strong and uninterrupted expansion since August 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The watchmaking branch has derived the full benefit from a
particularly favorable world economic context and a Swiss franc
which remains attractively priced in relation to dollar," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the encouraging figures, the export volume of
complete watches has continued to fall. Manufacturers exported 14.
6 million in the past six months -- three percent less than in the
same period of 1999. In contrast, the value of these watches was
16.7 percent higher at 4.24 billion francs (about 2.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The three top export markets are the United States, Hong Kong,
and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Consumers More Confident About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in
Switzerland is on the rise and is reaching levels not seen since
before the recession at the beginning of the 1990s, according to a
new survey made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index of consumer confidence is at its strongest for 10
years, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs said
following its recent survey of 1,100 households. In July it
reached 21 points, up from an already high level of 19 in April.
Households are also optimistic about their future prosperity,
</P>
<P>
Only 15 months ago, the reference index was hovering around the
zero mark, according to the secretariat. It attributed the more
optimistic attitudes to what it said was a "remarkable improvement
" in how households view employment security. That index
registered a positive figure (5 points) for the first time in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretariat noted that in July households were
more reluctant to make large outlays for such things as cars,
furniture and electric appliances than they were three months ago.
Households were concerned about rising prices. There are also
fears that inflation will increase.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Considers Special Court for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday began closed-door consultations to consider the
establishment of a special court for Sierra Leone in order to try
those who are held responsible for the serious violation of Sierra
Leonean law and international humanitarian law in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
The special court was proposed by the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations in a draft resolution, which has been discussed by
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, if adopted, will pave the way for the
establishment of the special court to try rebel leader Foday
Sankoh and his followers, who launched war and attacked U.N.
peacekeepers in May, for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is expected to ask U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to enter into an agreement with the Sierra Leonean
Government and an alternative host state to create an independent
special court for Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led by Sankoh,
violated a peace accord signed by rebels and the government in
Togo in July last year by taking more than 500 U.N. soldiers
hostage and surrounding 223 others for more than two months in the
eastern part of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is currently in the government custody in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said that RUF still
poses a threat to the peace process in the war-torn African nation.
</P>
<P>
In response, the 15-nation body adopted a resolution on Friday,
giving the U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone a tougher mandate to
deal with rebels violating the peace accord. The U.N. peacekeeping
force, known as UNAMSIL, was sent into Sierra Leone to monitor the

<HEADLINE> French Investigators Say Metal Strip on Runway Could Be Cause of Concorde Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- French investigators said on
Thursday that the metal strip found on the runway of the Air
France Concorde aircraft which crashed on July 25 could have
caused the explosion of a tire of the undercarriage of the plane
and in consequence the leakage of oil from the reservoirs and the
outbreak of a fire.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Accident-Investigation (BEA) said in a communique
that the hypothesis is yet to be confirmed by experts and that the
origin of the metal strip is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
``The burst of the tire could have thrown, at a moment when the
plane was running with a high speed (about 300 kilometers an hour),
the big pieces (of the tire) with great strength,'' said BEA.
</P>
<P>
``According to a process which remains to be confirmed, damages
were caused rapidly in one or several oil reservoirs on the left
wing of the plane, with as consequence a very big leakage of oil
and a fire,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
Video tapes show that the rear part of the Concorde plane
caught fire at the same time as it was taking off from the runway.
</P>
<P>
But investigators so far cannot establish links between an
explosion of a tire of the undercarriage with another key fact in
the crash -- the breakdown of an engine on the left wing.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and thirteen people were killed in the Concorde
crash on July 25 near the Charles-de-Gaulle-Roissy airport north
of Paris.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Appoints New Judges, Prosecutors in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, known as UNMIK, has
appointed an additional 139 judges and prosecutors and 309 lay-
judges in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, a U.N. spokesman said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, told a press
conference that with the Thursday appointments, the number of
local judges and prosecutors in Kosovo is now 405.
</P>
<P>
"Several members of minority communities have been also
appointed yesterday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kouchner, who heads UNMIK, made the appointments
taking into consideration of the recommendations presented to him
by the Advisory Judicial Commission about a month ago. Kouchner
said he had consulted widely in order to make a proper assessment
of the need for professional, qualified judges and prosecutors to
assist in reestablishing the rule of law in Kosovo, which suffered
a unilateral 78-day air strikes by NATO last year.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner said that "these appointments were part of UNMIK's
continuous effort to improve the functioning of the judicial
system in Kosovo," a UNMIK press release said.
</P>
<P>
The new appointments will be valid until the end of this year,
due to the fact that the budget for next year has not been
authorized and U.N. rules do not allow appointments to be made
without an authorized budget to support them.
</P>
<P>
The first swear-in ceremony of the judges took place Thursday
at Gnjilane, a town in Kosovo, to be followed by Mitrovica Friday,
Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, on August 15.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK was sent into the Yugoslav province in accordance with a
U.N. Security Council resolution, adopted on June 10 last year, to
engage in peacekeeping, post-war construction and administration.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demands all Member States, including UNMIK,
should fully respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A humanitarian group based in
Paris said on Thursday that an alarming famine is threatening tens
of thousands of refugees fleeing the war in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Action Contre la Faim (ACF) said that some 34,000 refugees,
most of them women and children, are fleeing "with an alarming
nutrition situation" into Bentiu and Rob Kona, two towns in the
region of El Ouahda 800 kilometers south of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
These people are gathering in a perimeter of 100 kilometers
around Bentiu. Their villages were looted and burnt by soldiers
and rebels, said ACF.
</P>
<P>
"In these two cities the food provision is not sufficient and
the situation can only get worse," said the ACF.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of the children under five years old among the
refugees are suffering from mal-nutrition, it said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has suspended flying humanitarian cargoes to
the region since Tuesday because of bombings on civilians and
humanitarian personnel by the two sides of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Southern Sudan has been under a chronicle war since 1983
between Muslim-dominated government forces and Christian rebels of
the Sudanese People's Liberation Army led by John Garang.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Czech GDP Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fond (
IMF) on Thursday said in a statement that the economic recovery of
the Czech Republic is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the IMF estimated Czech gross domestic product
(GDP) grow 2.0 to 2.5 percent in 2000, which is much higher than
the 1.5-2.0 percent it predicted in May. The IMF also forecasted
the Czech economy reach 3.0-3.5 percent in 2001. The upward
adjustment is largely based on the strengthening demand in the
European Union, a sharp increase in privatization and foreign
direct investment, as well as low inflation, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF warned "renewed enterprise restructuring is
expected to lead to a further rise in the unemployment rate to 10.
5 percent by end-2000 and 11 percent by end-2001." It also
expected the current-account deficit of the country rose to 3.5
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the economic recovery, the IMF recommended the
Czech government to accelerate reforms in the fields of banking,
pension and health care systems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace, the environmental
group, said on Thursday that it was setting up a special unit to
spur the creation and utilization of "green technology".
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the unit is to influence the development of
technology toward sustainable solutions and promote their entry
into the market," said Greenpeace Executive Director Thilo Bode in
a statement received here.
</P>
<P>
In one effort, Greenpeace has developed what is now called "
Greenfreeze" which uses hydrocarbon gases as the refrigerant
agents in place of hydrochlorofluorocarbons or hydrofluorocarbons.
</P>
<P>
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons have been
identified by scientists as the cause to the depletion of the
ozone layer and hence global warming.
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam-based environmental group said that it would
build on its previous efforts to further the development of green
technology or environmentally-friendly technology.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said that it had convinced Olympic sponsor Coca Cola
to replace its refrigerants with the Greenfreeze technology. The
group has also devised the environmental guidelines for the
forthcoming Olympic Games to be held in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has chosen Harry Lehmann, former director of a
German environmental research institute, to head the new unit that
aims at promoting green technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The exports of Belgium
increased significantly in May this year as against the same month
last year, bank statistics said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Belgian exports rose from 517 billion Belgian francs (11.7
billion U.S. dollars) to 711 billion francs (16.1 billion dollars)
in May, according to the statistics of the Belgian National Bank.
</P>
<P>
Imports, however, were also on the rise to reach 652 billion
francs (14.8 billion dollars) in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Economists of the country warned that despite the trade surplus
of 59 billion francs (1.3 billion dollars) the rise in exports was
only a temporary economic tranquility.
</P>
<P>
Though the depreciation of the single currency of euro somewhat
facilitated the country's exports, economists noted, international
competition and other factors would have reduced Belgium's trade
surplus in the ensuing month.
</P>
<P>
They predicted a much less growth in exports in June.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes French Unfreezing of Embassy Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday welcomed a
Paris court's decision to unfreeze the Russian Embassy's bank
accounts in France.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "highly appreciates the just decision" made by the court
earlier Thursday that the bank accounts of Russian representations
in France be unfrozen, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
This was the only possible way for justice to prevail, albeit
belatedly, the statement said. The Ministry regards "the issue as
finally resolved and removed from the agenda of Russian-French
relations."
</P>
<P>
The bank accounts were seized last May after French courts
responded to lawsuits filed by a Swiss businessmen that says the
Russian government owes his company 63 million U.S. dollars in
debts.
</P>
<P>
Aside from those of the Russian Embassy, bank accounts of some
70 other state-connected Russian entities operating in France were
frozen. It was not immediately clear whether accounts of those
entities will also be unfrozen under Thursday's ruling by the
Paris court.
</P>
<P>
In mid July, a Russian sailing boat, while in the French port
of Brest to attend a boat festival, was seized for the same reason.
The four-mast Sedov, which has been used by the federal fisheries
authorities for training, was later released.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry, in its Thursday statement,
thanked the French authorities and the media for their support "
that were able to bring Russia's concerns to [the attention of]
French society."
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful to all the Frenchwomen and Frenchmen who
expressed sympathy and sincere support for us both in the case of
the sailing vessel Sedov and the case of the accounts," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the court ruling refers to the immunity
of Russian diplomatic offices in France, which applies to their
bank accounts. In effect, the court fully upheld the Russian
position," it added.

<HEADLINE> Russian Diplomat Urges Leniency on East German Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Thursday called on German courts to show humanity in trying those
former East German leaders held responsible for bygone times.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alexander Yakovenko,
was related to the pending trial of Manfred Gerlach, East Germany'
s last president, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest trial in a series of judicial persecutions
of former German Democratic Republic leaders that has been
underway since the unification of Germany, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Gerlach, a staunch anti-Nazi fighter who was
persecuted by the Nazi authorities, has been put off because of
his poor health but could be re-started at any time, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "many German citizens worried about Gerlach'
s fate and the continuous criminal persecution and political and
social discrimination against former East German leaders, civil
servants, servicemen and security personnel."
</P>
<P>
They have been sending letters to the Russian authorities,
saying these people have made a significant contribution to post-
war reconciliation between Russians and Germans that "in the final
analysis, promoted the peaceful and democratic unification of
Germany (in 1990)," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Even though what German courts do is Germany's internal affair,
there is a moral and ethic aspect to the problem," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The German authorities should not be guided by "the ideological
criteria of the period of confrontation" when dealing with
problems inherited from the country's history," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists at CERN Use Anti-Matter to Probe Origins of Universe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the Geneva-based
CERN physics laboratory are planning to create particles of anti-
matter, which they say could shed new light on the origins of the
Universe and the Big Bang theory.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have been struggling for years to understand why
matter exists at all. In theory, the Big Bang should have created
equal amounts of matter and anti-matter, and they should have
wiped each other out.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that resolving this paradox is one of the central
challenges of modern physics, CERN spokesman Neil Calder said
Thursday, "The reaction between matter and anti-matter should, by
all known laws of physics, have led to the complete destruction of
the Universe, since, when the forces of matter and anti-matter
clash, they destroy each other."
</P>
<P>
The scientists at CERN have developed a device, called the "
Antiproton Decelerator", which will allow them to make and study
particles of anti-hydrogen. It would be the first time that anti-
atoms have been slowed down enough to be "caught" and studied.
</P>
<P>
Anti-matter is currently understood to be the mirror image of
conventional matter. Scientists believe that every sub-atomic
particle in the Universe has an identical anti-matter equivalent,
but one, which has its electrical or magnetic properties, reversed.
If a particle of matter were to meet its anti-matter equivalent,
so the theory goes, they would annihilate each other in a furious
burst of energy.
</P>
<P>
With funding from 20 European states, the United States and
other nations, it is hoped this 15-million-dollar project will
cast light on a monumental mystery that has perplexed the
scientific community for over 70 years.
</P>
<P>
The theory that matter and anti-matter coexist first came to
light in 1927 when a British mathematician and theoretical
physicist, Paul Dirac, formulated an equation that obeyed both
quantum mechanics and the laws of special relativity. He put
forward the theory that for every negatively charged electron
within an atom, there was a positively charged anti-electron, or
positron. Dirac had discovered the concept of anti-matter.
</P>
<P>
Modern techniques of "catching" anti-matter are about five
years old, but what's new about the Antiproton Decelerator is that
it can successfully separate matter from anti-matter, keeping the
two apart so that they do not annihilate each other.
</P>
<P>
The device accomplishes this feat by keeping the "unruly" anti-
particles in a vacuum, and cooling them sufficiently so that they
are inert enough to study. Anti-electrons are then added to the
anti-particles, which then give birth to anti-hydrogen atoms. This
allows scientists to investigate the newly created particles of
anti-matter.

OTTAWA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian researcher will be
able to provide a record-breaking super shoe for top sprinters at
the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Canadian media said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Benno Nigg, director of the University of Calgary's Human
Performance Laboratory, said the new shoes he has developed will
help reduce a runner's energy loss by an average 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result could be translated into an estimated 0.17 seconds
in a 100-meter sprint.
</P>
<P>
"I have bets going that in Sydney in the 100, 200 and 400
meters, world records will be broken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigg has been working on new technologies to shave off
fractions of seconds from the times of top sprinters.
</P>

He believed runners waste needless energy whenever their
metatarsal joints bend and eliminating their ability to do so
improves their efficiency.

Saad Eddin Ibrahim, director of the Ibn Khaldoun Research Center
for Social Development of the American University in Cairo, was set
free on bail of 10,000 Egyptian pounds (2,900 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Four of the other 11 suspects in the case were also let go on
bail. Nadia Mohamad Abdel Nour, the Sudanese accountant of the
center, was freed on bail of 5,000 pounds (1,450 dollars). Three
others were released on bail ranging between 1,000 pounds (290
dollars) and 500 pounds (145 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who holds duel Egyptian-U.S. citizenship, was detained
on June 30 on charges of receiving foreign funds without prior
permission from the authorities, producing films which "defamed
Egypt and other Arab states" and forging voting cards.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that it has ended the first stage of
investigations into the case, which required their detention,
hearings of witnesses and confronting the accused with documented
evidence, the official Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
After this stage, it was no longer necessary to keep them in
custody, especially as the defendants are banned from leaving the
country pending the finalization of the investigations, it said.

The president said Kwik would temporarily continue to carry out
his duties as minister, with reduced decision-making
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Kwik said he had submitted his resignation to
allow the president a free hand to carry out a promised cabinet
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
"This (resignation letter) demonstrates his sportsmanship to
allow me to restructure a new cabinet," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Although the resignation was accepted, Wahid said, Kwik would
be expected to continue in his post until the new cabinet is
formed.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kwik will still have to carry out his tasks, but will not
make strategic decisions, in accordance with his letter. Mr. Kwik
is a good, honest and clean individual and I am satisfied to have
worked with him. Whether or not I will place him in the new
cabinet, it is my prerogative right which I will not discuss with
anyone because it will cause a mixed reaction," he added.

<HEADLINE> 4th Lead: 12 Killed in Kashmir Car Bomb Blast EDS-Updates with toll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people, including
10 policemen and a journalist were killed and nearly 40 others,
including six journalists, injured in a massive car-bomb blast
that rocked Srinagar city in Kashmir within 48 hours of withdrawal
of ceasefire by Hizbul Mujahideen, an official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witnesses put the death toll at 14, including 12
securitymen in the blast.
</P>

The explosion which followed a low-intensity blast at around 12:
15 p.m. was so powerful that its bang was heard throughout the
city, police said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Gives Green Light to Sierra Leone Diamond Certifying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean
Government won approval from the U.N. Security Council late
Wednesday to start certifying diamonds, clearing the way for the
west African country to legally export its precious gems, U.N.
officials said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In early July, the 15-nation Council banned the purchases of
Sierra Leone diamonds without a government certificate in a bid to
choke the financial sources of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) to drag on the nation's nine-year civil war, which has
been largely financed by rebel sale of illicit gems, also called "
blood diamonds."
</P>
<P>
During a two-day U.N. hearing last week, the Sierra Leonean
Government outlined new regime for the legal mining and export of
diamonds, and the Security Council Sanctions Committee approved it
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sanctions Committee is mandated to monitor sanctions
against rebels in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a major step," said Bangladesh's U.N.
Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, who is the chairman of the Sanctions
Committee. "It will really bring in hopefully some legitimate
earnings into the coffers of the Sierra Leonean Government, which
hopefully will be used for the well-being of the people."
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels, who launched the war in May, still control
some 90 percent of diamond mining areas in Sierra Leone. The ban
on rebel diamond exports is part of a Security Council campaign to
help the government reassert its control throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury said that the Sanctions Committee wants the new
certification program to start operating as soon as possible
although the Sierra Leonean Government said it could take 90 days,
and the committee will send the government letters asking it to
speed up the process and to report back in 90 days on the system's
effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps Plans to Visit Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The reported plans to visit
the Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese cabinet members on August 15
constitute a serious insult to the peoples of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and other Asian countries, the
Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in a commentary on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The planned visit would be an anachronistic action which would
arouse concerns among the international community over the
militarization of Japan, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Eight ministers of the Japanese cabinet including the Minister
of Justice and the Director General of the Defense Agency have
reportedly planned to make an official visit to the Yasukuni
Shrine on August 15, the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
The Yasukuni Shrine is symbolic of Japanese militarism and top-
class war criminals including Tojo who inflicted unbearable
disasters upon humankind are entombed there, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Whether one visits it or not can be a touchstone showing the
attitude of the Japanese politicians toward the past war of
aggression, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese cabinet members, ignoring the political and social
consequences the visit would cause, have decided to make an
official visit to the shrine, which "cannot be construed otherwise
than a move to float the militarist trend in the Japanese society
and instill a reactionary view on history into the people," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"Militarism is a trend whose inhuman nature has already been
proved and rejected by history," it said.
</P>
<P>
The revival of militarism means self-destruction to Japan, the
commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Land Investments Up, Apartments Purchase Down in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Increasing investments in land
and gradually declining sales of apartments have been indicated as
major trends on the Romanian real estate market, according to
local daily Curentul.
</P>
<P>
Purchases of urban and extraneous land in commercial,
residential or industrial zones have been the most frequent
investments in real estate, a trend manifesting across Romania and
indicating expectation of a better time, when land owners can sell
out for higher prices.
</P>
<P>
Curentul said in a Thursday report that in Cluj-Napoca in
northwestern Romania, land demand this year was up by 40 percent
over 1999, while in Timisoara in western Romania, a square meter
of land sells for up to 120 German marks (60 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sales of apartments have shrunk in the interim, in spite of
lowering prices. Real estate agents in Bucharest say that the
average price for an apartment this summer has dropped by 1,000-4,
000 U.S. dollars from the same time of 1999, but is still too high
for the people's financial resources.
</P>
<P>
One apartment in Bucharest can be bought for 8,000-135,000 U.S.
dollars, varying in accordance with the difference of locations.

<HEADLINE> Firestone Canada to Unveil Decision on Massive Tire Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Firestone Canada will unveil its
decision on the massive recall of more than 6.5 million
Bridgestone/Firestone tires by the weekend, the company announced
late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Details on how the recall will proceed and what the tire owners
should do will be made known by Friday, said Firestone Canada
spokesman Jerry Priddle.
</P>
<P>
The recall involves more than 283,000 Ford vehicles alone in
Canada, while General Motors, Mazda, Toyota and Nissan vehicles
have also been sold with the tires.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John Arnone, manager of public affairs at Ford of
Canada, declared on evidence of problems has been found in Canada
with Firestone tires, which are standard on some Ford vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"There are no reported cases of accidents or injuries caused by
tire tread separation on Ford Explorers or other Ford vehicles
carrying these types of tires in Canada to date," he said.
</P>
<P>
The on-going tire recall came after the U.S. National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration received 170 complaints about the
tires, which were somewhat linked to accidents leading to 46
deaths and 80 injuries.
</P>
<P>
The complaints allege the tires peel off their casings
sometimes while the vehicles are travelling at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
The problem is also attributed beyond manufacture to such
factors as hot weather, driving at speeds of more than 160 km/h,
under-inflated tires and poor tire replacement.

<HEADLINE> Thai Boxers Aims at Three Golds in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Although Thailand's Olympic
boxing team returned without a single gold medal from a tune-up
tournament in its native country, the team's Cuban coach Juan
Fontanil still believes the Thai boxers will capture three gold
medals in the upcoming Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have one and half month to prepare before the Games. If
everything goes as planned, I am certain that Thailand will get
three golds," he said in a recent interview with local media.
</P>
<P>
He said that the boxers' Cuban experience will benefit them in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Three young boxers -- Parkpoom Changphonak, Pongsit Wiangwiset
and Pornchai Thongburan have showed in the Giraldo Cardova Cardin
Cup in Cuba that they have been improved vastly, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that they still need more practice to capture
gold in Sydney as they will be facing a lot of world-class boxers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he conceded that Thailand's gold chance in
the light flyweight category is slim because Suban Pannone, touted
as the Kingdom's biggest hope, was off form in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He also said that 1996 Olympic gold medalist Somluck Khamsing,
who bagged a bronze medal in Cuba, is not in good shape.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Somluck recaptures the gold depends entirely on
himself. If he trains attentively, I believe he will make history,
" said Fontanil.
</P>
<P>
Another hope, Wijarn Polrit who captured a silver medal after
losing to a host boxer in the final in Cuba, had a psychological
problem, said the coach.
</P>
<P>
However, both Wijarn and Somluck said earlier that they are
still confident despite the results in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Any Thai boxer who captures the gold in Sydney will become a
wealthy man. Besides the Sports Authority of Thailand's big bonus,
any successful boxer will pick up 10 million baht (250,000 U.S.
dollars), offered jointly by the Thai Rath daily newspaper, Thai
Airways, the Communication Authority of Thailand and six private
companies.

<HEADLINE> Supervision Work to Be Boosted in Anti-Corruption Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Party discipline inspection and
supervision organs at all levels are expected to play their role
to the full in the ongoing anti-corruption drive and in
facilitating the building of honest government, said a senior
Party official.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day national working conference on Party discipline
inspection and supervision which closed here today, Cao Qingze,
deputy executive secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, called for enhanced
efforts to battle corruption.
</P>
<P>
He Yong, minister of supervision, said that supervision
departments have achieved remarkable progress in anti-corruption
work, and have contributed a great deal to the reform and economic
development and stability over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1999, the supervision sector dealt with more than
80,000 economic cases and gave Party disciplinary and
administrative penalties to about 70,000 persons, he said, adding
that the work averted losses of 38.5 billion yuan for the state.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for enhancing supervision over the
implementation of macro-control policies and measures taken by the
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, cases involving
people's rights and interests, and laws and regulations enacted by
state administrations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the role of the inspection and
supervision over the management and use of state bonds, and the
real estate market, the reform of the grain circulation system and
the management of social security funds.
</P>
<P>
He urged related departments to seriously deal with persons
responsible for major violations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Says No Change of Policy Toward Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi stressed Thursday that Iran still does not
recognize Israel as a state, and its policy in this regard has not
changed.
</P>
<P>
The viewpoints and policy of Iran toward the "Zionist regime"
have not changed at all, he was quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asefi dismissed as "baseless" recent claims by Israeli sources
that Iranian and Israeli officials had had contacts in Cairo on
issues related to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The "lies" stemmed from Israel's recent setbacks in the region,
and the regime "has helplessly embarked on such poisonous rumors in
order to deviate the public opinion and pave the way for its new
plots," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran is opposed to the Middle East peace process, and has always
called for armed struggle against Israeli occupation of Arab and
Islamic lands.
</P>
<P>
It had been the major supporter of the Lebanese guerrilla group
Hezbollah, or Party of God, which spearheaded the resistance
movement against Israeli occupation of south Lebanon in the past
decades, forcing it to eventually withdraw in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Iran also slammed the recent U.S.-brokered Camp David talks,
which failed to produce an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement
mainly due to sharp differences between the two sides on the fate
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As the current president of the 56-member Organization of the
Islamic Conference, Iran has launched a campaign to seek unity and
solidarity among Muslim states against Israel.

CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

</P>

said.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia's non-oil imports from other Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries went up to 9.2 billion Saudi
riyals (about 2.5 billion dollars) last year, a hike of 12.8
percent compared to that of 1998, while its non-oil exports
nosedived to 6.9 billion rials (1.84 billion dollars), a decrease

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Meets Arafat, Pledging Support to Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Thursday voiced Tehran's support for Palestinian resistance
against Israel and promised that Iran will do its best to help
solve the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
Khatami said Jerusalem belongs to the whole Islamic world and that
the Palestinian nation as representative of world Muslims should
keep this holy city.
</P>
<P>
"We will take every possible action at our disposal to solve the
issue of Palestine and Bait-ul-Moqaddas (Jerusalem), although it is
not something that could be swallowed by the aggressor enemy," he
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, the current chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC), noted that the issue of Al-Qods (Jerusalem) is a
serious matter for the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole Palestine (by which he was referring to the
land that also includes Israel) should be liberated first and then
it is for the Muslims, Christians and Jews to "freely" decide the
fate of their own homeland.
</P>
<P>
He said the current Middle East peace talks would practically
get nowhere, because a great number of Palestinians still live as
refugees abroad and there are many other Palestinians living inside
Palestine who are also ignored.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon in May after
a 22-year occupation there, he said that the victory of Lebanese
people and resistance proved that resistance and faith can break
the myth of Israel's invincibility.
</P>
<P>
Arafat in the meeting called on Iran to continue its political
support for the Palestinians, saying that Iran, as the OIC
chairman, can show the world with its support that the Palestinians
are not alone.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Khatami on his talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak at the Camp David summit sponsored by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, which ended on July 25.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited several European, Arab and Muslim countries
since the U.S.-sponsored summit failed to produce an Israeli-
Palestinian agreement mainly due to their differences over the fate
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here Thursday morning and also held talks with
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
He said in his meeting with Kharrazi that Palestine and
Jerusalem are exposed to the Israeli dangerous plots and the
Israelis have hatched "dangerous schemes" to destroy the sacred
places of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He called for support from all Muslim countries to the
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, for his part, said any desecration of Jerusalem will
provoke the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Transfer of foreign embassies (to Israel) to Jerusalem and the
Judaization of the Muslim site should be strongly condemned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said that he would move the U.S. embassy to Israel
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem late this year. This announcement was
decried by the Arab countries as the United Nations does not
recognize Israel's claim that Jerusalem, including the Arab East
Jerusalem which it seized in 1967 and later annexed, as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their
future independent state.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Boosts Indigenous Oilseed Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is making conscious
efforts to boost indigenous oilseed production to reduce edible
oil import, expecting to save 100 million U.S. dollars through cut
in edible oil import during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The total edible oil production in 2000-01 is anticipated at
740,000 tons against the national requirement of 1.9 million ton,
leaving behind a gap of 1.16 million tons to be imported,
according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoting
official sources.
</P>
<P>
During 1998-99, 788 million dollars were spent on edible oil
import which came down to 450 million dollars during the previous
fiscal year, helping the country to slash its food import bill
significantly.
</P>
<P>
For the current fiscal, preliminary targets of 350,000 acres of
Canola and 600,000 acres of sunflower have been set which will
produce a total of 219,000 tons of oil.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cottonseed, rapeseed and other oilseeds will
contribute about 520,000 tons of edible oil, taking the total
anticipated production to 740,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Oilseed Development Board (PODB) which was set up in
February 1995, keeping in view the utmost importance of oilseed
sector in the national economy, is taking care of efforts to
promote and develop oilseed in the country.
</P>
<P>
PODB has taken several initiatives during the past six months
to boost indigenous oilseed production from traditional resources
as well as by exploring the new edible oil yielding resources.

<HEADLINE> Putin Briefed on Security at Nuclear Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Atomic Energy Minister
Yevgeny Adamov briefed President Vladimir Putin at a meeting
Thursday on security measures at the country's nuclear power
stations and other facilities with radioactive and explosive
materials under the ministry's control.
</P>
<P>
Adamov said Putin called the meeting in light of Tuesday's bomb
blast at Moscow's Pushkin Square, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed and more than 100 others injured in
the blast, which hit an underpass not far away from the Kremlin.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
There "are not many" nuclear facilities in Moscow, and most of
the 40 such installations at the ministry's responsibility are
located in the Urals and Siberia, said Adamov.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Adamov also discussed the situation and the outlook
of the nuclear energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Output from the nuclear plants will increase by at least 10
billion KWHs this year, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll in Tuesday's rush hour blast in central Moscow
has risen to eight after a man suffering injuries and burns died
Wednesday night. The blast has been the most powerful to hit the
capital city so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of explosions across Russia killed more
than 300 people and injured many others. Authorities believe
Chechen militants were behind these blasts.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities have beefed up security across the
country after Tuesday's blast.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, an anti-terrorist operation began Tuesday evening
and all vehicles coming to Moscow are being thoroughly examined by
reinforced traffic police at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
In downtown Moscow, traffic appeared to be much lighter than
usual after the stepped-up security checks.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Oboidikhin, a spokesman for the Municipal Interior
Ministry, urged Muscovites to set up vigilante posts in apartment
building stairwells and organize patrols on their buildings and
yards.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Inflation Set to Rise Above Target, Warns BoE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Increases in wages and consumer
spending could push inflation through the Government's underlying
2.5 percent target level over the next couple of years, the Bank
of England warned.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly inflation report, the bank's Monetary
Policy Committee (MPO), which sets interest base rates, said that
the inflationary outlook was "slightly higher" than that of its
last forecast in May.
</P>
<P>
This confirms the view of City analysts that the bank may need
to raise the base rate, which is currently 6 percent, bringing
dearer mortgages and increased business borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
The bank's deputy governor Mervyn King said the central bank's
decision to keep interest rates on hold over the past six months
was due to the steady growth in the economy, coupled with low
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Prio to that, the bank had raised rates several times to tame
inflation. But King said that domestic demand growth and pay
pressures must not intensify if inflation was to be kept in check.
</P>
<P>
However, the City analysts generally agreed that the inflation
report indicated a rise in interest rates is more likely than not.

<HEADLINE> Czech Output of Hops Drops Markedly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Prague, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The output of hops in the Czech
Republic is expected to drop by more than 20 percent to about 4,
800 tons this year due to unseasonable weather, according to the
country's hops growers' association.
</P>
<P>
The crop was affected by protracted drought and a long spell of
hot weather during April-June, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic is one of the major hops-growing countries
in the world, with areas cultivated for the crop exceeding 6,000
hectares, next only to Germany and the United States. Eighty
percent of the country's production goes for export, accounting
for more than 10 percent of the world's total exports.

<HEADLINE> Russia: London-Based Organization Sponsors Terrorist Groups in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that it has
accurate information that a Britain-based organization trains
demolition specialists for international terrorist groups fighting
in Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The group, called Halo Trust, was set up in Britain in the
late 1980s under the front of a charitable non-profit group with
headquarters in London, Itar-Tass said, quoting an unidentified
spokesman with the Russian Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
The organization, whose charter says it aims to assist mine-
clearing operations in countries afflicted by military conflicts,
has branches in Angola, Mozambique, Cambodia, Afghanistan and some
member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Halo Trust was first spotted by Russia's security services in
1998 when evidence was obtained that associates of its Abkhazia
arm -- British national Thomas Emms and Nicholas Nobbs and
Zimbabwean national Thomas Dibb -- engaged in subversive and
spying activities against Russia on the territory of Chechnya,
Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The organization's members came to Chechnya starting from 1997
without permission from the Russian federal authorities, Itar-Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
Halo Trust's activities are funded by Britain's ministry for
international development, the U.S. State Department, governmental
agencies of Germany, Canada, the European Union and by private
persons, Itar-Tass quoted the FSB spokesman as saying.

<HEADLINE> Manilov: Chechen Terrorists Behind Recent Moscow Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian defense
official said Thursday that terrorists from the breakaway republic
of Chechnya were behind the Tuesday blast in central Moscow that
killed eight people and injured about 100 others.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact that clues from the blast lead to terrorists who
are now stationed in Chechnya," said Colonel General Valery
Manilov, the first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said the afternoon rush-hour blast at Pushkin Square,
which is not far away from the Kremlin, has the same pattern as
similar crimes in other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
"This is a pattern of international terrorism which is
manifesting itself in other countries as well," Manilov told a
press briefing, "Terrorists do not have nationality or religion."
</P>
<P>
He said the terrorist attack in Moscow is the rebels' latest
attempt to force the Russian leadership to agree to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said ringleaders of the Chechen rebels are planning
new subversive and terrorist attacks both within Chechnya and
outside.
</P>
<P>
"Acts of terrorism and subversion are the last argument of
bandits who are unable to withstand the anti-terrorist operation,"
Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the current military campaign against the
Chechen militants launched last summer following two waves of
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Dagestan and a series of
apartment bombings that left more than 300 people dead in Moscow
and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces have wiped out up to 200 rebels in the past
week by reconnoitering rebel concentrations and then delivering
artillery strikes, the general said.
</P>
<P>
The toll in Tuesday's blast rose to eight after a man
suffering injuries and burns died Wednesday night. The blast has
been the most powerful to hit the capital city so far this year.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack and law
enforcement authorities have not arrested any suspects yet.

<HEADLINE> France Lifts Seizure of Russian Banking Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday lifted its seizure
of the banking accounts of the Russian embassy in Paris which were
frozen on May 18 at the request of a Swiss company involved in a
commercial dispute with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal of Paris said that the Russian embassy
should enjoy diplomatic immunity in accordance with the 1961
Vienna Convention which says that "the protection of the means
concerning the exercise of the functions (of embassies) should be
guaranteed."
</P>
<P>
The Russian embassy here welcomed the court decision as "a
victory of good sense and justice" and thanked the French
authorities for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
The Tribunal of Paris decided in March to allow the Swiss
import-export company, Noga, to seize Russian properties in France
in compensation for a 450 million franc (63 million U.S. dollar)
debt Russia owes to it.
</P>
<P>
Noga, which had an oil-for-food deal with Russia in the early
1990s, accused Russia of owing it 800 million U.S. dollars and
asks for an immediate payment of 63 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva-based company seized on May 18 the banking accounts
of the Russian embassy, the Russian commercial representation and
the Russian mission at the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization in Paris, and those of the Russian
Central Bank and the Vneshekonombank in France.
</P>
<P>
In July, Noga also seized a Russian yacht participating in a
sea festival in Brest. But the yacht, "Sedov," was released later
at the order of a French court in Brest.

<HEADLINE> France Issues Arrest Warrant for German Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- France has issued an international
arrest warrant for a German businessman for suspected corruption
of German officials in a deal between the French oil group Elf and
the German government in buying the Leuna oil refinery in eastern
Germany by Elf.
</P>
<P>
The French daily Le Monde Thursday quoted French judicial
authorities as saying that one of the judges investigating
numerous corruption scandals around Elf, Rena Van Ruymbeke, has
asked the Interpol for help in arresting Dieter Holzer, a middle-
man in the Elf-Leuna deal.
</P>
<P>
Holzer and a former French secret service agent, Pierre Lethier,
reportedly received from 270 to 300 million francs (38 to 43
million U.S. dollars) in commissions from Elf by arranging the
purchase of Leuna by Elf in 1992.
</P>
<P>
They could have used some of the commissions to corrupt
officials of the government of former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and to fund his Christian Democratic Union party in elections,
said French judges.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has categorically denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> World Champion Montalvo May Miss Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The world long jump champion
Niurka Montalvo may have to miss the Sydney Olympics next month
because her native country Cuba's athletics federation does not
allow her to compete.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Olympic committee (COE) president Alfredo Goyeneche
said on Thursday the Cuban athletics federation had refused
Montalvo's request for participation.
</P>
<P>
Montalvo won her world title in Seville last year in
controversial circumstances in front of her adopted home
supporters after marrying a Spaniard in early 1998 bringing about
naturalization on May 5 last year.
</P>
<P>
Under International Olympic Committee rules, athletes must get
a waiver from their former country if they have not been citizens
of their new country for three years.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Kenyan athletics federation prevented the
then world 800m champion Wilson Kipketer, who married a Danish
woman, from running for his adopted country in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Tung Briefs US Business Community On HK's Political, Economic Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, Tung Chee Hwa, Thursday
briefed the American business community in Hong Kong on Hong Kong'
s economic and political achievements in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Tung, delivering a luncheon speech to the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) as the kick-off speaker of the AmCham's "
Leadership Series", said that Hong Kong, since returning to the
motherland in 1997, has made much progress in the economic and
political fields.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Hong Kong is recovering from the
recession brought on by the Asian financial crisis, Tung said,
noting that led by strong growth in trade, tourist arrivals,
activities of the financial markets and consumer spending, the
region has double-digit growth for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
He expected Hong Kong to have more good news for the whole year,
"not just this year but most likely for next year as well."
</P>
<P>
Admitting there are other places in Asia recovering more faster
than Hong Kong, Tung believed that Hong Kong may be the only place
in Asia where recovery has been matched with genuine reforms, both
in the financial and public spheres.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's way to embracing the New Economy, Tung said,
some people may be in danger of being left behind.
</P>
<P>
He promised to provide financial resources to help retrain "
those who can and want to be retrained," and "make sure that the
long term unemployed or displaced workers, primarily late-middle
aged people, will be able to find basic livelihood while still
being useful people."
</P>
<P>
On the political front, Tung said that today, unlike the
colonial era, the political system is much more open.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law has given Hong Kong 10 years from 1997 to 2007 to
gain the necessary experience for developing a political system
that is compatible to Hong Kong's needs, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Taking the Legislative Council Elections as an example, Tung
said that according to the provisions in the Basic Law, the
government will be replacing four of the original ten election
committee seats with directly elected ones to be returned by the
geographical constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Aside from electoral politics, there are other forms of
participatory democracy that the government is promoting, Tung
said. The SAR government welcomes contributions of ideas, comments
and criticisms from individuals and organizations on all matters
and aspects of government, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, with the support of the Central
Government and the people of Hong Kong, the region has come a long
way. "I think many others would agree, that the achievements of
the SAR Government since 1997 have been important," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the smooth transition from the British rule to Chinese
sovereignty under the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
Besides, there is also the resolute preservation of the rule of
law as guaranteed under the Basic Law, the safeguarding of the
economic system and the successful implementation of a series of
reforms such as the environment, the financial sector and the
civil service, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The government, together with its people, has managed a number
of great political and economic changes over the past three years,
and accomplished the transition to "One Country, Two Systems"
under Chinese sovereignty, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The same government and the same people will be able to
accomplish other important and necessary tasks in the future," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Calls Russian President on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday called Russian President Vladimir Putin to update
him on the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the call just hours before Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat was due to arrive in Moscow in a
bid to win Russia's backing for his plan to declare an independent
Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Putin discussed prospects for the Middle East peace
process following the collapse of the July 11-25 U.S.-brokered Camp
David talks.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin said that Putin had reiterated Russia's pledge to
work further for peace in the Middle East, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, as a co-sponsor (with the United States) of the peace
process, will continue to do all it can to secure compromise
agreements between the (Israelis and Palestinians)," it said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks on phone, Barak and Putin said they had decided
to attend the millennium summit to be held in New York next month,
a statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the conversation, Barak offered condolences
on the death of eight people who were killed in a bomb blast in the
Russian capital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 more were injured when a bomb tore through the busy
tunnels of an underground passage in central Moscow during rush
hour. Authorities suspect that Chechen rebels were responsible for
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Putin agreed to cooperate more closely on fighting
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Putin also mentioned Israeli General Prosecutor Elyakin
Rubinstein's trip to Moscow on Tuesday, during which Rubinstein
briefed the Russian leaders on the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to hold talks with the Russian president on
Friday. Earlier on Thursday, the Palestinian leader visited Tehran
to brief Iranian officials on the failed Camp David peace talks and
to seek a meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in
support of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
To counter Arafat's international support-rallying campaign,
Barak has dispatched his ministers abroad to explain Israel's
position on the peace talks and to prevent a unilateral Palestinian
declaration of statehood.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, now also acting
foreign minster, is in Turkey and Minister of Cooperation Shimon
Peres is going to South-East Asia to explain Israel's position.
Ben-Ami is also expected to visit some European Union countries and
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and the Gulf States have denied media reports that Barak's
adviser, Danny Yatom, visited them last week.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan President in Iraq For Landmark Visit 2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
arrived in Iraq from Iran on Thursday for a landmark visit, the
first
one by a head of state since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Chavez and a large delegation accompanying him
arrived at the Iranian-Iraqi border city Munthariya, he stepped
into an Iraqi military helicopter and now is on the way to the
Iraqi capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials, including Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
and Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid, have been waiting at the
border for his arrival for hours, a local TV report said.
</P>
<P>
During his short visit, Chavez is expected to hold talks with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and invite him to attend the summit
meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) due in September.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to focus on what measures should be taken
to stabilize the volatile oil prices and strengthen unity among the
OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's trip has been under criticism of the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said on Tuesday
that Washington can not understand the visit and will be raising
the issue with "relevant" Venezuelan officials.
</P>
<P>
"We do think it is a rather dubious distinction to be the first
democratically elected head of state to go and meet with the
dictator of Iraq," the spokesman said, adding Chavez is making the
visit without the approval of the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel has rejected the
criticism by declaring there is no U.N. resolution banning
dignitaries from visiting Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the only interest Chavez has in visiting Iraq is that it
is an OPEC nation, of which Venezuela is also a member.
</P>
<P>
The key objective of Chavez's 10-nation tour is to personally
invite all OPEC members to attend the summit meeting slated for
September in the Venezuelan capital Caracas.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab
Emirates and Iran. In addition to Iraq, the trip will also take him
to Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria and Algeria before returning to
Caracas on August 15.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister in Turkey Following Arafat's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, Aug 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami arrived in Turkey on Thursday to seek support for
Israel's position on the Middle East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement issued upon his arrival, Ben-Ami said he
will brief his hosts about the peace process, which has proceeded
to a crossroad after the U.S.-brokered summit between Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the
Camp David failed last month.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, a key member of the Israeli delegation at Camp David,
said the two leaders want the process to come to a positive end,
adding they have several policies in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami expressed belief that Turkey will make significant
contributions to a fruitful solution in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami's visit came at the heels of Arafat, who paid a brief
visit to Ankara on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, Arafat reportedly explained his steadfast
positions regarding Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also tried to talk his hosts into backing
a long overdue declaration of a Palestinian state on September 13,
with or without a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, known as one of the politicians close to Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and an expert on the Palestinian problem, is
expected to inform Turkish officials of the latest developments in
the peace process and explain his government's views on Jerusalem
and other thorny issues that have blocked the progress in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, who was appointed Israeli Acting Foreign Minister by
Barak on his way to Ankara, is scheduled to meet with Turkish
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and will be received by Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit during his one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim-populated nation, has
traditionally supported its Palestinian brothers' aspirations for
an independent and sovereign state while maintaining close
political and military ties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Strives to Recover Tourism Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- After almost three years of
crisis, Indonesia is making a great effort to recover tourism
industry following the emerging of a conducive political and
security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government will focus its attention on luring more foreign
tourists to come to Indonesia by providing special facilities and
package such as free-visa facilities, and easing visa application
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The country's ministry of tourism also decided to expand the
number of countries eligible for a visa-free facility which
currently is provided for 48 countries.
</P>
<P>
But the most interesting point is that the government of
Indonesia will try to attract at least 1.3 million Chinese
tourists in 2001.
</P>
<P>
This is actually an unprecedented step as for nearly three
decades the Indonesian government has imposed stricter procedures
aimed at preventing the arrival of Chinese tourists to Indonesia
for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
And in fact, based on data issued by the ministry of tourism
last year, the ASEAN countries have been drawing about five
million Chinese tourists a year, among them 500,000 to Thailand,
6,000 to Malaysia and 350,000 to Singapore, but Indonesia only
drew 15,000 Chinese tourists.
</P>
<P>
The number of China's tourists visiting Indonesia was clearly
recorded at the lowest level compared to the number visiting other
ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
But now, the government seems to have been aware that imposing
strict bureaucratic procedures to Chinese tourists who wished to
visit the country was a wrong policy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government now has been hammering out a plan to
"restore wishes" of Chinese tourists to come to Indonesia by
providing some special facilities, such as easing visa application
procedures and even providing visa on arrival facility.
</P>
<P>
The administration of President Abdurrahman Wahid also made it
possible for airlines to conduct direct flights from Shanghai and
Beijing to Jakarta and Solo (a city in Central Java province) as
well as other Indonesian cities.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that with such a move many Chinese
tourists will come to Indonesia as it, in fact, has great
potentials to attract tourists. Indonesia has many historical
tourist sites closely related with China such as several ancient
temples in Central Java, and West Kalimantan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is resolved to intensify tourism promotion as this
sector among others is the most affected by a series of problems
in the country ranging from natural disasters to economic and
political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set Up Irradiation Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is going to set up
a multi-purpose commercial irradiation plant to be used to
preserve and sterilize herbal products, food and medical equipment,
according to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister
Muhyiddin Yassin.
</P>
<P>
The plant at an estimated cost of 25 million ringgit (6.57
million U.S. dollars) will be built by the Malaysian Institute for
Nuclear Technology Research (MINT), he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"With this plant, private companies and hospitals no longer
need to send their products for preservation and sterilization
overseas," Bernama news agency quoted him as saying here at a
seminar on "Trade Opportunities and Challenges in Food Irradiation
".
</P>
<P>
The minister said the public should not worry over the
government's move to step up use of irradiation for preserving and
sterilizing food and medical equipment because this method would
not affect their health.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Give Bangladesh Grant for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will receive a grant of
10 million U.S. dollars for expansion of education under an
agreement signed here Thursday between the government and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has agreed to apply the grant for implementation of
the project "Intensive District Approach to Education for All (
IDEAL)", a press release said.
</P>
<P>
IDEAL is a project of the Bangladeshi government for improving
the quality of primary education which began in 1996 with
technical, financial and material support from the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The project focuses on interactive classroom teaching and
learning with a view to making the school more attractive for
children.
</P>
<P>
Based on the theory that children have multiple intelligence
and styles of learning, it provides teachers and supervisors
training in multiple ways of teaching and learning.
</P>
<P>
IDEAL also introduces participatory local-level planning to
allow communities to take interest and play a role more actively
in primary education.
</P>
<P>
The project incorporates various social mobilization and
communication activities to encourage the involvement of
participant groups including parents, teachers and communities in
school activities and to create demand for quality education.
</P>
<P>
"IDEAL is an important project to improve the quality of
primary education working directly at the school level. This new
fund will certainly help expand the project activities in more
areas," said Shahida Azfar, UNICEF Representative in Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- 2,166 Bangladesh nationals are now
serving in eight United Nations peace-keeping missions in
different parts of the world, the official Bangladesh News Agency
quoted an official source as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source said these people, mostly members of the armed
forces, are now stationed in the Congo, Iraq, Kosovo, Georgia,
Kuwait, Western Sahara, East Timor and Sierra Leone.

Replying to a question, the source said the number of officers
and soldiers deployed to U.N. Transition Assistance in East Timor

<P>
Things are going well for Bangladesh troops in East Timor,
except the death of a soldier in an explosion that occurred last
week near the sea shore of the capital Dili.
</P>
<P>
With the death of the soldier on August 3, the number of
Bangladesh peace-keepers who lost their lives during service in U.
N. missions rose to 13, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Following the inclusion of one battalion troops to Sierra Leone
in June this year, Bangladesh stands third in terms of manpower in
U.N. peace-keeping missions, the source added.

<HEADLINE> British Government Calls for End to Anti-Paedophile Marches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
appealed for an end to anti-paedophile protests after
demonstrators took to the streets for a seventh night.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 people, mainly women and children, took part in the
protest, waving placards and banners calling for alleged sex
offenders to move away from the Paulsgrove estate in the southern
port city of Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
While Wednesday's march was described as "noisy but peaceful,"
previous protests escalated into riots with police coming under
fire, cars being burned and windows smashed.
</P>
<P>
The disturbances had already forced four families not connected
with sex offenders to be rehoused, police said.
</P>
<P>
But protesters said they would continue until alleged child
abusers had been driven away from their homes. They believe there
are 20 such people living on the estate.
</P>
<P>
Police said two men charged with child sex offenses had killed
themselves in the past week in separate incidents. One of them
committed suicide after being targeted by vigilante violence.
</P>
<P>
"What we don't want to see happen is people being driven
underground and the police and the probation services losing
control of them," Home Office Minister Barbara Roche told BBC
television.
</P>
<P>
The protests began after the News of the World, a top-selling
Sunday tabloid, launched a "naming and shaming" campaign to
identify child sex offenders, after the death of eight-year-old
Sarah Payne last month.
</P>
<P>
Protest spokeswoman Katrina Kessel said: "We are only trying to
intimidate paedophiles, not innocent people."
</P>
<P>
But the action was condemned as "the ugly face of hatred" by
Robin Corbett, a member of parliament from the Home Affairs Select
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He told the BBC he had asked the Home Office to consider
possible prosecution against the News of the World for incitement
to public disorder.
</P>
<P>
The Portsmouth City Council has agreed on a five-point "peace
plan" with police and protest leaders.
</P>
<P>
Protesters agreed to consider handing over their lists of
alleged paedophiles, and all sides will work to promote children's
and public safety on the Paulsgrove estate.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Foreign Minister Threatened With Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Foreign Minister Louis
Michel has been threatened with death, a local newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The La Derniere Heure (The Last Hour) newspaper quoted the
Brussels municipal prosecution as saying that Michel received a
letter of menace several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A bullet was found inside the envelope that contained the
letter of menace though the source of threat was not disclosed by
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Police and gendarmerie have taken necessary measures to protect
the foreign minister while the Brussels municipal prosecution was
entrusted with the investigation into the letter of threat.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian foreign minister last month got himself at the
center of a political row with both the Congo and the opposition
within Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The row started after Belgium had issued an international
arrest warrant against Congolese Foreign Minister Abdoulaye
Yerodia charged with crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was only made known on July 3 after Michel
had returned from his official visit to Kinshasa, capital of the
African country, to attend a ceremony on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The Congo has recalled its Brussels-based ambassador for
consultations over the incident.
</P>
<P>
A fax document from the Belgian Justice Ministry confirmed that
Belgium had issued the arrest warrant on June 6, long before the
Belgian foreign minister's trip to the Congo. The arrest warrant
was signed on April 11 by Brussels Magistrate Damien Vandermeersh.
</P>
<P>
Belgium made the move after Congolese refugees had accused
their foreign minister of inciting hatred against them in August
1998 in speeches using such discriminative words as "vermin" and "
extermination."
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant was issued in line with a 1993 Belgian law
that demands the arrest of those who have committed crimes against
international human rights no matter where they have committed the
crimes and what nationality they are of.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese foreign minister is now liable to be arrested if
he enters Belgium or any other country that is willing to execute
the arrest warrant.

military dictatorship in Argentina in from 1976 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Olivera was arrested on Sunday at the
international airport of Rome-Fiumicino by Italian police when he

A Parisian judge, Roger Le Loire, issued last month an
international arrest warrant against Olivera, who was one of the
military chiefs of the XXII infantery regiment in San Juan area in
western Argentina.
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of arresting and torturing Anne Marie Erize
Tisseau, a French citizen who disappeared in Argentina in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted judicial authorities in Paris as
saying on Thursday that France will "imminently" transmitt a
request to Italy for the extradition of Olivera.
</P>
<P>
According to the European Convention of Extradition, France has
40 days to present the request after the arrest of Olivera.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Venezuela Call for Stability of Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Iran and Venezuela
here on Thursday called on member states of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to try to stabilize the oil
market and defend the rights of oil producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and his visiting Venezuelan
counterpart Hugo Chavez made the call at a joint press conference
at the end of their talks, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Khatami praised the efforts made by
Chavez for hosting the OPEC summit meeting slated for this
September in Caracas, calling it an important step toward
consolidating the oil cartel.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president assessed as very positive his visit to
Tehran, saying Iran and Venezuela hold similar views on ways of
restructuring OPEC and bringing about stability to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the press conference, Khatami and Chavez discussed ways
of expanding bilateral ties, particularly mutual cooperation in the
field of oil.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said OPEC, as an international and powerful body, should
not only be engaged in the issue of oil prices, but also have an
impact on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Terming the upcoming OPEC summit in Caracas as a turning point
in the history of the organization, Khatami expressed hope that the
organization, in cooperation with non-OPEC oil producers, will be
successful in stabilizing the oil market and defending the rights
of both oil producing and consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Chavez expressed his country's readiness to strengthen Tehran-
Caracas bilateral ties, particularly within the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
He also presented a report on preparations for the upcoming OPEC
summit meeting to be held in Caracas late September.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president arrived here late Wednesday as part of
his tour of fellow OPEC member countries, namely Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia,
Algeria, Libya and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The key objective of Chavez's 10-nation tour is to personally
invite all OPEC members to attend the Caracas summit, which is the
first in 25 years and the second since the 11-member organization
was established in 1960.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his one-day visit, Chavez issued a joint
communique with Khatami on expanding bilateral cooperation and
stabilizing the oil market.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed two letters of understanding on
drug control and exemption of visas for diplomatic and service
passports between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Optimistic About Wood Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The wood processing industry
could emerge as one of Zambia's major foreign exchange earners
through exports once the Zambia Forestry and Forest Industry
Corporation is privatized, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) was quoted as saying in its
latest report that the industry obtained an upward trend in 1996
and 1997 when the sector recorded export earnings of 1.8 and 3.3
million U.S. dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend of exports has been attributed to fresh
capital investment undertaken by some companies, the EBZ said.
</P>
<P>
It said the manufactures are adopting an aggressive marketing
approach to exploit new market niches to increase exports. These
include South Korea, Norway, Britain, Swaziland, Germany and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the EBZ, Zambia has a good potential for
development of wood and wood products since it has a vast natural
forests and plantations which are managed on a sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's forest resources amount to 46.3 million hectares, out
of which 7.4 million hectares are forest reserves, 63,000 hectares
are plantations, 6.3 million hectares are national parks and the
rest 32 million hectares are other woodland.
</P>
<P>
This could provide a healthy base for further development of a
fully integrated wood industry, the EBZ said.

YANTAI, China, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Zhang Jian on
Thursday became the first person to swim Bohai Gulf on the coast
of northeast China, the longest open water course that the mankind
have overcome.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old, a sports teacher at Beijing Sports University,
took 50 hours and 22 minutes to cross the Gulf, which is more than
three times the width of the English Width.
</P>
<P>
Zhang swam a total of 123.58 kilometers, some 14km more than
the beeline width between Lushun of Liaoning Province and Penglai
of Shandong Province because of the stormy conditions.
</P>
<P>
He began from Lushun early on Tuesday and arrived at Penglai at
10:22am on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang walked out of the sea, raising his hands in jubilation
and gave an emotional hug to his wife Li Xiaona, who was waiting
there since early morning with his mother and two aunts.
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I'm successful, " said Zhang, who was greeted by some
10,000 people on the shore.
</P>
<P>
He was immediately sent to a nearby hospital to get a medical
check.
</P>
<P>
"Zhang only suffered several scrapes on his skin," said a
doctor. "He is now in good condition and is expected to return to
Beijing next Monday."
</P>
<P>
Zhang stopped every hour to eat food passed to him on a pole
from an escort ship but did not leave the water.
</P>
<P>
He mainly ate liquid food, milk and energy bars but couldn't
resist a bowl of instant noodles to fill him up in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's next aim was to tackle the 160-km Taiwan Strait, the
treacherous stretch of water between the Taiwan Island and
mainland China.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Venezuela on Thursday
underlined unity among members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to stabilize world oil market.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the one-day visit by
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Tehran, the two countries
stressed that OPEC should keep its independence for the collective
interests of OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Any cut or increase in OPEC outputs aiming at stabilizing oil
prices should be decided collectively on the basis of economic
mechanism, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the communique
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Caracas also voiced their support for the ongoing
efforts to strengthen the OPEC role at the global economic arena in
order to stabilize oil prices and safeguard the security of oil
supply.
</P>
<P>
Chavez arrived here late Wednesday night and left here Thursday
morning for Kermanshah, western Iran, for a visit to Iraq by car
after holding talks with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Chavez and Khatami discussed preparations for the second OPEC
summit meeting scheduled to be held in Caracas late September, IRNA

</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two sides called for further expansion of
bilateral ties through exchange of visits and mutual cooperation in
economic, trade, cultural and political fields, particularly

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Troops Patrol Near Fatma Gate Along Border With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese task force has
dispatched a flag-showing patrol along the border with Israel on
Wednesday for the first time in a quarter of a century amid
speculations that Lebanon would halt the Fatma Gate stone-throwing
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Israel have all welcomed the deployment of the 1,
000-strong Lebanese task force in the Israeli-vacated zone of south
Lebanon, As Safir newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Hezbollah guerrillas were allowed by the 500 Lebanese
army troops and 500 policemen to maintain their border "observation
posts" in line with President Emile Lahoud's insistence that Israel
must be kept feeling insecure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hezbollah guerrillas, who had spearheaded a guerrilla
war to oust Israeli occupation troops from the country, removed
their flags from all towns and villages that have fallen within the
task force's zone of operations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army and Internal Security Forces had been banished
from the border with Israel sine the 1975 outbreak of the 15-year
civil war. Israel invaded Lebanon twice, in 1978 and 1982, during
the civil war to rout out Palestinian guerrillas from their main
Middle East power base at the time.
</P>
<P>
A government statement in Beirut said the task force's
deployment operation was completed in two hours before dawn of
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The military portion of the task force was made up troops from
the army's counter-espionage and counter-terrorism brigade along
with military police and Internal Security Forces.
</P>
<P>
The task force has established command headquarters at the
Christian-populated town of Marajayoun and the predominantly Shiite
Muslim town of Bint Jbeil after the two-pronged push into the
region. Some 640 soldiers and policemen took up positions in
Marajayoun and 340 in Bint Jbeil.
</P>
<P>
Once the stationing process was completed, the force dispatched
a patrol near the Fatma Gate, where the Lebanese have been stoning
Israeli troops and farmers almost daily since the withdrawal on May
24, An Nahar and As Safir newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Israeli soldiers watching the deployment operation
came out from their steel-fortified border positions and waved to
the task force patrolmen, who totally ignored the welcome gesture,
As Safir paper said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army maintained mechanized patrols along the entire
border area to monitor the Lebanese task force deployment, complete
with a camera-equipped spy balloon over the northernmost Israeli
settlement of Metullah.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government said that it hoped the task force
deployment would soon bring the Fatma Gate hostilities to an end.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges OIC to Take Actions Against Israeli Aggression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Thursday called on the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) to take actions against the Israeli aggression on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival for a short visit, Arafat called on Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami, the current OIC chairman, to take the
initiative to defend the holy city of Jerusalem, the Iranian state-
run television reported.
</P>
<P>
Terming the Middle East peace talks as "dead", Arafat said that
he would exchange views with President Khatami on the future of
Jerusalem and the latest developments in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"We are victims of aggressions by the Zionists (Israelis) and
their oppressive actions against the holy Qods (Jerusalem)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that under previous agreements with Israel, an
independent Palestinian state will be declared in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited several European, Arab and Muslim countries
since a U.S.-sponsored summit at Camp David with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach
a peace agreement due to differences over the fate of Jerusalem and
the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here from Cairo and will leave for Moscow
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Iran had voiced strong opposition to the Camp David summit held
on July 11-25 and expressed delight over the failure of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has launched wide-range contacts and consultations with
Islamic states and Palestinian groups, calling for common stance
among Muslim countries on the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concerns over the U.S. statement to move its embassy
in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Tehran underlined that the
sovereignty over Jerusalem belongs to Palestine, and the
Palestinians have the right to establish an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Following the disclosure of
President Abdurrahman Wahid's plan to restructure and reshuffle
his cabinet, a senior Indonesian minister Thursday resigned from
his cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
In a letter submitted to the president, Coordinating Minister
for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie said that his
resignation was aimed at giving a full support to the president in
restructuring his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"Through this letter, with respect, I let Mr. President know
that I have taken decision to resign from the position as
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry," Kwik
said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Xinhua on
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"My reason is (that) there is a clear sign that the cabinet
would be restructured and be reshuffled. I fully comprehend that
based on our constitution, the formation of cabinet structure and
its personnel is a prerogative right of the President," Kwik added.
</P>
<P>
Kwik noted that his decision was aimed at clearing the way for
the president in carrying out cabinet restructure "from the zero
position, freely," saying that the move was taken to give the full
support to the president.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the president, Kwik promised that he will not
take any important and strategic decisions (from now on) before
leaving his minister office, citing "he is so thankful" to the
president for his confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
Kwik's decision was made less than 24 hours after President
Wahid told the Assembly's annual meeting on Wednesday evening that
he intends to restructure his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The President said that he would restructure the cabinet and
make the country's bureaucracy more slim in a bid to increase the
efficiency of the government.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also said that he will delegate Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputeri to carry out the government's technical daily
activities, such as arranging the agenda of cabinet working and
determine the focus and priority of the government.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls to Curb Illegal Arms Infiltration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has called on residents in North Eastern Province to help the
government curb infiltration of illegal firearms into Kenya from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call Wednesday when he received a
goodwill delegation of leaders from the province's Garissa
District at the State House.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's North Eastern Province borders Somalia and Sudan,
countries torn by civil wars or clan conflicts. It is reported
that illegal arms are frequently smuggled or infiltrated into
Kenya from these two countries.
</P>
<P>
Moi told the delegation that one way of enhancing regional
peace and security is to ensure all illegally held arms are
surrendered to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
It is important to maintain peace so that ordinary people could
go about their business freely, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moi also condemned occasional clan fightings in the province
and urged the elders to guide the youth on peaceful ways of
solving problems.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Church Willing to Meet Angolan Rebel Leader Over Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bishops Conference of Angola
and Sao Tome has reiterated the Catholic Church's willingness to
meet with Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to discuss ways to
bring peace to Angola, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting would be a consequence of the mid-July Church-
sponsored Congress for Peace in Luanda, during which participants
called for a cease-fire in the 26-year Angolan civil war and urged
resolution for the conflict through dialogue, the news agency
quoted Bishop Zacarias Camuenho as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Camuenho stressed that any meeting with Savimbi would
have to take place in a "climate of confidence", a condition that
is not assured at present.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Savimbi of not keeping his promises in the peace
accords and during the 1992 general elections, the Angolan
government has refused to hold talks with the rebel leader except
"the talks on his capitulation".
</P>
<P>
At the moment, most Angolans are tired of talking about the
civil war, which has deprived some 500,000 Angolans of their lives
and destroyed most infrastructures that are important for the
country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lead: New Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sworn In EDS-Updates with more ministers to be sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Minister for Public
Administration, Home Affairs and Plantation Industries Ratnasiri
Wickremanayake was sworn in as the country's new prime minister,
succeeding Sirimavo Bandaranaike who resigned earlier on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wickremanayake took oaths as the new prime minister before
President Chandrika Kumaratunga at a special ceremony held at
Temple Trees, the official presidential residence in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the world's first elected
woman premier, stepped down earlier Thursday in the run-up to the
general elections which is due by early November.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Bandaranaike, 84, was resigning to make way for
the next elections as there was intense speculation that the
parliament may be dissolved before the end of its six-year term on
August 24. Bandaranaike made history as the first woman prime
minister in the world in July 1960, succeeding her assassinated
husband. She was re-elected in 1970, serving 12 years in all.
</P>
<P>
Bandaranaike has the record of being prime minister thrice, the
latest in 1994, although the post is nowadays a largely ceremonial
position given her by her daughter, President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said President Kumaratunga is expected to
reshuffle her cabinet. Veteran United National Party politician
and former Finance Minister Ronnie De Mel, who crossed over to the
ruling People's Alliance recently, will take oaths as the new
minister of industrial development to succeed C.V. Gunaratne, who
was assassinated by Tamil Tiger rebels in early June.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Ranatunga is tipped to be sworn in as the new minister
of tourism and aviation in place of the deceased Dharmasiri
Senanayake. Ranatunga will relieve his present portfolio as deputy
minister of shipping, ports and rehabilitation.

PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Amelie Mauresmo of France has

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The five provinces and
autonomous regions in northwest China will join hands to develop
their tourism industry by using the area's rich tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
The State plans to spend 600 million yuan on developing the
region's tourism industry this year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's
government has said tourism is playing an increasingly important
role in Xinjiang's economic development and product structure.
Tourism is expected to become Xinjiang's third largest pillar
industry following oil and cotton industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xinjiang attracted more than 220,000 overseas
tourists and some seven million domestic visitors, earning over 85
million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange and 6 billion yuan (722
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province set up a tourism group two years ago and
invested 180 million yuan on 16 tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the province received 27 million tourists, with
tourism income reaching 10 billion yuan, accounting for 6.7
percent of the province's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region set up a poverty-relief
demonstration zone in Xihaigu this year, the region's poorest area,
to help local people get rid of poverty through developing tourism
industry.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai and Gansu provinces have also adopted various measures
to improve local infrastructure facilities and launch new tourism
projects.
</P>
<P>
During the national tourism festival held in Xinjiang from July
14-16, the five provinces and autonomous regions offered new
tourism routes.
</P>
<P>
The aim of holding the festival in Xinjiang, said deputy
director of the National Tourism Administration Zhang Xiyin, is to
show the tourism industry's support for the development of western
China.

<P>
HANGZHOU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province,
a booming coastal region, will spend more than 10 billion yuan (
about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) on five higher educational zones
over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
The funds will be provided by individuals, social organizations
and the government.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dejiang, secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee
of the Communist Party of China, said the zones are designed to
meet a growing demand for professionals in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, Zhejiang has less institutions of higher
learning than many other provinces, with the number standing only
at 36, although its gross domestic product ranks fourth in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The five zones, construction of which is already underway, are
located in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, Ningbo and Wenzhou,
both major cities.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, they will have a combined enrollment of at
least 200,000 students.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the Ningbo higher educational zone, scheduled for
completion this year, will accommodate seven colleges and
universities.

<HEADLINE> 1600-Year-Old Dunhuang Grottos Still Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, GANSU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Dunhuang Grottos, the
world's greatest repository of Buddhist art, still remain intact
100 years after it was discovered.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting the grottos has always been an important task for
us," said Ma Wenzhi, the director of Gansu Provincial Cultural
Relics Bureau. "And I can say that we are proud that we have been
so successful."
</P>
<P>
Located at the west end of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province,
Dunhuang is famed for its numerous frescos and sculptured figures
dating back to the 4th century.
</P>
<P>
Since 1950, the Chinese central government launched numerous
repair projects on the 1,600-year-old site, which was put on the
World Heritage List by the UNESCO in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Nearly every possible means has been used to protect the site,
including controlling sandstorms, reinforcing cliffs, preserving
sculptures and repairing frescos.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 square meters of damaged frescos have been restored,
sand erosion has been reduced by 70 percent, and the grottoes are
strong enough to survive an earthquake measuring up to seven on
the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The government is playing an active role to attract foreign
investment to protect the grottos. About 180 million yuan (2.2
million US dollars) has been collected so far.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting cultural relics in Dunhuang will provide a good
example for other places across the country in protecting their
own national treasures." said Ma.

<HEADLINE> Khatami to Set up Special Committee on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
will set up a special committee under his chairmanship to push
forward reforms in the country, the local daily Iran revealed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following a meeting between Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei with senior officials, the daily quoted
several Majlis deputies as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami underlined all organizations and state bodies
should have their representatives in the committee and should carry
out reforms inside themselves, the lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
Discussion on establishment of the committee is still underway
and the committee may include lawmakers, scholars, clerics and
others, the daily added.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei last month held a meeting on reforms with President
Khatami, Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Hashemi Shahroudi and Chairman of the State Expediency Council
Hashemi Rafsanjani. But no details about the meeting were revealed.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Iranian leaders, both from the reformist
and conservative camps, have reached a consensus to carry out
reforms in the country, but they have differences over the
conception of reforms and how to carry out.
</P>
<P>
The reformist allies of President Khatami emphasized on
political reforms to offer more freedom to the people while the
conservative camp stressed the government should focus on economic
reforms to solve economic problems facing the people.
</P>
<P>
Some conservative figures and newspapers warned the political
reforms, particularly "the U.S -style" reforms, will weaken and
threaten the theocratic rule in the country. They urged the
reformists to learn a lesson from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei ordered the reformist-dominated
Majlis to drop the debate on a motion to amend the restrictive
press law, passed by the conservatives in April before handing over
the parliament to reformists.
</P>
<P>
Reformists lodged their protest after Majlis Speaker Karrubi
announced withdrawal of the motion from the agenda. But
conservatives voiced strong support for Khamenei's decree by
holding gatherings and issuing statements in recent days.

<HEADLINE> Barak Names Ben-Ami as Acting Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Thursday morning appointed Public Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami as Acting Foreign Minister, Barak's office announced.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, a leading dovish politician in Israel, will replace
former Foreign Minister David Levy, who resigned last Wednesday due
to differences with Barak over Israel's negotiating approaches in
the talks with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami, a professor-turned-politician, has been involved in
various peace negotiations with Israel's Arab neighbors. He held
the so-called back-channel talks with Palestinian Legislative
Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) in Stockholm in May, which
laid the foundation for last month's Camp David summit talks.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old minister was born in Morocco and immigrated to
Israel in 1955. He later graduated from Tel Aviv University and got
his doctorate from Oxford University (England). As a professional
diplomat, he once served as Israeli ambassador to Spain from 1987
to 1991.
</P>
<P>
His appointment as Acting Foreign Minister will facilitate his
tour to Britain, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium and Morocco next
week, in an effort to explain to these countries' leaders Israeli
views regarding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was part of a series of cabinet reshuffle, which
began last Sunday with Barak's nomination of four ministers to hold
concurrent posts.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer has also taken up
the Construction and Housing Minister post, while Minister in Prime
Minister's Office Haim Ramon has also got an additional portfolio
of Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin will also head the Religious
Affairs Ministry, and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat will act as
National Infrastructure Minister concurrently.
</P>
<P>
The Barak cabinet had been reduced from 23 ministers to 12
ministers following a series of cabinet crises regarding the peace
talks with the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's Basic Law, however, Barak has no right to appoint
new ministers to his cabinet without Knesset (Parliament) approval,
which had begun its summer recess last Wednesday and will not
reconvene until the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
Barak still holds five ministerial posts temporarily. He is
hoping to fill the vacuum when he finishes coalition talks with
Shas, Meretz, or even the major opposition Likud party.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The extremist Abu Sayyaf group
has abducted a 30 year-old midwife in the southern Philippine
island province of Sulu, a TV report said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' biggest TV network ABS-CBN quoted initial
reports as saying that the midwife named Wilma Dasal was on her
way to a village in Talipao town, Sulu, Wednesday afternoon when a
group of armed men forced her to go with them.
</P>
<P>
However, the ABS-CBN said that the Abu Syyaf is not demanding
any ransom this time, instead saying they are willing to pay 300,
000 pesos (7,500 U.S. dollars) to Dasal's family to serve as the
midwife's dowry.
</P>
<P>
One of the Abu Sayyaf's leaders, Ghalib Andang alias Commander
Robot, reportedly wants to marry Dasal.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding hostage 14 of the 21 people
abducted in April from Malaysia, three French journalists and 13
local Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the military confirmed the Abu Sayyaf has
been paid 245 million pesos (about six million dollars) for the
release of six Malaysians, two Germans and three local Filipinos.

KAMPALA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Ministry of Health
has sent a team to Karamoja, the worst famine-hit region in
northeastern Uganda, with protein and energy concentrates for
emergency treatment of children's malnutrition.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Grows 8.8 Percent in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
rose 8.8 percent in the first half of this year from a year
earlier to 6,731.7 billion yen (63 billion U.S.dollars), marking
the first increase in a three and a half year period, the Finance
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official attributed the increase partly to a
decrease in services deficits, as the strong yen reduced expenses
that Japanese service-providers spent on overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 106.84 to the dollar in the period, compared
with 118.81 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Goods and services trade in the period posted a surplus of 4,
107.6 billion yen (38.5 billion dollars), up 3.1 percent, the
ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in the merchandise trade fell 5.2 percent to 6,559
billion yen (61.4 billion dollars), with exports rising 8.6
percent to 24,072.8 billion yen (225.3 billion dollars) and
imports surging 14.8 percent to 17,513.8 billion yen (163.9
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The surge in imports came partly from rises in crude oil prices,
which averaged 26.38 dollars a barrel in the period, up 102.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The services deficit shrank to 2,451.4 billion yen (22.9
billion dollars) from 2,931.8 billion yen (27.4 billion dollars) a
year earlier.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Georgian authorities said
Thursday that they have established contact with the abductors of
the three Red Cross workers who went missing earlier this month,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three, identified as French citizen Sophie Prokofiev,
Italian citizen Natasha Zulino, and their driver, Georgian citizen
Yuri Darchiev, were taken hostage on August 4 in the vicinity of
the Georgian-Russian border, where about 7,000 Chechen refugees
live.
</P>
<P>
Igor Kurashvili, prosecutor of Georgia's Akhmeta district, said
more information on the hostages is likely to be obtained later on
Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported in a dispatch from
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
The Tbilisi office of the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) said Georgian authorities have not supplied it with
any information about the beginning of talks with the terrorists
on the release of the hostages, and that the kidnappers have not
initiated any direct contacts with the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
However, Interfax quoted unofficial sources as saying that
Georgian law enforcement agencies are conducting talks with the
terrorists through Chechen refugees and local leaders.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Police, Soldiers Begin Searching Olympic Venues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 anti-terrorist
police, soldiers, bomb disposal experts, divers and sniffer dogs
began searching major venues in Sydney on Thursday in a final
security check before the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Security Commander Paul McKinnon said that the search
was expected to last three weeks and would culminate in all three
Olympic precincts being officially "locked down."
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the Olympics is set for September 15.
</P>
<P>
Public access to Olympic Park, Darling Harbour, the athletes'
village and all other Games locations will involve stringent
accreditation from September 1.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon said: "The key things with the searchers is for them
to be familiar with the fitout...so they recognize those items of
equipment that are foreign to the environment."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sydney's rail system and other public transport

<HEADLINE> Online Insurance Promoted in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A special insurance on-line
website company, www.eBao.com, was launched recently on the
Internet in China's leading industrial and commercial city,
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The company, involving an investment of 5 million U.S. dollars,
is open to both insurance companies and individuals in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guoliang, president of China Pacific Insurance Company,
said that a growing number of insurance firms in China are turning
to the Web to prepare themselves for increasing competition from
the outside world resulting from China's anticipated entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
China's first insurance website was launched in 1997. Major
insurance companies like Taikang Life Insurance Co., Ltd have all
since gone online to promote their business. Consumers can now get
a clear picture of those companies' assets, business scale, credit
information and business scope by browsing www.jilee.com.
</P>
<P>
China Pacific is also preparing to launch a website of its own
this year. It plans to make online transactions account for 15
percent of its total business volume by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Price to Remain Stable: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cotton prices on China's
domestic market is expected to remain stable in the coming months
this year, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
The average cotton price will probably stand at more than 8,000
yuan (964 U.S.dollars) per ton in the latter half of this year, 2,
000 yuan higher than last year's level, sources with the State
Administration of Textile Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
China plans to cap its cotton planting area to around 3.5
million hectares this year. However, the cotton output will be
less due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
There will be no cotton supply shortage because the stockpile
of cotton at the beginning of the year was quite large, an
official with the administration said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the world's cotton production, consumption and
trade will increase while the stockpile may decline in the coming
months. "But the supply and demand on the whole will not change
fundamentally and cotton prices will fluctuate between 58-61 cents
per pound," they added.
</P>
<P>
China's purchasing of cotton was pushed up to 390-420 yuan per
50 kilograms earlier this year because of recovering exports and
domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
Experts also attributed the price hike to the temporary lack of
cotton reserves and some cotton sellers.
</P>
<P>
They noted that demand for cotton may increase sometime later
this year, as oil and tow are expected to become more expensive.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Following National Security Advisor Danny Yatom's trip to the
Gulf states and chief negotiator Oded Eran's visit to Jordan last
week, Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami is off
Thursday on a journey to Turkey, Spain, Italy, and the Vatican to
brief their leadership on Israel's position at the Camp David peace
summit.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami is likely to make another trip in the near future to
Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
According to one senior Israeli diplomatic source, the purpose
of these trips is threefold: to explain Israel's position at Camp
David, to persuade third-party countries to fend off a unilateral
declaration of Palestinian statehood on September 13, and to get
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to show
flexibility on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to travel to Iran on Thursday to meet with
President Mohammad Khatami, his first visit to Iran since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Chief of General Staff Lieutenant-General Shaul Mofaz
called the West Bank city of Hebron "the most different place" in
discussions with Israel Defense Force (IDF) paratroopers serving in
the city.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Hebron, the only city divided between areas of
Israeli and Palestinian control, has been the scene of a wave of
violent incidents between Jewish settlers and Arabs. The IDF speaks
of an atmosphere of growing extremism which, to a large extent, has
been created by setters in the Jewish enclave.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is now home to 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers living in 63 settlements. The Palestinian media reported
on Wednesday that Israel agreed to evacuate the Jews from Hebron,
which evokes strong denial from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and angry response from the settlers.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator
Joseph Lieberman, an observant Jew, said on Wednesday that the time
is not yet right to transfer the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, speaking for the first time about the Middle East
since Vice President Al Gore chose him as his running mate,
asserted that he does support transferring the embassy, but it
should not be done until negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians are given a full chance at success.
</P>
<P>
This somewhat contradicts President Bill Clinton's recent
promise to review the issue.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Aryeh Deri, former leader of Israel's ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, will not start to serve his three-year jail term Sunday,
following Supreme Court President Aharon Barak's decision on
Wednesday to delay the execution of his sentence till the court
rules on his request for a second appeal hearing before an expanded
panel of justices.
</P>
<P>
On July 12, in a ruling on Deri's first appeal, a panel of three
justices upheld the Jerusalem District Court's decision to convict
him on charges of accepting bribe, aggravated grand larceny, and
fraud and breach of trust, but reduced the four-year jail sentence
handed down by the lower court to three years.
</P>
<P>
Deri, a former interior minister, was the first cabinet minister
to be sentenced to prison terms in the country's history.

<HEADLINE> Singaporean Economy Expands by 8 Pct in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's economy grew by 8.
0 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2000, bringing to
8.8 percent the growth rate for the first half of this year and
maintaining its momentum for robust growth following a seasonally-
revised 9.8 percent growth in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
This was the findings of an economic survey released by the
Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).
</P>
<P>
Except a 9.8 percent decline in the construction sector and a 1.
4 percent dip in the financial service sector, all other sectors
saw strong growth led by the manufacturing and wholesale &AMP; retail
trade sectors which expanded by 13.7 percent and 15.1 percent,
respectively, compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter also saw a 7.4 percent rise in the hotels &AMP;
restaurants sector, a 9.6 percent growth in the transport &AMP;
communications sector and a 5.0 percent expansion in the business
service sector.
</P>
<P>
The country's external trade expanded by 20.8 percent in the
2nd quarter of this year over a year ago while its manufacturing
investment commitments it absorbed in the 2nd quarter hit 2.3
billion Singapore dollars (about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The MTI said the strong growth of Singapore's economy was
powered by rising global demand for the country's products and
services, especially its semiconductors and other electronic goods,
with a 11.7 percent hike in total demand for the 2nd quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The MTI also said that the outlook for the Singaporean economy
for the rest of the year is promising and pointing to sustained
growth ahead as the global economic outlook remains positive.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the official forecast for the Singaporean economy in
2000 is raised from 5.5-7.5 percent to 7.5-8.5 percent, the MTI
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has ended its negotiations
for a 50-million-U.S. dollar credit from the World Bank to fight
the rampant HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/AIDS package would be approved by the World Bank board
of directors next month, said Kenyan Finance Permanent Secretary
Martin Luke Oduor-Otieno while addressing a regional meeting
opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The package was separate from the one approved last week, under
which the World Bank will offer 150 million dollars to Kenya to
support the country' poverty reduction program.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has to spend 3 million dollars to fight AIDS daily and
the pandemic is threatening the country's efforts to revitalize
the economy, said Oduor-Otieno.
</P>
<P>
He said the inadequacy of the country's budgetary allocation to
HIV/AIDS calls for credit from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to Oduor-Otieno, "the proportion of the country's
gross domestic product spent fighting AIDS is 3 to 4 percent."
</P>
<P>
The National AIDS Council requires 200 million dollars for the
next five years and the fund will have to be realized among other
sources and fund-raising, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on multinational pharmaceutical firms to lower prices
of drugs and urged the donor community not to tie stringent
conditions to AIDS-related loans.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Deploys More Troops in Border Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has sent
more troops to troubled Kaputa in Northern Province to reinforce
the border security following heightened armed incursions by
suspected renegade Congolese soldiers, the Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Inspector-General of Police Silas Ngangula, while confirming
the development, said the border is now safer following hundreds
of troops and policemen sent to the area.
</P>
<P>
In another development, over 700 temporary refugee shelters
have been burnt by locals in a bid to force them to move into
designated camps to improve the security situation.
</P>
<P>
Kaputa Deputy Council Secretary Elias Sampa was quoted as
saying that the burnt shelters were those of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) refugees who had refused to settle in
designated refugee camps and opted to live with the locals.
</P>
<P>
The local security management team decided to burn the
dwellings and had since organized buses to ferry the refugees to
refugee centers where they could be screened, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, hungry armed bandits entered Zambia
from the DRC at night to steal food from homes and shops, causing
terror in the border area for several months now.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blast Toll Rises to 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The toll in Tuesday's blast in
central Moscow has risen to eight after a man suffering injuries
and burns died Wednesday night, Russian media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were killed at the scene of the explosion, which
rocked an underpass near Pushkinskaya Ploshchad, a public square
not far away from the Kremlin. More than 100 others were injured
and are being treated in several local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, the most
powerful this year to hit the Russian capital, although some
officials immediately pointed their fingers at separatists of the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a series of explosions across Russia killed more
than 300 people and injured numerous others. Authorities believe
Chechen militants were behind the blasts.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Prosecutor General Yuri Biryukov said Wednesday
that no suspect has been detained for the Pushkin Square blast,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some suspects might be detained for various checks in the
course of search operations, but there are no detainees on this
particular case, Biryukov said.
</P>
<P>
Three major avenues are being pursued at the moment: a
terrorist act, hostilities between criminal groupings over the
division of trading territories in the Pushkin Square underpass
and a domestic crime resulting from personal enmity, revenge or
jealousy, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement bodies beefed up security across the country in
the aftermath of the Tuesday blast.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, an anti-terrorist operation started Tuesday evening
and all vehicles coming to Moscow are being thoroughly examined by
reinforced traffic police checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
In downtown Moscow, traffic appeared to be much lighter than
usual after the stepped-up security checks.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Oboidikhin, a spokesman for the Municipal Interior
Ministry, urged Muscovites to set up vigilante posts in apartment
building stairwells and to organize patrols of their buildings and
yards.

through one of his defense lawyers O.C. Kaligis earlier Wednesday,

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian gold medal winners
at the forthcoming Sydney Olympics will have their winning
performances made into postage stamps, on sale within 24 hours of
their success, Australia's post office said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Using digital technology, each stamp will have a print run of
200,000.

months to produce a stamp.
</P>
<P>
"During the Olympics we will shorten that to 12 to 18 hours,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Photographers would be at every final to capture the image,
which would be e-mailed to Australia Post within one hour and
dropped into a stamp template.
</P>
<P>
The stamp would be printed that night and distributed around
the country.
</P>
<P>
A further two million stamps using normal offset printing
methods would be produced within three days, Australia Post added.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has the approval of Australian and international
Olympic officials.

<HEADLINE> China Begins to "Clean Up" Scenic Spots in Western Regions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
started to move residents, hotels and other business facilities
from its nature scenic spots in the western regions to protect
their environment and restore their original outlook.
</P>
<P>
Chen Saizhou, deputy commissioner of the Aba Tibetan and Qiang
Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, said that Aba will move
restaurants and other business facilities out of Jiuzhaigou scenic
spot over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Jiuzhaigou is regarded as a "fairy land" for its unique natural
scenery. In 1992, it was listed by UNESCO as one of the World
Heritage. Currently, Jiuzhaigou has over 5,000 beds in various
hotels and inns as well as more than 1,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest hotel Nuorilang has already been removed, and the
removal of the remaining ones will be completed by 2003," Chen
said, adding that only some snack counters will be allowed in the
spot.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the area will also be moved out gradually and all
the farmland in the area will be replaced with trees to reduce
water, air and noise pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's western regions are rich in picturesque natural scenery,
and for years tourism has brought a considerable income in for
local governments. However, some local governments, too eager to
make money out of the scenic spots, have built a large number of
hotels, shops and other business facilities in these areas,
resulting in quick urbanization and worsening environment.
</P>
<P>
The Huangguoshu Great Falls, the largest in China, in Guizhou
Province has learned a good lesson from deteriorating the
environment. In 1992, Huangguoshu applied to UNESCO for being
listed as the World Heritage but was simply rejected due to sparse
forest coverage, too much unnecessary architectures and bad
environment.

<P>
An official with the China National Tourism Administration said
that China's western regions has the greatest potential in the
country's tourism sector, but he warned that to develop tourism
without considering the environment will bring disastrous
consequences.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou seems quick to learn and recently the provincial
government has mapped out a plan to move all of its residents and
business facilities from Huangguoshu over a 10-year period, and
meanwhile build a new town 8 kilometers away from the scenic spot
to accommodate tourists and residents removed.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost a total of 280 million yuan and will
raise the forest coverage in Huangguoshu to over 49 percent from
the current 10.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the well-known Stone Forest scenic spot in
Yunnan Province and Qingchenghshan--Dujiangyan scenic spot in
Sichuan have also started to dismantle buildings that do not
conform with the natural scenery.
</P>
<P>
In Yunnan's Yunshanpin Forest Park, all business facilities
have already been removed except a tea pavilion which is for
tourists to take a rest. A wooden pavement was built flanked with
wood fences to prevent tourists from stepping on the vegetation.
</P>
<P>
The protection efforts has been fruitful and tourists say that
they can again enjoy a quiet environment, lush vegetation, clean
air and clear water.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Second seeded American Pete
Sampras overwhelmed his compatriot Taylor Dent 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3)
in a hard-fought second round match at Tennis Masters Series-
Cincinnati tournament in Mason, Ohio on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the day, top-seeded American Andre Agassi was forced to

him since a minor car accident last month.
</P>
<P>
Sampras beat 19-year-old Dent despite 11 double faults. Both
served in the 130-mph (210-kph) range on occasion, but Dent served
15 aces to six for Sampras.
</P>
<P>
The start of their second-round match was delayed two hours by
rain, then was suspended in the first set for 45 minutes because
of lightning nearby.
</P>
<P>
In matches that were suspended nearly four hours because of
rain, fourth seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil eliminated Gianluca

<HEADLINE> Undiscovered Gas Reserve Around 33 TCF in Bangladesh: USGS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of the Bangladesh-U.S. joint
study, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has reached a
decision on the possible undiscovered gas resources in Bangladesh,
which is estimated to be around 33 trillion cubic feet (TCF), The
Financial Express reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
USGS expert Peter Warwick, responsible for assessing the
Bangladesh mineral resources, told the newspaper that information
so far available suggested that the commercially extractable
undiscovered gas reserve in Bangladesh would be around 33 TCF,
while discovered gas reserve around 15 TCF.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi geologists so far did not make any statement on the
undiscovered hydrocarbon resources, but privately they differed
with the estimate of the international oil companies (IOCs)
working in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi experts indicated that the undiscovered hydrocarbon
reserve would not be more than 25 TCF.
</P>
<P>
It is generally held that the IOCs or other international
organization are showing the higher gas reserve to substantiate
their advocacy for gas export through pipeline to India.
</P>
<P>
All IOCs and the U.S. government have been pressing hard to
have a decision in favor of gas export, while Bangladesh insists
not to export any gas before the gas reserve could meet the
domestic demand for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Later a seven-member team of Bangladeshi geologists would work
with the USGS team to make a final estimate on the undiscovered
gas reserve.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Growth Faces Setback for Lack of  Diversification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export growth is
facing a serious setback due to its failure in diversification of
exportable items, The Financial Express reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country has failed to make any positive growth
in the export sector over the years despite having a huge scope, a
highly-placed government source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export earnings over the years are largely
dependent on some limited products, creating a major obstacle to
the growth of the country's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Although there are around 115 categories of products in the
list of exportables, some six products, including ready-made
garments, leather and leather goods, jute and jute goods,
knitwears and frozen foods contribute nearly 92 percent to the
total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, more than 100 categories of exportable items
contribute only 8 percent to the country's total export earnings,
according to the source.
</P>
<P>
"The country's export earnings could stand at 10 billion U.S.
dollars by 2010 if the country diversifies its products as well as
export markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government launched a matching grand fund (MGF) involving
12 million U.S. dollars several months back for providing grants
to exporters in order to diversify exportable items as well as
explore export markets, but the MGF has virtually failed to make
any fruitful result.
</P>
<P>
The exporters are yet to show any positive response to the MGF
because of some procedural complexities, the source said, adding
that the authorities concerned did not consult the actual
exporters while formulating rules and regulations.

<HEADLINE> Former Osaka Governor Gets Suspended Term for Molestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Knock Yokoyama, who resigned from
the post of Osaka governor over a sex scandal in December, was
sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison, suspended for three
years, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama, 68, is the first sitting governor to have been
indicted on a molestation charge. He was found guilty of molesting
a female assistant during his reelection campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
The former governor molested the assistant, a 22-year-old
college student, for 30 minutes in his campaign van on April 8
last year, the court found.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Masayuki Kawaai said Yokoyama bears grave
responsibility and should be harshly reprimanded for the crime.
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, said he decided to hand down the suspended
sentence because Yokoyama had "resigned from his post, offered the
female student an apology and paid her 11 million yen (about 100,
000 dollars) in compensation."
</P>
<P>
Yokoyama pleaded guilty to the molestation charge and offered
an apology to the woman at the first hearing of his trial on March
21.
</P>
<P>
The woman filed a civil suit against Yokoyama in August last
year. In November, Yokoyama was ordered to pay her the
compensation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Aims for Boxing Gold at Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, which is fielding 50
athletes in 12 sports at next month's Sydney Olympic Games, aims
two medals including one gold in the boxing events, according to
reports Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Featherweight boxer Somluck Khamsing won the country's first
Olympic gold medal in the Atalant four years ago, and his Cuban
coach Juan Fontanian says he has a good chance of pulling off the
feat for a second time.
</P>
<P>
"I have great confidence in winning another gold for the
country," Somluck was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fontanian said light flyweight Suban Pannon has made
impressive progress in training sessions over the past six months
and is another major medal prospect.
</P>
<P>
"Flyweight Wichan Polrit and welterweight Parkpoom Jaengponak
should also produce some big surprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has won one gold, one silver and four bronze Olympic
medals since 1976 -- all in boxing.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, nine Thai boxers will compete in nine divisions.
Thailand is also looking to Tamarine Tanasugarn to provide some
cheer in the tennis competition.
</P>
<P>
Tamarine has reached the last 16 at Wimbledon three years in a
row. This year she lost to No. 8 Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
The Thai National Olympic Committee said the team of 28 men
and 22 women will participate in 12 sports including track and
field, swimming, badminton, weightlifting, shooting, table tennis,
windsurfing, yachting, rowing and beach volleyball.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Extends State Of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan parliament passed
Wednesday a government motion to extend the State of Emergency for
one more month by 124 to seven votes, the Island newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition United National Party refrained from
voting while the Ceylon Workers Congress and some of the Tamil
parties supported the government. The Tamil United Liberation
Front and the Sri Lanka Progressive Front voted against the motion.
</P>
<P>
 The State of Emergency is considered necessary to contain the
ongoing ethnic conflict in the north and east of the country where
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been waging a 17-
year war for a separate state during which over 60,000 persons
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament is to be dissolved by August 24 and general
elections must follow by November.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution the elections cannot be held under a
State of Emergency and the government will be compelled to lift
the emergency before elections.
</P>
<P>
The government efforts to rush through a new draft
constitution, which aims at ending the long-running war between
government forces and LTTE, and electoral reforms this week failed
due to mounting opposition from UNP, the powerful Buddhist clergy
and various other sections of the people. Consequently, the
government was compelled to postpone indefinitely the vote on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
The government is to decide the fate of the legislation -
whether it should be re-activated before the dissolution of
Parliament or whether it should be withdrawn altogether.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Angry With Belize for Expulsion of Guatemalans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala criticized Belize
on Wednesday for its recent expulsion of six Guatemalan families,
it is reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said the
eviction of 45 Guatemalans on August 1 by Belize from a border
zone of the two neighbors has undermined the confidence between
the two countries, which have border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Belize's move is contrary to the spirit of the agreements
signed in July before the Organization of American States in the
United States, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It said the case is to be investigated by a joint commission,
which is designed to cope with such problems in the border zone.
</P>
<P>
The Belize National Security Ministry said on Tuesday that the
six families had erected temporary houses in the disputed central
zone of Edward in the forest reserve of the Colombia River.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala and Belize have long involved in a territorial
dispute characterized by frequent diplomatic friction and border
incidents.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala demands the return of 12,000 square kilometers of
land claimed by Belize, which represent half of Belize's territory.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Erupts Again on Japan's Miyakejima Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Oyama, the 813-meter volcano
located at the center of Miyakejima Island, south of Tokyo,
erupted again Thursday morning, forcing nearby residents to leave,
the meteorological agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the eruption was confirmed at 6:59 a.m.,
Thursday (21:59 GMT, Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
Smoke was coming from Mt. Oyama at 6:30 a.m. (21:30 GMT,
Wednesday), Kyodo News quoted local government officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Miyakejima meteorological observatory said the smoke was
initially gray, then it turned black and was followed by volcanic
ashes.
</P>
<P>
The eruption, the fourth in less than two months, forced the
local Miyakejima authorities to issue evacuation orders to about
630 people shortly after 8:40 a.m. (23:40 GMT, Wednesday)
</P>
<P>
After confirmation of the eruption, Miyakejima Airport was
closed with all four flights between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and
Miyakejima canceled.
</P>
<P>
Miyakejima, located some 180 kilometers south of Tokyo, and
some other islands in the Izu island chain have been hit by a
series of earthquakes triggered by magma activity in the past few
months.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide ASP Market to Experience Explosive Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide application
service provider (ASP) industry is poised for explosive growth in
the next few years, a U.S. market research firm predicted
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the study of Dataquest, the market is expected to
grow from 1 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 to 3.6 billion dollars in
2000, and 25.3 billion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
"The ASP market represents a major computing revolution with
the power to dramatically redraw today's IT ecosystem based on the
delivery of application services over a network," said Dataquest's
report.
</P>
<P>
"Software licensing models, application and networking
architectures, and vendor strategies will all be impacted greatly.
Eventually, business services wrapped around application
functionality will be most useful to customers."
</P>
<P>
ASPs host software so customers do not have to install and
manage it themselves. The software is accessed from desktops and
is remotely monitored from a data center. Customers pay outside
providers to run everything from complicated enterprise software
installations to more common desktop applications, which are often
difficult to maintain.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide ASP market has been led by North America, but
Dataquest predicted that it will become much more global in the
next few years. In 1999, North America accounted for 65 percent of
ASP revenue and the percentage will decline to 45 percent by 2004.
Europe's share will grow from 20 percent last year to 32 percent
by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said the Internet is accelerating the adoption of
applications and technologies outside the United States. In
addition, European and Asian markets will be more orientated
toward "mobile" ASP applications than the U.S. mobile telecom
operators will develop more sophisticated, business-user-focused
applications, which are delivered via an ASP market.

individual medley, beating Maddie Crippen to second in 4:42.81.
</P>
<P>
However, Crippen will also bound for Sydney as top two

<HEADLINE> Detention Status of Soeharto Changed to City Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Detention status of Indonesian
former president Soeharto changed from house arrest to city arrest,
according to the South Jakarta District Court.
</P>
<P>
M. Yusuf, a clerk at the South Jakarta District Court, said the
issuance of the new status was in anticipation of the beginning of
Soeharto's corruption trial later this month.
</P>
<P>
"The new detention status for former president Soeharto was
handed over to his family through one of his defense lawyers O.C.
Kaligis earlier Wednesday," he said.
</P>
<P>
The decree on the defendant's new detention status was signed
by the head of the South Jakarta District Court Lalu Mariyun on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The city arrest status, valid for 30 days, became effective on
August 3, 2000," Yusuf was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The decree automatically nullified a previous decree, issued by
the assistant for special crimes investigation at the Jakarta
Prosecutor's Office Andi Syarifuddin on August 3, 2000, which put
the former strongman under house arrest. This decree was to have
been valid until August 22.
</P>
<P>
The South Jakarta District Court received the dossiers on
Soeharto on Tuesday, but has yet to decide on the schedule or
venue for the trial.
</P>
<P>
Lalu Mariyun hinted the initial hearing would be held after the
August 18 completion of the ongoing annual session of the People's
Consultative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Mariyun repeated that the court had yet to decide on a venue
for the trial, but insisted it would be held within the court's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 79, is accused of having misused 1.4 trillion rupiah
(150 million U.S. dollars) and 416 million U.S. dollars of state
funds, allegedly amassed through his seven tax-free charitable
foundations.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to stepped down from his presidential
office in May 1998 following an economic and political crisis in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Warns Foreigners Against Violating Banking Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian central bank has
warned that foreign currency traders and bankers violating
prudential banking rules would be expelled from the country, the
Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia (BI) Senior Deputy Governor Anwar Nasution said
on Wednesday that the central bank would now be more serious in
enforcing the country's banking regulation in a bid to stabilize
the monetary market.
</P>
<P>
"If the foreign bankers violate (the regulations), they will be
deported. We don't need those kind of people in this Republic," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that local traders and bankers proved to be violating
the regulations would be banned from entering the industry for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
To curb speculation in the rupiah (national currency), BI has
sent its inspectors to foreign exchange banks operating in the
country to ensure that they abide by the existing prudential
regulations,including a prohibition on banks exceeding the daily
20 percent net open position limit, and from opening forward
dollar contracts worth more than 5 million U.S. dollars with non-
residents.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that some 80 billion U.S. dollars in
Indonesian export earnings is parked overseas.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the on-the-spot inspection measures had helped in
the recent strengthening of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been hovering at around 8,600 lately compared to
a 21-month low of 9,570 per dollar last month.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the central bank is committed to maintaining
the current free float exchange rate system which was introduced
in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kazakh, Uzbek Presidents Reaffirm Efforts to Thwart Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh and Uzbek presidents
reaffirmed their common resolve Wednesday to thwart all attempts,
including terrorism, that might threaten the independence and
territorial integrity of the two countries, Kazakh media reported.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation, Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev and Uzbek President Islam Karimov exchanged views on
the border situation of southern Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Karimov said the Uzbek army was trying to wipe out a besieged
terrorist group in the border area. He said the Uzbek army had the
border situation under control and the conflict would not escalate.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh reports quoted a Tajik Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying that Tajikistan will adhere to the security treaty signed
by four central Asian countries to prevent terrorism. The
spokesman said Tajikistan would go all out to stop any attempts to
destroy the stability of Tajikistan and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan believed that the Islamic militants entered its
southern border from Tajikistan, but Dushanbe denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Tensions flared up in the border area between Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan on Saturday when about 100 Islamic terrorists entered
southern Uzbekistan and clashed with the Uzbek army.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic terrorists are reportedly followers of an Islamic
separatist movement that aims to create an anti-government
terrorist base in southern Uzbekistan. The movement plotted a
massive terrorist invasion into southern Kyrgyzstan a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian PM Announces Probe Results of Bugging Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov on Tuesday announced the results of a government probe into
a recent bugging scandal, claiming the Interior Ministry has not
conducted any "illegal bugging" since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kostov read a seven-page statement at a news conference held in
his official residence in Sofia. The statement said the Interior
Ministry has not conducted any "illegal bugging" since 1997, and
the ministry does not presently have overall information about
bugging devices.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the bugs uncovered in Bulgarian Public
Prosecutor Nikola Filtchev's flats were installed years ago, and
was "recidivism" conducted by former secret agent services.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, former interior minister Bogomil
Bonev, who was dismissed from office last December, and present
Interior Ministry Secretary-General Bojzhidar Popov should be
responsible for the bugging activities.
</P>
<P>
Kostov made a recommendation to President Petar Stoyanov that
General Popov be fired, the statement said. At the news conference,
Interior Minister Emanouil Yordanov suggested that Popov be
replaced by Slavcho Bosilkov, the prime minister's security
advisor and former national chief of police.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry also proposed an examination by the
government for bugs in the offices of 700 senior officials, and
the modification of relevant laws about special inspection
measures, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Filtchev revealed on July 28 that bugging devices were
uncovered in his flats in Sofia and demanded an investigation. At
the request of the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party, the
National Assembly, which was in recession, held a special meeting
last Friday and agreed on the investigation led by the Bulgarian
government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say these initial results could hardly meet the
satisfaction of the Bulgarian opposition and public opinion, and
the bugging incident is far from over.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Association to Set up Fact-Finding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) will set up a fact-finding team to investigate
allegations of match fixing during the Sanyo Indonesia Open at the
Senayan Tennis Indoor Stadium here in July.
</P>
<P>
PBSI Secretary General Leo Chandra Wiranata said that the
investigators would interview players, coaches, umpires, referees
and association officials.
</P>
<P>
"The letter from the International Badminton Federation (IBF)
dated August 4 gave us two days to get all facts about the
allegation. It'sreally difficult for me to fulfill their demand. I
told them that I could only reply to them within one or two weeks,
" he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
IBF sent a letter to PBSI in reference to a letter of
complaint made by England head coach Lars Sologub, who allegedly
suspected matchfixing in the women's doubles match between Indarti
Issoliana and Vita Marissa and Olympic qualifiers Etty Tantri and
Cynthia Tuwankotta.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged match fixing in the mixed doubles between
Indartiand Halim Heryanto and Olympic qualifiers Tri Kusheryanto
and Minarti Timur.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the non-Olympic qualifiers intentionally
lost to the qualifiers to improve the latter's world rankings
prior to the deadline of the IBF latest rank on August 31. The
latest rankings will become a reference for the Olympic drawing.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said Tuesday that Indarti did not intentionally
lose.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, the host of the 2001
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, agreed during the sports committee
meeting at Kuala Lumpust last week to stage more women's events at
the Games.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's National Sports Council (KONI) official in charge
of foreign affairs Indra Kartasasmita said that the women's events,
including weightlifting, soccer and sepaktakraw, would be featured
at the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
Sepaktakraw will feature the women's team alongside the men's
individual and team events, while netball will only feature the
women's team.
</P>
<P>
Besides these events, Malaysia also consented to stage men's
and women's beach volleyball, men's and women's mountain biking
and 1.5 kilometers downhill cycling and team events in fencing.
</P>
<P>
Indra said SEA Games council members wanted to promote women in
sports as recommended in a resolution issued in the second IOC
World Conference on Women and Sports in Paris in March.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that Malaysia, a predominantly Muslim nation,
earlier refused to include a women's event in weightlifting on
religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
"I told Malaysian officials that we have 10 Southeast Asian
female weightlifters qualified for the 2000 Olympic Games-- three
from Indonesia, three from Myanmar and four from Thailand. Why don
't we stage this?" he added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Farmers Guide English Tour (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Mama Moon" said that there are over 100 farmers turned tour
guides working on West Street. All of them can speak English as
well as she.
</P>
<P>
None of these people studied English in school. Instead, they
learned their English word by word from foreigners, said "Mama
Moon." She can communicate with tourists quite easily in at least
four foreign languages, namely English, French, German and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Although she is only able to recognize a few simple English
words, she can tell legendary stories about local scenic spots and
have casual chats with foreigners on topics as diverse as the
Great Wall or tulips in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
However, when she started to learn English five years ago, she
did not know what foreigners were talking about when they
mentioned the name "Mama Moon".
</P>
<P>
The name was given to her by an Australian girl, who left
complimentary words in Xu's notebook: "How I want to call you Mama.
You are a kind of `Mama Moon' living at the foot of `Moon Hill.'"
The hill is a local scenic spot, and the hill's formation is
shaped like a crescent.
</P>
<P>
"Mama Moon" has saved five to six notebooks full of warm
comments about her hospitality and talent. "They are an asset to
me. Whenever tourists see the comments, they develop a trust in me,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
Work as a tour guide is far from being very rewarding, but it
certainly improves the family income. However, Xu began to feel
the pressure from other tour guide professionals, whose English
skills are much better than hers, and the tourist authority now
requires tour guides to obtain certified licenses through exams
this year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure whether I can pass the exam for the license, but
if I do I would certainly continue to do this job until I'm too
old to climb the hill," said Xu, who often climbs up and down the
hill's 800 steps several times a day with tourists.
</P>
<P>
She said it has given her a lot of heartfelt joy to see
foreigners amazed by her skills of recognizing herbs and rubbing
them on the skin to ease the itch from mosquito bites.

<P>
YANGSHUO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- In Yangshuo, a major tourist
attraction in southwest China known for its superb landscape,
tourists are often surprised to find that lots of former farmers
are now becoming local tour guides. And they can speak decent
English and offer family hospitality.
</P>
<P>
"See the scenic Li River valley with this experienced English-
speaking guide. Enjoy my tranquil guesthouse and hospitality in my
local village," are the enticing slogans printed on the business
card of "Mama Moon," whose real name is Xu Xiuzhen, one of the
earliest tour guides in Yangshuo. The area is famous for its
limestone landscape in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The business card, which prints the information in both Chinese
and English, is just as professional as any business card with
such necessary information as phone number and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old country woman can be easily found on Yangshuo's
West Street, where Internet bars and restaurants are in abundance.
The street, which runs along the river, is partially made up of
century-old stone slabs that are lined up with the bars, cafes and
western food restaurants. They are all two-story white buildings
with reddish wooden window frames built to preserve the
traditional southern Chinese architecture.
</P>
<P>
"Forty yuan (4.8 U.S. dollars) for a guided trip. Fairly cheap.
Your trip needs one day. Doubt my price? Please consult with other
tour guides. Here is my business card," "Mama Moon" said, wearing
plastic sandals and carrying a bamboo hat as she bargained with a
Swedish couple in clear and silvery voice.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners did not seem in a hurry. They casually talk with
the country woman, their eyes fixed on hers, amazed by her
openness and leisure style.
</P>
<P>
To foreigners, the atmosphere mixed with old and new, east and
west, of the entertainment street is as attractive as the lush

<P>
LHASA, August 10 (Xinhua)-- Experts from Jiangsu transport
institutes and the Lhasa Transport Bureau have worked out a
blueprint to build a highway network construction project in three
years in this capital city of Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
The project is sponsored by Jiangsu Provincial Transport
Department.
</P>
<P>
The project will concentrate on renovating and upgrading
existing highways. Two horizontal and two longitudinal trunk lines
and four key highway sections will make up the basic framework of
the network within two years.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa will also reinforce highway construction along famous
local scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
As the region has no access to water and railway transport
services, highways play a vital role in developing the local
economy. Highways handle 92 percent of the cargo transport in
Lhasa with the remainder covered by air and pipeline services.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Built High Walls to Control Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Evidence taken from documents and
tombstones in east China's Anhui Province show that people in the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) knew how to control fires.
</P>
<P>
In areas near picturesque Mount Huangshan in southern Anhui
there are a number of well-preserved buildings in ancient styles.
</P>
<P>
The areas have become increasingly tourist attractions in
recent years, but few foreign or Chinese visitors know why the
ancient buildings have been so well preserved.
</P>
<P>
Most of the buildings have high walls, and local residents
asserted that their ancestors built the walls so high for security
purposes.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the major function of the walls was to control the
spread of fires, according to local annals and tombstones
unearthed over the past few years in the city of Huangshan,
archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the tombstones, fires used to break out
frequently in Huizhou (today's Huangshan). Then a prefect who
governed Huizhou in the Ming Dynasty ordered people to build
courtyard walls higher than their building roofs, making it
difficult for flames to reach other buildings.
</P>
<P>
The tombstone, which eulogizes the official's achievements,
also says that he ordered that courtyards be shared by no more
than five households to diminish losses caused by fires.
</P>
<P>
The documents indicate that lanes and watch towers were also
built in such a way as to guard against fires.
</P>
<P>
Li Jun, a fire brigade official in the city of Huangshan, told
Xinhua that the fire prevention concepts of the Ming Dynasty are
still useful for urban planning today.
</P>
<P>
Two villages in the area, Xidi and Hongcun, which have a number
of well-preserved ancient buildings, are applying to United
Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
to join the list of world heritage sites.

display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
The Kingdom of Qin was one of the major kingdoms during the
Spring and Autumn Period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists begun excavation of the No.1 tomb
between 1976-1986 and unearthed more than 3,500 relics. The No.1
tomb was listed under state-level protection in 1988. The grave is
59.4 meters long, 38.8 meters wide and 24.5 meters deep.

<HEADLINE> Project to Save Damaged Ozone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China has begun a nine-year
program to phase out the use of ozone-depleting substances as
cleaning agents to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jirong, deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration, called the program China's latest
effort to implement the Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting
Substances (MPODS), which is expected to finish by late 2009.
</P>
<P>
The program targets industrial enterprises, including
electronics, post and telecommunications, aerospace, aviation,
textiles, machinery, medical appliances, automobile and precision
instruments, which traditionally use ozone-depleting substances as
cleaning agents during production.
</P>
<P>
Carbon tetrachloride (CTC) use will be banned after the year of
2004. The production and consumption of two other major ozone-
depleting cleaning agents in China -- CFC-113 (a kind of
chlorofluorocarbon) and chlorothene Nu -- will be completely
banned by the end of the program.
</P>
<P>
All of them will be gradually replaced by substances that do
not hurt the ozone layer and the environment, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by 13 developed countries in 1989, over 170 countries
have ratified the MPODS or its Vienna Convention, making the
protocol a great protector of the earth's thinning ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Approving the protocol in 1991, China has cut its production
and consumption of ozone-depleting substances by 50,000 tons. This
year it has also met the target control levels for the production
and use of major chlorofluorocarbons.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the multilateral fund from the protocol, China
completed in early 1999 two years of research needed to completely
replace ozone-depleting cleaning agents.
</P>
<P>
Last March, the multilateral fund of the protocol approved
China's action program and donated 5.2 million U.S. dollars to it.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ransom Payment Stirs up New Worries in Philippines  by Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The officially-admitted ransom
payment in the Philippine government's effort to resolve the
ongoing Sulu hostage crisis has stirred up new worries over the "
future security problem" in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is really difficult to deny," Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora was quoted as saying Wednesday by the Philippine Post, one
of the country's leading daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Zamora made the comment when
reacting to a military report that the Abu Sayyaf has collected a
total of 245 million pesos (about six million U.S. dollars) for
the release of some of their dozens of captives.
</P>
<P>
Previous government denials that the Abu Sayyaf was being paid
ransom collapsed on Monday when Angelo Reyes, chief staff of the
Philippine armed forces, confirmed the amount of ransoms already
paid to the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
However, Zamora said the payments were being made "definitely
without the consent" of the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
He added that "even if we say don't do it, that the government'
s policy is no ransom, when the time comes they find a way to pay.
"
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is the government of the Philippines can not
stop all of that because these are foreign individuals, foreign
agencies, foreign governments that are paying," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He did not identify the foreign governments, agencies or
individuals allegedly making the payments. Foreign governments
whose nationals are among those held hostage have said they
support Manila's "no-ransom policy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government chief negotiator Robert Aventajado also
admitted that "there are many parallel negotiations that could
have led to payment of ransoms."
</P>
<P>
So far, the Abu Sayyaf has released six Malaysians, two Germans
and three local Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is still holding hostage 14 of the 21 people
abducted in April from Malaysian diving resort of Sipadan and then
moved to the southern Philippine island province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The 14 Sipadan hostages consist of three Malaysians, two
Germans, two French citizens, two Finns, two South Africans and
two Filipinos and a Lebanese woman. The rebels are also holding
three French journalists and 13 local Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Critics expressed fear that the country has become the "ransom
capital of the world", saying the military's admission of the
ransom payments "indicates a breakdown of government policy on the
hostage problem."
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen said the Abu Sayyaf, which claims to be
fighting for an Islamic state but has been widely deemed to be
bandits, had been using a big portion of the money to buy weapons.
</P>
<P>
The solons warned the Philippine government to brace for "
future security problems," saying that the government would face "
a much bigger problem" once the Sulu hostage crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
House Deputy Speaker Daisy Avance-Fuentes pointed out that the
Abu Sayyaf's loot is already three times bigger than the proposed
budget of the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Biazon, former military chief of staff and also
incumbent Senate defense committee chairman, cited military
reports that the Abu Sayyaf is using ransom payments to amass a
stockpile of arms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado expressed alarm over
the flooding of high-powered ammunition in Sulu provincial capital
of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
He said the price of an M-14 rifle on the Jolo black-market has
risen from about 20,000 pesos (500 dollars) to 60,000 pesos (1,500
dollars) due to the increased demand from the cash-rich Abu Sayyaf
members.
</P>
<P>
"This is causing a big problem because it appears the Abu
Sayyaf followers are now buying arms," Mercado said
</P>
<P>
The Philippine defense chief claimed that the arms will be used
by the Abu Sayyaf rebels to retaliate against the government and
commit more abductions.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence reports also said that several members of
the bandit group were spotted to have left their jungle hideout in
Sulu on board a high-speed boat in search of potential foreign
hostages in neighboring islands.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Welcomes Lifting of Pinochet's Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
expressed Wednesday its respect for the Chilean Supreme Court's
decision to strip retired general Augusto Pinochet of his
parliamentary immunity as lifetime senator.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Foreign Ministry said in a brief communique that "
the deprivation of immunity for General Pinochet is a sovereign
decision of the Chilean justice institutions."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry added that the Chilean justice
institutions are legal to decide the fate of Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Supreme Court Tuesday stripped Augusto Pinochet,
former Chilean president and commander-in-chief of the Army, of
his immunity from prosecution, paving the way for the 84-year-old
man to be forced to stand trial for alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic officials here said the communique of the Mexican
Foreign Ministry is very unusual, because the country
traditionally avoid to comment on internal affairs of other
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States may send
hundreds of military trainers to Nigeria and Ghana to help train
troops for the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), a
Pentagon official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 40 U.S.
military trainers are currently in Nigeria to look into what is
needed to train and equip up to five Nigerian battalions for
peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
The trainers will then go to Ghana to make a similar assessment
before reporting back and making relevant recommendations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We could expect up to 200 folks (U.S. military trainers) to go,
" the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the trainers could be in the region for up to ten
months depending on how much training each unit needs.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there are "no plans for U.S. forces going
into Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Confirming the U.S. plan to send trainers to Africa, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Wednesday that the move was
geared to "trying to help stabilize the situation in Sierra Leone"
where hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers were taken hostage
by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in May before releasing
them in batches over two months.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL was sent to Sierra Leone to support a peace agreement
signed by the government, the RUF and other rebel groups on July 7,
1999 after an eight-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> Dorres Sets American Record in 100m Freestyle Heats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 33-year-old veteran, who came out of a seven-year
retirement in July last year, proved that age is indeed a virtue
as she downed former world-record holder 27-year-old Jenny
Thompson in the heats of the women's 100m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
The previous record of 57.88 was set up by Thompson in the Pan
Pacific Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
In other preliminaries, Ed Moses came thorugh as expected in
the men's 100m breaststroke with a time of 1:01.19, while American
record-holder and 1996 Olympian Jeremy Linn had a disappointing
performance, finishing 31st with a time of 1:04.74.
</P>
<P>
Michael Norment's goal of becoming the first African-American
Olympic swimmer was also sunk in this event, as he touched 26th in
1:04.55.
</P>
<P>
Teen sensation Kaitlin Sandeno proved that she is not to be
taken lightly in the women's 400m individual medley as she posted
the fastest preliminary time of 4:44.18, but she will be
challenged by Christina Teuscher (4:44.26), Madeline Crippen (4:46.
13), Maggie Bowen (4:48.96), and Kristine Quance-Julian (4:49.10)
in the finals to be staged Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In the other finals of the day, Chad Carvin was the top
qualifier as he swam the fastest in the heats of the men's 400m
freestyle, with a 3:49.63.
</P>
<P>
Eric Vendt will also challenge for an Olympic spot as he
clocked the second-fastest time of 3:51.67.
</P>
<P>
Along with the two finals, the semifinals of the men's 100m
breaststroke and women's 100 freestyle will also be competed on
Wednesday evening, with their finals to be held on Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The top two finishers in each event's finals qualify for the
United States Olympic Swimming Team.

<HEADLINE> Tom Dolan Skips Freestyle to Focus on Individual Medley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order not to mess up with the schedule, Dolan, 24, decided
to skip his first chance on the 400m freestyle on Wednesday, the
first day of the eight-day U.S. Olympic swimming trials in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Still recovering from his knee surgery in May, 1999, Dolan,
considered to be the best American in the 400m freestyle, will
show up for the 400m medley on Thursday as he still holds the
world record of 4:12.30 set up in Rome in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a local newspaper challenged the swimmer by predicting
that he wouldn't win either the 400m or 200m individual medleys at
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
With little fanfare, Tom Wilkens, 24, has become one of the
country's most dominant swimmers, winning the 200m individual
medley at the 1999 Pan Pacific with Dolan still on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens then beat the world-record holder in the 400m at this
year's spring nationals with a time of 4 minutes 13.84 seconds,
the best by an American in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of guys out there that have a shot at making the
team. I'm only concerned with what I've got to do," said Dolan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to allow
foreign investors into its water infrastructure to tackle
shortages that could get worse in the future, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the sector has been a State monopoly. A foreign-
owned water project called Vivendi Waterworks will begin supplying
tap water in Chengdu, capital of southwest Sichuan province, in
early 2002.
</P>
<P>
Similar foreign-funded projects are under way in the cities of
Tianjin and Beijing, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China badly needs advanced water treatment technology, new
management structures and more capital, said Wang Yuqing, deputy
director of the State Environmental Protection Administration.
</P>
<P>
The country has long had serious water shortages. There is only
2,400 cubic meters of water per person, one fourth of the world's
average level.
</P>
<P>
Besides, low water prices and poor treatment facilities have
aggravated the problems.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Expresses Keenness to Keep Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations on Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is keen to keep Palestinian-
Israeli negotiations on track, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
political advisor Osama al-Baz has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Cairo Foreign Press Association late Wednesday,
al-Baz said that Palestinian-Israeli contacts are underway at
different levels in the hope that progress would be made during the
coming two weeks.
</P>
<P>
He also said that President Mubarak has been in constantly
contact with the parties concerned and received messages from U.S.
President Bill Clinton and other world leaders to continue efforts
for a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the most recent talks at Camp David in the U.S., Israel
and the Palestinians failed to solve their difference over final
status issues and the hope to conclude a permanent peace deal by
September is remote.
</P>
<P>
Egypt helps facilitate Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, al-Baz
said. He denied forcing the Palestinians to take harder stances
during the failed Camp David talks. Egypt wants a Palestinian-
Israeli agreement based on U.N. resolutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
On U.S. democrat presidential candidate Al Gore's selection of
Jewish senator Jospeh Lieberman as his running mate, the Egyptian
official said that Lieberman had not adopted stands hostile to
Arabs or Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman, added al-Baz, is a friend of Egypt and joined other
senators last July in urging President Clinton to go ahead with
implementing a free trade framework agreement with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it is too early to talk about postponing the
declaration of Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his recent visit to Syria and his meeting with
President Bashar al-Assad, he said that Bashar has veteran aides
who can help him in handling problems efficiently and open-
mindedly. Bashar was formally sworn in as Syrian president on July
17 and his father, late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, died
suddenly on June 10.

<HEADLINE> PCC to Reconsider Statehood Declaration Early September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestine National
Council (PNC) Salem Zanoun said here on Thursday that the Palestine
Central Council (PCC) would hold an "important session" early
September to reconsider Palestinian statehood timing.
</P>
<P>
The PCC, the 129-member central council of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) will discuss the report of the PLO
Executive Committee on the Palestinian statehood declaration,
Zanoun told reporters. But he declined to specify the date of the
PCC session.
</P>
<P>
The PCC is negotiating with Islamic Resistence Movement (Hamas)
and Islamic Jihad the possibility of their participation in the
coming PCC session as observers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad and its larger rival Hamas are violently opposed
to the Oslo peace accords signed by Israel and the Palestinians in
1993 and since then have carried out attacks that have claimed the
lives of dozens of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Early July, the PCC asserted that a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital would be declared on September 13.
</P>
<P>
However, the final-status talks between the Palestinians and
Israel have faltered due to the failure of the Camp David summit on
July 25.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the United States and some major European countries
including Russia, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands have
declared opposition to unilateral Palestinian statehood
declaration.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister May Hold Talks With Arafat: Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may hold
talks in Norwegian capital of Oslo this weekend, Israel's Ha'aretz
daily website reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The website report said that Peres, former Israeli prime
minister and a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his efforts to help
bring about the Oslo Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, will arrive
in Oslo on Friday and stay for around 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who just landed in Moscow on Thursday as part of a
explanation tour aimed at drumming up support for Palestinian stand
in talks with Israel, is also expected to arrive in Oslo on Friday
for a 24-hour visit, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders are scheduled to brief Norwegian Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland on the
Middle East peace process following the botched Camp David summit
last month.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, failed to achieve a breakthrough
toward a comprehensive Palestinian-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
The website quoted Leif Roessaak, information officer of the
Israeli embassy in Oslo, as saying that "it cannot be confirmed
that the two (Peres and Arafat) will meet."
</P>
<P>
If they really hold talks, it will be the first direct talks
between Arafat and a senior Israeli official since the failure at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who was dealt a humiliation in the voting for a new
president in the Knesset (Parliament) on July 31, has swiftly
recuperated from the defeat and returned to the political
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, he held secret talks with Palestinian Legislative
Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) and reportedly submitted
several "new ideas," which he hoped could break the current
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

get back their lands and basic rights.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the Palestinian people have no option but to adopt
extensive struggle against the occupiers to get back their basic
rights and lands, Rafsanjani told visiting Palestine leader Yasser
Arafat.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Vice-President Visits Rebel-Controlled Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Vice-President Joe
Demby visited a United Nations peacekeepers' base in Daru, a
former stronghold of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in
the diamond-rich east of the country early this week, Sierra Leone
State Radio reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Demby has been the first government official to visit the RUF-
controlled area since the break-out of the civil war in 1991, and
was welcomed by an Indian battalion of peacekeepers from the U.N.
mission in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL, based in Daru.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMSIL launched a successful military operation last month
to rescue about 200 Indian peacekeepers, who had been surrounded
by the RUF in Daru for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
The RUF took about 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage in early May
in violation of the Lome Peace Accord signed in July last year
with Sierra Leone's President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The RUF refused to handover weapons and still controlled
diamond mining areas in the north and east of the war-torn west
African country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Lower Interest Rates to Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced a plan Thursday to give lower interest rates to college
students who make their loan payments promptly for the first 12
months, a move that would save them and their parents roughly 600
million U.S. dollars over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the announcement at a round-table discussion at
Depaul University in Chicago City in Illinois State.
</P>
<P>
"I think helping people go to college is number one," Clinton
said. "If I didn't have a chance to go, I wouldn't be here today."
</P>
<P>
Under Clinton's plan, those making new loans directly from the
federal student loan system will receive an immediate interest
rebate equal to 1.5 percent of the loan. Students, who consolidate
existing loans under the federal student loan system and send in
the first year's payments on time, will get a 0.8 percentage point
break in their interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The White House estimates that the changes will help 1.7
million students taking new loans in this coming academic year,
and would save more than 500 dollars annually for a student with
10,000 dollars in loans.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Offers Condolences to Spanish Victims in Terrorist Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Thursday offered his condolences to the families of victims
in the recent spate of terrorist attacks in Spain and condemned
the use of violence.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to his Spanish counterpart, Josep Pique, Dini said,
"At this moment of pain, I would like to express my feelings of
solidarity and those of the Italian people and I ask you to convey
my condolences to the families of the victims and those who, once
again, have been made to innocently suffer."
</P>
<P>
"I wish to assure you that the Italian government feels
particularly close to Spain and the Spanish people in these tragic
circumstances," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the minister expressed "strong condemnation of
any form of violence and acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Dini's message followed Wednesday's killing of Spanish army
officer Franciso Casanova in the northern city of Pamplona, the
second assassination in as many days.
</P>
<P>
Casanova was the ninth victim this year of terrorist acts
attributed to the Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
ETA has killed some 800 people since it began a campaign in
1968 for the independence of the Basque area in northern Spain and
southwestern France.
</P>
<P>
The group, which ended a 14-month cease-fire in December 1999,
has stepped up its terrorist activities over the past month.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, five people were killed in less than 24
hours in three separate explosions.

UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official
Thursday met with a senior diplomat from the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) to convey the U.N.'s "deep concern" at the arrest
and detention of Britons and Canadians by the Yugoslav government,
a U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the spokesman for U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, said, "Bernard Miyet, the (U.N.) under-
secretary-general for peacekeeping operations, met with the charge
d'affaires of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in order to
convey to him the deep concern of the organization at the arrest
of two British nationals working with UNMIK (the United Nations
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo) as well as two Canadian
citizens arrested at the same time."
</P>
<P>
The charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United
Nations is Ambassador Vladislav Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
"Miyet, on behalf of the secretary-general, demanded access to
the detained UNMIK members by representatives of the organization.
He further demanded that the Yugoslav authorities honor their
obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and
grant immediate access to the detained persons by representatives
of their governments," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Miyet demanded similar access for the government of the
Netherlands to its nationals arrested by the Yugoslav authorities
some time ago. He insisted that all the detained be allowed access
to a lawyer of their choice," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Jovanovic undertook to convey these concerns to the relevant
authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the statement
said. "He expressed his conviction that access to the Dutch
nationals by their government had already been granted and that
access to the British and Canadian nationals to their governments
would be granted in a very short time."
</P>
<P>
The two British nationals are reportedly two British policemen
serving with the UNMIK, Adrian Prangnell and John Yore, and
Canadians Shaun Going and his nephew Liam Hall.
</P>
<P>
All four were arrested on the border between the Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro and the Yugoslav province of Kosovo on the
night of August 1-2, and detained on suspicion of terrorism. Four
Dutch nationals were also arrested though details of that incident
were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
"A military prosecutor in Podgorica (a Yugoslav city) has
submitted a request to bring an investigation against these
nationals for attempted terrorism, violation of Yugoslav
territorial integrity, infiltration of weaponry and armaments into
Yugoslav territory and prevention of military officials from
carrying out their duties," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the U.N. Security Council said Yugoslavia had
disregarded its international obligations in connection with the
detention of these foreigners, and called on Belgrade to fulfill
the requirements of international law.
</P>
<P>
A statement read to the press by the president of the Security
Council, Hasmy Agam of Malaysia, said, "Members of the Security
Council expressed their concern over the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia's disregard of its international obligations with
regard to the arrest and detention of the two British, two
Canadian and four Dutch citizens."
</P>
<P>
The council members "urged the FRY authorities to fulfill all
of the requirements of the relevant provisions of international
law without further delay," Hasmy said.
</P>
<P>
This was a reference to the Vienna Convention on Consular
Relations dealing with access by consular officials, as well as by
U.N. representatives in the case of those serving with the world
body.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Teenager Megan Quann broke
her own American record in the 100-meter breaststroke at the U.S.
Olympic swimming trials in Indianapolis on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quann, 16, clocked in one minute 7.12 seconds in her heat, the
fastest of the year in the world, to beat her national mark of 1:
07.54 set in March. However, her timing was 0.60 seconds off the
world record held by Penny Heyns of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy with my swim today, but I'm not satisfied. I
can go even faster tonight. I want to break the world record and I
know I can do it," Quann said.
</P>
<P>
Quann, who is to compete in the 100m semifinals tonight, hopes
to become Olympic teammates with Klete Keller, 18, and Kaitlin
Sandeno, 17, who already made the Olympic team on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In other heats of the day, Lenny Krayzelburg, world record
holder in the men's 100m backstroke, won the preliminaries at 54.
33, the fastest of the year in the world but missed his world mark
by 0.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Neil Walker, who won seven medals at the short-course world
championships this year, finished second in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Brooke Bennett, the 800m freestyle Olympic champion, won the
400m freestyle heats at 4:08.87, more than two seconds ahead of
the next-fastest qualifier Diana Munz (4:11.24).
</P>
<P>
Tom Wilkens beat world record holder Tom Dolan in the heats of
the 400m individual medley in 4:16.91. Dolan was second-fastest
at 4:18.89.
</P>
<P>
Courtney Shealy became the fastest qualifier in the women's
100m backstroke at 1:02.13, followed by B.J. Bedford in 1:02.19
and American record holder Lea Maurer in 1:02.58, a high school
English teacher who won two medals at the 1992 Olympics, and Beth
Botsford in 1.02.93, gold medalist in the 100 backstroke as a 15-
year-old at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
As expected, six-time Olympic medalist Angel Martino, 33,
withdrew from tonight's final in the 100m butterfly, even though

Thursday for allegedly being abusive to the crew of the jumbo jet

offense of disorderly behavior towards the plane's crew. They were
taken to a police station nearby and later were released on bail,
pending further inquiries, for four weeks.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Govt Urged to Put in Place Civil Servant Resettlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for the Public
Sector of Zimbabwe which represents 170,000 civil servants Friday
appealed to the government to put in place a policy on the
resettlement of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The union noted that its members are being discriminated in the
fast-track land resettlement program launched recently by the
government.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Vice-President and Chairman of the Land
Acquisition Committee Joseph Msika, General Secretary of the union
Pesanai Mazambani said there seemed to be no consideration on
civil servants who wanted to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
"We wonder if this anomaly is deliberate or genuine," Mazambani
said. "It is unfortunate that civil servants now feel that they
are being discriminated upon."
</P>
<P>
Considering that the government would like to reduce the civil
servants by 20,000, the organization was suggesting that those who
would be retrenched be considered for resettlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced to acquire 5 million hectares of
land to resettle landless Zimbabweans.

JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Deputy Defence
Minister Victor Simunja said Friday that the presence of the
Angolan government troops on the Namibian frontier should not be
blamed for the insecurity in the northeastern Namibian region of
Kavango, the Namibian Press Agency reported.

The Namibian government last December allowed the Angolan

springboard to launch attack on the UNITA rebels.

Speaking during a Kavango economic review panel discussion,
Simunja said the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) rebels have crossed into Namibia since 1994,
forcing President Sam Nujoma to close the border between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the situation in Kavango can not be described
as war but rather bandit activities and robberies, adding the
Namibian security forces are trying to get the situation in the
border areas back to normal.

<TEXT>

LUANDA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A UN humanitarian agency Friday
appealed to the international community for a 150-million-U.S.-
dollar grant to support the humanitarian operation in the war-torn
country, the Angolan official news agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
made the appeal in a report, which says that this amount is part
of a request made by the UN Angola-based agency in the framework
of the intermediary revision of the consolidated appeal for Angola
launched on July 26 in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 percent of the funds initially provided under the
appeal were used in the last six months, while 14 projects were
dropped in order to make the programs and funds meet, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
According to Angop, OCHA reviewed the humanitarian operations
it carried out in Angola over the last six months and came up with
proposals for the future actions for the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The OCHA report says that the agency is in charge of food
supply to 1.9 million displaced people among a total of some 3.7
million displaced persons in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The agency's main activities are the promotion of the self-
sufficient projects for the displaced people through the expansion
of agricultural programs, the reduction of mortality through the
implementation of water and sanitation programs countrywide, and
support for maternal-infant projects.

</P>
<P>
On his turn, the head of the ADB visiting delegation Daniel
Tembe said that the talks with various Angolan institutions were
fruitful, adding that a technical commission will stay in the
country to identify projects which might be financed by the
African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the resumption of the relationship between
the ADB and the Angolan government is a positive action, which
will improve Angola's image, not only before ADB but also other
partners.
</P>
<P>
The ADB mission, that has been in Angola since Tuesday, already
met officials from the ministries of
finance, planning, public works, transports and telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Called to Guard Right Over Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday called on Zimbabweans to cherish and guard their
hard-won independence and sovereign right over their natural
resources, of which land was the most important.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of people at the National Heroes Acre in
Harare to mark the Heroes Day, Mugabe said people should remember
that it was the desire for freedom, national sovereignty,
democracy, peace and unity that impelled freedom fighters to
dedicate and sacrifice their own lives.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of liberation war veterans have occupied more than 1,
000 white-owned farms since February to demand acceleration of
land redistribution process.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has adopted a fast-track approach by
designating over 3,000 white farms for acquisition without
compensation under the amendment of the Land Acquisition Act.
</P>
<P>
"There is now quite a greater part of the world which has
understood the situation and strongly supports us," Mugabe said.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Call for Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A two-day ministerial meeting on
how to mobilize resources to fight HIV/AIDS ended here Friday with
health and finance ministers from east, central and southern
Africa calling for a total debt cancellation.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important resource mobilization initiatives
identified in this meeting is the total debt cancellation," Kenyan
State Minister Marsden Madoka said in his keynote speech to
officially close the conference.
</P>
<P>
A total cancellation of the external debts will release a
significant amount of resources which can be channeled to the
crusade against the epidemic, Madoka said.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries spend about one third of the Domestic
Gross Product on debt service to Western countries, while less
than 5 percent on the combat against the pandemic, according to
the Commonwealth Regional Health Community Secretariat, the
organizer of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"I also urge member states to continue working collectively for
the external debt cancellation," Madoka said, adding: "I believe a
collective voice would provide a great opportunity to carry out
the debt cancellation agenda."
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's Minister for Health and Social Affairs P. K.
Dlamini strongly criticized western countries for their inaction
toward the suffering of Africans, asking where "the conscience of
the West" is.
</P>
<P>
Malawi's Deputy Minister of Health and Population Phillip
Bwanali suggested member countries to lobby the parliaments of the
developed countries directly in a bid to get debt cancellation and
more resources for activities against the HIV/AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration of the conference, ministers agreed that
resources allocated for AIDS from governments, international
agencies and donors are inadequate and innovative means of
providing community, national and regional funds need to be
developed.
</P>
<P>
Access to affordable medicines is one of the most critical
obstacles to improving HIV/AIDS preventive and care services and
regional and national methods of group purchasing must be explored
to reduce costs and expand coverage, according to the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The conference was the first regional one by health and finance
ministers, showing the political commitment to fighting the HIV/
AIDS. A total of 14 ministers or deputy ministers from 11
countries, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Swaziland
and Mozambique, attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Concerned Over Sudan Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday voiced its concern over rising violence in Sudan where
government bombing of rebel-controlled towns has narrowly missed U.
N. operations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press by the president of the
Security Council, Hasmy Agam of Malaysia, said, "Members of the
Security Council shared the concern expressed by the secretary-
general regarding the recent escalation of violence and,
particularly, the repeated aerial bombings around United Nations
and other civilian support services."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the closed-door consultations of the
15-nation body.
</P>
<P>
The Council members have asked the U.N. Secretariat to provide
a briefing on the security and humanitarian situation in Sudan,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
At least eight civilians were killed and 200 others wounded in
recent bombing strikes on the southern Sudanese towns of Mapel and
Tonji, reports said.
</P>
<P>
On August 7, government forces dropped some 18 bombs in the
vicinity of U.N. facilities at Mapel, where a U.N. relief aircraft
that had been cleared by the government for a flight was parked on
an airstrip at the time of the raid.
</P>
<P>
These latest bombings caused the temporary suspension of
flights for a U.N.-led relief effort called Operation Lifeline
Sudan (OLS) to allow for a reassessment of the security situation
in the northern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) and other armed
rebel groups have been fighting the Sudanese government for at
least 17 years for greater autonomy for the mainly Christian and
animist south. An estimated 2 million people have been killed in
the conflict and related famine.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A Nepalese U.N.
peacekeeper in East Timor died from wounds sustained in a gunfire
with a group of militia northeast of the city of Suai, the U.N.
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said the dead
was one of four Nepalese U.N. troops who were wounded in the
skirmish along with an East Timorese civilian.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said two of the wounded soldiers were taken to
the capital Dili, where one died, and the wounded were treated at
a military hospital of the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in Suai.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAET, which includes some 8,000 troops from more than 30
countries, is helping prepare East Timor for independence.
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of recent clashes between U.N. troops
and pro-Jakarta militia who have crossed into East Timor from
Indonesia's West Timor.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed On Earnings Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Thursday with the Dow rising and most other indexes falling on
fears of slow corporate earnings in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
2.93 at 10,908.76. The blue chip index fell 71.06 points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 93.51 at 3,759.99 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 12.62 at 1,460.25.
</P>
<P>
Fears of slow earnings in the second half of the year emerged
in the market as Gap announced that its second-half earnings might
be lower than earlier expectations. Gap was down.
</P>
<P>
The fears spread to the technology sector. Shares of
semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials fell despite
posting strong earnings in its fiscal third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Earnings fears replaced worried about higher interest rates. A
new Federal Reserve report on the slowing U.S. economy Wednesday
eased worries about more rate hikes, which had dominated the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said
in the latest Weekly Economic &AMP; Financial Commentary that the
Federal Reserve will almost certainly be on hold when the central
bankers meet on the rate issue on August 22.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.32 at 659.25 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 5.85 at 501.65. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.95 at 910.26.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,490 down, 1,359 up and 525 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 937.02 million shares from 1.05 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaigns in South, McCain Joins Bush in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and his running mate Joseph Lieberman campaigned in Atlanta,
Georgia, Thursday, vowing to vigorously contest the Republican-
tilted South in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell what the core of this whole struggle is all
about, it's the economy," said Gore. "Instead of a triple dip
recession we've seen a tripling of the stock market in the last
eight years."
</P>
<P>
Joining the new Democratic ticket were four Southern governors
who want to push welfare reform as an issue in the region. They
are Roy Barnes of Georgia, Don Siegelman of Alabama, Paul Patton
of Kentucky and James Hunt of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
Gore promised that if elected, he would seek "the next
generation of welfare reform, to encourage responsible fatherhood.
"
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States now has the fewest number of
people on welfare, 6.6 million, since 1968,
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arizona Senator John McCain joined Texas Governor
George W. Bush in a campaign rally in California Thursday to reach
out for independent and swing votes in the nation's most populous
state.
</P>
<P>
McCain praised the Texas governor as "a man who will restore
dignity and honor to the Oval Office" as the two began a three-day
West Coast campaign swing by train.
</P>
<P>
"I support Governor Bush and I am grateful to him and I am
proud of him," said McCain.
</P>
<P>
McCain won seven primaries before withdrawing from the race in
March.
</P>
<P>
Bush told several thousand supporters that he was "a better
candidate because of John McCain" and the Republican Party had
been strengthened by McCain's strong challenge.
</P>
<P>
Bush campaign hopes that Democrats and independents who
supported McCain in California's March 7 presidential primary
might switch to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
The two will campaign together in California, Washington state
and Oregon.

UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Four U.N. Nepalese
peacekeepers in East Timor were wounded Thursday when the U.N.
troops clashed with a group of militia northeast of the city of
Suai, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said, "Two of

been evacuated to the U.N. military hospital in Dili."

The spokesman said a civilian bystander was also wounded in the
gunfight.

The people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in August 1999
for independence. The UNTAET, which includes some 8,000 troops
from more than 30 countries, is helping prepare East Timor for
independence.

<HEADLINE> New Radar Devices Installed Against Smugglers Along Italian Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Finance Police Thursday
inaugurated the first in a series of new radar devices to track
sea-borne smugglers and admitted that criminals were shifting
routes and changing methods in an effort to elude authorities.
</P>
<P>
The radar system, installed along with new two-way radios at
the naval station in Bari, was the latest step in a high-tech plan
to beef up police resources, which apparently were beginning to
have an effect.
</P>
<P>
The plan includes spending 2.5 million U.S. dollars on a total
of four new coastal radar setups, to be operated by various police
agencies, as well as new two-way radio systems.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Israeli-built radar system was capable of
spotting a high-speed motor craft up to 40 miles away and would
allow operators to distinguish between a solid hull motor boat and
a rubber motor craft, which would affect the specific action taken
by police.
</P>
<P>
The finance police's officer, Edoardo Esposito, said the fight
against smugglers by sea and by land is a "transnational
phenomenon" for which his department has mobilized 1,700 agents,
700 boats and nine helicopters, and plans to increase the total
number of armored off-road vehicles in circulation to 45, by the
end of September.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Authorizes Extradition of Drug Lord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
authorized Thursday the extradition to the United States of
Alberto Orlandez Gamboa, considered to be head of the Atlantic
Coast drug traffickers' cartel, said the Republic's Presidency.
</P>
<P>
The extradition of Orlandez Gamboa, alias "The Snail" (El
Caracol), was authorized by a decree signed by President Andres
Pastrana and his cabinet, said a presidential communique.
</P>
<P>
"The Snail," detained on June 6, 1998 in Baranquilla (capital
of the Atlantic department, northern Colombia), is claimed by a
court of a southern district of New York State (the United States)
for charges of distributing 800 kilos of cocaine, money laundrying
and conspiring to bring in this drug.
</P>
<P>
Orlandez Gamboa's extradition was approved in a preliminary way
Tuesday by the Supreme Court, which answered affirmatively to the
request made by U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
If sent to the United States, "The Snail" would be the third
Colombian extradited to that country since 1997, when the
possibility of delivering citizens was reestablished, which had
been abolished by the Constitution declared in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In November 1999, the Colombian justice delivered to the United
States Jaime Orlando Laura Nausa, accused of being the "King of
Heroin," and on July 12, Orlando Garcia Cleves.

<HEADLINE> 2 Rovers to Jointly Explore Mars in 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two rovers will be launched separately in June 2003 and
land at the red planet after seven months' flight, with one
possibly reaching a safe, flat area and the other riskier, more
aggressive terrain.
</P>
<P>
"We are returning in force to Mars, this time with twins, twin
rovers," Scott Hubbard, Mars program director for NASA in
Washington, told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The rovers will be about 1.2 meters high and weigh 110
kilograms. Their arms will be about the length of a man's arm and
can reach out touching rocks.
</P>
<P>
Each rover will be able to cover some 90 meters in a day. They
are expected to work on the planet for about 90 days before Mars
dust blocks their solar power panels.
</P>
<P>
Everything the rovers do and see will be broadcast live on the
Web, a NASA scientist said.

<HEADLINE> WFP Seeks Additional Relief Food for Ethiopian Drought Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) is seeking additional 254,000 tons of food to
help 5.7 million drought affected peasants and pastoralists in
Ethiopia, WFP Country Director Judith Lewis said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The full effects of the drought are still being felt, and more
food as well as interventions in health, water, agriculture,
livestock and other areas are now critical if a major human
tragedy is to be avoided, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
Continued drought conditions throughout the country have left
an additional 3.4 million people in need of food aid, the U.N.
official said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP appealed earlier this year for food aid to 2.3 million
people for three to seven months pending a successful rainy season.
</P>
<P>
"To date, we have received some 182,000 tons in response to our
original request for 253,500," Lewis said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Step up Efforts to Help Africa Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will give long-
tern and low-interest loans to sub-Saharan African countries to
help them fight HIV/AIDS, World Bank representative in Kenya
Harold Wackman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A proposed loan of 500 million U.S. dollars will be presented
to the World Bank's Board for approval in September, to fund HIV/
AIDS prevention, care, and treatment throughout Africa, Wackman
told the East, Central and Southern African Health and Finance
Ministers Meeting on mobilizing more resources to combat AIDS.
</P>
<P>
All countries in sub-Saharan Africa are eligible for the
program because the bank will not let the battle be lost due to
lack of resources, Wackman said.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage governments to access the credit only as a last
resort, but unfortunately the cost of the AIDS epidemic is more
than the governments are able to raise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The loan provides a repayment period of 40 years, a grace
period of 10 years and a service charge of 3 to 4 percent,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
To step up its response to the widespread of AIDS scourge, the
World Bank last year adopted a new strategy, which committed
itself to a comprehensive collaboration with African countries and
the UNAIDS, a U.N. agency to control AIDS.
