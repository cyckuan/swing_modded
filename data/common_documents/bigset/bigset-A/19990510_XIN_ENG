<HEADLINE> Iran, Zimbabwe Reject Unipolar System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Zimbabwe Sunday rejected the
idea that the world should be dominated by a unipolar system and
criticized unfair relations between the powerful and developing
states.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the visit by

further cooperation among developing states within the framework
of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and south-south talks.
</P>
<P>
The communique underlined the need of promoting bilateral ties
in political, economic and technical fields, finding a solution to
the problems facing the African continent without foreign

<P>
They highlighted the importance of dialogue among civilizations
and termed it as a tool that would lead to expansion of
cooperation in dealing with international dispute.
</P>

rights of Palestinian nation while voicing their support for
struggles of the Palestinian people.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the road
accident in the New Orleans region of Louisiana State in Southeast
of the United States Sunday morning reached 19, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as a chartered bus carrying members of a
casino club on a Mother's Day gambling excursion flipped off an
elevated highway Sunday morning, killing at least 19 people and
injuring 23 others, the reports quoted local police as saying.
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, nine bodies had been removed from the bus,
and 10 or 11 remained in the wreckage, said Joe Narcisse, a
spokesman for the New Orleans Police Department.
</P>

"We have people on top of each other, crushed between twisted
metal," Narcisse said.

<P>
The bus was traveling eastbound on Interstate 610 and swerved
from the left lane into the right lane.
</P>

"The bus narrowly missed hitting several other vehicles, but
then it careened into the wall and toppled over it," Narcisse
said.

<HEADLINE> Talks Resumed On Fate of PLO Jerusalem Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian officials
resumed their talks Sunday night over the fate of three offices
in PLO headquarters in Jerusalem Israel has threatened to shut
down, with both sides saying a compromise might be reached.
</P>
<P>
Israel did not carry out a threat that it would close the three
offices in the Orient House by force if the two sides failed to
reach an agreement by 19:00 local time (16:00 GMT). The deadline
passed without incidents.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Avigdor Kahalani and Faisal Husseini,
top PLO official in Jerusalem, met for several hours Sunday
afternoon in an effort to avoid possible bloodshed over the
explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
Both sides said after the meeting that a compromise solution
might be found. The talks continued at a lower-level after the
19:00 deadline, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Palestinians gathered around the late-Ottoman
mansion in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem to prevent a
possible raid by Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Orient House has came under spotlight
since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered Kahalani
to shut down the three offices in it more than two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of conducting activities in
the offices in violation of signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians argued that their activities in these offices
are in line with those agreements since they are not linked with the
Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition joined the Palestinians in accusing
Netanyahu of heating up the Israeli-Palestinian tension over
Jerusalem, a holy city to both sides, in an attempt to invigorate
his flagging campaign in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about a possible explosion in the situation in the
run-up to the May 17 voting, Washington intervened last week to
help the two sides find a compromise.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker persuaded Kahalani to
postpone a threatened closure Thursday in order to give the
two sides more time to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani proposed that two of the three offices be moved out
of Jerusalem and the third one, the officel and put forward one
of its own which would stop parts of the works in the two offices,
one dealing with international relations and the other monitoring
Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side rejected the Palestinian proposal in return.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the security cabinet compromising selective
ministers Sunday, Netanyahu warned the Palestinians that if they
failed to reach an agreement with the Israeli side over this
issue, Israel would carry out the closure by force.
</P>
<P>
With only one week to go before the general elections,
Netanyahu is trailing behind his main rival for prime
ministership, Ehud Barak, in the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of atgh campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 elections, Netanyahu successfully made the issue
of Jerusalem a central element of the campaign with the slogan
that "Peres will divide Jerusalem," suggesting that the then
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres would give up control over
the eastern part of the city to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel annexed East Jerusalem shortly after capturing it from
Jordan control in the 1967 Middle East war in a move that
failed to win international support.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive and explosive issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the fate of Jerusalem is supposed to
be determined through the so -called final-status negotiations,
which have yet to start.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Journalists Denounce NATO Bombing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian journalists Sunday
denounced NATO's bombing of Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, which
left three dead, and more than 20 others injured.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's bombing was wrong," Zamaradi Kawawa, a female
journalist with Daily Mail, told Xinhua in an interview in the
capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"We are fed up with the attacks," said Bakari Mnkondo, another
journalist with Uhuru, a leading Kiswahili-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, Britain and Germany, believing that
they are supreme powers, used force at will. "This is hegemonism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the bombing, Emmanuel Herman, a journalist with
Mtanzania newspaper, shook his head. "It's bad, bad."
</P>
<P>
"It's a provocation, a blasphemy to peace," a photographer
said, urging China to strike back. "We are on the side of China."
He also expressed sympathy with the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
A female correspondent said, "It's really annoying."
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is not pleased hearing that the Chinese embassy was
bombed," said Emmanuel Onyango, a journalist with the African
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO attacked the Chinese embassy only because China
appeals for peace and turned against the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Press officers at the Tanzania Information Services described
the incident as "serious" and "unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was hit by three missiles from
different directions fired by the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) jets Friday night. Among the dead were a
female journalist of Xinhua and a newly-married couple of China's
national Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Western alliance has been bombing Yugoslav territories
since March 24 in an attempt to force Belgrade to sign a peace
agreement, granting greater autonomy to the independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo Province.

<HEADLINE> Large Amount of Rebels' Ammunition Seized in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has captured
a large amount of arms and ammunition from rebels' armory in the
northern district of Kitgum.
</P>
<P>
The seized arms and ammunition were displayed Sunday at the
Gulu town where the headquarters of the fourth division of the
government forces is based, a press release from the President's
Office said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
During a briefing in the town Sunday afternoon, division
intelligence officer Wycliff Mwesigye said the arms include, among
others, anti-aircraft guns, missiles, mortars, machine guns,
anti-tank mines, offensive and defensive grenades. Some bear
Arabic inscriptions on them.
</P>
<P>
These spoils of war were part of a huge amount captured by the
government forces in the last 16 months, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the success is mainly due to the wholehearted
support which the local population in the region has given to the
army in its operations.
</P>
<P>
Within the same period, 550 rebels of the Lord Resistance Army
(LRA) headed by Joseph Kony have been killed, 115 captured in
action, 575 defectors received by the government while 2,214
abducted civilians were rescued.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are at present opening up more military
camps in the region so that civilians can go back to their
villages to engage in agricultural production. The officer said
he was confident the war against the LRA rebels would soon be over
in the area.
</P>
<P>
The LRA is the major rebel group fighting the government forces
in the north from southern Sudan where they are based since 1986.
They kill, maim and abduct civilians to destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
The poor infrastructure and complicated topographic features of
the terrains there make it difficult for the government forces to
wipe out the rebels.

<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Four Iraqi civilians were killed
and five others injured on Sunday in U.S. and British warplane
attacks on civilian targets in the southern province of Basra, an
Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that the bombardment came after the
Iraqi anti-aircraft units hit an enemy plane violating southern
Iraqi airspace earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that at
10:05 (0605 GMT), 15 formations of enemy warplanes coming from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over the
provinces of Thi-Qar, Misan, Basra and Muthana.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the enemy planes attacked a military site
in Muthana province, adding that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired
back and hit an enemy plane. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, he added, one of the enemy formation bombed
"brutally, violently and barbarically" a farmer's house in
al-Quran district in Basra province, which left three civilians
dead and three others injured.
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes also bombed brutally a civilian facility in
Abi al-Khaseeb district in Basra province, leading to the death
of one civilian and the injuries of two others, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that eight formations of enemy planes again violated
southern Iraqi airspace over Muthana, Thi-Qar and Basra provinces
at 15:55 (1155 GMT) in the day, but Iraqi anti-aircraft units
repulsed them at 17:50 (1350 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets in the no-fly zones,
leading to heavy civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied plane violating
its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Mordechai To Fight on for Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Center Party decided
Sunday that its leader Yitzhak Mordechai will not drop out of the
race for the premiership although polls show his chance to be
elected is becoming slimmer.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made at a lengthy close-door meeting attended by
the founders of the new-born party, came amid mounting
speculations that Mordechai might withdraw his candidacy in the
final week ahead of the May 17 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Recent polls showed that Mordechai is putting a distant third
after incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and One Israel
leader Ehud Barak, with his support rate declining from 18
percent in March to 7 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
Dan Meridor and Roni Milo, two of the leaders of the party,
hinted over the weekend that Mordechai needs to reconsider if he
should stay on in the race.
</P>
<P>
As the polls suggested that Barak might defeat Netanyahu in
the first round, even without Mordechai's support, some people
inside or outside the Center Party have tried to persuade
Mordechai to quit the race and join forces with Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Center Party was established on the concept that only
Mordechai, the former popular defense minister, has a good chance
to beat Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai has made a pledge during a televised debate with
Netanyahu last month that he will fight on in the race. Some said
the promise made it hard for Mordechai, who has been widely
regarded as a man of his words, to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
Also, some analysts suggested that if Mordechai relinquishes
his candidacy, support for his party in the parliamentary election
would plummet as well.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Yemen's position during the
1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was a
"mistake," a senior Yemeni official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation was cleared after Kuwait was briefed about the
Yemeni stand and agreed to leave the mistakes of the past behind,"
Yemen's Foreign Undersecretary Ahmad Al-Said told Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"If Yemen had certain positions aimed at preserving the Arab
nation's top interests and which could have been misunderstood or
wrong, then this was a summer's cloud which is now cleared,"
Al-Said said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Kuwait and Yemen soured after Sanaa had
allegedly opposed the idea of forming an international alliance
to free Kuwait from Iraq's occupation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Said stressed that Yemen wanted "an Arab solution to the
crisis aimed at sparing the region from future problems."
</P>
<P>
He said that his country "never supported the Iraqi aggression
against Kuwait," adding that "our position was
misunderstood... . Yemenis were the first to protest the Iraqi
invasion."
</P>
<P>
Al-Said arrived here late Saturday aimed at preparing for the
reopening of the Yemeni Embassy during an upcoming visit by
Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Qader
Bajamal.
</P>
<P>
He said Bajamal's visit, which will mark the restoration of
bilateral relations between Kuwait and Yemen, should come no later
than mid-May.

CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Head of Egypt's national news agency
on Sunday expressed "the sincerest condolences" over the death of
the Chinese killed in the air strikes launched by the U.S.-led
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Mahfouz Al Ansari, editor-in-chief of the Middle East News
Agency, expressed the condolence in a message sent to Guo Chaoren,
director-general of China's official Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Ansari said "please accept my sincerest condolences over the
death of four Chinese nationals including three correspondents in
the tragic bombing (by the NATO) of the Chinese Embassy (in
Yugoslavia)."
</P>
<P>
The NATO fired three missiles from three different angles at
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade Friday night, killing at least
four people, including a female reporter of Xinhua and a
newly-married couple of China's national Guangming Daily, and
wounding over 20 others.
</P>

The Chinese government issued a statement Saturday, strongly
condemning and protesting against barbaric act of the NATO.

"I was deeply saddened" by the terrible bombing that "led to
the killing of innocent people and colleagues fulfilling their
duties under difficult conditions," Ansari added.

He also expressed his "deepest sympathy to" the families of the

<HEADLINE> Iranian MPs Urges Amnesty for Former Tehran Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 146 lawmakers from the 270-seat
Iranian Majlis (parliament) have called on the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to grant amnesty to former Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi who was jailed on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday that the
deputies sent a letter to Khamenei, urging him to take into
account the services of the former mayor and to issue an order to
solve Karbaschi's problem.
</P>
<P>
"After two years of judicial inquiry into Karbaschi's case, he
was found guilty of granting 20 percent discount in selling five
plots of land to the directors of Tehran municipality and was thus
sentenced to two years in prison," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers underlined that providing the managers at the
government offices with such bonuses is an ordinary procedure.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi has been jailed since Thursday after Iran's supreme
court rejected an appeal by his lawyers earlier in April.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a strong supporter of moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, was publicly tried on charges of graft last July and
given a sentence of five years, a 20-year ban from holding
government posts, 60 lashes and a fine of 1 billion rials (about
160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court later reduced his prison sentence to two
years and the banned period from taking public office to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's imprisonment was seen as a political move launched
by the powerful conservatives, who are still controlling the
country's judiciary, parliament, to undermine the power of
moderate reformists, the main supporters of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami on Saturday expressed regret over Karbaschi's
imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Stresses Management Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Sunday stressed the importance of inspection in moderate
management, saying it is one of the four pillars of modern
management.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remark when inaugurating the 4th Asian
Ombudsman Conference. He said inspection is an important tool in
the hands of managers to better handle affairs within the
framework of their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Ombudsman services of a country are responsible for dealing
with complaints lodged by ordinary people against the government
or the public service.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that management without inspection means moving
in vacuum and being deprived of making optimal use of facilities
to attain the desired objectives, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Terming inspection as one of the important tools that ensures
observation of citizens' rights, the Iranian president called for
exchange of information between the Asian and world inspection
organizations and adoption of new strategies to check corruption
in the administrative system and strengthen positive aspects of
management.
</P>
<P>
Head of Iran's Inspectorate General Ebrahim Reisi said earlier
that 27 countries from Asia, Latin America and Africa have
announced their readiness to attend the meeting.

<P>
CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Egyptian Shura
(Consultative) Council on Sunday condemned the airstrike against
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
"I, representing the Egyptian Shura Council and myself, condemn
NATO's air raid on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade," Mustafa Kamal
Helmy said during a meeting with a delegation of the Chinese
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Helmy denounced NATO's attack as an aggression, which he said
was also targeted on all the other peace-loving countries.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched an airstrike
against the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia Friday night, firing
three missiles from three different angles at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
NATO's barbarous act killed at least four people, including a
female reporter of the Xinhua News Agency and a newly-married
couple of China's national Guangming Daily, wounded more than 20
others and seriously damaged the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued a statement on Saturday,
expressing the Chinese government and people's utmost indignation
and severe condemnation, and lodging the strongest protest.
</P>
<P>
Helmy expressed hope that the Kosovo issue will be resolved
through political means, averting the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
The NATO has been continuing bombing Yugoslav sites since March
24 to force Belgrade to sign a peace agreement allowing the
alliance to deploy troops as peacekeepers in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, where the Yugoslav police force were fighting against
the separatists of the ethnic Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Say No To NATO On Mother's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- It was Mother's Day but thousands of
young Chinese were not staying home giving carnations to their
mothers like usual.
</P>
<P>
This was because the People's Republic of China had been
brutally insulted only a day earlier and many of them hadn't
returned home since then, when demonstrations began in front of
the U.S. Embassy and consulates in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenyang, and Chengdu. They were expressing their indignation over
the U.S.-led barbaric NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Today, the first thing many Beijing people did was to watch TV
reports on the incident. Newspapers were sold immediately after
they appeared on newsstands and two or more people often had to
share one paper.
</P>
<P>
On the front page of the most popular newspapers like Beijing
Youth Daily and Life Times, people could see large pictures of the
three citizens killed in the bombing and tears could be seen on
many faces.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Youth Daily devoted eight pages to the bloody incident
and used terms like "utmost sorrow", "darkest night", and "
strongest protest".
</P>
<P>
There was a significant decrease in the number of amusing
programs on television. Following China Central Television's noon
news, it carried a message on a silent screen for about a minute
expressing deepest sorrow for the deaths and sympathy for the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
One can sense the great sorrow around the newsrooms of the
Xinhua News Agency and Guangming Daily, where the three
journalists worked. At Xinhua, a number of journalists expressed a
determination to go to Belgrade to take up where their colleagues
left off.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning, thousands of college students gathered
near the foreign embassy district in Beijing and marched to the U.
S. embassy. Many demonstrators wore pictures of targets on their
shirts and sang the national anthem loudly.
</P>
<P>
One student had written on his T-shirt: "Protect the motherland
with our blood" and another said, "The U.S. and NATO bombers
should look at Chinese history and then they will understand that
our nation will never surrender to hegemony or invaders."

</P>
<P>
Yang Jinlong, a 33-year-old professor at the Chinese University

the United States are just power politics and hegemony.
</P>

University, said that the United States has been making disasters
everywhere under the banner of humanitarianism and has once again
posed a mad challenge to China by launching missiles on the peace-

servant, said, "Two of the victims of the attack were women," and,
"I feel especially sorry because this is Mother's Day."

attack and supporting the government's statement and some
university students have put messages of condemnation on the

motherland has lost three of its children on the eve of Mother's
Day. Chinese students call for safeguarding sovereignty and
fighting hegemonism."

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese Paper Blasts NATO Raids Against Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China's foremost newspaper, the
People's Daily, has stressed that any attempt to intimidate the
Chinese people with force would prove futile and warned that the U.
S.-led NATO will commit a historical mistake if it ignores the
Chinese people's indignation at its barbaric attacks against the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have flown into furies. The U.S.-led NATO's
outrageous attacks against the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia have
ignited the Chinese people's indignation," said the newspaper in a
commentary to be published in Monday's issue.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "The Chinese People Are Not to be
Humiliated", said the Chinese government issued a stern statement
on the same day as the savage act occurred, most strongly
protesting NATO's crime of barbarically infringing the Chinese
sovereignty and brutally ravaging China's dignity, urging NATO to
bear all responsibilities arising therefrom and stressing the
reservation of its right to take further action on the matter.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress, the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, All-
China Industry and Trade Association and the media have issued
statements and held rallies and talks to condemn NATO's bloody
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that indignant university students and
people across the country have staged demonstrations, sternly
denouncing the U.S.-led NATO's outrages and firmly supporting the
Chinese government's position of defending the nation's
sovereignty and national pride. They shouted: "China is not to be
bullied. The Chinese nation is not to be humiliated."
</P>
<P>
NATO's attacks against Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia is a
flagrant infringement of China's sovereignty and pride, a gross
ravage of the Chinese people's national sentiment and an open
provocation to the 1.2 billion Chinese people, noted the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
The bloody fact has made people realize who are flagrantly
breaching the U.N. Charter and the norms of the international law
and destroying the world's peace, and who are brutally killing and
injuring innocent civilians in Yugoslavia and even ravaging the
lives of diplomatic functionaries of other countries in the post-
Cold War era when the people all over the world aspire for peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted that NATO's atrocities have stripped
itself of its "humanitarian" cloak and fully exposed its savage
face as an aggressor.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China marked that the
Chinese people had stood up and the era when the Chinese were
bullied by foreign powers has gone forever, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
For more than a century, the Chinese people have shed blood and
even sacrificed their lives for safeguarding national sovereignty
and dignity, the commentary said, adding that after fifty years of
hard struggles, the Chinese people have embarked on the path to
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
If anybody thinks he can intimidate the Chinese through the use
of force, he will find himself completely wrong, the commentary
warned.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO should bear all consequences of its barbaric
missile attacks on the Chinese embassy, it said, pointing out that
NATO's atrocity has ignited the Chinese people's patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Shouting "anti-aggression", "anti-hegemony" and "safeguard
sovereignty" slogans, the Chinese people have also uttered their
heartfelt wishes -- to love and rejuvenate China, the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary believed a powerful and prosperous China with
all its people and nationalities united in one heart, is the
guarantee for the Chinese nation's existence and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Young students and people from all walks of life vowed to turn
grief into strength, work and study hard, enhance China's
productivity and scientific and technological level, realize the
goal of modernizing China's industry, agriculture, science and
defense sectors, and improve the country's overall strength.
</P>
<P>
This is the most cherished patriotism which should be carried
forward, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
China's sovereignty and national dignity allow of no aggression
and the Chinese people, who are not afraid of hegemony, will
tolerate no bullying from others, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The more than a century's arduous struggle of the Chinese
nation has, and will continue to prove that the great Chinese
nation is invincible, it said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S.-led NATO turns a blind eye to Chinese people's
indignation, it is doomed to make a huge mistake and will never go
away unpunished, said the commentary.

damaging plants, railways, bridges and broadcasting stations in

Now it has demonstrated again to the Chinese that its "human
rights" means striking the embassy and killing innocent people.

express our utmost indignation at the United states and NATO using
accurate guided weapons to attack the building of the Chinese

<HEADLINE> Chinese Organizations Express Support For Government's View On NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese organizations today
expressed support for the firm stance taken by the Chinese
government and voiced their strong protest against the NATO
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement
today on behalf of the 103 million trade union members and workers
in China denouncing the aggressive act of U.S.-led NATO and
called the attack on the Chinese embassy a brutal infringement on
Chinese sovereignty and an overt provocation.
</P>
<P>
The brutal act has aroused the indignation of the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions and its subordinate organizations and
of the workers in China, the Federation said, and called on the
working class and all laborers to unite more closely around the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core and to safeguard state sovereignty and security better.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students'
Federation today held forums for young people and college students
in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Participants said that young Chinese have always stood at the
front in safeguarding state sovereignty and protecting the Chinese
people and resolutely support the government statement.
</P>
<P>
Young Chinese have been indignant about the NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia over the last 40 days, participants said and
added that the attack on the Chinese embassy will surely lead to
even greater indignation and a stronger condemnation by all of
China's 350 million young people.
</P>
<P>
They urged all young people to channel their patriotism and
indignation into their studies and to work hard and maintain
China's stability and unity with their deeds.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 female representatives met in Beijing today to
denounce the aggressive act of NATO against the Chinese embassy,
with Gu Xiulian, vice-president of the All-China Women's
Federation, presiding. Participants expressed their condolence for
the families of the bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
The Federation members pointed out in a strongly-worded
statement that NATO's brutal bombing of Yugoslavia over the past
40 or more days deprived women and children of their right to
subsistence and that the attack on the Chinese embassy trampled on
world peace, human rights, and the rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
They urged all peace-loving women around the world to take
action and resolutely denounce and stop power politics and
hegemonism in any form.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Central Committee,
echoing the protest at a form in Beijing today, expressed
indignation and sternly condemned the U.S.-led NATO attack on the
Chinese embassy.

ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Major Afghan cities of Kabul and
Kandahar will soon have telephone exchanges and first consignment
of the necessary equipment for revival of international telephone
system in the area has reached Kabul, according to a senior
Taliban official.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Allah Dad Tabib, a
Taliban official for communication, as saying Sunday the Taliban
had signed an agreement with Telecom System International (TSI),
an American company, last December for the revival of
international telephone system in war-torn Afghanistan,
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official said that one telephone exchange would be
installed in the capital city of Kabul and another in Kandahar,
Afghanistan's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the system would restore Afghanistan's
international telephone linkage with the people living abroad, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Tabib said that they have also signed accord with TSI company
on installation of telex, fax and internet system. Arrangements
have also been made to revive telephonic service inside the
country although the old system is functional to some extent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have now restored the old telephonic system inside the
country which had been damaged by the years-long war and succeeded
in making it functional and linking the provinces with each other
through wireless," the Taliban official added.
</P>
<P>
He said these are outdated systems and cannot work properly but
can meet the requirements for the time being, adding, now when we
have signed accord with the TSI company, we would be able to
revive the entire system.

<HEADLINE> Buyoya Holds Talks with Nyerere on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Burundi President
Pierre Buyoya Sunday held talks with former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere on the Burundi peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The consultation was about how to push the peace process
forward," Buyoya told reporters here shortly after the talks,
lasting three and a half hours, at Nyerere's residence in the
northern outskirts of Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mark Bomani, an aide to Nyerere who is the international
facilitator of Burundi peace process, told Xinhua earlier in the
day that the meeting has been arranged as routine talks. Bomani
said he visited Bujumbura, Burundi last March.
</P>
<P>
The complete lifting of economic embargo on Burundi is not on
the agenda of the talks between Buyoya and Nyerere, he revealed,
adding that the issue will be discussed later.
</P>
<P>
The talks came a day before a meeting of four committees on
Burundi scheduled to be held for two weeks in the Arusha town in
north Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
The committees have been established to explore the nature of
Burundi conflicts, look at the issues of democracy and good
governance including the reform of the administration, judiciary
and armed forces, deal with peace and security, and examine issues
of refugees and rehabilitation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Bomani said it takes time for the committees, consisting of 18
feuding political groups of Burundi including parliament, to
negotiate and solve their tough issues.
</P>
<P>
The groups have started to negotiate peace since last June.
"They have made progress, and they haven't finished their work,"
he said. "So they continue meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said six refugees from Burundi in Tanzanian camps will
attend the Arusha meeting as observers but not as negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The six representatives, from both Hutus and Tutsis, have been
selected by some 300,000 Burundian refugees in the camps. The
Arusha meeting wants to allay their fears and respect their
appeals to participate in the Burundi peace process, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
In April, Nyerere visited the camps in western Tanzania and
urged Burundian refugees to abandon antiquated tribalism and
called on the armed groups of Burundi warring parties to cast away
weapons to join the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
CNDD-FDD, one rebel group which refused to put down arms
against Buyoya, has not been invited to the meeting, Burundian
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be a preliminary preparation for the fifth
round of Burundi talks to take place in a few months. The first
four rounds of talks, under the chairmanship of Nyerere, have been
held in Arusha since last year.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who came to the country for a one-day working visit as
the guest of Nyerere, was greeted by Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa at the Dar es Salaam International Airport. His delegation
included Burundian foreign minister Severin Ntahomvukiye.
</P>
<P>
Major Buyoya, a Tutsi, took power in a military coup in July of
1997. Seven African countries, backed by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), imposed economic sanctions on the nation in
early August.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was suspended in January this year to allow warring
factions in Burundi to continue their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been riven by ethnic violence between the Hutu
majority and the Tutsi minority, which has ruled almost
continually since the country gained independence from Belgium in
1962.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, more than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have
been killed in an escalated wave of massacres and a civil war in
the tiny central African country.

NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A national debate over
constitutional arrangements and elections between political groups
in Congo (K) which is expected to be held here has been postponed
until June, Kenya's Foreign Ministry said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the talks would be put off till June because

</P>
<P>
It is not clear how the debate would be funded, but rebels and

</P>
<P>
The Congolese government announced in April plans for
multi-party talks with the participation of rebels who control
much of the eastern part of the country. Kenya had agreed to host
the talks originally scheduled from May 8 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The central African country has been torn by a nine-month-old
rebellion backed by Uganda and Rwanda against the government of

<HEADLINE> European Environment Ministers Urge Chemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 9 (Xinhua)--The environment ministers of the European
Union (EU) countries at their meeting Sunday in Weimar called for
the chemical industry to take more responsibility in protecting
the environment from harmful chemicals.
</P>
<P>
European chemical producers and processors are urged to be
responsible for treating their materials and products until the
harmful chemicals beared are under the limit that might hurt human
health or the environment, said German Environment Minister
Juergen Trittin after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are concerned that European governments and
industry are ill-knowledged on harmful properties of thousands of
chemicals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under current EU laws, only 20 among the 100,000 chemicals are
required to be assessed, none of them required to be treated, said
Trittin, adding that the new chemicals law would be stricter.
</P>
<P>
And the harmful chemicals already in market will be traced and
inspected by authorities, he said.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars of international
law are saying that the U.S.-led NATO forces carry the blame under
international law for the attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Scholars from the China Society of International Law, Foreign
Affairs College, Beijing University, and Zhongshan University who
attended a symposium here today on the NATO attack said that the
attack was inevitable to some extent because NATO was expanding
the list of targets to include civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guoqing of Foreign Affairs College said that NATO's
actions violated air warfare rules that say that the military can
not target city residential areas and that an embassy contains the
lodgings and offices of diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Gong Renren of Beijing University said that NATO contravened
the Hague Convention, which prohibits attacks on buildings not
used for military purposes.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Central News Agency (
KCNA), the official news agency of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), on Monday issued a commentary slamming
the U.S.-led NATO missile attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The KCNA said no matter what the "U.S. and NATO war madmen" say
in defense of their atrocious attack of the Chinese embassy, they
must be put under international trial.
</P>
<P>
At midnight Friday, the U.S.-led NATO wantonly dropped three
missiles from different angles on the embassy of China in Belgrade,
killing three and wounding more than 20 others. The embassy
complex was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The barbaric raids against the Chinese embassy have triggered
the strongest protest and indignation in China, but NATO leaders
repeatedly claimed that it was "a tragic mistake."
</P>
<P>
The commentary said NATO's claim does not deserve to be heard,
adding that the claim tried to whitewash the atrocity.
</P>
<P>
The final winner will be the side who upholds justice and the
unjust side will be doomed to destruction, the commentary
concluded.

<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Monday that a
reported Yugoslav army withdrawal from Kosovo still fell short of
NATO's demands for a complete pullout of army and police.
</P>
<P>
"This is still by a long way short of NATO's conditions," a
Foreign Office spokesman said while commenting on the partial
pullout announced by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain understood Yugoslavia was offering a partial
withdrawal from Kosovo to the level of forces before the start of
NATO's air campaign on March 24, conditional on a halt to bombing
by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO repeatedly demanded a complete withdrawal of Yugoslav
troops and police from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most hawkish countries in NATO, Britain keeps
taking a hard line on the need to continue the bombing and ensure
the return of refugees to their homes.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Hu Jintao said today

COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Sri Lankan fishermen
and the families of the fishermen who are being detained in India
jails protested outside the Indian High Commission (Embassy) in
Colombo on Monday, demanding the immediate release of the detained
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The protesters waved placards and shouted slogans before

A spokesman for Sri Lanka's United Fishermen's and Fish

<P>
Fishermen have for long been a troublesome problem in the

narrow Palk Strait.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan fishermen say they stray into Indian waters mostly
due to bad weather unexpected during fishing.
</P>

Indian fishermen have been complaining that they are fired at

smuggling of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A forum to increase political
negotiations and economic cooperation across the Taiwan Straits
was held in Beijing today based on a study done in 7 coastal
provinces and cities on cross-Straits transport, postal, and
commercial links.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen praised the people involved for their
devotion to peaceful reunification and their sense of
responsibility in national interests.
</P>
<P>
The study fully demonstrated that non-Communist parties, the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-party
personnel have an advantage in handling work related to Taiwan,
Qian said, and that they can contribute greatly to the expansion
of cross-Straits exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, a vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said
that the study showed that more Taiwan people have invested or
settled on the mainland and that cross-Straits economic
cooperation is increasing.
</P>
<P>
The study can help people better understand Deng Xiaoping's
idea of "peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems" as
well as Jiang Zemin's Eight-Point proposal on reunification, Wang
said, and that this demonstrates the efforts of the Chinese people
at reunification under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 journalists from 20
news organizations and newspapers met here today to mourn the loss
of three journalists killed by the NATO missile attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A banner with the words "Strongly denounce the killing of
Chinese journalists by U.S.-led NATO attack" was hung across the
front of the meeting room and below it were flower arrangements
with yellow chrysanthemums and white silk containing elegiac
couplets, from 550,000 journalists from across China.
</P>
<P>
Li Guo'An, the vice-president of the China Journalists
Association, said at the meeting that a dozen Chinese reporters
have gone to the front to cover Belgrade since NATO began the
bombing in Yugoslavia a month and a half ago. Their work in
safeguarding justice and peace have won the praise of Chinese and
foreign readers, he said, and the killing of the three journalists,
Shao Yunhuan, Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, was a brutal infringement on
Chinese sovereignty and a wanton trampling on the basic norms of
international relations and a gross violation of the rights of
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers included Zhang Baoshun, the deputy director of
Xinhua News Agency, Li Jingrui, the deputy editor-in-chief of
Guangming Daily, and people from People's Daily, Economic Daily,
and China Central Television.
</P>
<P>
Chinese People's University's journalism school also held a

student read an open letter to foreign journalists in Beijing and

<HEADLINE> Interview: New Election Culture Emerging in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the date to select the first chief executive of the future
Macao SAR draws near, a new "election culture" has emerged in
Macao, which will return to China on December 20 this year, Tong
Chi Kin, a member of the Selection Committee for the first
government of the Macao SAR, told Xinhua in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tong said that he, also serving as a member of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao SAR, has participated directly in the
formulation of rules on the formation of the Selection Committee
and on the selection of the first chief executive of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"I am a witness of the process in which the Selection Committee
was formed and the two candidates (for the office of the first
chief executive) were selected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao residents have actively participated in the election
process, the Selection Committee has earnestly performed its role,
and the two candidates have contested seriously and openly, said
Tong, who is also president of Macao Computer Professionals
Society.
</P>
<P>
"The election has fully demonstrated the spirit of fairness,
justice, openness, democracy and honesty and has brought to Macao
an utterly new 'election culture,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both candidates, Edmund Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au
Chong Kit, have expressed their determination to implement the
principle of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
The two candidates have gone to the grass-roots to learn about
the needs and concerns of Macao residents and have put forward
solutions within the framework of the Macao Basis Law, and this
completely reflects the concept of "Macao people governing Macao,"
Tong said.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that has never been seen in Macao in the
past hundreds of years under foreign rule," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Macao residents have displayed unprecedented
enthusiasm for the election of the first chief executive of the
Macao SAR, as evidenced by their eagerness to report to the
Selection Members the important issues that have a bearing on the
future development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Though having different plans for how to govern Macao, both
candidates have advocated "seeking changes while maintaining
stability" to ensure the successful solution of Macao's problems
in economy and public order while guaranteeing the stable transfer
of Macao, Tong said.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever will be elected, I believe the future chief executive
has the capacity to govern Macao well," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following the selection of the first chief executive of the
Macao SAR on May 15, a new government will be formed to perform
the mission of "Macao people governing Macao," Tong said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Macao residents will carry
forward the spirit of active participation and responsibility, as
shown during the selection process, and be united to support the
chief executive in ushering in a new epoch in Macao.

Chinese correspondents by NATO missile attack on the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

In a press statement signed by the union secretary-general Kihu

it claims to champion", it added, stressing that "journalists all
over the world are, in principle, working hard to advance the
cause of peace and justice."
</P>
<P>
Journalists in the U.S. "have a duty to condemn the blatant
violation of journalists', diplomatic and human rights by

<P>
PARIS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The head of the International Cycling
Union (UCI), Hein Verbruggen, was temporarily held into custody
for questioning Monday by French investigators probing the use of
performance-enhancing drugs by the disgraced Festina cycling team.
</P>
<P>
Verbruggen, questioned as a witness only, was detained for up
to 48 hours as part of the judicial formality, an unidentified

The doping scandal erupted on the eve of last year's Tour de

steroids and erythropoietin (EPO) in a Festina team car.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile top Festina team figures arrived at the courthouse
for a "confrontation" of their different versions of the affair.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prominent Rwandan Politician to Appear in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Former chairman of the Democratic
Republican Movement of Rwanda, Bonaventure Ubalijoro, will appear
in court soon, the Rwandan News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Trial proceedings will begin within a period of two weeks,
Kigali Prosecutor Emmanuel Rukangira said in the capital, adding
that ''his case file is almost complete, and he will be brought to
court very soon."
</P>
<P>
Charges against Ubalijoro include, among others, embezzlement
of public funds and subversive activities.
</P>
<P>
As general manager of the country's biggest oil company
Petrorwanda, Ubalijoro reportedly stole around 80 million francs
(around 240,000 U.S. dollars) in complicity with some phony
companies and dubious dealers.
</P>
<P>
As for charges relating to subversion, judicial sources
indicated that Ubalijoro is accused of being at the helm of an
underground Hutu extremist organization which has been mobilizing
Hutus to stand up and topple the current regime in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said that Ubalijoro had formed groups of
Hutu extremists in several parts of Rwanda, which had for task
spreading ethnic hatred among Rwandans.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Ubalijoro will be also prosecuted for
crimes he committed in the 1960s which include alleged
responsibility in the massacres of some Tutsi politicians, and
ordinary civilians.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts in Rwandan capital Kigali contend that Ubalijoro
might not be prosecuted for crimes against humanity he might have
perpetrated in the 1960s, as the law punishing such crimes only
covers the period of 1990-94.
</P>
<P>
Unless necessary amendment is made to the law, Ubalijoro will
escape from justice for the above crimes.

<P>
Beijing University had another quiet day, but teachers and
students still felt angry about NATO's attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The university's Triangle has always been a news center and a
slogan appeared there today saying, "China will never yield, China
will never lose order."
</P>
<P>
Guan Chenghua, the secretary of the university's Communist
Youth League (CYL) Committee, said that the expression "China will
never yield" clearly expressed approval of the Chinese
government's statement on the attack and, "We also realized that,
at such a crucial moment, we should not lose order. Students said
that they will study hard, and put their patriotic fervor into
action and make the country stronger."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yi, a junior in the Guanghua Management School said: "
Teachers and students have had heated discussions about NATO's
atrocity and Vice-President Hu Jintao's televised speech and we
believe that China is in a developmental phase and should
concentrate on our duties."
</P>
<P>
University teachers and students in Beijing have held
demonstrations for two days to protest NATO's attack on the
Chinese Embassy, but because students have had to return to their
study, the number of people at the U.S. embassy has declined.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 1,000 policemen helping keep order around
the embassy and no conflicts with protesters, who seemed to be in
a reasonable and orderly mood and shouted slogans like "strongly
uphold the government statement" or "protest against the NATO
atrocity."

CHENGDU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Provinces and cities along China's
Yangtze and Yellow rivers are preparing for this year's flood
season.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces
and the cities of Shanghai and Chongqing are being asked by the
State Flood and Drought Control Headquarters to speed up work on
water control facilities along the rivers and to prepare goods and

</P>
<P>
Some meteorologists say that large floods are still possible on

upper reaches. Sichuan, which is on the upper reaches, is focusing
on afforestation work, water and soil conservation, and building
water control facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, on the middle reaches, has made dykes stronger than is
usually necessary, according to local flood control officials.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has piled up a large number of sacks and other flood
control materials and Hunan has spent more than 6 billion yuan on
water control facilities since last year.
</P>
<P>
A meeting on flood control on the Yellow River was held in
Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan Province, to discuss
safety on the Xianglangdi Project, China's largest water control
project on the Yellow River.

<P>
The 5,464-km Yellow River passes through 7 provinces and 2
autonomous regions before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The water
from the upper reaches has been declining and areas along the
middle and lower reaches have been hit by prolonged droughts. But,
people at the meeting warned of possible flooding on the river
this year and asked local governments to pay special attention to
levees along the lower reaches to allow them to withstand a flow
of 22,000 cu.m. per second.

PRETORIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- About one hundred Chinese people
Monday protested at the United States embassy in Pretoria against
the U.S.-led NATO's brutal attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

Protesters burnt U.S. and British flags and marched around the

A letter of protest was handed to a representative of the
embassy.

In the letter, the Chinese community expressed their strongest
protest against the U.S. government.

"We firmly insist that the U.S. government and NATO give their
explanation (to the incident) and take full responsibility for
their action, " said the letter. "We strongly demand that the
American government and NATO stop all their aggressive action."
</P>

The letter accused Washington of hypocrisy. "The American
government ought to match their deeds with their words. It should
genuinely respect human rights and world peace, instead of
creating conflicts, sabotaging peace and slaughtering innocent
people around the world."
</P>
<P>
The march was peaceful and no incidents occurred.

The NATO forces attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last

<HEADLINE> Macao People Continue Denouncing NATO's Brutality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The local media and students in Macao
Monday continued condemning NATO's air attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
All Chinese newspapers in Macao kept on carrying news stories
and pictures revealing NATO's barbarous air attack on the Chinese
embassy, and some newspapers published commentaries to denounce
NATO's brutality.
</P>
<P>
"The barbarian act has vehemently shocked the Chinese people
and all people around the world who love peace and justice," the
Macao Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the U.S.-led NATO, in the name of
protecting human rights, has been conducting incessant
bombardments in Yugoslavia, killing many innocent people, and
even the lives of embassy staff and journalists could not be
spared. NATO acts as the true criminal of war, it said.
</P>
<P>
Listing the brutal acts of NATO, the Tai Chung Pou newspaper
said in a commentary that "the atrocity of NATO is intolerable,
and the blood debts must be repaid definitely."
</P>
<P>
"If NATO does not stop bombing and goes its own way, NATO is
lifting a rock only to drop it on its own feet," the commentary
said.
</P>
<P>
Before classes for the new week began, many school authorities
in Macao organized students to mourn for the Chinese martyrs who
died in NATO's attack. During class breaks, students collected
newspaper clippings and held discussions to denounce NATO's
brutality.
</P>
<P>
At the University of Macao, hundreds of teachers and students
signed their names on a piece of cloth Monday to express their
condemnation.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Envoy Meets Arafat on Orient House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu sent a senior aide to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Monday to seek a solution to the dispute over the
Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Molcho, Netanyahu's legal advisor, held talks with
Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah over Israel's threat to
shut down three offices in the Orient House, Israel Radio quoted a
Palestinian source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he was seeking Palestinian clarification before
he made a final decision on the fate of the three offices, which
he has threatened to close on allegations of Palestinian violation
of signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
More than two weeks after he issued a closure order, Netanyahu
imposed a 19:00 (16:00 GMT) deadline Sunday on the Palestinian
side, saying they have to shut down the offices by themselves or
face a forceful closure by the Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
But the ultimatum was not carried out as Israeli and
Palestinian officials continued talks in hope of avoiding possible
bloodshed over the explosive issue.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu convened an inner security meeting late Sunday night
to hear briefings by Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani on
his talks with Faisal Husseini, the top PLO official in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, a moderate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
said Monday that he is continuing his efforts to find a compromise
solution in order to avert possible escalation of tensions.
</P>
<P>
For his part, however, Husseini said the Palestinians have no
new proposal to offer since they have agreed to close some
controversial work in the offices. Israel has rejected this
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Palestinians rejected an Israeli proposal put
forward by Kahalani, which suggests two of the three offices be
moved out of Jerusalem and the third, the office of Husseini, be
left open so long as he acts "in accordance with Israel's
instructions."
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Orient House has been under spotlight since
Netanyahu ordered Kahalani to shut down the three offices last
month.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of conducting diplomatic
activities in the offices on behalf of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), which Israel said is banned from operating in
Jerusalem according to agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians argued that their activities are in line with
those agreements since they are not linked with the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition joined the Palestinians in accusing
Netanyahu of heating up the Israeli-Palestinian tensions over
Jerusalem, a holy city to both sides, in an attempt to invigorate
his flagging campaign in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about a possible explosion in the situation in the
run-up to the May 17 voting, the United States intervened last
week to help the two sides find a compromise.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker persuaded Kahalani to
postpone a threatened closure Thursday in order to give the two
sides more time to seek a solution.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani's office said he received a phone call Sunday night
from U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, who wanted to know first
hand what was going on.
</P>
<P>
With only one week to go before the general elections,
Netanyahu is trailing behind his main rival for premiership, Labor
party leader Ehud Barak, in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was accused of attempting to use an old trick,
playing the fear of Israelis over the future of Jerusalem, to
strengthen his position in the tough campaign.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 elections, Netanyahu successfully made the issue
of Jerusalem a central element of the campaign with the slogan
that "Peres will divide Jerusalem," suggesting that then Prime
Minister Shimon Peres would give up control over the eastern part
of the city to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel annexed East Jerusalem shortly after capturing it from
Jordanian control in the 1967 Middle East war in a move that
failed to win international recognition.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive and explosive issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the fate of Jerusalem is supposed to
be determined through the so-called final-status negotiations,
which have yet to start.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from the Finance Ministry, Netanyahu decided
at a cabinet meeting Sunday to transfer 400 million shekels (about
100 million U.S. dollars) for infrastructure building in East
Jerusalem to tighten Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
The opposition bloc lashed out at Netanyahu for his decision,
terming it "an election bribe," and accused him of risking
national interest by provoking tensions over the Orient
House.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Commerce Secretaries Convention Opens in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Commerce secretaries of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) opened a
meeting here Monday with India criticizing developed countries for
flouting the World Trade Organization (WTO) discipline and using
double standards in the WTO system.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting of SAARC, which embraces Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, aims
to forge a common strategy for the next ministerial round of WTO
talks in Seattle in November next year, official sources said
here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Indian caretaker Commerce Minister
Ramakrishna Hegde criticized unilateral measures of developed
countries as flouting WTO discipline and deplored attempts to
thrust fresh negotiations on developing countries even before the
full implementation of existing WTO agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The very concept of a new round frightens many of us. We are
yet to recover from the hangover of the Uruguay Round. Many of the
implications of the commitments we have undertaken during the
Uruguay Round are only now beginning to be absorbed by industry,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Commerce Secretary P. P. Prabhu also said Monday that
the present multilateral trading system suffered from obvious
distortions and double standards adopted by developed countries
and this should be addressed immediately for developing countries
to gain meaningful access to the developed market.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries promote their own concerns by extolling the
spirit of free trade and multilateralism but cite the letter of
the law while addressing the concerns of the developing countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The commerce secretaries' meeting would mark the beginning of a
new initiative to express the concerns of SAARC countries "loudly
and in one voice," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be followed by the SAARC commerce ministers'
meeting in Male, the Maldives in early September this year.

repetition of this humiliating tragedy.
</P>

Some 1,200 students from the university joined the
demonstrations near the US Embassy yesterday and did not get back
to the campus until after 8 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Police's Anti-Terrorist
Unit has arrested a key leader of Tamil rebels who was responsible
for the transport of bombs for a number of major blasts in the
capital, police sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who was a resident of the former rebel stronghold
Jaffna, had come to Colombo about five years ago and had rented
out a house at Negombo, a suburb of Colombo, where he had been
living, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that the suspect had transported
high-powered bombs from Negombo for blasting the Kelanitissa Power
Station in 1997 and causing a number of other major destructions
in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest of a Tamil conductor of a Central
Transport Board bus from Negombo, the Anti-Terrorist United
arrested five key Tamil rebel cadres.
</P>
<P>
On information received from these suspects, the rebel leader
who was responsible for the transport of bombs to Colombo was
arrested, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police are on the trail of a Sinhala reserve police constable
who had helped the suspect to transport the bombs to Colombo, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels have been fighting a separatist war against the
Sri Lankan government for a homeland in the north and east of the
country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the rebels have carried out dozens of bomb
attacks against military and civilian targets in major cities
across Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns NATO Attack of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Monday
unreservedly condemned the attack of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade Friday night by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Cyprus Yin Zuojin,
Christodoulos Pasiardis, acting Permanent Secretary of Cyprus'
Foreign Ministry, expressed the Cypriot government's sympathy with
the Chinese government and its people, especially the families of
the victims.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday night, three missiles fired by NATO forces attacked
the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, killing at least three Chinese
people, all journalists, injuring 26 others, six in serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government also called on NATO to work towards
restoring peace and stability worldwide, Pasiardis said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government hoped that "the assumption
of responsibility and the apology on the part of NATO will be
followed by further actions on the part of alliance to restore
international cooperation and understanding among states and
mainly the big powers, with an aim to consolidate world peace and
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Cypriot parliament also condemned the
attack of the Chinese embassy and conveyed sincere condolences to
the victims, the Cyprus News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Spyros Kyprianou, on behalf of the
parliament, "condemned with abhorrence the outrageous action which
violates flagrantly the U.N. Charter and international law," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
He also conveyed "sincere condolences and sympathy for the
innocent and tragic victims."

<HEADLINE> China Making Hainan Its First Ecological Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build Hainan into
its first ecological province to help the country's sustainable
development, Governor Wang Xiaofeng told a meeting on ecological
improvements here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the island province plans to lead the country in
forestry coverage, air and water quality, economic competitiveness,
and environment and ecology within three decades. Hainan is one of
the few regions in China with good ecological protection, with
forestry coverage of 53.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But, ecologists say that Hainan's ecological system is
vulnerable because of its geographical location.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is the first provincial-level
government in the country to put forth an ecological development
plan. Some academicians at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and
ecologists connected with the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA) reviewed the plan today. SEPA says that it
will give full support to the province's ecological improvements.

<HEADLINE> SADC Free Trade Talks Make Headway: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) have been making efforts to
reach an agreement over the creation of SADC free trade area, the
Business Day newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The regional group has set a June deadline for the conclusion
of talks on the creation of SADC free trade area.
</P>
<P>
Free trade, characterized by the absence of tariff and
non-tariff barriers, has been identified by analysts as a panacea
to the region's, if not all, ills.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of free trade will make SADC's problems of
under development, unemployment, poverty, sluggish growth, low
levels of intra- regional trade and commodity-based economies
disappear, they believe.
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende, SADC Executive Secretary, once estimated that
tariff-free trade would create about five million new jobs in the
short term, and will add 2.6 billion U.S. dollars to the region's
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
It is this leap of faith in the benefits of free trade that has
driven SADC member states to work tirelessly towards the June
deadline, Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
For now, 11 of the 14 SADC countries have agreed not to raise
tariffs to the levels beyond those of July 1998. Those that have
had to, such as Zimbabwe which hiked tariffs by more than 100
percent in certain sectors at the height of its economic turmoil
last year, will have to reverse them to July 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Seychelles and Angola
are not included in the SADC free trade talks.

<HEADLINE> Senior Army Official Condemns U.S.-Led NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- General Fu Quanyou, chief of the
general staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), today
strongly condemned the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia, which left three dead, one missing and more than 20
injured.
</P>
<P>
The PLA firmly supports the statement of the Chinese government
and the important televised speech by Vice President Hu Jintao, Fu
said while holding talks with the visiting commander L.M. Fisher
of the defense forces of Botswana.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined, under the strong leadership of the Party
Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with Jiang
Zemin at their cores, work hard to intensify the building of
national defense and modernization of the armed forces, resolutely
safeguard the peaceful life of the Chinese people, and defend
state sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure that they
are not infringed upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade is a gross
violation of Chinese sovereignty and a wanton trample on the
Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and the norms of
international relations, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people have expressed their utmost
indignation and strong condemnation of the barbarous atrocity and
have lodged the strongest protest against the U.S.-led NATO, which
should bear all responsibilities arising therefrom, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government reserves the right to take further
measures on the matter, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fisher said that he was extremely shock over the U.S.-led NATO
attack, and expressed his condolences for the Chinese killed in
the attack and sympathy for their relatives.
</P>
<P>
China is an important force in safeguarding world peace and
stability, he said, adding that he hoped China would play a more
important role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on furthering friendship and ties of
cooperation between the armies of the two countries
comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
The visitor arrived here yesterday on a six-day official
goodwill visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Fu held a welcoming ceremony for Fisher and
his party and accompanied him in reviewing a guard of honor of
the three services of the PLA.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Finance Committee approved here Monday a special budget of 3.25
million U.S. dollars for settlement expansions.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for new neighborhood developments and
expansions at the Jewish settlements across the Green Line, the
Knesset said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Green Line is the 1967 ceasefire line between Israel and
the Palestinians, which the Israeli side does not want to be used
as the "border line" in the future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee approved the special budget upon the
request by the World Zionist Organization's Settlement Department,
the Knesset said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second decision during the last two days by
the Israeli side on spending more money for the "developments"
of the Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Israeli cabinet approved the transfer of 100
million U.S. dollars to the Jerusalem Municipality, despite the
strong objections from the Finance Minister Meir Sheetrit, the
only minister to vote against the decision.
</P>
<P>
The 100 million U.S. dollars will be used during the next five
years on the constructions in Jerusalem, particularly in the
Eastern sector of the city.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have expressed their strong objections
toward the decisions, saying those decisions by the current
government headed by Likud are nothing but actions out of
political and election considerations.
</P>
<P>
The Labor, Israel's main oppositon party, has asked the
government where the money will come from to go to the
infrastructure in East Jerusalem.

COPENHAGEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shuttlers will try to
defend the Sudirman Cup mixed team championship which starts here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Li Furong, chief-de-mission of the Chinese delegation, admitted
that China will meet strong challenge from its arch rivals from
Malaysia, Denmark, South Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
China, a badminton power in the past decade, notched up the
first title in Lausanne, 1995 and retained the crown in Glasgow,
Scotland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to defend the title, but obviously, South Korea,
Indonesia and Malaysia are also strong contenders," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women shuttlers, spearheaded by world champion Ye
Zhaoying, will face no threats in the championships while their
men's counterparts could not boast of such advantage.
</P>
<P>
"If our men's shuttlers had been strong, it would be a smooth
way for us to win the mixed team championships," said Li Furong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team's strength is plagued by the injuries of men's
players such as top singles player Sun Jun, Dong Jiong and mixed
doubles shuttler Liu Yong.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun, who was forced to withdraw from the All England
Championships by back injury, is still under treatment while Liu
Yong, Olympic gold medal winner with his women partner Ge Fei, is
also not in his top form with left shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
China will open its title defense on Monday evening by playing
Malaysia in a group match.

<HEADLINE> Thai Media Workers Condemn NATO Attack on Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-six journalists from eight
newspapers in Bangkok Monday submitted a letter to the U.S.
embassy here, strongly condemning NATO for targeting journalists
in its air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the journalists described as "despicable" NATO's
air attack on a Serb TV studio which killed 10 media workers and a
series of other attacks on TV stations and transmitters in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also cited the latest killing of three Chinese reporters
DPA253SPE037S10PEQL20:4020:401533
in NATO's air attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"NATO, by directly targeting journalists, has violated the
Geneva Convention, which calls for the protection of journalists
as non-combatants," the journalists said in their letter.
</P>
<P>
"More forebodingly, the bombings have set a precedent where
journalists and their workplaces are considered legitimate targets
in wars," they added.
</P>
<P>
"Killing journalists is the most extreme form of censorship,
and the enemies of press freedom understand that well," the letter
said. "NATO, by bombing Serbian TV and killing journalists, is no
different from those it criticized for brutal acts of barbarity."
</P>
<P>
The Thai journalists called on the United States, the de facto
leader of NATO, to fully respect the rights of journalists to
carry out their professional duty, and demanded an immediate halt
to NATO's attacks against the Serbian media.
</P>
<P>
"We also demand NATO to immediately stop the bombing of
Yugoslavia and call on the United Nations to negotiate a peaceful
resolution to the conflict," they said.
</P>
<P>
Pravit Rojanaphruk, one of the 86 journalists, told Xinhua in
front of the U.S. embassy that more and more journalists became
concerned about the attacks on journalists in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He and his counterparts might contact foreign journalists in
Bangkok and the Federation of Journalists in Hong Kong to take
further action if responses from the U.S. side are not
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prasong Lertratnavisut, deputy chairman of the Thai
Federation of Journalists, issued a separate statement on Monday,
strongly condemning NATO's attacks on Yugoslav TV stations and
killing of three Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
He said in the statement that "the barbaric acts revealed the
cruelty of the U.S.-led NATO, and were by no means humanitarian
acts."
</P>
<P>
"The destruction of media buildings and killings of journalists
are conducts of a dictator and are a form of censorship, which
will prevent people from getting correct information from the
media," he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Former Lebanese Ministers Questioned in Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Three former Lebanese ministers of
ex-premier Rafik Hariri's government appeared Monday in Beirut's
Justice Palace for judicial questioning over charges of
squandering municipal funds in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
The summons for the three ex-ministers followed a report by
the State Audit Department early last month about irregular money
vouchers and heavy waste of municipal funds in Beirut and the
Mount Lebanon Province.
</P>
<P>
A financial official of the Mount Lebanon governorate, Abdel
Kader Itani, was arrested 12 days ago in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers are ex-Minister of State for Financial
Affairs Fuad Sinyoura, ex-Minister of Rural and Municipal Affairs
Hagop Demirjian and his successor Bassem Al-Sabaa, who was also
Hariri's information minister.
</P>
<P>
The latter two are members of the current parliament and thus
no legal procedures can be taken against them before the
legislature waives their parliamentary immunity.
</P>
<P>
The case, along with other graft files, was opened shortly
after last November's swearing-in of President Emile Lahoud, who
vowed to launch a massive campaign against corrupt officials
who served under the previous governments.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition parties said the campaign was a political
revenge aimed at besmirching the previous governments and covering
up the nation's current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is now undergoing the serious economic recession since
the end of the 1975-1990 civil war due to a huge public debt and
ballooning budget deficit.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- In line with the policy of
transparency, Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered all
government agencies to submit a list of all contracts they have
entered into since July last year, government officials said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada directed all government departments, agencies,
subsidiaries of government-owned and government-controlled
corporations, or local government units to submit their lists no
later than May 30, 1999, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as asking that the list be updated on a
quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
"The listing must be arranged chronologically and contain
information as to the contracting party, the subject of the
contract, the date bidding, if any had been held, the price, and
date of completion," Estrada said in his directive.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has already implemented several measures to ensure the
wise use of public funds and the transparency of all government
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he directed all government agencies to submit all
contracts worth 50 million pesos (1.25 million U.S. dollars) and
above for review and approval.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also directed them to stop the practice of avoiding
scrutiny by splitting contracts worth this amount or more.

</P>
<P>
Makhan told Ogang that the OAU Economic and Cooperation
Department is preoccupied with regional cooperation and
integration and in this regard the OAU is ready to assist the bank
in advertizing its projects and programs through the African
Economic Community newsletter.
</P>
<P>
He said that those areas in Africa which are less prone to
conflict should go ahead with economic development.
</P>
<P>
Ogang expressed deep satisfaction with the way his bank was
operating by way of financing the private sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the regional bank head expressed concern that the
current political climate is hindering the optimal functioning of
the bank, noting that due to this factor, foreign capital could
not come to the eastern and southern Africa in the desired
magnitude.
</P>
<P>
Ogang also expressed his wish for cooperation with the OAU.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Overseas Investment Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and the State Economic and Trade
Commission began a five-day workshop here on Monday to try to
promote Chinese investment overseas.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to provide information for officials and
entrepreneurs from various parts of China on China's overseas
investment policy, overseas markets, and the investment
environment of various nations, according to MOFTEC officials.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng said at a ceremony for the
workshop that overseas investment in the processing business is
one strategy of restructuring the national economy and increasing
exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China had 5,600 overseas ventures in 160
countries and regions, with investment contracts worth more than
600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chinese investment overseas is mainly in trade, resources
development, processing, transport, project contracts, and food
services. The new investment in processing means processing goods
overseas with Chinese equipment and technology and has been
growing rapidly in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The trade minister said that China will encourage companies to
invest in processing overseas with a number of preferential tax,
finance, and insurance policies.

<HEADLINE> Retired Generals, Diplomats Condemn Embassy Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Retired Chinese generals, diplomats,
and researchers at the China Institute for International Strategic
Studies held continuous sessions to condemn NATO's missile attack
on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia at midnight last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the three-day sessions held from May 8 to 10
condemned NATO's "brutal atrocity" for causing severe damage to
the embassy and casualties among Chinese diplomats and staff
members.
</P>
<P>
They expressed firm support for the Chinese government's solemn
statement and the public speech that Chinese Vice President Hu
Jintao made on television about the incident.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that NATO led by the United States brutally
violated the sovereignty of China through this atrocity and
recklessly trampled on the Vienna Treaty of International
Relations and the norm of international relations.
</P>
<P>
The veteran generals and diplomats voiced their extreme
indignation and strongest condemnation on NATO's atrocity and
their firm support for the Chinese government in maintaining the
right to make further reactions.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that under the fallacy that "human rights are
above sovereignty" that it cooked up, U.S.-led NATO has been
wantonly and indiscriminately bombing the sovereign country of
Yugoslavia, causing heavy casualties among innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"This bloody fact thoroughly revealed the truth that the U.S.
is violating sovereignty and pursuing hegemony under the false
disguise of noisily calling for 'human rights'," they said.
</P>
<P>
They strongly demanded that U.S.-led NATO stop bombing
Yugoslavia immediately.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the consensus that they will turn burning
indignation into powerful motivation. They said that under the
leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the Central Military Commission (CMC) with Jiang
Zemin at the core, they will work hard to maintain stability, push
forward reform, promote economic growth, step up defense
development, and increase the national strength, so as to make
more contributions to fighting against hegemony and safeguarding
world peace.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks APEC Agreement on Short-Term Capital Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia hopes to see some
progress on short-term capital regulation at the sixth APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) finance ministers' meeting to
be held in the country later this week.
</P>
<P>
Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said Monday Malaysia
hopes that the meeting to be held in Langkawi, northern Malaysia,
on May 15 and 16, would make "some movement" towards getting a
concrete agreement on the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as the host, will take advantage at the meeting to
push for reforms of the international financial architecture,
Mustapa said at a press conference on the latest development
concerning the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will also try to get similar message across through a
working group on short-term capital flows set up by the Group of
Seven developed countries (G-7), he said. Malaysia is a country
outside the G-7, which was appointed to participate in the working
group.
</P>
<P>
"This is an area where Malaysia can play a role in getting the
international community to understand our views, and more
importantly, come to a consensus," Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
He said some developed countries were not keen on regulating
short-term capital movement, although they agreed on its
monitoring and transparency.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said APEC finance ministers are expected to issue a
joint statement on the meeting and their deliberations at the
meeting would be submitted in a report to the APEC leaders'
meeting to be held in New Zealand in September.
</P>
<P>
All APEC finance ministers will attend the meeting except for
those of the United States, Chile, Peru and Vietnam, who will be
represented by their deputy ministers.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the finance ministers' meeting, APEC finance and
central bank deputies will meet on Friday, also in Langkawi, to
prepare for the ministerial-level meeting.
</P>
<P>
APEC Financiers Group (AFG), which comprises mainly private
bankers, will also hold a one-day meeting on Friday to deliberate
on matters like corporate bonds.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Opens Biggest Fraud Case Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The People's Court of Ho Chi Minh
City Monday commenced hearings on Vietnam's biggest fraud and
corruption case, Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The key defendants in the case, known as the Minh Phung-Epco
case, are Tang Minh Phung and Lien Khui Thin who are accused of
defrauding 4 trillion Vietnamese dong (286 million U.S. dollars)
from the Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (Vietcombank) and the
Ho Chi Minh City branch of the Industry and Commerce Bank
(Incombank).
</P>
<P>
Phung and Thin allegedly built a network of 40 nominal
affiliate companies and collaborated with corrupt bank officials
to trick banks, mainly Vietcombank and Incombank, into granting
loans to them, VNA quoted Dang The Hong, director of the Ho Chi
Minh City People's Inspectorate as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 77 defendants involved in the case, 24 are former state
employees and communist party members. Nearly 20 defendants worked
in the banking sector. Pham Tan Khoa, former vice chairman of the
People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City's District 3, was also
required to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The Minh Phung-Epco case, which had taken investigators more
than two years to complete their work, is scheduled to last 45
days.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five defense lawyers will take part in the case. Tang
Minh Phung will be defended by five lawyers and Lien Khui Thin by
two.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court handed death
penalty to three people for their involvement in Vietnam's biggest
ever corruption case, known as Tamexco case, in which 400 billion
Vietnamese dong (about 28 million dollars) of state funds and bank
loans were appropriated.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Chinese FM Lodges Serious Representation to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan here this afternoon again lodged a serious representation
with James Sasser, U.S. ambassador to China, in which he put
forward four requirements to U.S.-led NATO after their attack
against the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Tang issued the following
solemn requests to U.S.-led NATO:
</P>
<P>
1. To make an open and official apology to the Chinese
government, the Chinese people, and relatives of the Chinese
victims;
</P>
<P>
2. To carry out a complete and thorough investigation of the
NATO missile attack on China's embassy in Yugoslavia;
</P>
<P>
3. To promptly publicize the detailed results of the
investigation;
</P>
<P>
4. To severely punish those responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that U.S.-led NATO wantonly used missiles to attack
the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which
caused many casualties and left the embassy building devastated.
</P>
<P>
"This is an open defiance and serious destruction of the U.N.
Charter and norms of international relations, and a gross
encroachment on Chinese sovereignty," he told Sasser.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already issued a solemn statement on
the matter, in which it expressed utmost indignation and extreme
condemnation of the brutal act, and presented the strongest
protest to U.S.-led NATO, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has demanded that U.S.-led NATO bear all
responsibilities for this incident, he said, adding that the
Chinese side will continue to pay close attention to the
development of the matter.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that "it must be clearly stated that the military
operation of U.S.-led NATO against Yugoslavia has brought abysmal
disaster to people in the region,"
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO must stop military operation against Yugoslavia
immediately so as to bring the Kosovo issue back to the track of
political solution as soon as possible," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side also presented an official note on the matter
to the U.S. side.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Affairs Office Condemns U.S.-Led NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council convened a forum today to condemn the barbarous act
of the U.S.-led NATO attacks on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the forum, presided over by Chen Yunlin,
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, participants all stood in
silent tribute to the three people, all journalists, killed in the
U.S.-led NATO strikes of the night of May 7.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he and other workers at his organization strongly
condemn and protest the air strikes of the U.S.-led NATO forces in
Yugoslavia and the barbarous act of the U.S.-led NATO raid in
attacking the Chinese embassy in Belgrade from different
directions, killing three people, injuring 20 others, and
seriously damaging the embassy building .
</P>
<P>
"We firmly support the righteous statement issued by the
Chinese Government on May 8, endorse and implement the guidelines
of the televised speech delivered yesterday afternoon by Chinese
Vice President Hu Jintao on behalf of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese Government," said
Chen, "and we fully support all acts made by the Chinese
Government toward the attacks."
</P>
<P>
He said he considers the barbarous act of the U.S.-led NATO
forces a grave infringement on China's sovereignty, a serious
provocation of the 1.2 billion Chinese people, and a wanton
trampling on international conventions and fundamental norms of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO forces should bear full responsibilities
arising thereafter," he went on.
</P>
<P>
"The grave incident helps us further understand the nature of
the anti-China forces in the Western world, the ugly face of
hegemonism, the disingenuous nature of so-called 'safeguarding
human rights,' inspire Chinese people's patriotism and national
spirit, and better understand the meaning of 'backwardness
getting bullied'," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
China is now in an important period of socialist modernization
and badly needs stability and progress, said Chen, "therefore, we
should keep a clear mind and be vigilant, try hard to safeguard
the stability, closely unite around the CPC Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin as its core, unite as one, struggle hard, and try our
best to do a good job with Taiwan affairs."
</P>
<P>
The participants said the brutal act of U.S.-led NATO made
them understand that the so-called "human rights" advocated by
western countries are actually hegemonism, and better know the
nature of hegemonism of the Western world.
</P>
<P>
They pledged to turn sorrows and anger into force and use their
efforts to safeguard China's sovereignty and the integrity of
Chinese territory, and to promote the peaceful reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, many compatriots in Taiwan and
businessmen from Taiwan investing in the Chinese mainland phoned
or sent faxes to the Taiwan Affairs Office to condemn the act of U.
S.-led NATO and to send condolences and sympathy to relatives of
the three journalists killed and the 20 others injured in the
strikes.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Strengthen Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Chief of General Staff Vice
Admiral Mike Akhigbe has urged African countries to strengthen
their capacity for conflict prevention as peace and security are
nearly absent in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a three-day Africa Leadership Forum
(ALF) meeting held in Ogun State, southwestern Nigeria, Sunday,
the senior Nigerian officer noted that "it was when we find peace
ourselves that we would be able to preserve it ourselves."
</P>
<P>
He noted that from the Horn of Africa to central Africa, from
southern Africa to the Great Lakes region and down to west Africa,
"we are all caught in a collective fever of war and violence."
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted Akhigbe as saying that
part of the solution is to see the problem of security in Africa
as everybody's business while Africa's friends worldwide could
assist in achieving peace on the continent by helping Africans to
solve their problems themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than trying to force any solution from outside," he
pointed out, "the external powers should give Africa the necessary
material and logistic support to encourage home-grown sub-regional
initiative for conflict resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The army chief cited the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG as an example of home-grown initiative at conflicts
resolution.
</P>
<P>
At the African leadership forum which was founded by Nigerian
President- elect General Olusegun Obasanjo, Akigbe told more than
100 participants that with ECOMOG and other back-up initiatives,
"conflicts, especially armed struggles, would be reduced to a
manageable level."
</P>
<P>
He urged African countries to keep the arm merchants out of the
 continent by dropping their guns and grabbing the lifelines of
dialog and compromise.
</P>
<P>
"Arms dealers are worse than slave traders and drug
traffickers," he noted, adding that as Africa marches into the new
millennium, "we must strive towards presenting a new face to the
world by embarking on a holistic overhaul of our attitude toward
governance and conflict resolution. "

<HEADLINE> HK Celebrities Denounce NATO Air Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Political, economic and community
leaders in Hong Kong have expressed their condemnation over the U.
S.-led NATO's air attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued by the Hong Kong deputies of the
National People's Congress Monday said NATO's act was a brutal
violation of China's sovereignty and wanton violation of the
international conventions governing diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded the U.S-led NATO to take full
responsibility and make "formal apology and compensation."
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin-chi, member of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC), said in a statement that NATO's
deliberate air attack on the Chinese embassy was an infringement
and provocation of China's sovereignty and should be denounced by
all peace-loving people of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said he "firmly supports" the solemn statement issued by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by all the Hong Kong members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference said they were "shocked and indignant" by NATO's "
barbarous act."
</P>
<P>
The statement said they support all necessary steps taken by
the Chinese government to safeguard the country's sovereignty and
dignity and demand that NATO be "fully responsible" for the air
attack.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan, member of the NPC Standing Committee and president of
Hong Kong's Legislative Council, said NATO should be responsible
for their act of infringing China's sovereignty and respect one of
the fundamental human rights - the right of existence. She
demanded that NATO immediately stop their killing of the innocent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of trade unions, community organizations,
and some academic and educational institutions also issued
statements or remarks to denounce the NATO act.
</P>
<P>
They stated that the air attack was an open challenge to the
international diplomatic conventions and displayed the
hypocritical nature of human rights, democracy and freedom
proclaimed by U.S. politicians.
</P>
<P>
The air attack showed the hegemonic nature of the U.S.-led NATO
and was a "signal of danger" that cast a shadow on the coming 21st
Century, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) condemned the
killing of three Chinese journalists in the air attack.
</P>
<P>
The HKJA said it will demand and ask for NATO's promise to
protect journalists in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
When NATO attacked the Serbian state television late April, the
HKJA signed a protest letter to NATO along with more than 20
press freedom organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
An organization of educators in Hong Kong expressed extreme
outrage and strong condemnation over NATO's attack and extended
deep condolences to the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The organization called on the U.S.-led NATO to stop air
attacks, apologize to China and compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, protesters from various political parties, social
organizations and other sectors in Hong Kong marched to the U.S.
Consulate for a third consecutive day to voice their indignation
and protest.

city of Tianjin today issued a public statement condemning the
NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Build New Dam to Improve Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Water, Mussa Nkhangaa, said that the
construction of Kidunda Dam will augment the Dar es Salaam water
supply capacity to 90 million gallons per day, according to
Monday's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Plans are also underway to rebuild the water distribution
system in Dar es Salaam, said the minister last weekend while
inspecting four newly completed water boreholes financed by the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as additional water
sources in case of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Currently the water supply capacity of Dar es Salaam stays at
DPA166HAB039I10TEQL18:0018:001035
60 million gallons every day, which can hardly meet the needs of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Numerous leakages on the worn-out water system in the city have
led to a loss of about 40 percent of water pumped from the Ruvu
station, Nkhangaa said, adding that the boreholes drilled in the
city and the Coast Region in the east will provide more than one
million gallons of clean water per day.
</P>
<P>
He said UNDP has committed 150,000 U.S. dollars to finance the
drilling the construction works of another seven boreholes in Dar
es Salaam and Coast regions.
</P>
<P>
The cost of Kidunda Dam is estimated to be 110 million U.S.
dollars on the 1995 basis, said Nkhangaa. The cost, together with
the rebuilding of Dar es Salaam water network, is going to be
covered by a World Bank soft loan.
</P>
<P>
The population of Dar es Salaam stands at 3 million and is
still increasing at an annual rate of some eight percent,
municipal government officials said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Dar es Salaam frequently suffered from water
shortages. Last May, more than one third of residents in the city
have no access to mains water for more than a week after floods
washed away a section of water pipeline in the outskirts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
A spell of drought starting last October forced water level of
the Ruvu to fall at alarmingly low levels for months, creating
fears in Dar es Salaam. The city also experienced a water crisis
in 1996 after a spell of dry weather.
</P>
<P>
When water is in short supply, the government would adopt a
water rationing system and call on people to save water by using
treated water for irrigation and car washing.

<HEADLINE> Abubakar Bids Nigerian Politicians Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian outgoing Head of State
General Abdulsalami Abubakar has stressed the need to embark on
vigorous political engineering in the country with a view to
ushering in an acceptable political culture.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a farewell address to elected senators and members
of the House of Representatives in capital Abuja on Sunday, he
said "this will stabilize the political terrain, thereby leading
to an enduring democracy devoid of any threat of military
intervention."
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar counselled the lawmakers-in-waiting to be in
close touch with their various constituencies with a view to
understand their difficulties and seeking reasonable solutions,
according to a Nigerian Tribune report Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Your conduct will therefore determine the level of confidence
the people would have in the system," stressed the head of state
who is scheduled to hand over power to President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar also urged the in-coming government to
consider "the need to overcome the problem of nationhood by
building a strong and united Nigeria, where Love, justice and
fairplay will reign supreme," when he held what seemed to be his
valedictory meeting on Saturday with leaders of the three
political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, former Vice-President Alex Ekweme, spokesman
for the three political parties, said that he and his colleagues
initially doubted the sincerity of the military government when it
unfolded its political transition program.
</P>
<P>
But, he thanked the head of state for keeping faith with the
program, the implementation of which he described as commendable.
</P>
<P>
In an address at a reception held Sunday evening in his honor
in Niger State, Abubakar noted that military intervention into the
political life of the country had not been able to solve the
numerous problems facing the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
"Too many military intervention has created problems for the
country," General Abubakar stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said with the successful conduct of elections for all the
tiers of government and the promulgation of the decree backing the
1999 constitution, the country was now set for a smooth move into
democracy.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar is set to hold two briefing sessions with
President- elect General Obasanjo as part of preparations for the
May 29 hand-over date.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy Attack Exposes True Face of "Human Rights Champion" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO's missile attack
of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade has exposed again the true face
of the so-called "human rights champion," the head of the Chinese
mission to the United Nations Office at Geneva said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-led NATO attack of the embassy is a rare action in
the diplomatic history," Ambassador Qiao Zonghuai said in a press
statement. "It constitutes a gross violation of the sovereignty of
China and the human rights of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was attacked late Friday night
by NATO missiles, which resulted in three people dead, more than
20 injured and serious destruction of the office building and the
residence of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
At the 55th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights that
was concluded only last month in Geneva, Qiao recalled, the United
States targeted China out of its domestic partisan strife.
</P>
<P>
"While the gunpowder smoke of confrontation has barely vanished
at the commission, it has targeted China again, but this time in
the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Qiao pointed out, a diplomatic mission,
such as the Chinese embassy to Yugoslavia, is the symbol of
sovereignty of a state. Its security and safety are protected by
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and should not be
flagrantly infringed upon by anyone, he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, NATO, cloaked with humanitarianism and in defiance of
world opinion, has launched gratuitous attacks at the Chinese
diplomatic mission and savagely slaughtered the Chinese citizens,"
the Chinese ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and its people express their utmost
indignation and strongest condemnation over this brutality and
lodge the strongest protest," he said. "The U.S.-led NATO must
bear all the responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
On NATO's air strikes against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia,
Qiao said that NATO's frenzied bombardment during the past 40-odd
days has cost heavy casualties of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Facts vindicate that it is the U.S.-led NATO which has caused
the humanitarian catastrophe," he said. "Its acts fully expose the
hypocritical nature of its advocacy of human rights."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and its people strongly urge an
immediate halt to the U.S.-led NATO attack and aggression against
Yugoslavia in a bid to bring the Kosovo issue back to the track of
political solution as soon as possible," Qiao said.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Claim on Embassy Attack Unconvincing: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official on Monday
denounced as "totally unconvincing" the NATO's claim that it
"accidentally bombed" the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO's claim that it "'accidentally bombed' a building as
large as the Chinese Embassy is totally unconvincing," Egyptian
Deputy Prime Minister Youssef Wali said in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The United States-led NATO, which possesses advanced precision
guided weapons, fired three missiles from three different angles
at the five-story Chinese Embassy in Belgrade Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The barbarous attack killed three Chinese nationals, a female
reporter of Xinhua and a young couple of China's Guangming Daily,
and seriously damaged the building.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued a statement Saturday, expressing
the Chinese government and people's utmost indignation and severe
condemnation, and lodging the strongest protest.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO has failed to justify" its airstrike against the
Chinese Embassy, Wali, who is also the chairman of the
Egyptian-Chinese Friendly Association, stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called for an overall and thorough investigation into NATO's
attack on the Chinese Embassy, leading to a justifiable
explanation.
</P>
<P>
Wali expressed to the Chinese people condolences and sympathy
over the death and injury of the Chinese nationals in NATO's
brutal attack on the Chinese Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Form Khmer Rouge Prison Chief Founded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statement released Monday by Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cabinet
said that "the cabinet of the Prime Minister of the Royal
Government of Cambodia would inform that Duch is living under the
protection of the government with safety."
</P>
<P>
About Duch's trial, the statement said whether to try Duch
along with other Khmer Rouge leaders will depend on the decision
of the court. "It is the obligation of the court," it added.
</P>
<P>
Duch or Kaing Khek Iev, 56, was director of Tuol Sleng prison
in Phnom Penh under the Khmer Rouge regime in 1975 and disappeared
in 1979. He was recently found by a freelance photographer in
northwestern Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The Far Eastern Economic Review reported last week it had
tracked down Duch living freely in the west, widely believed to be
in the Pailin area, as a born-again Christian and aid worker.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Duch admitted to mass murder and was
willing to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
On May 6, Hun Sen ordered security forces to locate and protect
Duch.
</P>
<P>
Among the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders only Ta Mok was
arrested by the government and being detained in Phnom Penh
waiting for trial. Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, another two top
leaders of Khmer Rouge, defected to the government last year and
now live around Pailin.

<HEADLINE> China Should Go After NATO War Crimes: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China should go after U.S.-led NATO
for its war crimes in its attack on the country's embassy in
Belgrade, law experts said here today.
</P>
<P>
NATO has trampled international laws and the basic norms of
international relations, and the Chinese government has every
right to take actions against it according to relevant laws and
conventions, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
NATO bombed the Chinese embassy with three missiles on May 8 (
Beijing time), resulting in three deaths, one missing and dozens
injured, and embassy buildings were seriously damaged, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The barbarous act of the U.S.-led NATO has violated the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and the Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally
Protected Persons Including Diplomatic Agents, they added.
</P>
<P>
It constitutes war crimes to harm civilians and protected
persons under a law on endangering human peace and security, which
was approved by the United Nations in 1991, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under the guiding principles of the Nuremberg Trials after
World War II, it also constitutes major war crimes to slaughter
civilians and attack non-military targets, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy represents not only a
gross violation of China's sovereignty, but also an aggression
against and challenge to world peace, said Yu An, professor at the
Law School of prestigious Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
There has never been an act that disparages international laws
more than this, and it has set an extremely dangerous precedent,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"We must condemn the barbarous act, and war crimes must be
dealt with," the professor said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government should proceed from international laws
and norms of international relations, and adopt all necessary
measures to go after NATO for its war crimes, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO must make solemn apologies, punish war
criminals, and compensate for the casualties and property damages,
they said.
</P>
<P>
They should also guarantee that no such act will repeated in
the future, they stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Regrets NATO Bombing of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Monday
expressed its regret over NATO's bombing on Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, killing three, injuring more than 20, six seriously, and
destroying the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry said
the embassy, as a diplomatic building, deserves integrity respect
and immunity on the basis of international laws, not as a target
of regretful violence.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia believes that the conflict in Yugoslavia can never be
solved by means of arms, therefore all factions involved should
stop all forms of violence and use of arms, and settle their
conflicts through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government also expressed its condolences to the
death of Chinese journalists during NATO's attack on the Chinese
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
At least three were confirmed killed in the NATO air raid on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last Friday, with one identified
as a female correspondent of China's Xinhua news agency.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
quietly through Monday's trading session to finish narrowly weaker
after a roller coaster ride over the weekend triggered by the
confirmation of British gold sales.
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the close of foreign exchange trading in Sydney
Friday the Bank of England announced it would sell some of its
gold holdings, sparking a dive in the price of the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
Steve Chater, foreign exchange manager of IBJ Australia Bank,
said the domestic unit slid nearly two-thirds of a U.S. cent to
66.50 U.S. cents on the news, but a U.S. buyer stepped in at that
level to drive it back up.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 66.98 U.S. cents from 67.16 U.S. cents
Friday, after spending the day between 67.26 and 66.85 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Britain's treasury division announced Friday night it intended
to sell 415 tons of gold, as part of a restructuring plan to
adjust the proportion of its reserves represented by the currency.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was also buying
0.6237 euro from 0.6226 euro and 80.81 Japanese yen from 80.51
Japanese yen while the euro was trading at 1.0728 U.S. dollars
from 1.0788 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Missile Experts Refute NATO Deceit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese missile experts
said here today that the attack on the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia by U.S.-led NATO forces was a premeditated action.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Xinhua News Agency, these senior
experts, who have worked on missile research for dozens of years,
refuted NATO's deceit with technological analysis.
</P>
<P>
Although it is still not clear whether the bombs were cruise
missiles or air-to-ground missiles, they confirmed that NATO has
used precision-guided missiles with a margin of error of less than
ten meters.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that data of carefully calculated track and
pictures of target features shot by military satellites are input
into the missiles' computers.
</P>
<P>
Missiles will fly to planned targets following planned tracks,
they said, adding that when near their targets, the target
coordinates will be readjusted according to the pictures sent back
by cameras on the missiles.
</P>
<P>
One of the three missiles hit the top of the five-story
building of the Chinese embassy and penetrated down to the ground
floor, another hit the fourth floor straight on, and the third
seriously damaged a part between the office building and the
ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
They held that since the U.S. and its allies always boast of
their advanced and accurate weapons, it is impossible that all
three missiles could make such low-grade mistakes one by one.
</P>
<P>
NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last Friday
night was obviously an intentional and carefully planned action,
the experts said.

CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares closed
marginally higher Monday as a resurgent industrial sector more
than made up for a correction in resource stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 9.0 points higher at 2996.7,
thanks mainly to a 55.3 point jump in the all industrials index to
5233.8 points.
</P>
<P>
The story in resource stocks was different, as a 13 percent,
155.5 point, collapse in the gold index to 1018.0 points helped
the all resources index to a 43.0 point drop to 1224.2.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold in Sydney slumped to 280.90 U.S. dollars an
ounce Monday at the close, dramatically lower than Friday's close
of 288.80 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Diversified miner BHP was the worst performing resource major
on Monday with a 4.2 percent fall, or 74.2 cents, to 17.05
Australian dollars, while telecommunications giant Telstra was the
stand out industrial with a 5.3 percent gain, or 39.2 cents, to
7.755 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The falls in the rest of the non-gold resources sector were
more modest, however, with global miner Rio Tinto down 14.8 cents
to 24.702 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The story in industrial stocks was much more positive, however,
with the banks, financial services companies and
telecommunications roaring back to favor after a sell off on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
ANZ bank climbed 52.7 cents to 11.527 Australian dollars, the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia jumped 53.3 cents to 25.423

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are highlights of China's
trade news from May 4 to 9.
</P>
<P>
-- The China State Power Corporation (CSPC) announced last
Tuesday that the nearly three billion yuan of bonds it issued in
1998 will be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on May 6.
</P>
<P>
-- China and Cuba signed five trade and investment agreements
last Tuesday including a trade agreement, a framework agreement on
China's offer of preferential loans, an economic and technological
cooperation agreement on China's offer of interest- free loans and
another agreement on China's offer of free economic assistance
plus a summary of the current session.
</P>
<P>
-- The first phase of construction work on a paper mill with an
annual production capacity of 1.35 million tons has begun in the
city of Zhenjiang in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met with Leon Brittan, vice-
president of the Commission of the European Union (EU), here last
Wednesday afternoon. The two leaders exchanged views on bilateral
trade and on China's accession to the World Trade Organization (
WTO), saying they agreed to speed up bilateral negotiations on
China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
-- China's domestically produced milk powder is not selling
well, and stockpiles continue to increase, though the country's
dairy industry grows steadily, according to a report in the
Township Enterprise News.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi met with Cuban Foreign Trade
Minister Ricardo Cabrisas Ruiz here last Thursday. The two sides
exchanged views on the relations between the two countries and the
expansion of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- The list of agreements for China's accession to the WTO that
the U.S. side unilaterally published is not accurate, Chinese
trade minister Shi Guangsheng said here last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Although China and the United States scored major progress on
China's accession to the WTO during Premier Zhu Rongji's recent
visit to the United States, it was different from the published
list," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"China did reach agreements with the United States on some
issues, but some of the listed issues are still under negotiation,
and some so-called 'agreements' are only demands from the U.S.
side, and have never been agreed by the Chinese side," Shi added.

<P>
-- The negotiations with the European Union (EU) on China's
entry into the WTO were "constructive," and resulted in progress,
Shi Guangsheng said here last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue the technical group discussions in
Beijing, according to the minister. He said China's stand on its
WTO accession has not changed.
</P>
<P>
-- The opening to overseas investment of certain industries and
the service trade sector will bring more cooperation opportunities
for Chinese firms along with competition, Wu Yi made the remark at
a nationally televised conference, and urged Chinese firms to
grasp the new opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In order to give overseas investors more confidence, Wu Yi
urged that all regions improve their "soft environment", which
means more effective implementation of regulations and policies.
</P>
<P>
-- China's sustained effort to join the WTO is a part of its
reform and opening-up drive, according to a signed article in last
Friday's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The gradual opening of China's service sector is a need of the
ongoing reform and opening-up, rather than a concession, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
China's goal is to foster new economic growth points and boost
consumption, as well as to create positions of high- and middle-
income job opportunities, it said.
</P>
<P>
-- China's largest international trade fair, the Beijing
International Fair (BIF), will take place between May 20 and 24
this year at the Beijing International Exhibition Center,
organizers announced here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- European companies in China have stated their support for
the country's ambitions to join the WTO, saying the organization
should leave a comparatively long transitional period for China's
certain fragile industries to adjust.
</P>
<P>
Those expressed this opinion included Ericsson (China) Company
Ltd., the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, and the world electrical
giant Siemens.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Jointly to Source AIDS Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 African countries
recently set up a joint expert committee to explore the
possibility of African countries in sourcing anti-HIV drugs, the
East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee constituted by African health authorities
includes health ministers of Kenya, Swaziland, Zambia and Botswana
who were attending an international medical conference in capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting agreed that joint sourcing of
the drugs was the only way the continent could hope to supply
vital medicines to its growing number of HIV positive people.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising members from both government and
private sector, was mandated to develop mechanisms for
implementing the program, including the management of joint
finances.
</P>
<P>
According to Swazi Health Minister Phetsile Dlamini, joint
sourcing of AIDS drugs by African countries will give the
continent a stronger negotiating position with Western
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that at a cost of up to 15,000 U.S. dollars per
person per year, effective anti-retroviral therapies are way out
of reach for many the continent's health system, most of which
have per capita budgets of less than 10 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Anti-retrovirals have been credited with reducing the AIDS
death toll in the United States from over 50,000 in 1995 to just
about 18,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Currently, African has an estimated 20 million people infected

<P>
SEOUL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China and the Republic of Korea (ROK)
Monday hailed the smooth and rapid development of their relations
and vowed to continue the increasing exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), ROK Prime
Minister Kim Jong-pil and Speaker Park Jyun-kyu of the ROK

<HEADLINE> Beijing Remodels Two Major Museums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
announced today that it has entrusted a construction engineering
company with the remodeling of the Museum of the Chinese
Revolution and the Museum of Chinese History.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the municipal government has undertaken
the remodeling of the two well-known museums on the east side of
Tian'anmen Square since they were built in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The two museums, with 320,000 historic relics in their
collections, have been among Beijing's ten major buildings since
they were put up 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The remodeling which began today is estimated to cost some 100
million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars), and 50,000 square
meters of area will be remodeled.
</P>
<P>
The remodeling project includes consolidation and re-
ornamenting the exterior including more than 60 stone pillars in
front of the museum gate, changing the glazed tiles, and paving
the front grounds.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed this August, just in
time for the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Those in charge said that a portion of the two museums about
the Chinese history will be open to tourists during the remodeling
period as usual.

<HEADLINE> China Develops High-Quality New Building Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is taking effective measures
to develop high-quality new building materials in a bid to meet
the needs of the vast construction of infrastructure facilities
and housing projects now underway.
</P>
<P>
China will support the development of large building materials
enterprises this year, and give priority to improving industrial
structure and developing new building materials, quality cement,
and plate glass urgently needed by those projects, according to
Yang Zhiyuan, deputy director of the State Administration of
Building Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in the first four months this year
China's production of building materials made big headway. The
quality of the products has improved, with the quality ratio now
nearly 90 percent; the ratio between production and marketing is
better and exceeds that of the national average; earnings from the
sector picked up month by month, and exports of the building
materials were brisk.
</P>
<P>
The accelerating pace of the construction of infrastructure
facilities and housing projects has effectively boosted the growth
of the building materials industry, said the official.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country's annual cement output stands at 490
million tons, or more than one third of the world's total, and the
annual output of plate glass has reached 160 million heavy boxes,
accounting for nearly 30 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China is still trying to attract more
overseas funds to produce new building materials, inorganic non-
metallic materials, and equipment for manufacturing building
materials.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the use of overseas funds should take account
of the industry's product-mix readjustment and environmental
protection. The funds will be introduced mainly for production of
quality cement, glass, and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he encourages the construction of large cement
projects and technology upgrading in small cement plants. In
sanitary ceramics production, the focus will be on improving
product quality, he added.

<HEADLINE> CPIFA Strongly Condemns NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Institute of
Foreign Affairs (CPIFA) issued a statement today strongly
condemning the U.S.-led NATO attacks on the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the bombing is a gross violation of
Chinese sovereignty and a random violation of the norms of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The CPIFA strongly protests and condemns the shocking and
bloody criminal act committed by the U.S.-led NATO forces and
firmly supports the solemn statement issued by the Chinese
government on May 8.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the CPIFA also expresses profound condolences
for the Chinese journalists killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The barbaric action by the U.S.-led NATO forces fully uncovers
their true nature of hegemonism and the hypocrisy of "human rights
" they advocate, the statement notes.
</P>
<P>
"He who is unjust is doomed to destruction. The Chines people
are not to be bullied," the statement says.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO forces should bear all responsibilities
arising therefrom, the statement stresses.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Backs Asian Candidate for WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, Africa's most
influential member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), has
joined the fray over the continued impasse in selecting the trade
watchdog's new head, Business Day newspaper said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a move that pits Pretoria against the WTO's most powerful
members -- the European Union (EU) and the United States -- South
Africa has openly reiterated its support for Supachai
Panitchpakdi, the Thai deputy prime minister who is trailing
behind the other remaining candidate in the race, Mike Moore, New
Zealand's former premier.
</P>
<P>
Bahle Sibisi, the chief director for foreign trade relations of
the Trade and Industry Department, said at the weekend that
Pretoria was continuing to back Supachai.
</P>
<P>
He signalled that South Africa would not join other WTO
members, such as developed countries, in calling upon Supachai to
step down.
</P>
<P>
Most of the EU's 15 members and the U.S. backed Moore, while
Asian nations, including Japan, and some African countries support
Supachai.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock has prompted some members, including Japan, to
seek a vote, a proposal that is fiercely resisted by the U.S.,
which fears a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
As the impasse continues, Sibisi has urged WTO members to step
back and focus on what is at stake: the preparations for the WTO's
third ministerial meeting in Seattle, U.S,. in December. He warned
that resentment and polarization of members arising from the
leadership race could complicate the next round of market-opening
talks.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that if Supachai loses, the WTO's developing
members will, at best, be unenthusiastic about supporting the
WTO's policies and, at worst, they will just shrink back to
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
A Moore victory will also fuel the perception that the world's
multilateral bodies are simply "rich man's club".

<HEADLINE> NATO's Raid on China's Embassy Condemned in Wellington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Leading members of the New
Zealand-
China Friendship Society and New Zealand Chinese community
strongly
condemned NATO's air raids on Yugoslavia and especially its recent
raids
on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the Christchurch City in New Zealand's South
Island,
Bill Willmott, national president of New Zealand-China Friendship

Society, Monday told Xinhua in a telephone interview that the
bombing of
the Chinese embassy is "an outrage against international
diplomatic
conventions."
</P>
<P>
"As national president of the New Zealand-China Friendship
Society, I
have written today to our Minister of Foreign Affairs Don
Mckinnon,
urging the New Zealand Government to express its strongest
condemnation
of this act.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand should take this opportunity to call on its
friends in
NATO to stop the illegal bombing of Yugoslavia forthwith and allow
the
United Nations to take its rightful role in seeking a peaceful
solution
to the Kosovo crisis," Willmott said.
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply horrified, shocked and saddened to hear of the
bombardment by NATO of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade which has
resulted in 4 deaths and over 20 injured," said Nancy Goddard,
national
secretary of the Society in an interview with Xinhua Monday.
</P>
<P>
"No excuses of any sort can be accepted for bombardment in a
residential area.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO action is an international crime and cannot be
accepted by
the rest of the world," she said.
</P>
<P>
Goddard added: "China has always stood by her policy of non-
intervention in the affairs of any other countries and NATO
intervention
in the affairs of Yugoslavia is a flagrant flouting of that
principle."
</P>
<P>
Bing Fon, committee member of the Wellington Branch of the
Society,
told Xinhua that for years the United States has been acting as a
world
policeman. It has been pursuing a hegemonist policy by using force

against anyone who does not act according to its will. The latest
tragedy
suffered by the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a result of
hegemony
practiced by the United States and its allies in NATO.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his sincere condolences to the families of the

Chinese victims, Fon said that the barbarous act of the United
States and
its allies has reasonably prompted the strong opposition and
protest from
the Chinese people and the peoples in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Hai Zhu, president of New Zealand New Overseas Chinese
Friendship
Association, told Xinhua that he's very sad when he learned the
deaths
of his compatriots in Belgrade. He criticized the United States
and its
NATO allies for placing themselves above the United Nations and
launching
air strikes presumptuously against Yugoslavia. "This is a
manifestation
of hegemonism," he said, adding that the Yugoslav issue should be
solved
through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Six organizations formed respectively by New Zealand students,

scholars, businessmen, fellow provincials or townsmen of Chinese
origin
in Auckland, the biggest city in New Zealand, have issued a joint

statement, strongly condemning NATO for its bombardment of the
Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, which has resulted in severe casualties and
heavy
property losses.
</P>
<P>
In the statement they said that the missile attacks on the
Chinese
embassy were a flagrant violation of China's sovereignty and an
infringe
upon human rights. The statement added that NATO's act has
wantonly
trampled on the basic norms governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement held the NATO countries headed by the United
States
responsible for all consequences arising from their act.

<HEADLINE> Aged People Propose "Tree Burials" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two elderly people in north
China's Shanxi Province have written a letter proposing tree
burials, that is, the burying of cremains of the dead beneath
trees instead of in the traditional manner.
</P>
<P>
"Burial under trees is the best form in the current effort to
reform burials and afforestate the motherland," the letter says.
</P>
<P>
The letter goes on to note that 10 million infants are born in
the country every year, while land resources are decreasing due to
soil erosion, desertization, and infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Zhao Yuhuan, a 78-year-old retired
construction company worker. Zhao came up with this idea four
years ago, when she read newspaper reports about the tree burial
for a retired official.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, she has campaigned, at her own
expense, to look for comrades in and out of the province. "I hope
I will get official support to set up a non-government voluntary
group to promote this cause," she says.
</P>
<P>
Tree burial involves digging a pit in the ground, putting the
cremains into the pit, and then planting a tree over the grave,
said an official from the local civil affairs department.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who have accepted this new form of burial
remains small due to traditional thinking, the official says. So
far, only five tree burials have been reported in Taiyuan, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Li Ying, whose husband, Cheng Dadong, was buried beneath a tree
in accordance with his wishes, strongly advocates this new form of
burial. She wrote in a poem commemorating her husband, "Let's be
tree-growers together, after my burial alongside you."
</P>
<P>
To date, 89 local people have applied for a tree burial in
response to the letter, and a village in the city's suburbs has
allocated 1.33 hectares of land for those who want to be buried in
this way.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in Toronto, Canada's
biggest city, rallied and demonstrated Saturday and Sunday,
strongly condemning NATO's missile attack on the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade Friday night.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 protesters of overseas Chinese, Chinese
Canadians, Chinese students and Yugoslav Canadians held a protest
rally at Toronto's municipal square Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 representatives spoke at the rally, condemning the
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, which killed three
Chinese journalists and injured more than 20 other persons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade has
violated the United Nations Charter and international laws, said B.
N. Cham, Chairman of the Confederation of Toronto Chinese and
Canadian organizations.
</P>
<P>
A Yugoslav Canadian said that NATO's missile attack on the
Chinese embassy was by no means fortuitous. It was because China
had firmly opposed NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, more than 1,000 protesters demonstrated
in front of the U.S. Consulate in Toronto, and then gathered at
University street of the city. A Chinese student representative in
a speech at the rally condemned NATO's barbaric act against the
Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia violated the
sovereignty of the Balkan country and urged NATO to stop bombing
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The marchers also went to China's Consulate General in Toronto
and laid fresh flowers at its front gate to express their deep
mourning to the Chinese killed in NATO's air strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's unremitting efforts to
protect the environment have provided an increasing number of
chances for investors over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu Province, one of the country's economic powerhouses,
the environmental protection industry has emerged as a new
economic growth area.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Jiangsu Provincial Planning and Economic
Commission show that about 1,500 enterprises are now involved in
the developing, manufacturing and trading of anti-pollution
equipment, with total annual output value of 8 billion yuan and
profits of one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
One of these enterprises, the Jiangsu Ningke Company, began
producing auto exhaust control devices in 1995, and its monthly
sales have jumped up to 3,000 units, about 10 times the figure of
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-pollution equipment is selling well now, thanks to the
state's environmental protection policy," General Manager Mo
Wenming said.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Environmental Protection Administration,
all Chinese automobiles not up to exhaust emission standards are
required to be equipped with an exhaust-treatment device by July.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, products for treating waste water, waste industrial
gas, and waste residue as well as auto exhaust all have a ready
market.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China's annual output in environmental
protection industry has maintained a 30 percent growth in recent
years, higher than that of most other industries.

TAIYUAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province plans
to invest 13.2 billion yuan (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) this year
in 23 key projects.
</P>
<P>
These projects are mainly in the fields of telecommunications

infrastructure construction, and reforms in institutions of higher
learning, and include two power plants, the Yangcheng, and the
Yangquan, and the Wanjiazhai key water control project.

projects have played an important part in its economy. The total
investment for last year topped 15.38 billion yuan, increasing the

projects have not only improved traffic condition, lessening the
pressure on coal transportation, but have also accelerated the

projects according to international standards as well, enabling

<HEADLINE> Grain Output to Increase 6 Percent in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's grain output will reach
1.787 million tons in the current agricultural year (from July 1,
1998 to June 30, 1999), a six percent increase over last year's
1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
The Prediction System for Mozambique's Food Security announced
this in Monday's Noticias newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The system predicted that of the agricultural production this
year, 1. 191 million tons will be maize and 204,000 tons will be
rice.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the envisaged increase to the planting acreages
enlarged from 3.976 million hectares last year to 4.154 million
hectares this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 63,000 hectares of farming land has been flooded in
southern and central Mozambique, but generally speaking the
climate is normal.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican food security foresees that 217,000 tons of
commercial grain, mainly maize, could be supplied for the market
during 1999 and 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-led NATO air attack on the
Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was condemned Monday by the
Victorian branch of Australia-China Friendship Society.
</P>
<P>
Betty Little, president of the Melbourne-based branch,
described the air attack on the embassy as outrageous.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to leading Australian newspapers, the president
said the air attack "is against all the principles laid down by
the United Nations" and "is an act of open aggression."
</P>
<P>
"The loss of valuable lives and the injuries inflicted on (the
Chinese embassy) staff fills us with sorrow and anger," she said
in a letter to Wu Ronghe, consul general of the People's Republic
of China in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 50 Australian Chinese groups in Sydney told Xinhua
that they condemned in the strongest terms the savage act
committed by U.S.-led NATO against the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
The leaders are scheduled to meet on Monday night to discuss
the next steps they would take in their protest over the NATO air
attack.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the 50 groups in Australia's biggest state New
South Wales, of which Sydney is the capital, the Australian
Council of Chinese Organizations issued a statement on Sunday,
calling on the United Nations Security Council to stop NATO's
bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, dozens of Australian Serbs and members of the
Australian Greenpeace gathered at Chinese consuls general in
Sydney and Melbourne in a show of their support and sympathy to
China.
</P>
<P>
The weekend air attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by
NATO has led to three deaths and more than 20 injuries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Exports Declines Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's exports recorded six
million U.S. dollars in the first two months of this year compared
to 15.7 million dollars during the same period last year,
according to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the central bank show that
exported goods have dropped in terms of U.S. dollar by over 70
percent over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper Monday quoted Deputy Minister of Industry
and Commerce Obert Mpofu as saying that the government is
concerned over the decline in exports and the country's reliance
on exports of unprocessed goods.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been experiencing pressure on the exchange rate
and an acute shortage of foreign currency largely because of poor
performance by the export sector, the deputy minister told the
paper Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in high rates of inflation, prohibitive
lending rates and relentless price increases, which has killed
business confidence, the paper claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, Mpofu remained optimistic that the incentives which
were introduced in the national budget, implementation of
industrial policy and discussions under the National Economic
Consultative Forum would stimulate export performance.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the best will soon be realized through these
efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's export promotion agency, ZimTrade, said the
decline in the value of exports reflected the harsh economic
environment and unfavorable international commodity prices.

<HEADLINE> Buyoya Holds Talks with Nyerere on Peace (by Gu Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Burundi President
Pierre Buyoya Sunday held talks with former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere on the Burundi peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The consultation was about how to push the peace process
forward," Buyoya told reporters here shortly after the talks,
lasting three and a half hours, at Nyerere's residence in the
northern outskirts of Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mark Bomani, an aide to Nyerere who is the international
facilitator of Burundi peace process, told Xinhua earlier in the
day that the meeting has been arranged as routine talks. Bomani
said he visited Bujumbura, Burundi last March.
</P>
<P>
The complete lifting of economic embargo on Burundi is not on
the agenda of the talks between Buyoya and Nyerere, he revealed,
adding that the issue will be discussed later.
</P>
<P>
The talks came a day before a meeting of four committees on
Burundi scheduled to be held for two weeks in the Arusha town in
north Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
The committees have been established to explore the nature of
Burundi conflicts, look at the issues of democracy and good
governance including the reform of the administration, judiciary
and armed forces, deal with peace and security, and examine issues
of refugees and rehabilitation, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Bomani said it takes time for the committees, consisting of 18
feuding political groups of Burundi including parliament, to
negotiate and solve their tough issues.
</P>
<P>
The groups have started to negotiate peace since last June.
"They have made progress, and they haven't finished their work,"
he said. "So they continue meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said six refugees from Burundi in Tanzanian camps will
attend the Arusha meeting as observers but not as negotiators.
</P>
<P>
The six representatives, from both Hutus and Tutsis, have been
selected by some 300,000 Burundian refugees in the camps. The
Arusha meeting wants to allay their fears and respect their
appeals to participate in the Burundi peace process, Bomani said.
</P>
<P>
In April, Nyerere visited the camps in western Tanzania and
urged Burundian refugees to abandon antiquated tribalism and
called on the armed groups of Burundi warring parties to cast away
weapons to join the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
CNDD-FDD, one rebel group which refused to put down arms
against Buyoya, has not been invited to the meeting, Burundian
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be a preliminary preparation for the fifth
round of Burundi talks to take place in a few months. The first
four rounds of talks, under the chairmanship of Nyerere, have been
held in Arusha since last year.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who came to the country for a one-day working visit as
the guest of Nyerere, was greeted by Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa at the Dar es Salaam International Airport. His delegation
included Burundian foreign minister Severin Ntahomvukiye.
</P>
<P>
Major Buyoya, a Tutsi, took power in a military coup in July of
1997. Seven African countries, backed by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), imposed economic sanctions on the nation in
early August.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was suspended in January this year to allow warring
factions in Burundi to continue their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been riven by ethnic violence between the Hutu
majority and the Tutsi minority, which has ruled almost
continually since the country gained independence from Belgium in
1962.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, more than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have
been killed in an escalated wave of massacres and a civil war in
the tiny central African country.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Predicts Pause to NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- An influential English-language
newspaper of the United Arab Emirates on Monday predicted
NATO's bombing against Yugoslavia, now in its 47th day, is likely
to pause soon.
</P>
<P>
Khaleej Times, based in Dubai, said in an editorial that a new
intensity in the bombing campaign could be a prelude to a bombing
pause, as was the case during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has suggested that there could be a
bombing pause in the right circumstances, and NATO's blunder in
targeting the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, leading to strong
reactions in Chinese cities, has renewed calls from Russia and
China for a suspension of the air strikes, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has gone to great lengths
to say how accurately the NATO air campaign is being carried out
in statistical terms, but he failed to answer the political
questions raised by the "mistakes" of bombing Kosovo refugees,
hospital complexes, trains and buses, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Embassy bombing, which was considered a major
setback for NATO, has become something of a watershed in the air
war, said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton is "dangling the prospect of a bombing pause
in his desperate search for a way out of the Kosovo trap," the
paper said, adding that the supporting rate for the air strikes in
America is falling as well as Clinton's own popularity ratings.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that the real question will boil down to
the composition and command of the international military presence
that is supposed to be introduced into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Will it be composed of armed forces 'with NATO at its core',
as demanded by Clinton?" the paper asked.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Journalists Denounce NATO Bombing of Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian journalists Sunday
denounced NATO's bombing of Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, which
left three dead, and more than 20 others injured.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's bombing was wrong," Zamaradi Kawawa, a female
journalist with Daily Mail, told Xinhua in an interview in the
capital of Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"We are fed up with the attacks," said Bakari Mnkondo, another
journalist with Uhuru, a leading Kiswahili-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, Britain and Germany, believing that
they are supreme powers, used force at will. "This is hegemonism,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the bombing, Emmanuel Herman, a journalist with
Mtanzania newspaper, shook his head. "It's bad, bad."
</P>
<P>
"It's a provocation, a blasphemy to peace," a photographer
said, urging China to strike back. "We are on the side of China."
He also expressed sympathy with the relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
A female correspondent said, "It's really annoying."
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is not pleased hearing that the Chinese embassy was
bombed," said Emmanuel Onyango, a journalist with the African
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO attacked the Chinese embassy only because China
appeals for peace and turned against the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Press officers at the Tanzania Information Services described
the incident as "serious" and "unfortunate."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was hit by three missiles from
different directions fired by the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) jets Friday night. Among the dead were a
female journalist of Xinhua and a newly-married couple of China's
national Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Western alliance has been bombing Yugoslav territories
since March 24 in an attempt to force Belgrade to sign a peace
agreement, granting greater autonomy to the independence-seeking
ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo Province.

CHONGQING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Heaven Pit and Earth Fissure,
another tourist attraction in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze
River, was opened to public recently in Fengjie County in
southwest China's Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The pit, a karst funnel in geological term, is 622 meters in
diameter at its upper rim and 522 meters at the lower point. It is
666 meters deep, with a total volume of 11,900 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest karst funnel in the world in terms of
volume", said Zhu Xuewen, director of the Cave Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The great fissure, which is close to the pit, is 37 kilometers
long and 1 meter to 500 meters in width, with a depth of 4 meters

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Opens Wider to Overseas Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai plans to introduce one or two of the
world's top 100 insurance companies in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal government said recently this is
another step taken by the city to open its insurance market wider
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai has decided to resume its status as an insurance
center through international competition," the official added.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was an important insurance center of the Far East in
the 1930s and the 1940s, with 214 domestic and overseas-funded
insurance firms based here.
</P>
<P>
The city reopened its insurance market to overseas investors in
1992, and has since attracted eight insurers from abroad,
including Manulife Financial of Canada and Allianz of Germany, who
have set up their subsidiaries here.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of
China, the country's central bank, show that these overseas-funded
firms now make up over half of the total number of insurance
companies based in the city, with combined premiums for 1998
hitting 1.22 billion yuan, accounting for 10 percent of the city's
total.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have only a small share of the local market here
at present, we are confident of our future development," said Chen
Binggen, general manager of the Sino-Canadian Zhonghong Life
Insurance Company.

ABU DHABI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
has officially opened its embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka, paving
the way for both countries to further consolidate their bilateral

</P>
<P>
"The opening of the embassy highlights the growing bilateral
ties," Sri Lankan Ambassador to the UAE A.M. Samsudeen was quoted
Monday by Khaleej Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
With the embassy, thousands of UAE-bound Sri Lankan workers
can have their relevant documents attested in Colombo instead of
sending them to the UAE embassy in New Delhi, India as was the
case previously, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Many Sri Lankan labors work in the UAE as maids, gatekeepers,
and cleaners.
</P>
<P>
"The processing of visas for Sri Lankans to visit or do
business in the UAE will now be simplified as a result of the
embassy in Colombo," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A South African woman has
allegedly stabbed her son, 22, to death in Potchefstroom,
North-West province, because he was playing his hi-fi too loudly,
local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman apparently lost her temper on Friday

She left his bedroom and returned a few minutes later with a
bread knife, with which she stabbed him in the back. She then left
the house.
</P>
<P>
The man's two younger brothers, who were in the house at the
time of the attack, carried the victim outside and locked him in
an outside room, apparently to protect him from further attacks.
</P>
<P>
They then left the premises in an attempt to find their father
and summon emergency services to the scene.
</P>
<P>
By the time police officials arrived at the scene, the victim
had died.
</P>
<P>
The mother was arrested when she returned.

<HEADLINE> China's Advisory Body Chairman Condemns NATO's Attack on Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman Li Ruihuan of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) said here Monday that U.S.-led NATO armed
forces should be held fully responsible for its wanton missile
attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil,
Li said the crime of bombing the Chinese embassy is an open
violation of Chinese sovereignty, a serious provocation against
the Chinese people, and a wanton trample of relevant international
law.
</P>
<P>
The crime has aroused extreme indignation among the 1.2 billion
Chinese people and has been severely condemned by all the peace-
loving people across the world, said Li, stressing that the
Chinese people has never yielded to foreign aggressive forces and
will not tolerate any unscrupulous move of power politics.
</P>
<P>
It is China's consistent position to follow an independent
foreign policy of peace, to unswervingly safeguard state
sovereignty and national dignity, to uphold justice in
international affairs and to oppose hegemonism and power politics.
And the policy will not change under any circumstances, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack, which killed three people and injured more
than 20, happened at midnight last Friday, the day after Russia
and other seven members of G-8 reached an agreement on a deal to
end the Kosovo crisis including the sending of an international
force there.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the U.S.-led NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization)
to immediately stop airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Kim shared China's view that the Kosovo issue should be
resolved as early as possible by peaceful means, adding that the
missile attack of Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia should not have
happened.

ANKARA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's Supreme Election Board launched an investigation
into claims that Merve Kavakci, deputy of the pro-Islamic Virtue
Party (FP), is a United States citizen.
</P>
<P>
The board announced that her status as deputy will be abolished
if her American citizenship is proven.
</P>
<P>
On May 2, Kavakci entered the parliament hall for swearing in
ceremony and caused chaos in the parliament for wearing a
headscarf.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey reportedly will purchase medium and long range
missile systems to advance its defense capabilities and the
U.S.-made Patriots are the strong options in Turkey's purchasing
plans.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- Greek Foreign Minister Yorgo Papandreou made a call to
Turkey to cooperate with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Yeltsin Discuss NATO Attack on Phone (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang said that the U.S.-led NATO's attack on Chinese Embassy
is an utmost barbarous act, and a gross violation of Chinese
sovereignty, which is rare in the diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO should bear all the responsibilities arising
therefrom," he told Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the military attack of the U.S.-led NATO
against Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, by bypassing the United
Nations, is the demonstration of an "absolute gun-boat policy".
</P>
<P>
This is a very dangerous trend, which should arouse the
vigilance of statesmen all over the world, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that China and Russia, two permanent
members of the UN Security Council and two countries playing an
important role in the world, shoulder significant responsibility
on upholding justice and maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
At present, the halting of NATO's attack against Yugoslavia
constitutes the prerequisite of the solving of the Kosovo crisis,
he said.
</P>
<P>
With the bombing continuing, it is impossible for the UN
Security Council to discuss any plan to solve the problem, and any
plan to be made should be acceptable to Yugoslavia, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He told his Russian counterpart that the two countries have
conducted sound cooperation in major international issues
including that of Kosovo, and he suggested that the two countries
maintain close consultation and further coordination.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's condiment market is
expected to grow five-fold to 30 billion yuan (3.62 billion U.S.
dollars), according to a report in the Farmers Daily.

annually, and that is expected to lead to a 30-billion-yuan
condiment market, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts acknowledge that Chinese condiment products
are now developing in a more exquisite manner.
</P>
<P>
New varieties of condiments have been introduced catering to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Americans Protest Against NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese Americans, who
drove a long way from Philadelphia, rallied Sunday in front of the
White House to protest against NATO's brutal missile attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Embassy is part of the Chinese territory. The
brutal bombing is an aggression of China's sovereignty," said a
protester named Wang, whose whole family came to join the protest.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people will not tolerate any aggression, we would
never bow to anybody," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters gathered at the Lafayette Park near the White
House. A woman held a five-star red flag and all the protesters
raised posters or signs that read: "Justice For The Innocent!" "We
Love Peace!" and "Turn In The Murderer!"
</P>
<P>
"We come here to express our anger at the killers," said a
demonstrator named He. "The U.S. leaders always claim they
safeguard human rights, now where are the human rights of the
Chinese people? why did they kill the Chinese people? "
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese journalists were killed in the NATO air raid on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade late Friday. Over 20 others were
injured. The five-storey embassy building was hit by three NATO
precision-guided missiles from different angles.
</P>
<P>
NATO and the United States claimed that the Chinese Embassy was
targeted by mistake.
</P>
<P>
However, the Americans do not believe so. "I was born and grew
up here, I know our government, they are liars," Scafer Bailey,
who also joined the protest by the Chinese, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely not an accident, we should formally
apologize to the Chinese," Bailey said, adding, "The Americans are
committing war crimes there, it's a big shame."
</P>
<P>
"NATO=North Atlantic Terrorist Organization" reads a sign
raised by Concepcion Picciotto, who has spent 18 years at the
Lafayette Park to protest against nuclear weapons and all wars.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement on the
bombing of the Chinese Embassy, an American tour guide told Xinhua,
"Clinton said (Yugoslav leader Slobodan) Milosevic should be
responsible. No, no way. It is Clinton's fault."

<HEADLINE> Overseas Chinese in Netherlands Condemn NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Overseas Chinese in the
Netherlands Monday delivered a protest letter to the U.S.-led NATO,
condemning the military bloc's barbaric attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and holding it fully responsible for the
atrocity.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that all the Chinese in the Netherlands, one of
the NATO member countries, were shocked and angered by the tragedy
at midnight Friday when three NATO missiles hit the embassy,
killing three journalists and injuring more than 20 diplomatic
staff.
</P>
<P>
The overseas Chinese, as well as students and scholars from
China, pointed out in the letter that NATO's bombing against
Yugoslavia is a kind of wrongdoing act from the very beginning
because it violated the United Nations Charter by wantonly
trampling upon the sovereignty of the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the Chinese Embassy there, the letter said,
violated not only the U.N. Charter and relevant international law
and diplomatic norms including the Vienna Convention, but also
brutally violated China's sovereignty. They also expressed their
support for the Chinese government's stand on the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Signed by the Federation of All Chinese Communities in the
Netherlands, the letter said that Yugoslavia, a sovereign country,
should be allowed to solve their long-standing ethnic conflict by
its people themselves.
</P>
<P>
"However, the U.S.-led NATO put pressure on Yugoslavia by
wanton bombing without U.N. mandate so as to compel Yugoslavia to
give in," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment has intensified ethnic problems in this region
and created biggest civilian damage since the Second World War.
The intensified war in Yugoslavia has quickened the pace of arms
race in the world and is posing threat to world peace, the letter
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Canadian lawyers and
professors have lodged a complaint with the Hague-based
International War Crimes Tribunal, arguing NATO leaders are acting
like outlaws by bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The complaint, sent to the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise
Arbour, accuses 67 heads of state, ministers and NATO officials of
violating international humanitarian law in their six-week-old
campaign against the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright are among those named in the document.
</P>
<P>
The group of 15 lawyers and professors says NATO leaders have
committed crimes such as willful killing, wanton destruction of
cities and unnecessary devastation in their war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Citing incidents of Yugoslav civilian targets being hit by NATO
bombs and missiles, the group says the alliance has violated the
United Nations Charter and the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
"Even in a legal war you cannot kill civilians. But this is an
illegal war and the NATO leaders are acting like outlaws," Michael
Mandel, professor at Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in

The manpower export from Bangladesh stood at 267,667 people in
1998, a drop of about 32 percent from 181,077 persons in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
And till February this year, the manpower export stood at
37,381 people only, the report quoted sources at the Labor and
Manpower Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's manpower export might reach about 70,000 in 1999
if the current trend continued, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Labor export is one of Bangladesh's major foreign exchange
earners, contributing more than 1 billion U.S. dollars to its
foreign exchange reserves each year.
</P>
<P>
The country's manpower export to the Gulf countries, except
Saudi Arabia, had fallen sharply in 1998 and 1999, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia imported the manpower of 106,534 people from
Bangladesh in 1997, 158,715 people in 1998, and 26,286 people till
February in the current year.
</P>
<P>
But the labor export to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Singapore, and other countries in the Modest and the Southeast
Asia declined in 1998 and till February in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The recent economic recession in those manpower importing
countries was the main cause behind the falling import of manpower
from Bangladesh, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Vice Speaker Condemns NATO's Embassy Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian National Assembly Vice-
Chairman Blagovest Sendov said on Sunday that NATO's attacks with
most advanced weapons on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia are
totally groundless aggression against a great country.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that NATO's barbaric acts are simply incredible
and constituted a violation of China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed deep condolences to the three Chinese
journalists killed in the missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Bulgarian public figures in political and other
circles called the Chinese Embassy, the Xinhua News Agency bureau
and the "China" magazine in Sofia expressing their outrage at
NATO's brutal attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Writers Association said NATO's attacks on the
Chinese Embassy showed that the U.S. wants to launch a new
worldwide crusade.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and NATO, which have always preached humanism and
peace have now thrown away their masks and bared their true
features of the barbarians. They are as barbaric as wolves, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the missile attacks on the Chinese Embassy
could not have been accidental; the U.S. and NATO simply wanted to
test China's reaction to their "new world order" policy.

BUCHAREST, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Cao Lei, son of Shao Yunhuan, the
woman journalist of the Xinhua News Agency killed in the NATO
raids on the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, on Sunday sent a
letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, protesting against the
atrocities by the U.S.-led NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
In the letter delivered on Mother's Day to U.S. Ambassador

strongly protested against NATO's missile attacks and the killing
of three Chinese journalists, including his mother -- a 48-year-
old Xinhua correspondent working in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
He urged Clinton to listen seriously to the peace calls of the
world, to stop bombing, to stop indiscriminate killings of
innocent people and to prevent repetition of the tragedy that has
happened to him.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-headed NATO forces launched three precision missiles on
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade late Friday night, killing three
journalists, injuring more than 20 other persons and devastating
the embassy complex.
</P>
<P>
Joining Cao's protest, nine overseas Chinese organizations in
Romania issued a joint declaration in stern condemnation of NATO's

<HEADLINE> Anti-NATO Peace Demonstration Staged in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Over 10,000 Hungarians gathered in
downtown Budapest on Sunday to protest against NATO's raids
against Yugoslavia, holding high placards reading "NATO is War
Criminal; Clinton is Nazi!" and "Stop Bombing! Peace to the
Balkans!"
</P>
<P>
A senior official of Hungary's Socialist Party, who
participated in the largest anti-NATO demonstration in Hungary
since the air strikes began in late March, told Xinhua that NATO's
missile attacks on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade late Friday
grossly trampled international law and norms governing
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Kosane Kovacs, member of the National Presidium of the party,
said the war has claimed too many innocent lives and urged NATO to
stop immediately its air strikes against Yugoslavia and to seek a
peaceful end to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Another senior official of the parliamentary Committee for
Social Welfare told Xinhua that NATO's attacks against the Chinese
Embassy again revealed the U.S. wild ambition to be a world
overlord and to bring the Balkans into its sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by the Movement for Peace in
the Balkans. A spokesman for the group said NATO's acts in
Yugoslavia have seriously jeopardized the world peace and damaged
relationships between peoples of the nations in eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot believe that those who have triggered humanitarian
disasters and trampled international law are intending to protect
human rights," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Colombo Port Faces Crisis with Shipping Lines Moving Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's port of Colombo is
facing a serious crisis with big shipping lines moving out to the
Middle East, port officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said two shipping giants Sea Land and Maersk have
announced changes to their transshipment plans that will reduce
throughput at the port of Colombo by 130,000 Twenty foot
Equivalent Units (TEUs) a year.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo port handled 180,000 TEUs for Sea Land and Maersk
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The two shipping lines have shifted most of their regional
transshipment traffic to Salalah in Oman from April 30.
</P>
<P>
In a separate move, the APL-NOL alliance is reported to have
reduced its business via Colombo and is expected to transship
greater volume through the port of Aden in Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Maersk and Sea Land hold a 15 percent equity stake in the port
of Salalah and the two lines played an instrumental part in Oman's
decision to build the new port which opened for business last
December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the APL-NOL alliance will sign a deal with Aden
Container Terminal, Yemen's new Red Sea Box port which opened last
month.
</P>
<P>
The shipping lines said that one of their considerations for
shifting out of Colombo was that efficiency levels at Colombo were
low compared to other major transshipment hubs although the ports
recent initiatives to improve productivity have been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Colombo's productivity is reported to have improved 50 percent
in the last year and port management has improved its customer
relations.
</P>
<P>
However the shipping lines said that improvements had commenced
too late.
</P>
<P>
With fears that it will lose substantial volumes from APL and
NOL, as well as from Sea Land and Maersk, Colombo is unlikely to
match last year's recording-breaking throughput of 1.71 million
TEUs.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have detected a
new London-based Tamil rebel publication believed to be circulated
among former militant organizations to induce them to take up arms
again, police sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Intelligence Gathering Unit (IGU) of Colombo's Mt. Lavinia
police which made the discovery said that the eight-page paper
called "Thamil Eelam", giving a London address as its place of
publication.
</P>
<P>
The first issue written in Tamil is reported to have been
published on April 15. A copy posted from India to a former
militant cadre living in Colombo was intercepted by the police.
</P>
<P>
Claiming to be published by a hitherto unknown Tamil People's
Party (TPP), the newspaper uses what police described radical
terminology such as comrade and quotations from Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
Police believed that the TPP is a front organization of the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) who has been
fighting for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Some of the pro-LTTE publications written overseas are 'Tamil
Nation' (a weekly publication) and 'Thamilan' (Tamil) which is a
monthly publication published in Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> New Clash Hits East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- One man was killed and three
another injured when they were shot during clashes between
pro-integration forces and independence supporters in Dili,
capital of East Timor, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident, apparently sparked by a dispute over gambling,
occurred in Dili's Mercado Lama market and was the first of its
kind between the two sides since a deal on direct vote was signed
in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
"One was hacked to death while the three injured have been
permitted to leave the hospital after receiving medical
treatment," East Timor Police Chief Col. Timbul Silaen said.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation is now under control.
</P>
<P>
"Police personnel have blocked certain areas to prevent the two
disputing groups from clashing again," Silaen was quoted by
national newspapers Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between pro-independence forces and pro-integration
groups have been on the rise for several months ever since
Indonesia abruptly announced in January that it would grant the
territory independence if the population rejects its offer on
wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Dozens, possibly more than 100, have died in clashes between
the two sides this year.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement between Indonesia and Portugal
signed on May 5, the approximately 800,000 East Timorese people
are facing a direct vote scheduled for August 8 to decide their
own future.
</P>
<P>
The accord stipulated that if the East Timorese accept the
wide-ranging autonomy package, the Indonesian youngest province
would remain as such but with a wide-ranging autonomy, but if they
reject the package, the Indonesian government will release East
Timor as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations.

<HEADLINE> Italian Parties Condemn NATO's Attacks on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Communist Party Chairman
Armando Cossutta on Sunday condemned NATO's missile attacks on the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and expressed his support for the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Cossutta said in a message sent to the Chinese Embassy in Italy
that NATO's attacks on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade were a
crime all the people across the world should denounce.
</P>
<P>
"The intolerable destructive acts of the U.S. and NATO have
dealt a blow to the entire peace cause and will affect the
possibility and necessity of reaching a political agreement," he
said, voicing support to China in the name of himself and his
party.
</P>
<P>
An official of Italy's ruling Democratic Party of the Left said
on Sunday that the attacks on the Chinese Embassy were "a serious
blunder," which raised the question if there are people in NATO's
military machine who think that it is simply not right to solve
the problems through political means.

South Africa, the 1996 African champions, showed greater

Veteran striker Daniel Mudau put the visitors ahead on a

goalkeeper Aaron Lawrence.

Theodore Whitmore levelled in the 37th minute with a close-
range shot after a deflection off South African defender Papi

The second half saw nine substitutions but few chances with the
best falling to Jamaican Paul Hall, whose close-range shot was
beaten away by goalkeeper Brian Baloyi.

In a letter to the Chinese Ambassador to Russia, Wu Tao,
Luzhkov said people of Moscow and other parts of Russia are

He said the attacks -- a criminal act without any reason

He said the tragedy proved again that the military intervention
in the Balkan crisis could not solve any existing problems and
could only plunge the world into chaos and disaster.

He called for joint efforts by Russia and China to seek a way
for an early end to NATO's invasion against Yugoslavia.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A national safe production
publicity week started on May 9 stressing the "safety first"
principle in China aimed at reducing work-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
Shan Chunchang, an official with the State Economic an Trade
Commission (SETC), was quoted by today's China Daily as saying
that it is urgent to enhance people's awareness for workplace
safety.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, traffic accidents claimed more than 200 lives a day,
while mishaps in industrial and mining enterprises killed 40
people a day, according to Shan, who is the director of the SETC's
Work Safety Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months this year, the country's coal mining
sector alone reported 537 deaths in 31 accidents, a 42 percent
increase from the previous year, according to SETC statistics.
</P>
<P>
The accidents have also caused millions of yuan in economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
Organizing safe production publicity weeks is an effective
method to promote the awareness of workplace safety, Shan said.
</P>
<P>
This year's week is the ninth held across the nation.
Activities will include awareness campaigns in the media, public
quizzes and speeches.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United scored a lone goal
on Sunday to beat Middlesbrough 1-0, backing to the top spot in
the Premier League and keeping alive its hope for an unprecedented
triple.
</P>
<P>
With the win, both Manchester United and Arsenal have 75 points
with two games to play and United holds the first place for having
scored more goals.
</P>
<P>
The Premier title will not be settled until next Sunday, the
final day of the season, when Manchester United is home to
Tottenham and defending champion Arsenal is home against Aston
Villa.
</P>
<P>
The sole goal for United, trying to win the league, the English
F.A. Cup and European Champions Cup, was netted in the first half
injury time by Dwight Yorke.
</P>
<P>
Yorke appeared to be off side as Nicky Butt lobbed in a long
pass that Teddy Sheringham headed to Yorke, who scored from eight
meters on a header.
</P>
<P>
The goal might have made up for one that Sheringham scored
earlier in the half but was then ruled off side. Television
replays showed that play was on side.
</P>
<P>
Although Manchester United had the wide edge in play,
Middlesbrough, coached by former Manchester United captain Bryan
Robson, came within inches of scoring in the 27th minute when
midfielder Mark Summerbell grazed the post to Peter Schmeichel's
left.
</P>
<P>
The victory left the Reds undefeated in 29 games, their last
loss coming 3-2 against this same Middlesbrough side.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United plays at Blackburn on Wednesday and closes
the season on Sunday at home against Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal plays at Leeds on Tuesday and closes Sunday at home
with Aston Villa.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, third in the close race with 71 points and still with
a mathematical chance, was to play Monday at Aston Villa and
closes at home Sunday against Derby.

<HEADLINE> Rios Wins German Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Marcelo Rios of Chile savored his first
title of the year by beating Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina in five
thrilling sets in the final of the German Open in Munich on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Rios, 23, needed four hours and seven minutes to prevail over
the unseeded Argentine 6-7 (5-7), 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 for his
first title after he retired in the final of the Monte Carlo
tournament with a thigh injury two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Rios thus became the first South American champion in Hamburg
since Guillermo Vilas of Argentina in 1978 and it was also the
first all South American final in the history of the German Open.
</P>
<P>
Rios was twice a break up in the first set before Zabaleta
fought back to level at 5-5 and force a tiebreaker which Rios
eventually lost with a backhand into the net.
</P>
<P>
Zabaleta, 21, broke Rios' serve to make it 5-5 but had his own
serve broken in the very next game and gave up the second set
before the fourth-seeded Rios served out at love.
</P>
<P>
After trading breaks early in the third and giving up the third
set, Rios broke for the seventh time for a 3-2 lead in the fourth
and eventually won the second tiebreaker before serving out the
competition to his credit.
</P>
<P>
"Marcelo won with the experience of many good finals," Zabaleta
said, "I played a good match and it's been the greatest week of my
career."
</P>
<P>
"He is young but he is very good," Rios said of Zabaleta.
