<HEADLINE> Thailand's 1st Senate Election Ends With High Voting Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's first senate election
ended Saturday afternoon, with an unexpectedly high voting rate.
</P>
<P>
According to television reports late Saturday evening, about 60
to 70 percent of eligible voters cast their votes nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The high voting rate shows that the government's campaigns over
the past several months to encourage voters to exercise their
rights in the country's senate poll debut bore good fruit.
</P>
<P>
The election is the first one since Thailand adopted
constitutional rule 68 years ago and is widely seen as the first
test of the country's political reform under its 1997 constitution,
which seeks to foster democracy and clean up politics.
</P>
<P>
Under the new charter, senators will be elected, rather than
hand-picked by the prime minister, and will be entitled to more
substantial power than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
The new senators can dismiss unscrupulous politicians and
install mechanisms to monitor and check corruption and abuse by
the power that be.
</P>
<P>
So the competition for the 200 seats in the upper house turned
out to be quite fierce, with 1,532 candidates joining the fight.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people had crowded bus terminals and railway
stations in Bangkok since Friday to catch buses and trains to
return to their provincial hometowns to vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's present constitution, it is a duty that all
Thai citizens aged 18 and up, including those living abroad, to
exercise their rights in election. Otherwise they will be deprived
of key political rights for five years.
</P>
<P>
One of the drafters of the 1997 constitution said the
significance of the election is that it is the first time that the
Thai people exercised their constitutional rights to vote for
senators.
</P>
<P>
The election began at 8 a.m. (0100 GMT) nationwide and ended at
3 p.m. (0800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the unofficial results of the poll are
expected to be known at around midnight while the official ones
may take one or two days to come out.

<HEADLINE> Jubilo Wins Japan Super Cup in Penalty Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Jubilo Iwata won another
honor as the current Asian club champions captured the Xerox Super
Cup on Saturday by beating Nagoya Grampus Eight in a penalty
shootout at Tokyo's National Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Jubilo won the shootout 3-2 after a 1-1 draw in the regular 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Grampus, which won the Japanese FA's Emperor's Cup last season,
led 1-0 after 55 minutes when new Brazilian defender Romildo
scored from eight meter away.
</P>
<P>
Jubilo, which won a treble of their own last season with the
Asian Club Championship, Asian Super Cup and J. League title, tied
it 1-1 at the 73th minutes when Takashi Fukunishi sent home a
first-time shot on the run from the right wing.
</P>
<P>
But Jubilo goalkeeper Yushi Ozaki was the hero in the shootout,
saving shots from Nagoya's Dragan Stojkovic, Hirano and, with the
last kick of the regulation five per team, from Wagner Lopes to
end the contest.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Stresses Detente Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said here on Sunday that Iran's current foreign policy of detente
is not at all tactical, but an important strategy.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that the interests of the country, the region and
the world at large are linked with stabilization and expansion of
the detente policy, Khatami told visiting Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian nation wants to respect all nations and
countries on the basis of their interests, ethics, history and
culture, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The president added that Iran does not have any intention of
interfering in any other country's internal affairs and is for
mutual respect and recognition of the nation's status and position
as well as for helping secure the interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He termed Iran's policy of detente toward Europe as "
successful," pointing out, however, that Italian policy makers have
been more fair and realistic (than other European countries).
</P>
<P>
Referring to a recent Belgian court order against former Iranian
president Hashemi Rafsanjani, Khatami said the action was the
reaction of the enemies of the Iranian nation as well as enemies of
peace and international security, who showed their anger towards
the strength of the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian judge recently ordered police to investigate
allegations by an Iranian-born Belgian national, which said that
Rafsanjani was responsible for kidnapping, torture, harassment and
psychological violence perpetrated between April 1983 and February
1989 in Tehran and two other Iranian cities. The order has drawn
strong protests from Iran.
</P>
<P>
"For the Iranian nation, nothing is more intolerable than attack
on its historical identity as well as insult and incursion on its
national strength and security," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iran and its government would not spare any
efforts to safeguard their historical credit, strength and dignity.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations with Italy, Khatami said that Iran has
extended the hand of friendship to the European country and adheres
to the bond.
</P>
<P>
Terming the relations as good, he expressed hope that the two
countries would be able to make the world in the new millennium a
more suitable place to enable their children to live under respect,
welfare and peace.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Iran and Italy would further expand their
cooperation in the fields of small- and medium-sized industries and
the creation of more jobs during Iran's third five-year economic
development plan from 2000 to 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the ground has been paved for cooperation in the
economic, cultural and political fields and practical steps have
also been taken to this end," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister congratulated Khatami on the
successful holding of the 6th Majlis elections on February 18 and
said the world looks at the Iranian nation admirably, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Recent parliamentary elections in Iran, which resulted in a
landslide victory of reformers, highly impressed the people around
the world and the outcome should give a pleasant and good image of
Iranians at the regional and international levels, Dini said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Welcomes Forthcoming Israeli Troops Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) - Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Sunday expressed welcome to Israel's plan to withdraw its troops
from south Lebanon, saying his country will not guarantee security
for Israel's interest if there is not an agreement between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
At anytime Lebanon hails the return of its occupied territory,
Hoss said shortly after Israel's cabinet voted to withdraw its
troops from a border zone in south Lebanon by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, who is also Lebanese foreign Minister, stressed Lebanon
prefers to make a framework of an agreement with Israel, but it
will not give any pledge to Israel if the latter pulls out of its
troops unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
"We have longed for the moment for 22 years since the United
Nations Security Council resolution 425 passed on. We also hope to
renew the contact with the people on the occupied territory," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council passed the resolution, which calls for an
immediate and unconditional Israeli pullout from Lebanon, in 1978
after Israel waged a large-scale aggression to Lebanon in the name
of wiping out Palestinian guerrillas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a "security zone" in 1985 in southern Lebanon
to protect settlements along its border from attacks by anti-Israel
groups, mainly the Iran-backed Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
The surge of fightings between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas since the beginning of this year, which has left seven
Israeli soldiers dead, has somewhat catalyzed Israel's pullout
decision.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria have rejected repeated Israeli offers
to withdraw from Lebanon in return for an enhanced security
guarantee by Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which have been keeping a special
relationship, insist on a comprehensive peace settlement including
a withdrawal from Syria' Golan Heights captured by Israel during
the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Germany, S. Africa to Help Ethiopia Snuff Out Bush Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Fire fighters from Germany and
South Africa are exploring the best way to put out the bush fire
in southern Ethiopia, the Ethiopian News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ethiopian Agriculture Ministry as saying that
a South African fire fighting team had arrived in Borena and Bale
regions of Ethiopia to study mechanism to extinguish the wildfire
that had been raging for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The South African team, together with its German counterpart,
is expected to issue an official statement by Monday on the state
of the fire together with the possible means to snuff it out.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Ethiopians, including university students,
have been mobilized to extinguish the fire that has destroyed some
50,000 hectares of forest.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Lebanon Pullback by July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's cabinet voted
unanimously Sunday to withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon by
July, still preferably under an agreement with Lebanese powerbroker
Syria.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet statement said "the Israeli Defense Forces will deploy
on the border with Lebanon by July 2000 and from there will ensure
the safety of the northern towns and villages."
</P>
<P>
"The government will act to ensure that this deployment will be
carried out in the framework of an agreement," it added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has preferred to seal a peace
deal with Syria before bringing his troops home from south Lebanon,
fearing a unilateral withdrawal will expose completely north Israel
to the attacks of the Syrian- and Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the return of the Golan Heights Israel
seized in the 1967 Mideast War and regards the Lebanon issue as a
bargaining chip in negotiations with Israel, has warned the Jewish
state against withdrawing unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Barak came to power last year on a pledge to making peace with
Arab neighbors, including pulling out his troops from south Lebanon
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Barak resumed peace talks with Syria last December after a 45-
month break, which was believed to precede the restart of Lebanese-
Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiations fell apart in less than one month over
Barak's rejection to a Syrian demand for a commitment to full
withdrawal from the Golan Heights Israel seized from Syria in the
1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of the Syrian-Israeli peace talks was soon
followed by an escalation in Hezbollah attacks on Israeli
occupation troops in south Lebanon and seven Israeli soldiers were
killed in the raids within three weeks, stepping up public pressure
on Barak to immediately pull out.
</P>
<P>
Barak insisted on a July pullout, saying he needs time to try to
restart the talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television reported last Friday that a peace deal
between Israel and Syria would be finalized within four to five
weeks and would be presented to the public.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office has denied the report Saturday, but Barak
admitted Sunday that there had been indirect contacts, via U.S.,
between Israel and Syria though the open talks were in an impasse.
</P>
<P>
But a withdrawal without an agreement was also signalled in the
statement. It said "in the event that conditions will not be
conducive to Israeli Defence Forces' deployment in the framework of
an agreement, the government will convene at an appropriate time to
discuss the method of implementation of the above-mentioned
decision."

<HEADLINE> Barak Raps Palestinian Unilateral Step on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Sunday that he will reject any Palestinian unilateral measures
on statehood declaration and Israeli troops withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Barak said that the
current deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks should be
broken only through further negotiations, not through unilateral
actions or threats.
</P>
<P>
Barak also emphasized that although Israel will continue working
hard to revive both interim and final-status talks, it was not
responsible for the current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Barak's remark was responding to a Friday statement issued by
the Palestinian National Authority, which insisted that the
Palestinians will declare an independent state by September 13.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the date, which is also the deadline
for a final peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, is
final and unnegotiable.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have missed the February 13 deadline for a
framework agreement on the final status of the fate of Jerusalem,
the future of Jewish settlements, borders and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Barak has suggested a new target date for
the framework agreement, the forerunner of the permanent peace
deal, saying such an agreement is a "useful and essential" station
on the road to a final deal. The suggestion has been rejected by
the Palestinians outright.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Arafat told visiting European Commission President
Romano Prodi that Israel was responsible for the current impasse
because "Israel is not committed to implementing what has been
agreed upon in Sharm el-Sheikh," which mandates the dates for the
framework and permanent peace deals.
</P>
<P>
On the issues of the interim period, Palestinian Legislative
Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei also said over the weekend that the PNA
would take over West Bank land should Israel refuse to implement
pullback, which was due in January.
</P>
<P>
He told Palestine Radio that Israel's reluctance to withdrawal
will push the Palestinians to change these areas from partially
Palestinian-controlled Area B to fully Palestinian-ruled Area A
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Qurei's words has aroused worries that the PNA will sent
Palestinian policemen in Area B, which will certainly lead to armed
conflicts with Israel Defence Forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami also warned that the
Palestinians should understand "very well that, in an unilateral
step, Israel is stronger."
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Israeli cabinet meeting is a continuation of last
week's session on a withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the cabinet announced that ministers agreed
unanimously to withdraw Israeli soldiers from south Lebanon by
July.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-declared purpose of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has been fighting to end the Israeli occupation
there.

<HEADLINE> Italy, EU for Further Expansion of Ties With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said here Sunday that Italy and the European Union (EU)
support the recent Iranian parliamentary outcome and are for
further expansion of ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Iranian reformists' landslide victory in the
February legislative elections, Dini told a joint press conference
with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi after their first round
of talks that the EU fully supports the recent developments in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Official results showed that reformists supporting President
Mohammad Khatami won more than three-fourth of the 290 seats in the
new expanded Iranian Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Dini is the first European official to visit Iran after the
polling, the results of which are welcomed by most Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising Iran's detente policy, the Italian minister also voiced
his government's support for the reformist policies of Khatami's
administration, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"What is supported by us and the EU as a whole is the expansion
of relations with Iran," said Dini, who arrived here Saturday night
for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact of a Belgian court order involving an
accusation against former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani,
Dini said that Belgium is only one of the EU's members and whatever
goes on in that country is its own matter.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian judge has recently ordered police to investigate
allegations by an Iranian-born Belgian national, which said that
Rafsanjani was responsible for kidnapping, torture, harassment and
psychological violence between April 1983 and February 1989 in
Tehran and two other Iranian cities. The order has triggered strong
protests from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that he did not carry any message from the United
States to Iranian leaders. However, he expressed hope that Iran and
the U.S. can resume political negotiations, IRNA said. The two
countries have been in antagonism over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kharrazi said that Italy is Iran's top trading
partner among EU members.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Dini had decided to hold a joint meeting to
study the process of globalization and its dimensions to draw up
measures to reduce the negative effects of globalization on the
economic and cultural life of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi added that the visit of Dini and the upcoming visits by
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine to Iran is a token of firm relations between Iran
and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi disclosed that British Foreign Minister Robin Cook has
been invited to visit Iran in spring but the exact date for the
visit has not been set.

<HEADLINE> Bir Zeit University Crisis to be Resolved Soon: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The two-week crisis of Bir Zeit
University, whose students stoned visiting French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin, is heading for a detente, said Commander of
Palestinian Preventive Security Gebriel Ragoub on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened in the university was unintentional and
unplanned," Ragoub told Voice of Palestine radio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A number of suspended students, who were arrested under the
case, will be released after consultations with the Palestinian
Ministry of Justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jospin was slightly injured in the head on February 26 in the
incident in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The students stoned
Jospin to show their anger about the prime minister, who branded
the Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah as "terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war since 1985 when
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon to oust the
occupation troops from the country.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat denounced the stoning incident
and ordered the closure of Bir Zeit University. He also apologized
to Jospin for the incident. Palestinian police made 100 arrests
under the case, triggering continuous clashes in the West Bank in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
Up to 170 students at the university went on a hunger strike
three days ago to show their solidarity with their schoolfellows.
</P>
<P>
Students from Bethlehem University in the West Bank marched from
the university campus to Bir Zeit Sunday morning to protest against
the recent arrests. Hebron University students declared a
suspension of study on Sunday and Monday to press for the release
of the arrested students.

<HEADLINE> mee030519hke-- Iraqi Deputy PM: New U.N. Resolution Cannot Solve Iraqi Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said here Sunday the U.N. Resolution 1284 is not aimed at
solving the Iraqi issue, but at prolonging the sanctions imposed on
Iraq since 1990, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a political symposium held under the proposal of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Aziz repeated Baghdad's rejection
to the resolution adopted last December and supported by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The resolution offers Iraq the chance to have the decade-old U.
N. sanctions suspended if it cooperates fully with a new arms
inspection group and makes progress on key disarmament tasks to be
defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad regime insists it has carried out all obligations of
disarmament stipulated in related U.N. resolutions and demands an
immediate end to the sanctions imposed on it due to its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aziz described the U.N. oil-for-food program, which
allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil under U.N. supervision to
buy humanitarian goods for its people, as a temporary arrangement
that has failed to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He cited the remarks of the resigning U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator Hans Von Sponeck who said the oil-for-food deal was
inadequate and failed to meet the minimum requirements of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leadership repeatedly condemned and rejected the new
U.N. resolution recently, at a time when the new U.N. chief
inspector Hans Blix formally took office on Wednesday and U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan on Tuesday expressed the hope that
Iraq would show flexibility in dealing with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Blix was appointed in late January as the executive chairman of
the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or
UNMOVIC, which replaced the defunct U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution 1284 requests Blix to pick up the personnel for
the UNMOVIC and draw a working plan, subject it to the approval of
the U.N. Security Council within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection in Iraq has been suspended since
December, 1998 after the U.S. and Britain launched four-night air
strikes against Iraq over its alleged non-cooperation with U.N.
arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims 2,800 POWs Still Held in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Sunday Iraq is still
holding 2,800 Iranian prisoners of war (POW), despite of the Iraqi
claim that it has repatriated all Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Iranian POWs Commission Brigadier General Abdollah
Najafi told the families of POWs that among those missing in action
(MIA) that it is not clear how many are still alive.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said that since 1996, Iran have had talks with Iraq on
the issue, but Iraqi officials have always claimed they repatriated
all POWs to Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims there is no Iranian POWs in their county, but
investigation and documents available have revealed otherwise, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said the two countries exchanged lists of
POWs and MIAs after the 8th summit of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference in 1997 and the latest talks between the two
sides were held in Baghdad last July.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought a bloody war between 1980 and 1988, in
which some one million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said last August that Iran released 55,438
Iraqi POWs since 1981 on 103 occasions while Iraq freed 39,417
Iranian POWs in the same period on 70 occasions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Iraqi POWs in Iran, Najafi said Iran has
unilaterally released 10,000 Iraqi POWs, but they were unwilling to
return home and only four out of a group of 3,500 Iraqi POWs were
ready to return to their country.

<HEADLINE> UAE Buys 80 F-16 Fighters From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates Sunday
signed a contract with the U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp. for purchase
of 80 of the latest F-16 fighters worth 6.4 billion U.S dollars, a
military spokesman told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract which is pending approval of the United
States Congress, the jets, dubbed Desert Falcon, will be delivered
from the end of 2004 through 2007.
</P>
<P>
The package includes electronic warfare systems but not the
engines, the military spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that F-16 fighters, termed by some as the
most advanced fighter jets, were sold to countries outside the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War to end Iraq's short-lived occupation of
Kuwait, the UAE, which is locked in a land dispute with regional
power Iran over three Gulf islands, has decided to build up an
increasingly self-reliant defense system.
</P>
<P>
It bought 30 French Mirage 2000-9 combat planes in November
1998.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the UAE air force also has about 50 British-made Hawk
trainers.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Urges to Restore Suspended N.Irish Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said on Sunday that Northern Ireland's peace process can be put
back on track and the deadlock over disarming resolved if the
suspended executive in the province is reinstated,
</P>
<P>
"If we get them back up and running, everything is possible.Of
course, we're not going to do that unless we get some basis of
discussion on the (arms) decommissioning issue," Ahern told state
broadcaster RTE Radio.
</P>
<P>
"Without the institutions, decommissioning is going to be very
difficult if not impossible," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
On February 11, the fledging home rule executive was suspended
by Britain on the grounds the Irish Republican Army had given no
clear commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which is holding to its latest ceasefire, then pulled
out of talks with the province's independent decommissioning body.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said there was "no basis for seeing a green light" in
talks yet and played down the prospects of an imminent
breakthrough, saying he expected nothing major before the Ulster
Unionist Party conference on March 25.
</P>
<P>
His comments on the institutions followed calls for more
flexibility on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
Liz O'Donnell, Irish deputy foreign minister, was quoted on
Sunday as saying the May deadline for a guerrilla arms handover
was no longer realistic
</P>
<P>
"Things are taking longer than we anticipated and I think there
has to be some flexibility, given that the executive was only
operating for nine weeks," O'Donnell, one of the architects of the
1998 peace deal, told The Sunday Times newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Russia Exports 3 Billion U.S. Dollars of Arms in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia's arms exports in 1999 hit a
record high of over three billion U.S. dollars, Russian Trade
Minister Mikhail Fradkov told a latest expanded ministry board
session.
</P>
<P>
Arms and other military ware amounted to 40 percent of the
country's exported machinery and technologies last year, said
Fradkov.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, these volumes "are not on par with the potential
of the Russian defense industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to boost arms exports and improve
coordination between ministries and agencies to this end, adding
that the government should offer support to Russian arms exporters.
</P>
<P>
He believed that construction of projects abroad will create
great opportunities for increasing exports. Technical assistance
to China and India in building nuclear power plants alone is
estimated at four billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, last year the Russia' budget
revenues lost about 2 billion U.S. dollars due to discriminatory
measures by foreign states against Russian exports, including the
arms export.
</P>
<P>
Fradkov said that prices should be monitored and Russian trade
missions abroad should better inform Russian exporters and improve
access to foreign markets.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Expert Concerned Over Low-Level Contraceptive Usage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An Nigerian expert Sunday puts the
low-level usage of contraceptives a main reason of the unchecked
population growth in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Aken'ova, Deputy Director of the Women's Health
Organization of Nigeria (WHON), said at a workshop organized by
the country's National Population Commission in Lagos that a
recent survey shows that only 5.9 percent of female youth in the
country, aged between 15 and 19, use some forms of contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its negative impact on population growth,
low-level contraception is also blamed for poverty, pressure on
available resources and services, as well as a high HIV/AIDS
infection rate, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual economic growth rate has been fluctuating
around three percent in recent years, while its population growth
rate has hit some 2.8 percent, according to statistics published
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria government announced last October that the
country's population has surpassed 120 million, but some experts
said the actual figure is substantially more than that.
</P>
<P>
Aken'ova reminded the workshop attendants that about 80 percent
of the HIV transmission in the sub-Saharan Africa was through
unprotected sexual activity,
</P>
<P>
She said among the 5.6 percent who practise contraception, only
one percent are using condoms or other scientific methods to serve
the purpose, while other people are using traditional ways to
prevent pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The lack of legal liability for young people, both married and
unmarried, to access contraceptives, as well as the lack of
awareness in this regard, contributes to the HIV transmission and
the unchecked pregnancy, she said.

<P>
GAZA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Yassin, founder and spiritual
leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas,
Sunday denied links between Hamas and the armed clashes that took
place in the Israeli Arab town of Taibeh Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ezz-Eddin Al-Kassam Battalion, Hamas' military wing, will soon
declare its breakaway from Hamas, Yassin said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ezz-Eddin El-Kassam Battalions carried out
several attacks against Israeli targets to undermine the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process since the signing of the Oslo interim
peace accord in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Four militants, who were allegedly Hamas members, were killed in
the small hours of Thursday in Taibeh during the armed clashes with
the Israeli police while they were preparing for suicide attacks
against Israeli targets, according to Israeli security sources.
</P>
<P>
Yassin has repeatedly declared opposition to any attacks against
Israeli civilian targets.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cracks Down on Drug, Prostitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
recently intensified its crackdown on prostitution and drug-
related crimes,Vietnam News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thi Hue, head of the Anti-Social Evils Department of the
country, has disclosed that the Vietnamese government is to
considerably reduce organized prostitution, clear out prostitutes
in public places such as those near parks and lakes, close down
restaurants, bars and hotels using prostitutes and break up sex
trade rings.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve the objective, social workers involved in
this work will get intensive training. Meanwhile, drug addicts and
prostitutes will be given access to vocational training and job
opportunities after receiving rehabilitation services.
</P>
<P>
Campaigns for a healthy lifestyle among people of all walks of
life will also be boosted to raise public awareness of social
problems and mobilize them to participate in the fight.
</P>
<P>
Up to December 1999, more than 13,000 prostitutes throughout
the country had been registered, according to Vietnam's Ministry
of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry warned that prostitution has expanded to rural
areas while the trafficking of women and young girls for the sex
trade has spread at an alarming rate. Last year, 1,500 cases with
nearly 6,000 offenders involved in organized prostitution were
discovered.
</P>
<P>
More than 97,000 drug addicts, including students, have also
been registered nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese police discovered 7,625 drug-related cases and
arrested 15,710 offenders last year.

<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government Sunday
decided to set up industrial parks in the country to promote
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Bangladesh News Agency, the decision
was made at the 13th meeting of the Board of Investment (BOI) here
on Sunday with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina chairing.
</P>
<P>
The industrial parks have to be set up in such a way that
agricultural production and the environment are not affected, the
meeting said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to hold a week-long or fortnightly
commerce and investment fair in Bangladesh's missions abroad
during the month of February every year to attract foreign
investment and show the country's traditional culture and
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, the prime minister called for making
all-out efforts to attract foreign investment and speed up the
country's industrialization process. She also urged the concerned
authorities to implement the decisions taken at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
BOI Executive Chairman Mokammel Haque told the meeting that
foreign investments worth 1 billion U.S. dollars were registered
in the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Launch Counterattack in Some Liberated Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military Sunday said
that the situation in the liberated parts of the breakaway
republic of Chechnya is becoming complicated as some small rebel
groups have moved into populated areas to attack federal troops.
</P>
<P>
A battle between a Chechen rebel detachment and Russian federal
units broke out near the populated area of Komsomolskoye,southeast
of Grozny on Sunday morning, said the Russian Interior Ministry's
press center in the North Caucasus, cited by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who descended into the foothills from their
mountain positions under the cover of darkness, have failed to
break through the federal lines.
</P>
<P>
The Fighting was still raging at the battle site, where roughly
70 rebels had been kept locked up inside the federal encirclement,
the press center said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, militants launched sudden attacks at the Russian
Interior Ministry's seven checkpoints or blockhouses near Chechen
capital of Grozny and in the Nozhay- Yurt, Urus-Martan and
Naurskaya districts, but caused no casualties among federal
servicemen, the Interfax quoted the press center as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, the federal troops have established
control over a number of strategic high points in the western and
eastern districts of Chechnya, and federal aircraft and artillery
have been bombing and shelling rebel positions in mountains, said
the military.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an Itar-Tass reported said that Thursday 37 members of
a Russian special police unit from the Moscow region were killed
and other 12 injured in a rebel ambush assault in a Grozny suburb.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military said that now Chechen rebel leaders are
regrouping remnant bandits in south Chechen mountains in order to
break out of federal grip through the Argun gorge.
</P>
<P>
Russia announced in late February that nearly all Chechen
territories and population had been liberated, but there were 1,
500-3,000 gangsters remaining in the Argue valley while scattered
rebel groups haunting in the freed Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Moscow on Saturday assured that "Chechen President" Aslan
Maskhadov and top rebel field commanders Hatabb and Shamil Basayev
are still staying in the province.

<HEADLINE> Schools' Classes Suspended in Mozambique's Flooding Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- All 633 primary, secondary,
tertiary and technical schools in the southern Mozambican Province
of Gaza have suspended classes until March 20 in principle due to
the catastrophic flooding that has devastated the province since
early February.
</P>
<P>
The issue on whether classes are to be resumed on March 20 will
depend on the situation returning to normal, said Armando Ubisse,
director of the Gaza provincial education department.
</P>
<P>
If by March 20 "the flood situation has not improved we will
have to ask for an extension of the period of suspension of
classes", he was quoted as saying by the Mozambique News Agency on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ubisse noted that "even before we ordered the suspension of
classes in the whole province, at least 136 schools were not
operating".
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible for us to continue thinking that schools that
are on higher ground should continue teaching, because the
whereabouts of many of the teachers and students are unknown", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Even those students who are in boarding centres are in no
physical or emotional condition to learn, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ubisse explained that the decision to suspend classes in Gaza
had the go- ahead from provincial Governor Eugenio Numaio and
Education Minister Alcido Nguenha.
</P>
<P>
Without giving figures, he said that many students are now
suffering from malaria and diarrhoea diseases at a time when "the
province is running short of medicines".
</P>
<P>
At least 500 teachers are directly affected by the disaster,
but Ubisse noted that this figure may be far from accurate, since
the provincial directorate cannot contact all teachers working in
the areas that are seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
AIM reported that provincial government offices in Xai-Xai,
capital of Province Gaza, that used to function in the low-lying
part of the city, which is now completely flooded, have been
transferred to the "Joaquim Chissano" pre-university school, where
classes have also been suspended.

Larsson 6-3, 7-6 in the Copenhagen Open tennis tournament on

Unseeded Vinciguerra needed little more than an hour to defeat
third seed Larsson, who was rarely able to cope with his opponent'
s pace and aggression.
</P>
<P>
Vinciguerra's top-spin forehand strokes from the baseline

<HEADLINE> Horticulture Garden Renewed to Attracts Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Horticulturists in the Yunnan
horticulture garden in southwest China have transferred some 50,
000 pots of flowers from Shanghai and renewed another 400,000 of
potted flowers and 10,000 trees to attract more tourists during
the spring season.
</P>
<P>
A cold air spell hit the region in December last year, with
biggest snow in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
To help rare plants brave the snow in the horticultural garden,
the organizing committee built tents for some plants and used the
method of burning red phosphorus to fight frost.
</P>
<P>
Yan Shuping, a senior horticulturist with the garden, said that
the efforts, which cost some 800,000 yuan, have worked well to
preserve most of plants.
</P>
<P>
He said that some tropical plants sent by Guangdong and Hainan
provinces in their exhibition halls in the '99 Kunming World
Horticulture Exposition died. But, a 300-year-old cypress, the
world's oldest plant, has survived the rare cold.
</P>
<P>
The '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition is the largest of
its kind ever held in China. It has successfully promoted the
development of tourism in Yunnan. The expo alone attracted over
nine million visitors from May 1 to October 31 last year.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Poor West With New Thinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In a government work report
Premier Zhu Rongji delivered at the ongoing session of the
National People's Congress today, he listed the protection and
building of ecological environment as an important, integral part
of the government's strategy of developing the vast, economically
backward western regions.
</P>
<P>
The premier announced that the government will carry out a
program to reconvert farm fields into forest land or grassland in
China's west in a planned manner.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's statement indicates a brand-new way of thinking on the
part of the government. This indicates a firm step forward on the
road of realizing a sustainable development of the national
economy, observers say.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, economic development always went along with
catastrophic damages and pollutions to ecological environment, but
in the current government strategy to develop the western regions,
priority is being given to protecting and building the ecological
environment. Experts maintain that this new thinking is helpful
for dealing with typical local problems like desertification, the
filling up of rivers and lakes, and the Yellow River's frequent
flow stoppages.
</P>
<P>
The western region is composed of seven provinces of Shaanxi,
Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou, two ethnic autonomous
regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang, and one municipality of Chongqing.
The region covers 5.4 million sq. km., 57 percent of the country's
total, has a population of 280 million, 23 percent of the national
total, and owns half of proven natural resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
Rampant tree felling has led to severe soil erosion, with
deserts expanding at a speed of 2,400 sq. km. a year. The
deteriorating ecological environment has caused poverty and
backwardness in the western areas and is posing major threats to
social and economic development there.
</P>
<P>
According to the government strategy to develop the western
region, top priority has been given to tree- and grass-planting,
reconverting farm fields into forest land or grassland, and
protecting primitive forests.
</P>
<P>
The new government policy allows local farmers to stop
contributing grain to the state. The most important thing for the
western areas is to spare no efforts in retaining water and soil.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from this year, local governments in the western
region have made strategic adjustments to their respective
economic development plans, with ecological environmental
protection put on top of their work agendas for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Advisors Hail Government's War Against Brain Drain (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The government's latest endeavor
to combat brain drain has become one of the heatest topics during
panel discussions at the on-going sessions of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) and the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members are of the
same opinion that China is facing an even greater challenge in
this regard, as its accession into the World Trade Organization (
WTO) is eminent and the State-owned enterprise reform is
progressing and the economically backward western areas is going
to be developed.
</P>
<P>
As the globe is rolling into the era of the knowledge-best
economy, it has been crucial for China to curb the detrimental
brain drain, said Huang Qifan, a NPC deputy and director of the
municipal economic commission of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The reality, however, paints a gloomy backdrop.
</P>
<P>
One third of the graduates from Beijing University, or Beida,
one of China's top prestigious universities, have gone to study
abroad. Out of these students, some 500 remain in the United
States alone, according to Gan Zizhao, a CPPCC National Committee
member and dean of Beida's physics department.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhu Qingshi, a NPC deputy and president of the
University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), also
expressed his worries on the same issue, since very few of USTC
students studying abroad have returned to the motherland. "Who can
retain the 'trump cards' to play in the international competition?
" queried the university president.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics available show that since China launched
its reform and opening drive in the late 1970s, almost 200,000
Chinese students studying abroad have not returned home, which
accounts for two third of the total, and 80 percent of them are
promising students majored in science and engineering fields.
</P>
<P>
While hundreds of thousands of Chinese students have joined the
ever-bulging army of brain drain, a huge number of college
graduates at home have been hired by foreign firms, which have set
up factories and offices in China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, Advisors Hail Government's War Against Brain Drain (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, the older generation of Chinese scientists and
engineers have reached or approached the age of retirement,
leaving behind them an increasingly prosperous China and a wealth
of heritages with some of the most sophisticate products like
satellite and nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
To retain the younger generation of professionals to cope with
the fierce international competitions in the new century, the
Chinese government has been waging a war against the brain drain.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has mapped out a plan for
restructuring the country's system of higher learning in an all-
round way, in a bid to abandon the outmoded curricula -- a top
factor that has compelled many Chinese students to flock to
prestigious foreign schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, college graduates need a "theater stage" at home to
develop their talents to the full. So hi-tech firms in the country
could be an ideal place for Chinese college graduates, said Liu
Chuanzhi, president of the Legend Group, one of the largest
computer manufacturers in China.
</P>
<P>
His company has succeeded in attracting the young scientists
with a newly-formed employment mechanism, in contrast to the
traditional practice in which young people get less chances to get
promoted. "We encourage young people to display their talents and
creativity," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Legend Group staffers is aged 28.6 years on
average, whereas the average age of its managers only 31 years.
Some 100 Legend people are said to have been among the first
intellectual-turned millionaires in China.
</P>
<P>
So the president of the Legend Group was picked as the top
businessman in Asia by the U.S. magazine "Fortune" last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Founder Group, another hi-tech giant in Beijing's
Zhongguanchun Science Park, has turned its employees into share-
holders of the company as part of its reform. "To establish a
mechanism of 'distribution according to work' is the best way to
encourage young people," said Wang Xuan, a NPC deputy and founder
of the Founder Group.
</P>
<P>
If the ongoing economic reform can create a sound environment,
a host of local industries can be made attractive to venture-
minded young intellectuals in the country, said Song Jian, vice
chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and president of the
Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE).
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chaoyang, chief of Sohu, one of the largest networking
firms in China, has been cited by lawmakers and political advisors
here. The successful story of this student returned from overseas
has become a hero of the Internet era.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the central government decided to allocate 600
million yuan for the China Academy of Sciences (CAS) to attract
senior scientists from overseas. It is the largest-ever government
allocation for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
And the Ministry of Education distributed 1.8 billion yuan to
the two leading universities of Beida and Qinghua, with one third
of the money to be used for salaries for awarding outstanding
teachers and faculty members.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Israel, Syria Must Resume Talks Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Sunday that the talks with Syria should be renewed in two or
three months to avoid further delay in striking a peace treaty
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly cabinet meeting, Barak said all sides are
wary of the danger that if the current deadlock protracts for
several months, it will be very difficult to achieve a peace
agreement even next year or the year after.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that there are discussions through the United
States for the resumption of the talks, although he denied any
direct contacts with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who is former
Israel Defense Forces chief of staff and has attended previous
talks with Syria, said the resumption of the talks is possible in
two or three months if the U.S. extends its helping hands.
</P>
<P>
Lipkin-Shahak said he based his estimate on the fact that U.S.
President Bill Clinton is eager to achieve peace in the Middle East
before his presidency runs out in the next months.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who will step down in a year, reportedly wants to seize
the last chance to turn his farewell party into a victory
celebration and lay the carpet for the award ceremony of a Nobel
Peace Prize at his feet.
</P>
<P>
The tourism minister also hinted that there were secret contacts
between Israel and Syria, saying that he hoped the talks behind the
scenes could produce results, although he himself was unfamiliar
with the talks.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's cabinet meeting is a continuation of last week's
session on a withdrawal from Lebanon, in which Barak hinted that he
will consider making a promise to withdraw fully from the Golan
Heights to the June 4, 1967 lines under some conditions as well as
his four predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Since it is the most important precondition set by Syria for the
resumption of talks, rumors surfaced from all sides that the talks
are soon to be renewed and that secret high-level contacts have
been going on all the time.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Channel One television revealed Friday night that an
agreement would be ready within four to five weeks and it will
guarantee full Israeli control of both the Sea of Galilee and the
Jordan River's sources.
</P>
<P>
However, all the Israeli, Syrian and U.S. officials denied the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again earlier this year only after two
rounds of talks due to differences over Israeli troops withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, which was occupied by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war. 
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel's written committment to a full
withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 borders. But Israel insisted on
discussing security arrangements and the normalization of bilateral
ties first.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves Lebanon Pullback by July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's cabinet voted
unanimously
Sunday to withdraw Israeli troops from a border zone in south
Lebanon by July, but said it prefers to do so within a framework of
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Defense Forces will deploy on the border with
Lebanon by July 2000 and from there will ensure the safety of the
northern towns and villages," said a cabinet statement issued after

several hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
"The government will act to ensure that this deployment will be
carried out in the framework of an agreement," the statement said,
referring to Prime Minister Ehud Barak's efforts to revive stalled
peace talks with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed in last December after
nearly four years of break, broke down in mid-January over a
dispute on the fate of the Golan Heights, a Syrian plateau seized
by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision would end the much-heated debate among the
public as to when and how Israel should withdraw its troops from
south Lebanon, where Israel carved out a border zone in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
been leading a war of attrition to try to end the Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The surge of fire exchanges between Israeli occupation troops
and Hezbollah since the beginning of this year, which has left
seven Israeli soldiers dead, has somewhat catalyzed the pullout
decision.

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans to Introduce New Reconnaissance Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to introduce three types
of drone reconnaissance aircraft to its Self-Defense Forces (SDF)
during the next several years, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The unmanned aircraft, to be used by the SDF for the first time,
will be able to make prolonged flights and instantly send
information to ground bases, the report said, quoting Defense
Agency sources.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft's introduction would serve as a core element of an
initiative for the SDF to acquire high-tech equipment during the
agency's next midterm defense buildup plan which lasts from fiscal
2001 to fiscal 2005, said the report.
</P>
<P>
One of the unmanned planes will be a small jet-powered drone to
be developed by the Air Self-Defense Force. The drones would be
deployed under the wings of fighters and would separate from the
fighters to reconnoiter enemy forces, including ships and ground
forces.
</P>
<P>
The Ground Self-Defense Force is also mulling equipping its
field artillery units with a remote-control observation system
relying on unmanned helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Defense Agency's Technical Research and
Development Institute is also set to launch trial manufacturing of
a glider drone capable of flying at altitudes of up to 20 to 30
kilometers and able to stay in the air for several days.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Agency plans to request for funds for the
introduction of the unmanned planes in the fiscal 2001 budget.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Bid to Host 2006 World Cup to Be Under Scrutiny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A six-member FIFA technical
inspection committee will arrive in South Africa on Wednesday to
evaluate the country's preparedness to host the 2006 World Cup,
South African Press Association reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile delegation, headed by Alan Rothenberg, has
already been to Germany, England, Brazil and Morocco, the other
four bidder to host the great sport event.
</P>
<P>
The tour to South Africa is their last leg of inspection before
FIFA makes the crucial decision on which country wins the vote on
July 6-7 this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to show the whole world that South Africa and
Africa is ready to host the biggest sporting showpiece in the
world," said Chief Executive Officer of South Africa's 2006 World
Cup Bid Committee Danny Jordaan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important challenge, because for the first time
FIFA will have a first-hand look at the country's infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
Jordaan has spent most his time this week on putting funal
touches on the preparations for the tour. He even met the taxi
bosses to convince them they would also benefit if South Africa
was chosen to host the world event.
</P>
<P>
Since six days are not enough to take the FIFA team to every
city the delegation will visit Johannesburg, Pretoria, Sun City,
Cape Town and Durban.

<P>
KUNMING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
will send 200 million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) to quake-
stricken Yao'an county to help its people rebuild their homes.
</P>
<P>
Two earthquakes hit Yao'an in January, killing seven people,
injuring over 2,500 and leaving more than 90,000 farmers homeless.
</P>
<P>
The tremors also destroyed 40,000 houses and damaged another
600,000, causing direct economic losses of 1.66 billion yuan (200
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But thanks to swift relief response, all victims have been
settled and given food and medical care, local government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most schools in the county have reopened and restoration of
systems of transportation, telecommunications and electricity are
still underway, they added.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set the end of 2001 as the
deadline for completion of the rebuilding, with housing, school-
building, health facilities and water conservancy as high
priorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, a total of 1,135 schools and 524
hospitals, clinics and other health facilities were damaged by the
quakes.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Governor Li Jiating emphasized that relief funds and
donations must be strictly audited and embezzlement or misuse of
them will result in harsh punishment.
</P>
<P>

Nations disaster assessment group said they were very impressed
with China's immediate and effective relief work in the area.

<HEADLINE> "Taiwan Independence" Means War: Army Paper (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article points out that putting an end to the separation
situation across the Taiwan Straits and realizing full
reunification of the motherland at an early date concerns the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and is an irreversible
historic trend.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and Chinese government have showed
great sincerity and exerted enormous efforts to realize peaceful
reunification through the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
The article condemns "Taiwan Independence" and separatist
forces who have fabricated the "two-states statement" and
continued their attempt to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Recently the leader of the group who have always advocated "
Taiwan Independence" has used beautiful words to deceive the
Taiwan people. His recent "White Paper on Constitutional Policies"
is in fact a "declaration of Taiwan independence," the article
says.
</P>
<P>
The article warns people not to be misled by his beautiful
words.
</P>
<P>
It says that China is consistently opposed to any foreign
forces to meddle in the Taiwan issue and is against a handful of U.
S. congressmen who attempted to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan by
concocting the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act and utilizing all
kinds of pretexts.
</P>
<P>
"We hope for peaceful reunification. We know full well that
Taiwan compatriots long for peace. We don't want to see war and we
believe that Taiwan compatriots don't want to see war and don't
want to see our own flesh and blood resort to arms," the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
"We have the greatest sincerity for realizing peaceful
reunification and will try every means possible and do our utmost
to seek peaceful reunification," the article stresses.
</P>
<P>
"However, we must explicitly point out that 'Taiwan
independence' means war and separation will lead to no peace since
'Taiwan independence' and separation can only undermine China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, can only separate Taiwan
from the motherland and can only make peaceful reunification of
the motherland impossible," the article says.

Realizing the full reunification of the motherland is the

will of all the Chinese people, and is a great goal that can never
be changed. "There is no room for any compromise on this
important matter of principle which concerns the future and fate
of the Chinese nation," says the article.
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has always regarded
safeguarding the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity
and realization of the full reunification of the motherland as its
sacred mission.
</P>

by President Jiang Zemin on promoting the peaceful reunification
of the motherland and try every means possible to seek peaceful
reunification".
</P>
<P>
"However, as for the 'Taiwan independence' and separatist
forces, the People's Liberation Army's millions of troops stand in
combat readiness, are on the high alert and will never allow and
sit by idly for any attempt to split China to succeed," says the
article.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says, "we will adopt all measures to firmly
crush any attempts to divide China and will realize the complete
reunification of the motherland," if any major incident to
separate Taiwan from China under any pretexts occurs, if any
foreign country invades and occupies Taiwan and if Taiwan
authorities refuse indefinitely to solve the reunification issue
peacefully through negotiations.

If "Taiwan independence" and separatist forces dare to split

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator on Alleviation of Students' Academic Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li Peng
called on whole society to care for the issue concerning heavy
academic burdens on primary and middle school students, saying
that it is an arduous, time-consuming task to cope with.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), the top legislature, made this call later
today while addressing a panel discussion at the Beijing
delegation venue to the on-going Ninth NPC 3rd Session.
</P>
<P>
The baton of the nationwide college-entrance examination, which
draws hundreds of thousands of high school graduating students on
a yearly basis, have long exerted a negative impact on quality
education. "The society is need of various kinds of personnel, and
efforts should be made to change the outdated viewpoint pertaining
the training of personnel, so as to make sure that the very best
can be channeled into every occupation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li's view is shared by NPC deputy Zhang Gongru, who said that
education should satisfy the increased social demand and that the
society should create a healthy environment for youths to mature
and improve ethical education.
</P>
<P>
On the topic regarding China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Li Peng said the world must not be dominated
by one or a few powers. "We should seize the time and take the
initiative, but at the same time we should learn to protect
ourselves," he added.

said Zhang when discussing Premier Zhu Rongji's government work
report with PLA deputies to the Third Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC). "The PLA will not sit idly by
and watch the development of any separatist plot."
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" means war, while separatism certainly
means that peace will not prevail, Zhang said, adding that the PLA,
together with the people of the whole nation including Taiwan
compatriots, will take any necessary means to steadfastly smash
the political gamble of splitting the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said that peaceful reunification of the motherland is in the
fundamental interests of the compatriots on the both sides of the
Taiwan Straits and of the entire Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best to achieve peaceful reunification of the
motherland in the course of solving the Taiwan issue. But if there
occurs a major incident of separating Taiwan from the motherland
under any pretext, if Taiwan is invaded and occupied by a foreign
power, if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely reject peaceful
settlement of the reunification issue through negotiations, then
we will have to take all resolute measures possible to realize the
reunification cause," Zhang stressed.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Nat'l Committee Comment on Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The 2,000-plus members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), who observed the opening of the annual session
of the National People's Congress (NPC) here today, commented
favorably the Government Work Report delivered by Premier Zhu
Rongji at the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee members, who are attending their
own annual session, discussed the government report at panel
meetings and agreed that China made notable achievements in reform,
opening and modernization in the past year. They are of the
opinion that the figures given in the report are convincing and
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Shen Liechu, representing the economic circle, said the
achievements have laid a good foundation for further deepening
economic reform. The premier reported that China saw a 1,137.7
billion revenue income last year and that breakthroughs were made
in the reform of state-owned enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
The breakthroughs show that the government's three-year program
to streamline state-owned enterprises is poised to succeed, but "
we should be clear-headed about difficulties and problems on the
way," said Li Yafang, a vice-chairman of the provincial CPPCC
committee of northwestern Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The government's commitment and measures to deepen government
reform in order to curb corruption from the source has been widely
appreciated by the advisors. Gao Shangquan, chairman of the China
Society on Restructuring the Economic System, said the government
should well serve the public and create a sound environment for
economic development.
</P>
<P>
A clean government could reduce opportunities for officials to
look for leasers of government powers, and consequently, it
prevents corruption, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the discussion, participants hailed the success of three
political campaigns last year against respectively the NATO
bombarding of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Lee Teng-hui's "two-
state" statement, and the Falun Gong cult. They agreed that these
campaigns have created a sound social environment for economic
development.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Express Appreciation of Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress, China's highest law-making body, regarded a
government work report delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji today as
being pragmatic and realistic and free of trumpery and cliches.
</P>
<P>
Liang Shaotang, a deputy from south China's Guandong province,
said: "The report on government work this year not only touches on
all five issues of common concern last year,but refers directly to
prominent problems in need of urgent settlement this year and
proposes feasible solutions. The report is inspiring and enables
us to see our future direction."
</P>
<P>
Another deputy named Ye Xionggan said the report this year
presents a clearer picture of China's economic performance by
providing various indicators in that regard rather than the amount
of the Gross Domestic Product only. "This indicates that the
central government is more concerned about quality-oriented growth
rather than the size of the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from western China's Shaanxi, Gansu provinces, Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia agreed that the report on
the work of the government gives them an impression that the
government is a pragmatic one, which does not exaggerate
achievements and shun problems.
</P>
<P>
"The report indicates that the government's knowledge about
realities at the grassroots level is complete and accurate, which
enabled it to set a practical and feasible work agenda for the new
year," said Deputy Wu Dengchang.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Shanghai Xu Kuangdi said the report uses plain words
and its analysis of problems and difficulties indicates that the
government is fully confident in the nation's future.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Lu Yansun said the report focuses on ten major tasks the
State Council -- China's cabinet -- needs to deal with this year
rather than touches on everything, which indicates a pragmatic
attitude.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Officers Pessimistic Over Future South Lebanon Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Fighting in south Lebanon would
continue even if Israel unilaterally withdrew troops from the
security zone, said a senior Israeli military officer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military leaders are in the same opinion that
fighting would continue not only in the security zone in south
Lebanon, but also along the Israeli-Lebanese border after Israel's
unilateral pullout from south Lebanon, Chief of General Staff of
the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Shaul Mofaz told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
This assessment of the Israeli military leaders were made based
on the current situation in south Lebanon and on the progress being
made in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Hezbollah, an Iranian- and Syrian-
backed Islamic militant group, has been fighting against the
Israeli occupation since then.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, seven Israeli soldiers have
been killed in the security zone as the situation there worsened.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Syria does not want to take any actions to rein
in the activities of Lebanese Hezbollah and as this result the
military conflicts occur quite often inside the security zone,
Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
Before Israel strikes a peace agreement with Syria, the Syrians
will continue to use Hezbollah as a bargaining chip for forcing
Israel to make more concessions in the peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said, the IDF is well prepared for any eventuality
and ready to follow the government's decision to withdraw from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has promised to withdraw the IDF from
south Lebanon by July this year with or without a peace accord with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak called his cabinet ministers to a meeting on Sunday again
to discuss the issue concerning Israel's pullout from the security
zone, but no decision has been announced so far.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been intensified over the weekend in the security
zone and an IDF soldier was wounded Saturday night in mortar fire
on the Beaufort Castle outpost.
</P>
<P>
The IDF exchanged gunfire in the central and eastern sector of
the security zone on Sunday and the Israeli jet fighters were
called to strike against the Hezbollah targets north of the central
sector of the security zone. But there were no immediate reports of
casualties from both sides so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel will intensify its reprisals against the Lebanese targets
if Hezbollah attacked Israeli civilians once Israel pulls out its
troops from south Lebanon, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh
said in Tel Aviv last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Along the new-old line we will have to retaliate more harshly
if our civilian population is attacked," Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
The new-old border line will be the international border between
Israel and Lebanon along which Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
pledged to redeploy the Israel troops after the withdrawal from the
security zone by July.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of talks held in the United States, the
Israeli-Syrian peace track has been stalled since January, mainly
due to Barak's refusal to the Syrian demand of a written commitment
to a full withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights which Israel
occupied during the 1967 Middle East War.

An AFSED statement said the project, including the construction
of pipelines, pumping stations and distribution networks, was aimed
at securing water supply to the Omani provinces of Dank and Ibri
from Al-Masarat Basin.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-term loan carries an annual interest rate of 4.5
percent.
</P>

projects in Oman.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and the Alborz

Managing Director of Alborz Ali Fathali said that the first
crude haul was 2.1 million barrels worth 58 million U.S. dollars
with an insurance premium of 11,600 dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that hitherto foreign insurance companies charge twice
as much as their domestic counterparts, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fathali said that the agreement covers 120 million barrels of
crude based on CIF (cost, insurance and freight) which at the price
of 27 dollars per barrel will equal to a total of 3.24 billion
dollars of insurance cover.
</P>
<P>
The country's petrochemical industry is under a combined
insurance cover of three domestic companies, he added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Team Arrives for Talks in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A Taliban team arrived here on
Sunday for talks with visiting Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan
Boris Shikhmuradov on regional and bilateral issues, Afghan
sources said here.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on the Afghan civil war and a proposed
natural gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan and Pakistan via
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban team comprises the Islamic militia's Deputy Foreign
Minister Abdul Rahman Zahid and Deputy Minister of Mines Mohammad
Azam, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan is the only Central Asian republic that enjoys
good relations with the Taliban militia and it hosted the U.N.-
sponsored peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan
opposition alliance in its capital, Ashgabat, last year.
</P>
<P>
Being a member of the "Six Plus Two" group on Afghanistan,which
is made up of Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors plus the
United States and Russia, Turkmenistan has been actively involved
in promoting reconciliation in its war-ravaged neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmuradov, who arrived here for a three-day visit,Saturday
called, during talks with his Pakistani counterpart,Abdul Sattar,
for a peaceful solution to the Afghan imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
The proposed two-billion-dollar Turkmenistan-Pakistan gas
pipeline project is believed to be another major issue to be
discussed between the Turkmen minister and the Taliban delegation.
</P>
<P>
According to an ambitious plan, the 1,464-kilometer-long
pipeline will transport 20 million cubic meters of gas from
southeastern Turkmenistan to Pakistan. However, the instability in
Afghanistan has hindered the implementation of the plan.

NEW DELHI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Top administrators of Asian and
African Olympic bodies Sunday gave their final approval to the
inaugural Afro-Asian Games to be held in New Delhi from November 3
to 11 next year.
</P>
<P>

athletics, boxing, shooting, tennis, football and swimming.
</P>
<P>
The games are expected to bring together 96 national Olympic
associations -- 53 from Africa, 43 from Asia -- which make up
nearly half of the International Olympic Committee membership.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a big move towards solidarity between the two
continents and it is a matter of pride that India has taken the
initiative," Suresh Kalmadi, president of the Indian Olympic
Association, commented.
</P>

Members of the Afro-Asian Games Council, along with senior
Olympic officials from both continents, also inspected on Sunday

<TEXT>
<P>
Retooling of the state-owned enterprises (SOE) -- China's top
priority -- recorded decisive breakthroughs last year, with the
textile sector halting its loss-making performance a year ahead of
time.
</P>
<P>
However, to extend domestic demand remains the long-term
principle China has to go by in improving inadequate demand,
irrational economic structure, and alleviating employment pressure,
Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Yang, a vice-minister of the State Development
Planning Commission, predicted that a 22-month-long decline in
consumer price index would bottom out some time later this year.
</P>
<P>
And export business will once again be a major contributor to
GDP growth, as shown by the January increase of 47.8 percent, as
indicated by latest relevant statistics.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to implement the proactive fiscal policy
this year, relying on its tax revenue of more than 1 trillion yuan
last year. Premier Zhu said the central government will issue
another 100 billion yuan of long-term T-bonds to fund
infrastructure, eco-system, and technological upgrading this year
in a bid to further stimulate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Chen Dongqi, a noted expert at the Macroeconomics Research
Institute, said that the year 2000 will turn out to be a critical
year for China's economic growth as the country's GDP growth has
shown sound signs of recovery.

<HEADLINE> "Inflation" Control to "Deflation" Containment -- Experts' Appraisal on Economic Performance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March (Xinhua) -- China's economic performance has
been a heated topic of discussion among prestigious economists
attending the on-going 3rd session of the 9th on-going National
People's Congress, who share the unanimous optimism about this
year's sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
"Economic performance in the new year will go smoothly with
some signs for further improvement, and gross domestic product (
GDP) growth will be maintained at a growth range of 7 to 7.5
percent, based on the economic situation of last year," said Xiao
Zhuoji, an economist and a member of the National Committee of the
Ninth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
China reported a GDP growth rate of 7.1 percent last year,
slightly higher than targeted 7 percent. and its economic
operation maintained an upbeat momentum during the past two years
despite complex situations and difficulties involved in the
economic sector.
</P>
<P>
"Through our work and exploration over the past years, we have
accumulated a wealth of experience in curbing inflation, and
obtained basic experience in controlling deflation as well,"
Premier Zhu Rongji told the 3rd Session of the 9th NPC, which
opened today.
</P>
<P>
China's two-decade-long high-speed economic growth has ended
due to sluggish domestic market, and entered into a period of sub-
high-speed growth, said Dong Fureng, another renowned economist,
adding that among the three major economic driving motivation
forces, which is vividly compared to a "three-horse carriage",
namely investment, export and consumption, and the first two have,
beyond any doubt, contributed the most to the country's economic
growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
China continued implementing the proactive financial policy and
other relevant macro-control measures in 1999 in a bid to further
expand domestic demand. Calculations show that over the past two
years the central government issued 210 billion yuan in long-term
treasury bonds to finance more than 5,000 projects.

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China is encountering both serious
challenges and good opportunities at the turn of the century,
when the science and technology field is advancing rapidly and the
world is entering an era of a knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Li urged attaching equal importance to both basic sciences and
applicable sciences, with the latter, in particular, to be
developed in line with market needs. Research houses studying
applicable sciences should be merged into enterprises or be turned
into enterprises, so as to tap their unused resources and
capabilities, he noted.

sector. He called for studying President Jiang Zemin's recent

Territorial integrity of the motherland should be steadfastly
maintained, and we should firmly oppose separatism," he stressed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NPC First Motion Calling for Law on E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The first motion presented today
to the on-going 3rd Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) calls for enacting a law on E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The motion, signed by more than 30 other deputies, comes from
Zhang Zhongli, an NPC deputy from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhang says in the motion that with information globalization
going strong, E-commerce has been cropping up in China as a faster
and more accurate form of business transaction. But an appropriate
legal environment is urgently needed to guarantee its healthy
development, he says.
</P>
<P>
The law should take into consideration the security of E-
commerce, prevention of hacker attacks, taxation, and
telecommunications market access. It should also cover the
protection of data, intellectual property rights, trade marks and
domains, as well as the responsibility of Internet providers. The
motion also calls for the establishment of a safe and convenient
electronic payment system.
</P>
<P>
The information industry is a new economic growth area, says
the octogenarian, adding that the Internet culture is exerting an
increasing influence on economy and society and that China should
pay special attention to the sector, especially when it is making
efforts to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's Internet users amounted to 8.9
million by the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel on High Alert After Foiling Terror Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police were put on high
alert Sunday across the country in fear of major terrorist attacks
after they foiled a suicide bombing attempt by the Islamic militant
group Hamas last week.
</P>
<P>
As part of the beef-up security measures, roadblocks were set up
on major roads, and a large number of police deployed at shopping
centers, bus stations and other public places.
</P>
<P>
The measures were taken after Israeli police and soldiers killed
four Hamas members and arrested the fifth one in a shootout in the
northern Israeli town of Taibeh Thursday. Officials said the Hamas
members had been preparing for simultaneous bombing attacks in
Israeli cities, especially those in the central region.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security facilities said the incident was a signal that
Hamas intends to resume its terror campaign to torpedo Israel's
peacemaking with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon. The
Palestinian militant group has carried out a series of attacks in
Israel and killed scores of Israelis in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
The Taibeh incident was the second major setback Hamas suffered
in less than one month. Israeli General Security Service (GSS)
announced last month that it had uncovered an underground Hamas
cell which had been planning serious anti-Israeli activities.
</P>
<P>
The GSS said the latest failure of Hamas might fuel its desire
to resort to future actions in order to redeem its image in the
eyes of its own supporters.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli cabinet ministers have praised the Palestinian
National Authority for its close cooperation on security matters
although the peace talks between the two sides have been deadlocked
for one month.

<HEADLINE> Putin Does Not Rule Out Possibility of Russia's NATO Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President Vladimir
Putin on Sunday said that he does not preclude the chance of
Russia joining NATO and his country will never be in isolation
from Europe and "the civilized world."
</P>
<P>
In a Sunday morning interview with the BBC, asked whether
Russia's integration into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
can take place, Putin said "Why not?" and called the Russian
culture "part of the European civilization."
</P>
<P>
However, the West's attempts to exclude Russia from the debate
over NATO's eastward expansion have led Moscow to oppose any such
moves, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
"But this does not mean we are going to shut ourselves off from
the rest of the world. Isolationism is not an option," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is part of the European culture, and I cannot imagine
my own country in isolation from Europe and what we often call the
civilized world," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin stressed that Russia's joining the western alliance can
be possible only if the state enjoys equal status with the other
members.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we can talk about more profound integration with
NATO, but only if Russia is regarded as an equal partner," he said.

<HEADLINE> National Sports Commentators Selection Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The first round competition of
2000 National Sports Commentators Selection (Beijing Zone) was
held here Saturday and Sunday before 24 lucky birds out of more
than 500 competitors qualified for the semi-finals which will be
on stage late in March.
</P>
<P>
Being the first ever competition of this sort held in China,
the Selection have attracted more than 2,000 people all around
China, according to the joint organizers, China Central Television
(CCTV) and Coca Cola (China).
</P>
<P>
The Competition, which is to be held in six zones, including
Beijing, Wuhan, Shenyang, Hangzhou, Chengdu and Guangzhou, aims to
select excellent commentators of soccer, volleyball and table
tennis. The finals will be held in Beijing in April.
</P>
<P>
The winners or even the finalists may get job opportunities as
sports commentators in CCTV, according to Cheng Zhiming, general
secretary of the competition's organizing committee and vice
director of News Department of CCTV Sports Center.
</P>
<P>
"We lack of sports commentators especially those who are
specialized in certain kind of sport and we are trying to find the
qualifiers." Cheng told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are only seven sports commentators in CCTV, the
biggest TV station of China, and no more than 200 nationwide. As
a result, a sport commentator has to comment on 7-8 or even more
sports.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, with the amount of sports programs
arising sharply and people's interests towards them increasing
enormously, more profound and specialized comments are demanded.
</P>
<P>
"We are providing a chance to those who can meet the needs of
sports fans and make them more satisfied. We may provide
contracts to those we think suitable for the job but we do not
promise anything." Cheng added.
</P>
<P>
The competition have arisen considerable interests in college
students as well as people with various career status, among whom
are workers, teachers, doctors, office clerks and even peasants.
</P>
<P>
"I was once a student of Beijing Sports University and I am
confident my knowledge background can help me greatly in serving
as a good sports commentator." A middle school teacher named Hu
Qikun said. "I revel in sports, especially table tennis. I will
quit my job as a teacher without thought if I am lucky enough to
win and get a working opportunity in CCTV."
</P>
<P>
Another junior student majored in Mathematics came to Beijing
in train from Shandong Province for the competition. "I love to be
a soccer commentator. I will love the career with my life, even if
I can get nothing in return." He said. "But I will not accept the
job offer immediately if I get it. I'd like to be a student of
News in Qinghua University to make myself more qualified first."

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Students to Receive Education in Inland Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- It's nothing new for city kids in
China to study at high schools and colleges abroad, but for years
young people in underdeveloped regions in the west have found that
getting into an urban school in their own country wasn't so simple.
</P>
<P>
From the autumn school term this year, 1,000 high school
students in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will get the chance
to enter key senior high schools in a dozen large inland Chinese
cities every year, a local official announced at a recent press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Wang Huaiyu, vice-chairman of the region in northwest China,
said that the classes for Xinjiang students, mostly children of
ethnic minority farmers and herdsmen, will be set up in selected
senior high schools in 12 major cities, including Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang junior high school graduates must first pass an
entrance examination before they can enroll in the four-year
senior high program. They may continue on at college anywhere in
China if they pass the state college entrance test.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Finance invested 87.5 million yuan (10.5 million U.S. dollars) on
books, instruments and supplies for the special Xinjiang classes.
The Xinjiang regional government will cover part of the students'
daily living expenses.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the Chinese Government's drive to help lagging
regions better educate ethnic people who may eventually contribute
to the economic development in their hometowns, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Famous Chinese Physicist Passes Away in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese physicist Xie Xide, who
has made outstanding contributions to semi-conductor and surface
physics, passed away yesterday in Shanghai at the age of 79.
</P>
<P>
Xie, a member of the 12th and 13th Central Committees of the
Communist Party of China, was not only an outstanding female
scientist, but also active in promoting women academics. She took
part in United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Born in Quanzhou, east China's Fujian Province in 1921, Xie
graduated from the Mathematics Department of Xiamen University.
She obtained a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) in 1951 and was given a honorary doctor of
science by New York College and Smith College in the United States
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
An academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xie
devoted her career to the research of semi-conductors and solid
physics. She published more than 20 academic articles and a number
of books. Her most famous books are "Semi-Conductor Physics",
Solid Physic" and "Group Theory and Its Use in Physics".

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Emphasizes Respect for Reality, Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin called for
suiting measures to local conditions in doing all kinds of work
and protecting ecological environment when seeking economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Central Committee of the ruling
Communist Party of China (CPC), made the remarks today while
participating in panel discussions of Hainan and Qinghai deputies
to the National People's Congress (NPC), in session from today.
</P>
<P>
To develop Hainan, the country's largest special economic zone,
has been an unfulfilled wish of the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping, according to the president. He called Hainan a treasure
island and urged local people to properly utilize its natural
resources and carefully protect its ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
"Protection of the ecological environment is an important issue
that has a direct bearing on the interests of the state and people,
and on whether or not we can have sustainable economic
development and on the well-being of our offspring," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a special economic zone, Hainan should take the lead not
only in reform, opening to the outside world and economic
development but also in nurturing high ethical standards among the
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Qinghai, a province in the underdeveloped western
part of the country, Jiang urged speeding up the development of
vast, resources-rich western regions. These areas should
accelerate the building of infrastructure and give priority to
developing education and science and technology with the
assistance of the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
Again he called for protecting the ecological environment. "
Soil erosion should be stemmed by reconverting farm fields into
either forest land or grassland," he said. Programs to reconvert
farm fields into forest land or grassland need to be carried out
in a planned manner and the will of the local people must be
respected, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government's strategy to accelerate the development of
western regions has produced good opportunities to the local
people, Jiang noted. Leading officials at all levels must
emancipate their mind, update their thinking, work hard and seek
practical results, he said.

<HEADLINE> Energy Project To Translate Strategy into Reality (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The coming launch of an ambitious
natural gas pipeline project promises to translate the strategy of
developing China's west into reality.
</P>
<P>
The super-project aims to transport natural gas in the central
Asian region of Xinjiang to Shanghai. It is a key to the
successful implementation of the government's strategy of
developing the west and an important measure to narrow wealth
disparities between China's east and west, according to deputies
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), now in session here,
and members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The government is inviting foreign businesses to invest in the
project, which at a cost of 120 billion yuan is second only to the
Three Gorges Project in investment size. "The project is entirely
different from massive construction of industries for defense
purposes in the country's southwest in the 1960s," said Chen
Wanzhi, a deputy from Chongqing Municipality, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Some economists and officials proposed the idea of accelerating
the development of central and western areas in the 1980s, but the
disparity between the east and west has actually widened since
then as government polices were aimed at letting the east get rich
faster.
</P>
<P>
Out of worries about the imbalance between the east and the
west, Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of China's reform and opening-
up program, proposed that economic development in central and
western areas should be accelerated after the coastal regions have
become developed.
</P>
<P>
China's west comprises 10 provinces, autonomous regions and one
centrally-administered municipality, which have a combined area of
about 5.4 million sq. km and a population of 285 million. The
areas have abundant natural resources, but per-capita GDP there is
only half of the national average.

<HEADLINE> No GDP Growth Rates in Government Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of New China that a
government work report, released at an annual NPC session, goes
without targeted growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
In his Report on the Work of the Government, Zhu details tasks
for government work in 2000, but stops short of setting the GDP
growth target for this year. China's annual GDP growth target used
to be carried in government work reports.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the Premier intends to encourage various
departments, localities and the whole society to place emphasis on
the quality of economic growth instead of merely pursuing
quantity, according to reliable sources with the central
government.
</P>
<P>
When delivering the report, Zhu time and again underlined the
importance of "raising the overall quality of the national economy
" and "boosting economic efficiency." Meanwhile, he repudiated
problems like bureaucracy, formalism, falsification and
exaggeration which he described as "rampant."
</P>
<P>
The sources said the lack of GDP growth rates is not to negate
them, since they are, after all, important indices of the
national economy and a leading yardstick in evaluating the work of
the government.
</P>
<P>
What Premier Zhu prefers is nothing but "real stuff" that holds
water, the sources said. "People's welfare cannot be enhanced and
social wealth enriched without improvement in the quality and
efficiency of the economy," he added.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Echo Premier's Call for Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The theme of reunification was
once again highlighted at today's opening of the annual session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) as Premier Zhu Rongji
re-affirmed the official stance on the issue in his government
work report.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), and Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of
the Macao SAR, who were seated smiling side by side on the rostrum,
drew attention from those at the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Then, the flash lights of cameras and videocamera flooded onto
them while Premier Zhu was reading out the solemn statement that
resounded the magnificent hall -- "The return of Hong Kong and
Macao to the motherland marks great progress toward the
realization of the great cause of complete reunification of the
motherland."
</P>
<P>
Zhu promised that the central government will adhere to the
policy of "one country, two systems", and continue to support the
Hong Kong and Macao SAR governments.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has recovered from the aftermath of the Asian
financial crisis, which began in 1997, and it has maintained
social stability. For Macao, everything has been operating well
ever since the Macao SAR was established on December 20 of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The formula of "one country, two systems", a concept of late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, has come true in both Hong Kong and
Macao.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong and Macao has made the task of
resolving the Taiwan issue and realizing the complete
reunification of the motherland even more outstanding as a sacred
mission for the people of all ethnic groups in China," the premier
went on with his report, reiterating the resolve of the Chinese
government to accomplish the great cause of the reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tung and Ho joined nearly 3,000 NPC deputies and 2,000 CPPCC
National Committee members  throughout the hall in thunderous
applause to respond the premier's announcement, which goes, "The
Chinese people are determined and absolutely able to bring the
Taiwan question to an early settlement and realize the great cause
of reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
The exciting Zhang Kehui, aged 72, a CPPCC National Committee
member who was born in Taiwan and chairman of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, told Xinhua, "I agree with the
premier's statement on the great cause of reunification of the
motherland."
</P>
<P>
"There were two rounds of enthusiastic applause from among the
audience when he was elaborating on the Taiwan issue," Zhang noted,
"it fully shows the firm will of the Chinese people to resolve the
issue at an early date."
</P>
<P>
Many of the deputies interviewed by Xinhua are unanimous on the
view, "We are placing hopes on the Taiwan Authorities and even
more on the people of Taiwan. We are willing to continue working
together with Taiwan compatriots in developing cross-straits
relations and realizing reunification of the motherland."
</P>
<P>
General Li Laizhu, a NPC deputy and former commander of the
Beijing Military Commanding Area of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA), said, "The One-China Principle is the
premise and basis for peaceful reunification and it is our
consistent guideline as well."

<HEADLINE> Energy Project to Translate Strategy into Reality (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strategy of developing the west has been hailed as an
important policy decision for China in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The projective gas pipeline will be 4,200 km long. The project
was made public a week before the opening of the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
According to deputies to the NPC session, natural gas pipelines
are also planned in other parts of the country, and all of them
involve resources-rich western areas.
</P>
<P>
These projects are designed to form a nationwide network of
natural gas supplies based on three major natural gas producers in
the west: Sichuan, Shaanxi and Xinjiang. The network will also
cover most developed areas in the east.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of developing the west should be based on rich
resources in the west in the first place, which could increase
local fiscal income and create job opportunities there, said Xu
Peng, an NPC deputy from Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The eastern areas have also shown great interest in the program
since it would help ease their energy shortages, said Huang Qifan
from Shanghai, a receiver of Xinjiang natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that gas pipeline projects would make areas
along their routes a magnet for capital, technology and talents,
facilitating the growth of energy, steel, building materials and
automobile industries.
</P>
<P>
Launching these energy projects would also bring built
infrastructure facilities in the west into fuller play, said Chen
Wanzhi.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the western part of China has
natural gas reserves of 1.5 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Dai Mingzi, an official from the China National Petroleum
Corporation, said that natural gas has huge market potential since
it is to become a major form of clean energy in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists also warned that the launching of gas
projects is only a start for the program of narrowing the economic
disparity between the west and east, and that the western areas
should accelerate building a market economic system to brighten
their economic prospects.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Welcomes Outside Investment for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China will open more areas to domestic and foreign
investors as a way of implementing the central government's
strategy of developing the country's west.
</P>
<P>
Investment is welcome in sectors including infrastructure,
mineral resources, farming and husbandry, tourism, and projects in
eco-industry and technological development, according to chairman
of the regional government Legqog, who is here to attend the
ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet will seize opportunities created by the central
government strategy and open wider to the outside world," Legqog
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that private investors are also welcome to engage in
pollution-free development projects and contract uncultivated land
for ecological development.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the strategy of developing western areas as an
important policy decision the central government has made for the
new century, Legqog said that Tibet won't wait for financial
support from the central government but will seek investment from
a variety of channels instead.
</P>
<P>
As an open-wider step, Tibet is drafting a tourism promotion
plan to attract more tourists there, according to an NPC deputy
from Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
With support from the central government and other parts of the
nation, Tibet has registered an annual economic growth rate higher
than the national average for six consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> Kidnaped Polish Ambassador to Yemen Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 5(Xinhua) -- The kidnaped Poland's ambassador to
Yemen, Krzysztof Suprowicz, has been freed unharmed early Sunday by
tribesmen three days after being taken hostage, a diplomatic source
with the Polish embassy in Sanaa told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, in his 50s, had safely returned to the Polish
embassy in Sanaa at about 3 a.m.(local time) from Khawlan, a hilly
area 60 kilometers east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Suprowicz was kidnaped on Wednesday by members of the Beit-al-
Qairi tribe who demanded the release of a tribe member who was
arrested for "security reasons" at Sanaa International Airport upon
his arrival from Jordan some days ago.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping occurred few hours after the Polish ambassador
signed a pact on granting 15 scholarships to Yemeni post-graduates
with the Yemeni Education Ministry, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni security officials said the government did not meet any
of the kidnappers' requests in exchange for the ambassador's
release.
</P>
<P>
They said army and police units had besieged the abductors'
hideout and arrested some tribe members in Khawlan to put pressure
on the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek had expressed the hope
that Suprowicz, who was kidnapped as he dropped his daughter at a
dental clinic in Sanaa, could be freed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Suprowicz was the first ambassador who was abducted in Yemen by
tribesmen, who have in the past 10 years held hostage less senior
Saudi, French and U.S. diplomats or foreign oil firms staff.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings of foreigners are rampant in Yemen, an Arab country
on the tip of the Arabian peninsula. Tribesmen abduct foreigners to
press the government for development projects in their area or the
release of detained tribe members.
</P>
<P>
Since early 1990s, Yemen has registered more than 200 abduction
cases against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The hostages are usually freed unharmed, but in December 1998
four Westerners held by an Islamic group were killed when the
security forces stormed the hostage takers' hideout to rescue 16
kidnaped Western tourists.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, which is endeavoring to attract foreign investments and
boost its tourism industry, has introduced death penalty on
kidnappers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Sunday reiterated his country's commitment to a
time-bound and comprehensive global disarmament but asserted that
this would be guided by "strategic autonomy and the need to
maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent."
</P>
<P>
Dedicating the second unit of the Kaiga Atomic Power Station to
the nation in Kaiga, southwest India's Karnataka, he said, "Till
all weapons of mass destruction are dismantled, we continue to be
guided by the imperative of India's strategic autonomy and the
need to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent."
</P>
<P>
His statement assumes significance in the light of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to India later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said India's self-reliance in the nuclear sector shall
not be hindered. "Despite sanctions being imposed on us, the
capacity factors of our nuclear power plants have gone up."
</P>
<P>
He also announced that his government is committed to
increasing funding for research and development from 1 percent of
the gross domestic product to 2 percent in five years to encourage
a career in science among youth.

<HEADLINE> Official: Investors' Confidence in Philippines Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The confidence of the foreign
business community in the Philippines remains strong as shown by
the long-term investments that they are bringing into the country
this year, an official said over the weekend..
</P>
<P>
In a radio-TV program here, Trade Secretary Manuel Roxas said
Avon, a leading manufacturer of beauty and health care products
distributed worldwide, has just established its regional
headquarters in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said the Development Bank of Singapore brought in 700
million U.S. dollars into the country's banking system while
multinational Colgate-Palmolive set up a new extension office here.
</P>
<P>
He also said a leading food retailer based in France, the
Casino Group, would also bring in 100 million dollars while top
American retail chain Wal-Mart is now scouting for an investment
site in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"If we believe in ourselves, we can help the government more.
This does not pertain to the media only, but also to our basic
attitude(toward confidence in the economy)," Roxas said.
</P>
<P>
Roxas was trying to dismiss media reports that foreign
investors have lost confidence in the Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
He added that Philippine exports this year are expected to
reach 40 billion dollars, with the electronics sector continuing
to lead the way.
</P>
<P>
Roxas stressed that business fundamentals are improving as
evidenced by the fact that inflation remains at single-digit
levels while prices of basic goods continue to be stable.
</P>
<P>
These positive developments, he said, would stimulate economic
growth and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the Philippine stock market index has fallen
to around 1,700 points, the lowest in 15 months, and the peso, the
country's currency,depreciated to about 41 to the dollar, a five-
month low.

<HEADLINE> 607 Filipino Workers Die Abroad Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Six hundred and seven overseas
Filipino workers (OFWs) died abroad last year and 19 percent of
them lost their lives under mysterious circumstances, Senator
Loren Legarda disclosed here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At least 607 OFWs, including 141 women, died last year, and 113
of them, or 19 percent were classified as "with no report on cause
of death," the senator told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the Department of Foreign Affairs' Office
of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers, Legarda said the bulk
of the OFWs, or 351 of them, suffered health-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
Of those who died due to poor health, she said, 39 percent, or
136 people, succumbed to heart conditions.
</P>
<P>
The senator also said 16 OFWs were murdered and 14 others
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 690 OFWs died abroad and in 1997, 567 OFW deaths were
reported.
</P>
<P>
Legarda said the increasing number of OFWs dying of heart
ailments"merely confirms the tremendous emotional strain that our
workers have to endure while working away from their families."
</P>
<P>
As for those OFWs with no reports of cause of death, the
senator said, "The DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and our
labor attaches should thoroughly investigate their cases."
</P>
<P>
"Both the DFA and the Department of Labor and Employment should
strengthen their monitoring and investigation of OFW deaths to
detect possible cases of foul play or victims of abuse," she added.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, there are about 4.5 million
Filipinos working abroad and they earn the country about 7 billion
U.S. dollars a year. Because of their contributions to the economy,
the government has described them as "modern heroes."

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Process to Have New Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Four Burundi peace process
committees agreed at their 10-day session in Tanzania's north town
of Arusha Saturday to form a fifth committee on guarantee and
implementation of an anticipated peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also have to oversee the return of thousands
of refugees from neighboring states, cessation of hostilities, the
 demobilization of some elements of the armed forces and
installation of transitional institutions, Tanzania media reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The committee will be chaired by the Burundi peace talks
mediator, former South African president Nelson Mandela. It will
be composed of heads of various parties at the peace talks aimed
at ending the six-year civil war in the tiny central African state
and chairpersons of the other four committees.
</P>
<P>
The four committees are dealing with conflict (committee I),
democracy and good governance (committee II), peace and security
for all (committee III) and economic reconstruction and the return
of refugees (committee IV).
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who was named as mediator last December to succeed the
late former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, has made it a
priority to bring the rebels into the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said in a statement that he may not continue
his role as mediator for the Burundi peace process as the Arusha
talks have ended without any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Burundian Hutu rebels and the Tutsi-dominated
army has killed more than 200,000 people and uprooted more than
1.2 million since 1993.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Kristian Ghedina beat
Austrian great Hermann Maier in a men's World Cup super-G in
Kvitfjell, Norway, on Sunday, ending the Austrian team's three-
year domination of the discipline.
</P>
<P>
But Maier claimed the super-G title and also broke the record
for the number of points amassed by a male skier in a single World
Cup season.
</P>
<P>
Ghedina's was the first super-G win by a non-Austrian skier
since France's Luc Alphand won at the German resort of Garmisch in
February 1997, ending a run of 21 victories by the Austrians in
the World Cup, Olympics and world championships.
</P>
<P>
The Italian launched himself down the Kvitfjell course after
Maier, who had seemed sure of securing his fourth super-G win in
six races, and clocked a time of one minute 28.56 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Maier was second in 1:28.94 but the 80 points he secured took
his total overall tally so far to 1,760, well ahead of the
previous best of 1,699 set by Switzerland's Paul Accola in the
1991-92 season.
</P>
<P>
Maier also has an unassailable total of 440 points in the super-
G standings with one race remaining. Austrian Andreas Schifferer
was third on Sunday in 1:29.52.

<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Claudia Pechstein and Anni
Friesinger finished 1-2 in the women's 1,500 meters at the World
Speed Skating Championships in Nagano, Japan, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pechstein, winner of the 3,000m Friday, and Friesinger had a
close race throughout, skating side-by-side until Pechstein
emerged from the final turn with a slight lead and steadily pulled
away down the straightway.
</P>
<P>
It was Pechstein's second gold and fifth overall collected by
the women skaters from Germany in the championships at the 10,000-
capacity M-Wave, a Nagano Olympic arena two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Among a total of nine medals for Germany, the women athletes
won all but the team's only bronze, which went to Frank Dittrich
in the last event of the championships, the men's 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the 10,000m, the Dutch, who have been dominant in the
distance races, showed their strength with a 1-2 sweep by Gianni
Romme and Bob de Jong.
</P>
<P>
Romme, winner of Friday's 5,000m, made it look easier as he
clacked away from de Jong, skating in the last pair with him, from
the beginning and finished in a time of 13 minutes, 12.27 seconds,
more than eight minutes ahead of his compatriot.
</P>
<P>
The two had the same 1-2 finish in the 3,000m.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Framework Talks to Resume Soon: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The final-status framework talks
between the Israelis and Palestinians are expected to resume soon,
the Ha'aretz daily revealed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are close to agree on a formula to enable the
resumption of the talks, the daily quoted top political sources in
Jerusalem as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report follows Friday night's statement issued by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which said that the September
13 deadline for a final peace deal with Israel is final and non-
negotiable.
</P>
<P>
The statement after the authority's weekly cabinet meeting said
that the Palestinian highest legislative body, the Palestinian
Central Council, had decided that it will declare an independent
state by then.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Office
responded Saturday that a unilateral action to declare statehood
will not contribute anything to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The officials also worried about another "unilateral measure",
threatened by Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei
(Abu Ala), regarding the third and last phase of Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Qurei said over the weekend that the PNA would take over West
Bank land should Israel refuse to implement the 6.1 percent
pullback, which was due in January, and the third further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
He told Palestine Radio that Israeli reluctance to withdrawal
will push the Palestinians to change these areas from B to A
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Area B is under Israeli security control and Palestinian civil
rule, while Area A is under full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Qurei also reiterated that the PNA, which has controled 40
percent of the territories already, should receive over 90 percent
of the land before the end of the interim period.
</P>
<P>
His remarks made some analysts worry that if the PNA sent
Palestinian policemen in Area B, as Qurei plans, it would surely
lead to armed conflicts with Israel soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami also warned that
the Palestinians should understand "very well that, in an
unilateral step, Israel is stronger."
</P>
<P>
U.S Middle East Special Coordinator Dennis Ross reportedly will
return to Israel later in the week to push forward the talks, his
second attempt in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The permanent-status negotiations between the two sides, which
opened on September 13, 1999, will try to resolve some thorny
issues such as the status of Jerusalem, borders, the future of the
Jewish settlements on occupied land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
and the return of Palestinian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum signed last September,
Israel and the Palestinians should reach a framework agreement on
final-status talks by February 13 this year and a final accord by
September 13.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks have fallen into a stalemate after breakdown
of a summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last month at the Erez checkpoint
on the Gaza-Israeli border, which had made the two sides miss the
February 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
After that, Barak reportedly wants to set a new target date to
conclude the framework agreement, saying such an agreement is a "
useful and essential" station on the road to a final deal. The
suggestion had been rejected by the Palestinians outright.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Greek, Bulgarian FMs to Hold Tripartite Talks on Balkan Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Bulgaria,
Greece and Turkey are due to meet in Plovdiv, southern Bulgaria, on
Sunday to discuss Balkan stability amid mounting tensions in
Kosovo, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers, Nadezhda Mikhailova of Bulgaria,
George Papandreou of Greece and Ismail Cem of Turkey, will hold
their talks first in Plovdiv, then move to Edirne in western Turkey
and Orestiada in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Such a rotating arrangement for the venue is viewed as a symbol
of the close ties among the three Balkan neighbors, politically and
geographically, said the semi-official news agency.
</P>
<P>
The three countries are expected to sign a cooperation agreement
to reaffirm the principles of good neighborliness and respect for
the territorial integrity among Balkan nations.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss the latest developments in Kosovo and
its implications on the entire Balkan region during the day-long
meeting. They will also consult on infrastructure construction in
the region and ways to coordinate it among regional states.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be the fourth encounter between Papandreou and
Cem since the beginning of this year, which is termed as a signal
of further warming of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warming political climate among the three countries,
both Turkey and Greece expressed deep concerns over the Balkan
instability.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Constantinos Simitis on Thursday warned
that the Balkan nations faced a continued danger of conflicts and
he renewed calls for easing the international sanctions on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"For some time, Southeast Europe will remain troubled," he said
at a press conference in Athens, adding that the danger of
conflicts is ever present in these countries with "the resurgence
of nationalism and local disputes."

BELGRADE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An ethnic Albanian boy, who was

Tuesday, has been arrested by the Kosovo peacekeepers, the Tanjug
news agency reported Sunday.

peacekeepers, the news agency said the killer, who shot the
Russian soldier to death in the central town of Srbica on February
29, was only 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
Three Russian solders have been killed and 10 others have been
wounded in Kosovo since the Russian peace keeping troops were

De Jong finished with the silver medal in 13:21.74, while Frank
Dittrich of Germany set a new national record of 13:27.93 for

It was a repeat for the 27-year-old world champion, who set
former world records to win the 5,000m and 10,000m gold medals at
the Nagano Olympics two years ago, and also the second gold medal
for Romme, who beat de Jong into second to win the 5,000m on

World champion Claudia Pechstein completed a clean sweep for
Germany in the women's events by winning the 1,500m in 1:58.43 to

Taibei at the age of 95.
</P>
<P>
In his message of condolence to Wu's relatives, Jiang expressed

<P>
Wu devoted his life to scientific research and education, made
great contributions to the development of science in China, and

<P>
Wu concerned himself about the reunification of the country,
dedicated himself to making the nation prosperous and strong, and
had made outstanding contributions to the scientific and
technological exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, winning high
praise from the compatriots from both sides of the straits, Jiang
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Education Minister Hussein Kamel Bahauddin and
Minister of Insurance and Social Affairs Amina el-Guindi will
attend the first national conference on non-governmental
organizations' role in implementing educational development
programs.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. investigators said late on Friday they will renew the
search for wreckage of EgyptAir Flight 990, which crashed into the
Atlantic off the U.S. northeast coast last October, thus prolonging
the controversial probe further. The resumption of the search
operations for the second engine of the ill-fated Boeing 767 nulls
the suicide theory, said EgyptAir Pilots' Association Board Chief
Waleed Murad.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- A team from the Supreme Council of Antiquities discovered a
brewery at Borg AL-Arab in Alexandria dating back to the late Roman
era. The brewery consists of a room in which grapes were squeezed
and a cube-shaped basin for collecting the grape juice.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will fly to Washington
on March 18 to prepare for a five-day visit to the U.S. by
President Hosni Mubarak which will start on March 24. Mubarak is
expected to hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, senior
administration officials and Congress leaders.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Traffic jams are expected in many parts of Israel on Sunday
as a result of beefed-up security on the roads and at entrances to
cities -- particularly in the central region -- due to a nationwide
terror alert.
</P>
<P>
Random checkpoints are expected to be set up in the coming days
across the country, especially in the Sharon and Dan districts, and
the public is urged to immediately report any unusual or suspicious
activities and to cooperate with the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The measures follow Thursday's thwarting in Taibeh of
potentially devastating attacks by Hamas suicide bombers. Four of
the terrorists were killed and another was arrested after he turned
himself in.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Supporters of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are
furious over the idea raised by Likud Knesset (Parliament) members
Reuven Rivlin and Meir Sheetrit to move forward by one year the
primary for party chairman.
</P>
<P>
The two potential candidates for the post made the proposal over
the weekend, arguing that the elections for a new prime minister
were likely to take place before schedule, and that the Likud
therefore needed to get organized and choose a permanent head.
Acting Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon is not ruling out the idea.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his wife Sara are reportedly to be indicted on
charges of removal of public property and misuse of public funds.
As long as the matter is unresolved, Netanyahu would find it
difficult to re-enter the political arena.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli, Syrian and U.S. officials Saturday all dismissed
Israeli Channel One television's report about an imminent Israeli-
Syrian agreement.
</P>
<P>
They rejected the report's estimate that Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak is moving to present an agreement with Syria for public,
government and Knesset approval within three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
The report also claimed that the agreement will be based on a
border located between the international and the June 4, 1967 lines
and will guarantee full Israeli control of both the Sea of Galilee
and the Jordan River's sources.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- An Israel Defense Forces soldier was wounded Saturday night
in a mortar attack on the Beaufort Castle outpost in the Israeli-
occupied security zone in south Lebanon. No further details were
provided about his condition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli cabinet is to meet Sunday to resume the
debate on a withdrawal from Lebanon, which is a continuation of
last week's cabinet meeting. At the end of Sunday's session the
cabinet is expected to come up with a preliminary bill calling for
a redeployment to the international border by July.
</P>
<P>
The American and French co-chairmen of the Grapes of Wrath
monitoring group of south Lebanon are also expected to meet with
senior government officials in Jerusalem Sunday in an effort to
reconvene the five-nation committee.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Kano State Adopts Islamic Law Sharia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Kano State Governor Rabiu
Kwankwaso has signed a bill for the implementation of Sharia, the
Islamic legal system, into law in his state in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Baita, commissioner of the state for Information, Youth,
Sports and Culture, made the announcement on Saturday after the
conclusion of a state Executive Council meeting in the state's
capital Kano, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Kano Council of Islamic scholars last
December, takes cognizance of the constitutional provision, which
guarantees the right of all citizens under the new law, Baita
said.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner explained that the law had nothing to do with
non- Muslims and advised them not to entertain any fear.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made against the background of recent clashes
between Christians and Moslems in Nigeria's northern State Kaduna,
and southern states of Abia and Imo, which had left hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
To stop the rampant violence, governors of the west African
nation's 36 states decided in an emergency meeting in Abuja on
Tuesday to suspend Sharia's implementation.
</P>
<P>
But some northern states' governors quickly acted back on their
 decisions at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Executive Council of Nigeria's
northern State of Jigawa Saturday also restated its determination
to introduce Sharia.
</P>
<P>
The governor's special adviser on political affairs, Alhaji
Chaichai, said the council accepted to adopt Sharia as demanded by
the people of the state, 98 per cent of whom, were Muslims.
</P>
<P>
"There is no going back in the adoption of Sharia in the
state," Chaichai stressed in the state's capital Dutse.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the governors of the three northern
states of Zamfara which took the lead to adopt Sharia in January,
Kebbi and Sokoto had met on Wednesday and agreed to go ahead with
implementing Sharia.
</P>
<P>
The Niger State, however, on Wednesday withdrew all the bills
on Sharia recently passed by the state's legislature following the
decision of Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Council of states.
</P>
<P>
"If suspending Sharia is the sacrifice some of us have to make
to sustain the nation's unity, I abide by it," said Niger State
Governor Abdulkadir Kure on Friday, who announced last month that
his state would follow Zamfara's suit to adopt Sharia early May.

MOSCOW -- Russia on Saturday officially put Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov on the federal wanted list, charging him with
stirring up and participating in armed mutiny.
</P>
<P>
A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Maskhadov, the
supreme commander of rebel forces, and formal charges were brought
against him in a trial by default, said Yury Biryukov, chief of
the North Caucasus directorate of the Russian Prosecutor-General
Office.
</P>
<P>
Biryukov said investigation reveals that "since May 1998, with

of well-known terrorist Shamil Basayev."

<HEADLINE> Kidnaped Polish Ambassador to Yemen Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 5(Xinhua) -- The kidnaped Poland's ambassador to
Yemen, Krzysztof Suprowicz, has been freed unharmed early Sunday by
tribesmen three days after being taken hostage, a Polish embassy
official here confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, in his 50s, had safely returned to the Polish
embassy in Sanaa at about 3 a.m. Sunday from Khawlan, a hilly area
60 kilometers east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Suprowicz was kidnaped on Wednesday by members of the Beit-al-
Qairi tribe who demanded the release of a jailed tribe member.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni security officials said the government did not meet any
of the kidnappers' requests in exchange for the ambassador's
release.
</P>
<P>
They said army and police units had besieged the abductors'
hideout and arrested some tribe members in Khawlan to put pressure
on the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek had expressed the hope
that Suprowicz, who was kidnapped as he dropped his daughter at a
dental clinic in Sanaa, could be freed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Suprowicz was the first ambassador who was abducted in Yemen by
tribesmen, who have in the past 10 years held hostage less senior
Saudi, French and U.S. diplomats or foreign oil firms staff.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings of foreigners are rampant in Yemen, an Arab country
on the tip of the Arabian peninsula. Tribesmen abduct foreigners to
press the government for development projects in their area or the
release of detained tribe members.
</P>
<P>
The hostages are usually freed unharmed, but in December 1998
four Westerners held by an Islamic group were killed when the
security forces attacked the hostage takers' hideout.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, which is endeavoring to attract foreign investments and
boost its tourism industry, has introduced death penalty on
kidnappers.

LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Nigerian newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and former South
African President Nelson Mandela Saturday spoke highly of the
virtues of late politician, Shehu Musa Yar'adua, who died while
fighting for democracy, freedom and justice of the oppressed in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Punch:
</P>
<P>
-- Fear has gripped some member countries of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), following speculations
that the violent disturbances arising from the introduction of the
Islamic Sharia law in some Nigerian states may escalate and create
refugee problems for them.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu has expressed his support
for the suspension of Sharia by the National Council of States,
saying this is the only basis for continued unity, peace and

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sets Date for Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Presidential elections in Uganda
are to be held between February 11 and March 12 next year, a
leading daily newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision quoted Political Commissar of the ruling
National Resistance Movement (NRM) James Wapakhabulo as saying
that President Yoweri Museveni was likely to be NRM's candidate
for the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 Constitution, the presidential elections should
be held during the first 30 days of the last 90 days before the
expiration of the term of the president.
</P>
<P>
Museveni's term expires on March 12, 2001, Wapakhabulo said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the Constitution intends to leave the last 60
days of the president's term free to prepare for hand-over and to
clear any matters like petitions arising out of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections would more likely have to be held earlier in
February than later in case of a run off (a second round of polls
in case no candidate gets a clear majority) which also has to be
disposed before the March 12 deadline, he added.
</P>
<P>
The general feeling in the ruling NRM leadership is to field
Museveni again, he said.
</P>
<P>
All political parties and interest groups are focusing their
attention on the impending general elections in Uganda. It is
widely believed that the referendum on the political system slated
for this June is viewed as a pre-general election test of their
popularity.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni was elected president of the country in
1996 and the Constitution stipulates that a president can at most
serve two terms.

Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>

of ill health Saturday when he hinted that he may have to give up
his continuing political role, including recent mediation efforts
in the Burundi peace process.
</P>
<P>
City Press:
</P>
<P>
-- The diplomatic wrangle between South Africa, Britain and the
United States, which threatened to delay urgent rescue missions,
has been averted as the world finally woke up to the humanitarian
disaster in southern Africa. South Africa Saturday allowed
British and U.S. task forces to use its air base to launch rescue
and relief efforts for Mozambican flood victims.

<HEADLINE> African Church Leaders, World Bank Officials to Discuss Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Top church leaders from Africa
will meet with the World Bank officials in Kenya this week to
examine ways of addressing the poverty crisis in the continent,
newspapers here reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 delegates to the five-day meeting will discuss
cooperation between the church and the World bank in influencing
policy formulation which would ensure good governance and in
channelling of resources to the poor.
</P>
<P>
David Gitari, head of the Anglican Church in Kenya, said
Saturday that poverty alleviation has eluded planners in Africa
for the last three decades. The poor have become poorer with
statistics indicating that more people are trapped in a cycle of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite millions of dollars being spent in the
continent to fight poverty and propel development, the situation
has worsened.
</P>
<P>
However, Gitari was optimistic that the conference would find a
solution because the church had an effective network reaching the
poor at the grassroots.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Reduce Crop Production due to Effects of Cyclone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's total crop production
for this year is expected to reduce by not less than 30 percent
because of the long and short-term effects of the Cyclone Eline,
The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Farmers Union noted heavy losses of soil nutrients
in areas affected by the cyclone, particularly in eastern and
southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Soil experts at the University of Zimbabwe said unless an
active program to restore the nutrients and rehabilitate eroded
landscapes is undertaken, recovery would take more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Office here said Cyclone Eline is the worst
to have affected Zimbabwe since they started compiling their
records.
</P>
<P>
It passed through the Eastern Highlands and was in Zimbabwe for
two days, from February 22 to 23 after which it died out into a
depression. Its effects, through strong winds and heavy
rainfall, however continued for days after the cyclone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the government said Saturday about 500,000
people were affected by the floods with roughly 250,000 believed
to be in need of urgent assistance. Some 20,000 people were
actually displaced by the floods.

<HEADLINE> More Freedom on Land for Ethiopian Farmers: Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A signed article in the
English weekly Capital appealed to the Ethiopian government Sunday
to offer more land freedom to farmers in a bid to increase
self-sufficiency of food in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
How farmers use land is greatly affected by the degree of
security of land tenure, including duration of user rights,
clarity of land right, ability to sell the lands or to pass them
on to succeeding generations, the article reads.
</P>
<P>
"A farmer with unclear, insecure or short-term tenure is more
likely ... to seek maximum short-run production gains through bad
crop rotation practices, thus degrading the biological and
physical qualities of soil," it says.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 50 to 60 percent of the Ethiopian population is
food insecure or lives below poverty line. Official statistics
shows that there are some eight million famine victims in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The article cites as the major challenge for the government
today to pursue the economic policies that will ultimately enable
every household to produce or purchase sufficient food.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture authorities should encourage private investors
and the existing small farmers by providing credit facilities,
irrigation development, project designation and training, the
article says.

<HEADLINE> Entry into WTO Poses Historic Opportunity to China: NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's accession into the world
trade body is a strategic choice the government has to face in the
wake of economic globalization, and this will pose a historic
opportunity for the country's reform and opening-up, according to
deputies attending the on-going 3rd Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will bring
China an ever-improved external environment to the best advantage
of its reform and opening-up objectives and to serve its national
interests, said Pi Qiansheng, a NPC deputy from the city of
Tianjin adjacent to Beijing during a panel discussion here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"As a country with increasing openness, China should not give
up the right to participate in formulating 'game rules'," Pi said,
adding that it is the country's duty and obligation to have its
own interests as well as interests of other developing countries
reflected in the WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
China should take the initiative to involve itself in economic
globalization, beef up its industrial restructuring and increase
its people's market competitiveness, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Entering into the WTO, China will open wider still to the
outside world, abide by internationally accepted regulations, and
benefit from open markets of other countries, said Prof. Yu
Yongning at the Beijing Science and Technology University.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mao Daru, president of the Agricultural University
of China, said he is looking forward to the bright prospect and
chances to be endowed to China's agriculture after the entry into
the WTO. "Accession will possibly affect agricultural production
in some areas. On the whole, however, he added, it will offer the
country's agricultural sector better opportunities, as proven by
WTO member nations like India, Indonesia and other developing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies from the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR),
too, care for to the motherland's entry. Prof. Ieong Wan Chong of
the University of Macao cited China's expected entry into the WTO
as a milestone on its way to economic globalization, which will be
of help to China and fill it with an increased growth impetus in
the new century.

<HEADLINE> Some White Farmers Give in On Land Issue in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Some white farmers of Zimbabwe are
now willingly negotiating and handing over some of their farms to
former freedom fighters who have invaded white farms countrywide
over the past few weeks to push for the equitable redistribution
of land, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Chenjerai Hunzvi, Chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation
War Veterans Association, said Saturday his association had
received reports that some white farmers were handing over some of
their farms to the war veterans.
</P>
<P>
"We are starting to see the fruits of the invasions as some
whites are willingly calling us for negotiations before handing us
some of their farms, " Hunzvi said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the spirit that we want from the white farmers and we
are very delighted because of this development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said two white farmers along the Harare-Mvurwi
road had so far given the war veterans three farms.
</P>
<P>
He said some white farmers had informed the war veterans that
they were prepared to hand over their farms without receiving any
compensation.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "There still some resistance but we will continue
with the fight until the land is back to its rightful owners. We
support the stance taken by President Robert Mugabe and there is
no turning back."
</P>
<P>
The ex-combatants vowed that they would continue with the farm
invasions despite an ultimatum given by Minister of Home Affairs
Dumiso Dabengwa Thursday to retreat from the farms by Friday or
face unspecified consequences.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe Thursday said the government would not stop the war
veterans as they were demonstrating peacefully for equitable
redistribution of land.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, at least 30 white-owned commercial farms have
been invaded by the former freedom fighters.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Cannot Double Sugar Exports to EU: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania cannot double its
sugar exports to the European Union (EU) because the EU market has
a surplus of the product from the African, Caribbean and Pacific
(ACP) countries, the Sunday Observer newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
EU has sugar surplus amounting to 1.4 million tons from ACP
countries annually, EU Head of Delegation to Tanzania, Peter Beck
Christiansen, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania could only increase its sugar exports to EU if other
ACP suppliers fail to meet their annual export quotas, said
Christiansen.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1975 Lome IV Convention Sugar Protocol,
Tanzania has an annual export quota of 10,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Tanzanian Sugar Development Corporation (SUDECO)
and Swedish Ministry of Agriculture want it to be relaxed, so that
an extra 10, 000 tons of sugar could be exported to Stockholm
every year.
</P>
<P>
The corporation estimated that Tanzania will export over 16,000
tons of sugar to the EU market this year, which could earn the
country over 6.25 million U.S. dollars in revenue, because
Mauritius failed to meet its quota.
</P>
<P>
Christiansen pointed out that although Tanzania's sugar exports
to EU earns the east African country about three times what the
same amount earns at world market prices, it's irresponsible to
increase the quota to Europe while Tanzanian local producers are
yet to satisfy domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU official, Tanzania is currently importing
over 100, 000 tons of sugar, because local producers have not
satisfied the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's annual sugar consumption is put at between 350,000
and 400, 000 tons while local producers are able to satisfy only
about half the demand.

CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt sacked its soccer coach
Frenchman Gerard Gili on Sunday as its soccer squad was dethroned
at the African Nations Cup last month.
</P>
<P>
"The union is no longer assured of his ability to lead the team
in the light of his frustration (over the loss) and the breach of
conditions in his contract," said Harb al-Dahshuri, president of
the Egyptian Football Union.
</P>
<P>
Egypt lost to Tunisia 0-1 in the quarterfinal of the tournament,
and Gili left for France immediately and failed to return on time
to train Egypt's Olympic team.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Returns Green to People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hulun Buir League of north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will make efforts for
ecological protection, and the local government plans to rebuild
balance between ecological environment and economic growth, said
officials.
</P>
<P>
The league, located in the region's northeast, abounds in great
tourism resources with the nation's three percent of grassland, 10
percent of forests, and thousands of lakes, and various species of
animals.
</P>
<P>
Tourists just could not walk away from the Hulun Buir Plain for
its white snow in the seven-month long snowfall period, for unique
folk customs and cultural atmosphere in the league.
</P>
<P>
And a mysterious land with a vast area of green, 36 ethnic
groups including Mongolian, Daur, Xibe, Oroqen and Ewenki, is
really some attraction that no one can resist.
</P>
<P>
Besides, riding on horses, watching wrestling, dancing around
the campfire, listening to the lovely songs of birds, and looking
at them hovering around, will bring the tourists into a fairyland.
</P>
<P>
The league plans to invest 2.1 billion yuan to protect ecology,
set up another six nature reserves, increasing the total area to
145,000 sq km, or over 15 percent of the league.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that altogether 240,000 travelers came to the
league in 1999, generating revenues of 46.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, excessive lumbering for farming had for a time brought
harm to the ecological environment in some areas there. More than
a decade of consecutive farming cultivation led to over 333,000
hectares of farmland increase, but the forest areas decreased by
over one million hectares. Degeneration of pastures had also
affected the livestock raising in certain areas as well, said
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The league's program for protecting ecology is expected to help
bring about a marked improvement in ecological conditions in the
area in five years, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Parliament Session: Blueprinting a More Splendid China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Third Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top law-making body,
which opened here this morning, is to be remembered as the last
grand gathering of the nation's parliament for the 20th century
that will usher China smoothly into the new century.
</P>
<P>
Although it is an annual event for the legislature, the session
has drawn legions of domestic and overseas reporters. Equipped
with notebooks, recorders and cameras, reporters in the hope of an
on-the-spot interview before the opening of the session packed the
flights of steps that lead to the Great Hall of People, the venue
for the annual gathering of deputies to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Key issues for the session include state enterprise reform,
development of China's western areas, China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the Taiwan question, anti-
corruption and development of rural China.
</P>
<P>
The Internet has made the session an even more widely-known
event this year compared with the past, and some websites have
even set aside a special page for the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the clear weather and blue sky, NPC deputies
hailed this year's session as "one of the warmest and freshest NPC
sessions in history". However, only two years ago, heavy pollution
in Beijing received the most criticism from NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the session, a crowd of local residents
gathered on Tiananmen Square, watching from a distance NPC
deputies walk into the Hall.
</P>
<P>
Xu Rong is a laid-off worker from a state-owned enterprise. "
The NPC session is going to discuss the reform of state
enterprises," he told Xinhua. "It will have a direct bearing on my
personal interests."
</P>
<P>
Compared with their past narrow focus on the health of a top
Chinese leader, the media today are paying attention to far more
areas of interest.

Leading officials from local governments, for instance, became
a common target of the media. While the central government
policies have a direct bearing on local economies, strategic
restructuring in these regions in turn affects the decision-making
of the central government.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Huang Ju
said, Shanghai has put on an entirely new look and registered
unprecedentedly fast growth during the past 20 years. With the
implementation of the strategy of developing western areas and
China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Shanghai
is bound to create a new glorious chapter in its economic
development program in years ahead.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiulin, an entrepreneur from northeast China's Jilin
province, has high hopes for a full-scale upturn in profitability
of state enterprises in the new century, citing a significant
breakthrough last year in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Attracting more attention from reporters are deputies from
ethnic minorities, whose colorful traditional costumes made them
stand out among a sea of deputies wearing Western-style suits. The
regions they hail from are expected to benefit the most from the
central government's strategy of accelerating development of
western regions.
</P>
<P>
A deputy from west China's Gansu Province was surrounded by
more than 20 domestic and overseas reporters including those from
foreign media such as Reuters and AP. "I will propose to the NPC
session that environment protection should be strengthened in the
western regions." he said.

It is the first time that a Macao delegation has attended a
session of China's supreme legislative body. "Changes in interior
areas will help Macao become more prosperous," said Tong Seng Chiu,
head of the delegation. "We have a great sense of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
Maria Tam Wai-chu, an NPC deputy from Hong Kong, said, "We
firmly support policies of the central authorities."
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the opening of the NPC session, some of the
deputies were still engaged in heated discussions. Topics they are
going to talk about during the session include quality-oriented
education, security of the Internet, transgenetic technology and
how to make the film industry prosperous.
</P>
<P>
The information pavilion inside the Hall was surrounded by
people. A staff member said there were far more people than
terminals, though more of them have been added.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Oscar Ameyedowo, ambassador of Ghana, said the session is
important for the future of China. Norman Bottorff, a reporter
from the Associated Press Television News, said the anti-graft
campaign, China's reunification, and the development of the
western regions are crucial themes that will have a profound
effect on the future development and stability of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, the NPC held its first session. Establishment of the
people's congress system has been regarded as one of the most
important changes in the history of China.
</P>
<P>
"After hearing the premier 's government work report and
reading proposals by deputies, I believe China will become more
colorful and splendid in future," said Zhang Deze, a local
reporter from Chongqing City, southwest China.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Push for Further Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will push
for further economic reforms aimed at enhancing global
competitiveness of domestic industries and improving the economy
as a whole, a senior official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said
that the government remains steadfast in its resolve to "provide
every Filipino food on his table, a roof over his head and the
chance to make his life the fullest it can be."
</P>
<P>
Reyes is combating criticisms over the past few months that
President Joseph Estrada does not have a clear program of
government.
</P>
<P>
The government's major policy thrusts in the medium term are
fiscal consolidation, financial and banking reforms, enhancing
global competitiveness of domestic industries, rural development,
housing and social services, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Reyes, major legislations awaiting congressional
approval include the Omnibus Power Sector Reform, the Retail Trade
Liberalization Law ad the Rationalization of Fiscal Incentives.
</P>
<P>
Reyes stressed that there is a need to reposition and to focus
the country's energies in becoming globally competitive.
</P>
<P>
At the very least, he said, the country needs to assess its
competitiveness in specific industries or product lines in the
markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We must get out of labor-intensive, low-wage industries and
seek our competitive advantage based on our skilled manpower doing
quality work and innovation," Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
He said that administrative reforms will involve streamlining
of operations in government service, office automation,
simplification of rules and procedures and greater transparency.

official visit to Cambodia at the invitation of his Cambodian
counterpart Hor Namhong.
</P>
<P>
This is Nguyen Dy Nien's first official trip to Cambodia after
taking office last month.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Nguyen Dy Nien held a wide range of talks
with Hor Namhong, senior minister, minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation of Cambodia. The two sides agreed to
make efforts to complete their border demarcation at the end of
2000 and to sign a border agreement within the year.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also discussed an idea on the opening
up of a developing area along the common borders of Vietnam,
Thailand, Laos and Cambodia, in order to enhance the economic
development of the area. It was said the plan has got the support
of other ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting here Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Nguyen
Dy Nien expressed their hope to comprehensively implement all the
cooperation agreements signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nguyen Dy Nien also paid courtesy calls on Acting
Head of State and the Senate President Chea Sim and National
Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at further strengthening the traditional
friendship between the two countries and the cooperation on border
trade, agriculture, electricity, telecommunication and

<HEADLINE> Mandela Discloses Possibility of Quitting as Burundi Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela said that he may not continue his role as
mediator for the Burundi peace process as the 15-day talks in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha have ended without any
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"It could be that, sooner or later, circumstances beyond my
control prevent me from continuing my work in general, and
particularly as mediator for Burundi," Mandela said in a statement
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On February 21, Mandela opened the latest talks aimed at
bringing peace to Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Mandela had been optimistic that the
negotiation would lead to a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
However, the hope of the talks was undermined by the absence of
the Force for the Defense of Democracy and National Liberation
Forces, the two Hutu rebel groups most active in the six-year-old
civil war.
</P>
<P>
International observers to the talks said the latest session
has failed to move peace efforts forward dramatically.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Tutsi-led government and Hutu rebels since
1993 has reportedly claimed about 200,000 lives.

<P>
According to a report of the Reserve Bank of India Sunday, the
0.29 percentage fall in the annual rate of inflation to 2.08
percent from 2.37 percent in the previous week was mainly on
account of the effect of a sharp rise in the corresponding week of
last year.

The country's inflation rate was higher at 5.70 percent during
the corresponding week in 1999.
</P>
<P>
After rising to a 32-week high of 3.31 percent for the week on
January 22, 2000, the inflation rate has been steadily falling due
to decline in prices of various primary articles.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Vies Against Davenport in Scottsdale Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis won her
semifinal match by straight sets on Saturday for a final clash
against Lindsay Davenport in the final of the 535,000 U.S. dollars
State Farm Women's Tennis Classic in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
The top seed Swiss outpowered fourth seed Frenchwoman Mary
Pierce 6-4, 6-3 after second seed American Davenport defeated
sixth-seeded Russian Anna Kournikova 6-2, 6-2 in the earlier
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
However, Hingis who placed first in the WTA rankings, was in
the odds against Davenport for a career record of 7-10 as the
Swiss lost her last four meetings, all by straight sets, including
the Australian Open Championship in January.
</P>
<P>
"I can only go out and try to beat her. I know I did it before,
so I have nothing to lose. I'm number one and she's two. She wants
to be number one and I want to stay there," said Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Hingis won the opening set by breaking Pierce for the third
time in the final game at love, and held a 4-3 advantage after the
two traded early service breaks in the second set.
</P>
<P>
She recorded the key service break in the next game for 5-3
after the French star muscled a forehand over the baseline.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's NPA Calls for Unified Position on Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's National Peace
Alliance (NPA) has called on the People's Alliance (PA) and the
United National Party (UNP) to move for a unified common position
that could be the basis for negotiations with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a news release by the NPA available
here Sunday said.
</P>
<P>
The NPA, the country's most powerful peace lobby, backed the
current government and main opposition UNP to work out a plan that
could help end decades of ethnic violence in the country, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems between the
Sinhalese and Tamils - the two major ethnic groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a war against the government for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the island since
1983, in which some 60,000 have been reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has invited UNP leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe for a meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NPA stressed the need for a PA-UNP consensus on "preceding
the negotiating process with the representatives of the Tamil
people and the LTTE in particular."
</P>
<P>
It also proposes that the negotiations with the leadership of
the Tamil political parties "should be carried out jointly by
representatives of the PA government and the UNP."

<HEADLINE> Food Aid to Bangladesh Dips to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Food aid to Bangladesh dipped to a
new low with the European Commission's new food security strategy
taking a final shape, The Daily Star reported here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Food Ministry projected a food aid volume of only 500,000
metric tons in the upcoming 2000-2001 fiscal, the lowest in 20
years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's projected food aid volume in the current fiscal (
1999-2000) was 992,000 metric tons, and the volume was 1.233
million metric tons in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission used to contribute almost one-fourth of
the total food aid volume to Bangladesh annually, and its decision
to introduce the 2000-2002 food security cycle with less food and
more cash results in the decrease of food aid flow to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Food Ministry still prefers the donors to channel aid in
development projects in terms of food instead of cash, the report
said, adding that it might take more time than anticipated to make
the government accept the new food security strategy of the
European Commission.

<HEADLINE> Son of Former Bangladeshi President Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Saad Ershad, the only son of former
president and chairmen of the Jatiya party Hussein Muhammad Ershad,
was arrested from his residence in the capital Saturday on charge
of abducting a 14-year old school girl, The New Nation newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He was produced before a special court and was placed on two-
day police remand. The 17-year old son of the former president who
was ousted in 1990 during a mass movement by the opposition, will
be indicted under the recently passed tough Women and Children
Repression Act and if found guilty, he may have to suffer a 14-
year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The girl, a student of Bangladesh International Tutorial, was
reportedly taken by Saad Ershad in a car from a market to his
father's home and confined there for 27 hours. She was dropped
Friday in another marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The girl gave a statement before a magistrate, in which she
narrated how she was kidnapped and tortured by Saad.
</P>
<P>
However, Jatiya Party sources said it was a mere love story and
any illicit affair between them is impossible.

<HEADLINE> State to Loosen Hold on Gold: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's gold market will be
deregulated within two years, according to a senior gold industry
official.
</P>
<P>
Deregulation is a set strategy, but a schedule for implementing
a gold exchange awaits confirmation by the central government,
reported China Daily's Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dexue, director-general of the Gold Administration under
the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), told the Business
Weekly that gold market deregulation will stimulate the gold
sector in China.
</P>
<P>
Operation of the Huatong silver exchange in Shanghai, which
Wang called a success, is expected to speed up the establishment
of the gold exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government invested only 100 million yuan (about 12 million
U.S. dollars) in the sector last year, compared with nearly 2
billion yuan per year from 1988 to 1993, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies have been allowed to invest in the sector in
line with interim provisions guiding foreign investment issued by
the SETC, the State Development and Planning Commission (SDPC),
and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. But
exclusively foreign-funded gold mines are still banned.

<HEADLINE> Chief Banker on Mexico's Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 4 (Xinhua) -- New chairman of Mexican
Bankers' Association Hector Domene said Saturday that Mexico will
become the financial center of Latin America if it fulfills its
imminent tasks and achieves a 6 percent annual growth in the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
When assuming his post after the closing of the 63rd Banking
Convention, Domene said Mexico faces three important challenges:
respect and enforcement of the rule of law, sustaining economic
stability, and improving the banking system.
</P>
<P>
He said with an average 6 percent economic growth and an
inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent, Mexico's GDP will reach 7,000 U.
S. dollars per capita in 2006, a considerable increase over the
present 4,700 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loans granted by banks will be 35 percent of the GDP,
instead of the present 23 percent, and the banking system will
have 35 million accounts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Domene stressed the banking system will be made up of well
capitalized banks, probably with a lesser number of national
entities, to comply with the global trend.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the approval of the financial laws stagnating in
the Mexican Congress on the guarantee of credits and bankruptcies,
and the creation of courts to solve litigation in this sector.

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- General aviation should be given a
larger role in the development of the country's western areas,
said General Manger Zhang Yanzhong of the China Aviation Industry
Corporation II.
</P>
<P>
Relatively backward transportation facilities in western areas
have hindered economic development in the west, he said. And the
area's mountainous terrain makes it difficult to develop surface
transportation.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Business Weekly of the China Daily, Zhang
said that using aviation would protect the western environment,
and the development of telecommunications, power networks, and
natural resources in the areas will require the use of general
aviation, helicopters in particular.
</P>
<P>
China has less than 400 civil aircraft which fly about 40,000
hours a year, compared with 200,000 hours a year in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The country should allocate a certain amount of money to set up
a fund for purchasing domestically made aircraft to develop the
western areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies such as exemptions from airport
construction fees and aviation construction fees should be
considered to support the use of civil aircraft in western areas.

<HEADLINE> China Making Preparations for Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said that no
time should be lost in adjusting to the new situation created by
the accelerated process of China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and that various preparations should be made
for the accession.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the call in his government work report delivered at
the Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Following a "win-win" agreement in November 1999 between China
and the United States on the former's entry into the WTO, China
has begun negotiating with many other WTO members and sealed
agreements. Currently, the country is still holding negotiations
with a few WTO member states.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the process of China's entry into the WTO is an
important policy decision for speeding up the development of a
socialist market economy and opening itself wider still to the
outside world. The accession will bring along both opportunities
and challenges.
</P>
<P>
China has been preparing itself for the entry in two major
aspects. On the one hand, it is publicizing WTO rules and related
knowledge so that ordinary Chinese will acquaint themselves on the
WTO and get to know how to embrace opportunities and meet
challenges once accepted.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the central government is reviewing and will
revise existing laws, regulations and policies that obviously
contradict with the WTO rules, in a bid to lawfully guarantee the
implementation of the WTO regulations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhu Rongji called on all trades and professions and
all enterprises to increase their competitiveness and ability to
cope with risks by accelerating reform, improving management and
upgrading technology. Meanwhile, great efforts will be made to
revise and further improve the relevant laws and regulations and
train various types of specialized personnel.

<HEADLINE> China Not to Tolerate Separatist Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji today said, "
We will not sit idle by and watch any serious separatist activity
aimed at undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
such as those advocating the "two-state theory" or "the
independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
At the opening meeting of the Third Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress NPC), the premier said that the return
of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland marks major progress
toward the realization of the great cause of complete
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said, "We will continue to adhere to the principle of 'one
country, two systems', support the governments of the Hong Kong
and Macao special administrative regions in their efforts to
govern in accordance with the law, and maintain the prosperity and
stability of these two regions."
</P>
<P>
The recovery of Hong Kong and Macao has made the task of
resolving the Taiwan question and realizing the complete
reunification of the motherland even more outstanding as a sacred
mission for the people of all ethnic groups in China, including
our compatriots in Taiwan and overseas Chinese, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We will, as always, keep to the basic principles of
"peaceful reunification", "one country, two systems" and the eight-
point proposal put forward by President Jiang Zemin, and continue
to work hard to develop cross-straits relations and promote the
peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zhu reiterates that the One-China Principle is the foundation
and prerequisite for peaceful reunification, noting that " on the
basis of this principle, we are willing to conduct cross-straits
dialogue and negotiations on any matter."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to promote the exchange of visits of people
in both directions and various cross-straits contacts, vigorously
promote cross-straits economic and trade relations and
conscientiously protect the legitimate rights and interests of
Taiwan compatriots, including their legal rights and interests
related to investment and business operation on the mainland," he
said.
</P>
<P>
" We place our hopes on the Taiwan authorities and even more on
the people of Taiwan. We are willing to continue working with the
vast numbers of our Taiwan compatriots in developing cross-straits
relations and achieving peaceful reunification of the motherland,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
 The premier said the Chinese people are determined and
absolutely capable to bring the Taiwan question to an early
settlement and realize the great cause of reunification of the
motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the disciplinary department of the Communist Party
of China and the central government, 132,447 Party and government
officials were given disciplinary penalties last year, of which 4,
092 were at the county level, 327 at prefectural level and 17 at
ministerial or provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Among these officials are Xu Yunhong, former Party secretary of
the city of Ningbo in Zhejiang Province, who misused official
power for personal gains; Hu Changqing, former vice-governor of
Jiangxi Province, who asking for and accepting bribes; and Jin
Deqin, former vice-president of the China International Trust and
Investment Corporation, who peculated a large number of public
funds and other officials involved in smuggling and frauds.
</P>
<P>
"In the present changing circumstances," Zhu said, "we should
continue to carry forward our fine tradition of building the
country and handling all affairs through diligence and frugality."
</P>
<P>
"We must resolutely put an end to the extravagance, waste and
squandering seen in some areas, departments and institutions.
Cases of misuse of public funds and institutional spending in
violation of relevant regulations must be strictly investigated
into and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Government officials travel, entertain and dine in a luxurious
style at public expenses in the name of all sorts of invented
activities such as "festival" celebrations, ribbon-cutting
ceremonies and standards inspections. This wastes money and
manpower and arouses the indignation of the people. Such practices
must be resolutely stopped, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the reform of government institutions, he
said, departments under the State Council should consolidate the
outcome of institutional reform. Local governments should
intensify their institutional reform in compliance with the
arrangements and requirements of the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
"We should streamline our administration and establish a highly-
efficient, well-coordinated and standardized administrative system
and operating mechanism through reform, and carry out official
duties in accordance with the law," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The premier said, "We should continue to improve and exercise a
civil service system and enhance the political integrity and
professional competence of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels must conscientiously subject
themselves to the supervision of the people's congresses at the
corresponding levels and their standing committees, take the
initiative to strengthen contacts with the committees of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels,
and earnestly listen to the views of the democratic parties,
federations of industry and commerce, prominent persons without
party affiliation and mass organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should make government affairs public, encourage people to
exercise supervision over the work of the government and its
functionaries in accordance with the law, and bring the
supervisory role of public opinion into full play," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Major Tasks for Development of Western Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- Efforts should be made to open China wider still to the
outside world, improve the investment environment and do all
possible to attract foreign funds and import foreign technology
and managerial expertise.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji said that the large-scale development of the central
and western regions of the country is a major policy decision made
by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee for the
new century in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's strategy for the
country's modernization drive, which encompasses the development
of both the coastal areas and the interior.
</P>
<P>
"This is crucial to the efforts to boost domestic demand,
promote sustained national economic growth and bring about
coordinated development of regional economies for eventual common
prosperity as well as to strengthen national unity, safeguard
social stability and consolidate border defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier asked the eastern region to continue to take
advantage of its strong points to constantly improve the
performance of local economy and its competitiveness so as to
facilitate its own development, and areas where conditions permit
should take the lead in modernizing.
</P>
<P>
The eastern region should increase support to the central and
western areas in various ways, such as joint development,
cooperation for mutual benefit and providing coordinated
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Implementing this great policy decision is a long-term and
systematic project. "We need not only a sense of urgency, but also
a comprehensive plan focusing on key areas. We must carry out the
plan step by step," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 provinces, autonomous regions and municipality in
west China, including Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Tibet,
with a total area of some 5.4 million square kilometers and a
population of 285 million. The average gross domestic product (GDP)
in the resources-rich but underdeveloped region is only half that
of the eastern region.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Deng Xiaoping, China's reform architect,
urged the central and western parts of China to assist the
coastal areas, while the eastern areas will make more efforts to
help the central and western China at a certain stage.

<HEADLINE> China's SOEs' Reform and Three-year Objective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The year 2000 is the last year in
which the central government vowed to bring its ailing state-owned
enterprises (SOE) out of difficulty, and statistics show that the
objective can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium-sized SOEs did well last year, with net
profits rising 77.7 percent and losses dropping 15.9 percent. All
but the defense and coal mining industries have ended money-losing
performance, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1997, the then Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji first put
forward the objective during an inspection tour of northeastern
Liaoning Province, the country's major industrial base. And in the
same year, Party General Secretary and President Jiang Zemin
reaffirmed that the majority of SOEs should adopt the modern
enterprise system by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, newly-elected Premier Zhu Rongji repeated his
promise, saying that the top 500 of China's 79,000 industrial SOEs
accounted for 85 percent of the country's total tax revenues and
profits, but he added that only 10 percent of the 500 top were in
the red.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the central government introduced
debt-to-equity swaps into 73 SOEs last year, relieving more than
111.3 billion yuan of SOEs' debt burdens. Meanwhile, the
government set aside more than 70 billion yuan to offset SOEs' non-
performing loans, resulting in over 800 SOEs going bankrupt and
being merged.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector, for example, cut more than nine million
cotton spindles in the past two years, and reached the objective a
year ahead of schedule.

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, university and college enrollment rose by 47.4
percent over the previous year, the biggest increase in years. He
said that enrollment in institutions of higher learning should be
increased, and the practical problems of student dormitories,
cafeterias and teaching facilities should be resolved by gradually
making such services independent in their operation. Personal
loans to finance education should be vigorously promoted.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the management system for education, he said
that except for the Ministry of Education and a small number of
special departments, departments under the State Council will no
longer directly manage schools in an effort to form a new system
under which schools are run by governments at both the central and
provincial levels, with most schools managed by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Effective policy measures should be taken to encourage and
attract students studying overseas and outstanding personnel
residing abroad to come home to work in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "We should continue to follow a path of
sustainable development. We should further strengthen family
planning, striving to stabilize the low birth rate and promote
good prenatal and postnatal care, and devoting strong efforts to
the management of family planning and related services in rural
areas and among the floating population."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, efforts to bring urban environmental pollution under
control should be intensified, focusing on projects to prevent and
control environmental pollution in major cities, valleys, regions
and coastal areas and striving to achieve the goals set for
environmental protection and pollution control. Urban and rural
areas should be properly planned.
</P>
<P>
The management of natural resources should be strengthened, and
efforts should be made to protect and make rational use of land,
forest, grassland, mineral, marine and water resources in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Work in public health and sports should be further improved
with close attention paid to disease prevention and control,
strengthening urban community health services and rural primary
health care, and raising the overall physical fitness level of the
public, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Gradual Changes Expected in Asia Telecoms  By Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Asia's telecom market has entered a
new era with deregulations and mergers, but the pace of changes
will be gradual as Asian economies are still at the different
stages of development.
</P>
<P>
For decades, it has been believed in Asia that
telecommunication companies are strategic assets that should be
protected and not be owned even partly by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
But with the development of new technologies such as wireless
communications and the Internet, Asian governments have been
forced to undertake reforms in the telecom sector to improve
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"Historically, nations have tended to want to own and control
their principal telecommunications companies. But with new
technology and the ability to provide alternative access, notions
of ownership and regulations are starting to crumble," said James
Wilkinson, deputy chief executive officer of Hansol PCS of South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, market deregulations and mergers
have swept across the region. In 1999, Asia's telecommunication
sector saw some 14 billion U.S. dollars worth of take-overs,
according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
However, the pace of changes has picked up this year, as Asian
economies have to speed up the process of deregulations and
mergers to meet new challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Singapore government announced that it would
immediately scrap a rule restricting foreign ownership of
telecommunications businesses to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also said that completely free competition in
telecommunications services will begin in April, two years ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In India, where telecommunications business until now have been
dominated by state-owned companies, the government is reportedly
considering opening the sector to foreign interests. Foreigners
may soon be allowed to set up telecom companies without a local
partner as previously mandated.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, Globe Telecom, a joint venture between
Ayala Corp of the Philippines and Singapore Telecom International,
and Isla Communications Inc, in which Deutsche Telekom AG has
majority shares, agreed to merge in February, bringing the country
closer to a regional telecom player.
</P>
<P>
But what has really shaken Asia's telecom market is the 38.10-
billion-dollar takeover of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT by Pacific Century
CyberWorks Ltd. (PCCW) at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which has been described as only the beginning of a
transformation of Asia's telecommunications landscape, will lead
to more changes in Asia's telecom market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be much more consolidation to come in the telecom
industry," said Bruce Carnegie Brown, head of the Asian region for
J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. "We will see more instances in which new-economy
money buys old-economy companies."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts said, the fast development of Internet
would become the major forces behind changes in Asia's telecom
sector in the years ahead as telecom companies must make
preparations for fierce competition.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Internet is already posed to become one of the
fastest growing industries in Asia, offering possibility of
billions of dollars in revenue for overseas and local
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
According to International Data Corp., online spending in non-
Japan Asia will double from 2.2 billion dollars in 1999, to 5.5
billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 will be the year that the global e-commerce
players invade Asia," said David Michael, vice president at Boston
Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
If Asian Countries do not want to lose the big Internet market,
they will have to speed up changes in the telecom sector to meet
the growing demand of online population in the region and to
compete with foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
But analysts admitted that Asian economies are at the different
stages of development, governments there are likely to open the
telecom market cautiously and slowly, because radical changes
could hurt the still vulnerable telecom sector.

<HEADLINE> Russia Orders Arrest of Chechen President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday officially put
Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov on the federal wanted list,
charging him with stirring up and participating in armed mutiny.
</P>
<P>
A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Maskhadov, the
supreme commander of rebel forces, and formal charges were brought
against him in a trial by default, said Yury Biryukov, chief of
the North Caucasus directorate of the Russian Prosecutor-General
Office.
</P>
<P>
Biryukov said investigation reveals that "since May 1998, with
the permission of Aslan Maskhadov, the Congress of Peoples of
Ichkeria and Dagestan has acted in Grozny under the chairmanship
of well-known terrorist Shamil Basayev."
</P>
<P>
The congress, attempting to change Russia's constitutional
order and create an Islamic republic of Chechnya and Dagestan, was
responsible for Chechen armed incursions into Dagestan last August
and September, he said.
</P>
<P>
An expert evaluation of Maskhadov's call on rebels to put up
every resistance to federal forces is underway, Biryukov said.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov in a February hysteria-tainted address to rebel
groups reportedly called on them to "kill federal troops wherever
possible" and "enjoy it."
</P>
<P>
If experts find it authentic, another criminal case could be
opened against him, Biryukov said.

<HEADLINE> International Cigar Festival Ends in Havana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The second International Habano (
Cigar) Festival held to promote Cuban cigars ended in Havana
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of dollars worth of Cuban cigars were
auctioned during the festival which started Monday.
</P>
<P>
Western Europe is the largest market for Cuban cigars,
accounting for 65.5 percent of the total. Within Europe, Spain and
France were biggest cigar consumers last year which imported 43
million and 17.8 million cigars respectively, said officials from
the national cigar company Habanos S.A.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains the largest potential market for
Cuban cigars with its geographic proximity and American
fascination for cigars. About 6 million cigars are smuggled into
the United States annually despite nearly 40 years of U.S. embargo
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The third Cigar Festival will be held from February 19 to 23 in
2001.

LONDON -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Saturday that
he agreed with a British Home Office report which says
paramilitary men in Northern Ireland are planning fresh violence.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said concern was focused on dissident groups but there
was no evidence to suggest the main republican and loyalist
terrorist groups were implicated.
</P>
<P>
"We have no particular information, but it has been well known
for a long time that the security forces north and south of the
border and in Britain have been very concerned about groups of
dissidents," he said. (BC-N.Ireland-Ahern)

<HEADLINE> FIFA Rules out Nandrolone Bans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- World soccer ruling body FIFA has
ruled out banning players who test positive for nandrolone,
spokesman Andreas Herren said in Zurich, Switzerland on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee, however, said that it had
no plans at the moment to change its hard-line position which
inflicts bans on any athletes found to have an unacceptable level
of the steroid in their systems.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows research which showed nandrolone can be
produced by the body during strenuous exercise.
</P>
<P>
Scientists commissioned by FIFA carried out a study of 148
Swiss footballers in compiling their findings.
</P>
<P>
"It was found that the body did produce nandrolone in
quantities that would put players above the threshold for a
positive test," Herren said.
</P>
<P>
"Knowing that there is the possibility that the body itself
produces nandrolone, we cannot ban footballers who test positive
for nandrolone."

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Bank of
Communications (BoCom) will seek a domestic listing and a stronger
presence in the country's relatively developed areas this year,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's Business Weekly quoted the bank's President
Wang Mingquan as saying that the bank will first replenish its
capital.
</P>
<P>
Flotation of debentures worth 5 billion yuan (about 600 million
U.S. dollars) are being considered among the options in its
recapitalization plan, he said. The debentures refer to bonds
issued to institutions.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also prepare to issue shares to individuals and
go public on a domestic bourse, he said.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1988, the bank was the country's first shareholding
bank, with investment from the central government and State
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Following the establishment of BoCom, about 10 share-holding
commercial banks were launched in China to compete with the four
wholly State-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The China Mingsheng Banking Corporation, which is China's only
private bank, and the Huaxia Bank, have been preparing for their
listing plans, according to the newspaper.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will form a stronger IT
industry by increasing the production capacity of new electronic
equipment parts and establishing more competitive conglomerates,
according to a recent national symposium here.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, officials from the Ministry of
Information Industry, the State Development Planning Commission
and the Ministry of Science and Technology agreed that the
industry must upgrade IT equipment and form conglomerates in the
next five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
Qu Weizhi, vice minister of the information industry, told the
meeting that China's IT industry has developed a considerable
production capacity during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The sector is expected to leap ahead at an annual rate of 25
percent in the next five years with the soaring demand from the
fast-growing automobile and telecommunications industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qu said that the industry's development strategy will give more
importance to forming competitive IT firms, such as the Fenghua
Group, to encourage technological upgrading and market exploration
for new products.
</P>
<P>
The company in south China's Guangdong Province has become the
largest provider of porcelain capacitors, resistors and inductors
in China. With 70 percent of its products for export, it recorded
a sales worth 1.5 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
China will grant digital and Internet equipment producers more
preferential policies to accelerate a smooth transfer of
intellectual research products.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouse, has boosted the consumer
market by cutting fees and taxes.
</P>
<P>
The province's telecom authority reduced the installation fee
for telephones and mobile phone subscription charges last year by
a large margin, which helped lure 2.9 million new cell phone
subscribers, bringing the total to 6.8 million.
</P>
<P>
The readjustment of the real estate market and drop in property
taxes, accompanied by a determined housing reform, have garnered
the enthusiasm of home buyers. The residential housing sales are
expected to continue their high-speed rise through this year.
</P>
<P>
A streamlining of electricity fees helped increase industrial
and commercial companies' power consumption by 8 percent on an
annual basis in the first 11 months in 1999, and removed the
financial burden on the rural sector by 3.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Livestock producers also had a bumper year. The province
curtailed taxes on pig sales by some 1 billion in 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Major Tasks for Development of Western Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji has set forth
some major objectives for the implementation of the strategy to
develop China's western areas in his government work report to the
Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress, which
opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
For the present and a period of time to come, the focuses
should be placed on the following:
</P>
<P>
-- To accelerate infrastructure development. While mainly
concentrating on highways, efforts should be made to build more
railways, airports and gas trunk pipelines. Efforts should also be
beefed up for the growth of electric power grids and
telecommunications, radio and television facilities as well as
infrastructure development in large and medium-sized cities. It is
particularly important that prominence should be placed on the
rational exploitation of water resources and on water conservation.
</P>
<P>
-- To conserve and improve ecological environment effectively.
Greater efforts need to be made to complete the projects in
protection of natural forests along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River and the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River.
Terraced fields on steep slopes should be returned to forests or
pastures in a planned and systematic way.
</P>
<P>
In light of China's relatively ample supply of grain and other
farm produce, forests and pastures should be developed at the
expense of grain production in accordance with the comprehensive
measures for returning cultivated land to forests or pastures,
closing off hillsides to facilitate afforestation, giving relief
to local residents in the form of grain, and encouraging
individual contractors to manage concerned areas.
</P>
<P>
Plans should be worked out to provide effective policy guidance
for this work, respect the wishes of farmers and carry out
experiments, gradually spread successful new practices, and
refrain from rushing headlong into action. Any further effort to
clear forests and pastures to reclaim land should be resolutely
stopped.
</P>
<P>
-- In light of local geography, climate, resources and other
conditions, different regions should focus on developing strong
industries with local characteristics as well as high and new
technology industries where conditions permit.
</P>
<P>
-- Science, technology and education should be vigorously
developed. The translation of scientific and technological
advances into productive forces should be accelerated; people
should be trained in different fields at different levels of
expertise; and the overall quality of the workforce should be
improved further.

<TEXT>
<P>
"We should step up agricultural infrastructure development,
focusing on water conservancy projects to improve production and
living conditions in rural areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for intensifying industrial restructuring efforts to
improve the industrial structure, product quality and economic
performance, and become more competitive internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said that China should adopt the following measures: First,
following the laws governing the market economy, the country
should employ a variety of means to limit the production of non-
marketable products. More small and technologically backward
plants and mines that produce shoddy products, waste resources and
cause serious pollution should be closed down. More outmoded
equipment, technology and production processes should be abandoned
and the surplus production capacity in certain industries should
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Second, effective measures are to be adopted to speed up
technological upgrading in enterprises, giving preferences to old
industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We should continue to put quality above everything
else, introduce advanced standards and restructure and optimize
the pattern of production. Efforts to develop new technology,
production processes and products that are in great demand on the
market need to be intensified. Production of more readily
marketable products, especially famous, quality products, should
be encouraged."
</P>
<P>
Third, vigorous efforts should be made to develop high
technology and emerging industries, particularly in the field of
information, bioengineering, new energy sources, new materials and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, China should develop more labor-intensive
industries.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, industrial reorganization efforts should be continued
to help key industries improve their economy of scale and optimize
their distribution. We should work hard to upgrade the technology
used in the major equipment manufacturing and basic materials
industries.
</P>
<P>
The premier underlined the development of tertiary industry. "
While continuing to develop transportation, commerce and trade, we
need to make great efforts to develop information, banking and
financial services, tourism, community services and intermediary
services to gradually raise the proportion of tertiary industry in
the national economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments under the State Council should
expeditiously work out plans and adopt measures to stimulate
industrial restructuring and technological upgrading.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Lothar Matthaeus played his
farewell Bundesliga match for Bayern Munich Saturday, but VfB
Stuttgart handed a 2-0 defeat to Bayern.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus left in the 55th minute of his 266th league match to

</P>
<P>
Matthaeus plays his final match for Munich next week at home

<HEADLINE> China's Auto City Tries to Improve Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- These days Zhao Guiyun doesn't
give a second thought to wearing white for her morning jog through
People's Square in Changchun, in China's northeast Jilin Province.
A few years ago, her snowy sports clothes turned to gray after
just 30 minutes in the city air.
</P>
<P>
Several years of continuous anti-air pollution efforts in
Changchun have brought substantial progress, and over the next
three years the city will spend 1.596 billion yuan (about 192
million U.S. dollars) to fight air pollution caused by coal, auto
emissions and dust.
</P>
<P>
Changchun's air quality record is now at its best in history,
with the proportion of sulfur dioxide reducing to 15 micrograms
per cubic meter, and nitrogen oxide to 43 micrograms per cubic
meter, said local official in charge of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The city has spent a total 500 million yuan in the past four
years to build nearly 1,000 anti-pollution projects, add another 5
million sq.m. of central heating, and channel natural gas into
another 10,000 households.
</P>
<P>
It has also built green belts in the urban areas, increasing
its green coverage rate to the current 38.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Suspended particles in the air, 55 percent of which come from
burning coal, have been the main cause of air pollution in winter
in Changchun, known as China's "auto city."

<HEADLINE> Boxer Lewis Prepared for Title Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's undisputed world
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis could be stripped of his World
Boxing Association title on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The belt was one of the two Lewis won when he beat Evander
Holyfield last year in Las Vegas, adding this and the
International Boxing Federation version to the World Boxing
Council crown he already held.
</P>
<P>
Lewis is set to defend the titles on 29 April against unbeaten
American Michael Grant at Madison Square Garden in New York.
</P>
<P>
But the WBA wants Lewis to fight its top-ranked challenger,
Britain's Henry Akinwande, who Lewis defeated by disqualification
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande was non-combative in that bout and resorted to
hugging Lewis constantly to avoid being hit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Grant is regarded as the biggest-name challenger
available in the heavyweight division other than Mike Tyson, whose
comeback bid is not yet ready for a title test.
</P>
<P>
Frank Maloney, manager of Lewis, said his fighter will drop the
title rather than be forced into another fight against Akinwande.
</P>
<P>
"The fans don't want it, Lennox doesn't want it and boxing
doesn't need it," Maloney said.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Critical of Careless Defending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United manager Alex
Ferguson was critical of his side's "careless" defending after
securing a draw against Liverpool in a English premier league
match on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But his counterpart Gerard Houllier insisted the title was now
definitely on its way to Old Trafford after a 30-yard free-kick by
Patrik Berger gave Liverpool a 28th-minute lead before Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer equalised in first-half injury-time.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson maintained that United had been "unlucky" not to
secure all three points and declared himself content with their
overall display as he added: "We're getting more like it."
</P>
<P>
He was, however, concerned by his defence's lack of solidity in
the first-half and declared: "I thought we were taking chances at
the back early on in terms of trying to dribble the ball out of
our own box.
</P>
<P>
"If you're as careless as that you can create a bit of anxiety,
particularly among the supporters. That happened a few times and
we are like that at times.
</P>
<P>
"We think we're playing in a practice game at times and we don'
t have defenders who want to kick it into row five. They want to
chip it in there or play a one-two to get it there!"
</P>
<P>
Keeper Mark Bosnich was again dropped to the bench, with
Ferguson insisting that reports he was suffering from a virus in
midweek were not correct.
</P>
<P>
The United manager added: "He's all right. He doesn't enjoy it
but we had two fantastic strikers Teddy Sheringham and Andy Cole
on the bench as well.
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with the two who did play Solskjaer and
Dwight Yorke and that interchange brings you the freshness and
sharpness which strikers revel in.
</P>
<P>
"You have to explain that to Teddy and Andy but I know I'm
right."
</P>
<P>
The draw left Liverpool still 10 points behind United and
Houllier repeated the claim which he made before kick-off as he
admitted: "Even if we'd won, I'd still have thought they would win
the title."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Sees Chechen Issue as Russia's Internal Matter: Russian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian presidential
envoy Ramazan Abdulatipov said in the Saudi capital of Riyadh
Sunday that Saudi Arabia sees the ongoing Chechen issue as Russia's
internal affair.
</P>
<P>
Following talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-
Faisal, Abdulatipov told a press conference that Riyadh is
concerned about the humanitarian situation of the Chechen people
and believes that political solution is the best way out of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Gulf kingdom for providing 70,000 tons of food
and other relief aid to Chechen refugees, which he said exceeded
the total European aid.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy noted that Moscow is determined to continue
its operations against the terrorists in Chechnya until a
reconstruction plan is worked out.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Moscow's refusal of any dialogue with the Chechen
government of President Aslan Maskhadov, which he accused of
turning Chechnya into a "castle of international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Russia officially put Maskhadov on the federal
wanted list on charges of armed mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
A arrest warrant for Maskhadov, whom Moscow accused as the
supreme commander of rebel forces, has been issued, and formal
charges of abetting and participating in armed mutiny were brought
against him in a trial by default.
</P>
<P>
Abdulatipov had earlier delivered a letter to Saudi Crown Prince
and Deputy Prime Minister Abdulllah Ibn Abdul-Aziz from acting
Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin, also prime minister,
briefed Abdullah on the latest development in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official also discussed with Saudi officials the
situation in the Middle East, the Gulf region as well as bilateral
relations, according to the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Abdulatipov arrived in the western Saudi city of Jeddah earlier
Sunday on a Gulf tour which will also take him to the United Arab
Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Supports Yugoslavia Against U.S.: Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq stands firmly by the Yugoslav
people in their struggle against the aggressions of the United
States and its allies, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said here on
Sunday in talks with visiting Yugoslav Vice President Dragan
Tomichi.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saddam said that Iraq supports the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and believes that Yugoslavia
would be able to withstand the aggressions by the U.S.-led North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, which launched fierce air attacks
against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was the first in the Arab world to condemn the U.S. and its
allies, Saddam said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will fail in its attempts to split other countries on
the excuses of religious or ethnic issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Tomichi expressed Yugoslavia's willingness to
strengthen bilateral relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
While Iraq condemned the air campaign against Yugoslavia by the
U.S.-led allies last year, Yugoslavia voiced support to Iraq's
confrontation with the U.S. and calling for the lifting of the
decade-long sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel Takes Significant Step in Peace Process  by Tan Xinmu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet Sunday
endorsed Prime Minister Ehud Barak's plan to pull troops out of
southern Lebanon by July, marking a significant step that the
Jewish state has taken in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet endorsement of the plan is important because it came
at a time when both Israelis and the international community are
uncertain over in which direction the Middle East peace process
will go.
</P>
<P>
When taking office last July, Barak got a lot of applause from
around the world by promising to revive the stalled peace process
on all its tracks in order to end the lasting conflict between
Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
But seven months into his office, the widespread optimism is
giving its way to increasing doubts as the peace talks were stalled
again on both the Palestinian and Syrian tracks and tension is
mounting in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
As the most direct result, the cabinet decision might pose a
challenge to Damascus to choose between returning to the
negotiating table quickly or risking losing an important card in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for Barak to have given a high priority
to the talks with Syria is that a peace deal with Damascus will
guarantee an orderly Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Syria is said to have been using Hezbollah
guerrillas, who are fighting to end Israel's occupation of south
Lebanon, as a means of applying pressure for Israeli concessions
over the Golan Heights, seized by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet decision said that Israel will pull its
troops out of south Lebanon preferably, but not necessarily, within
a framework of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Although the Israeli-Syrian talks broke down in mid-January,
international mediation efforts led by Washington have been going
on. There have been reports for the last few days that the two
sides are only weeks away from a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
No matter what progress has been made toward the peace accord,
the Israeli cabinet decision will undoubtedly speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
Also, by turning his election pledge to an operational cabinet
decision, Barak demonstrated to the world that he is serious in and
capable of carrying out his promises.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians deadlocked in early
February over disputes on both interim and final status issues. The
Palestinians said the main reason was Barak's failure to keep his
own words.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet decision marks the first time that Israel agrees
pull its troops out of Lebanon unconditionally. For the last two
decades, Israel has long ignored United Nations resolutions calling
on it to withdraw from Lebanon without any precondition.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned against over-optimism because the peace talks
with Syria and the Palestinians are apparently different from an
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the pullback pledge last year because there was
almost a consensus among Israelis on the necessity of a withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed in two
invasion wars and the ensuing occupation in Lebanon in the last two
decades. The rising casualties have cast widespread doubt over the
effectivity of the so-called security zone and sparked increasing
call for a withdrawal from there.
</P>
<P>
For Israelis, the talks with both the Palestinians and Syria
require much more painful compromises since Israel has to give up
land in exchange for peace with them.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, few Israelis thought Israel should keep south
Lebanon forever. On the other hand, not many Israelis agree to
dismantle Jewish settlements in occupied Palestinian areas or hand
over the whole Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of this difference, the Israeli parliament last week
approved the preliminary reading of an opposition bill that will
require a special majority, a majority of all eligible voters
instead of those who cast their votes, in a national referendum for
ratifying a peace agreement with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria Call for Stability in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Turkey, Greece
and Bulgaria on Sunday called in a joint statement for easing
tensions in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers Ismail Cem of Turkey, George Papandreou of
Greece and Nadejda Mihailova of Bulgaria met in Plovdiv, south
Bulgaria, for one-day talks on Balkan stability.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite meeting, initiated by Mihailova, came against the
backdrop of worsening of the situation in Kosovo, where ethnic
conflicts have continued unabated since the U.S.-led NATO launched
two-month air strikes on the province last year.
</P>
<P>
"Permanent peace, stability, democracy and economic development
in Southeast Europe is the common target of the three countries,"
said the joint statement issued at the end of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed their continuous support for relevant U.
N. resolutions on Kosovo and called on the U.N. authorities there
to create a democratic atmosphere by taking into consideration the
rights of all citizens in the region , said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministers pointed out that the countries in the Balkan
region should play a principal role in implementing the stability
pact they signed and that the private sector should be given a
chance to play an active part in the restructuring efforts in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The three foreign ministers agreed to hold similar meetings in
the future to continue their discussion on issues of common
interest.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Activity Threatens Canada's Boreal Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's boreal forests are being
threatened by industrial activity, Global Forest Watch Canada has
warned.
</P>
<P>
In its latest report released this week, the environmental
watchdog group said up to 95 percent of all major forested
watersheds have roads, mines, settlements and other developments.
</P>
<P>
Using government information and satellite data, the report
says that much of Canada's remaining intact forests are being
opened up to large-scale industrial development, with only 8
percent of major forest types under protection.
</P>
<P>
The threatened types include the country's environmentally
sensitive boreal forests, which account for one third of the world
's remaining tracts.
</P>
<P>
Excessive logging is a major threat to the boreal forests that
run across northern regions of the country. Canada's forests are
predominantly managed for timber, with half of it in logging
tenures, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
In the western province of British Columbia, more than 80
percent of the forests have been allocated to forest companies,
whose logging rates appear unsustainable over the long term.
</P>
<P>
Rates need to drop as much as 25 percent in boreal forests and
up to 30 percent in coastal B.C. forests to reach sustainablility
goals,the watchdog group said.

<P>
ATHENS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Greece,
Turkey and Bulgaria Sunday reiterated their support for the U.N.
Security Council resolution 1244 concerning the settlement of the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and his Turkish and
Bulgarian counterparts, Ismail Cem and Nadezda Michailova, later
Sunday concluded their meeting with a visit to Nea Orestiada,
northern Greece, after visiting Plovdiv, Bulgaria and Edirne in
Turkey, according to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, all three foreign ministers voiced their
concern over the worsening situation in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo and their support of the U.N. resolution 1244, regarding
the efforts of the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo to create
a safe environment for all nationalities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also believed that the joint interim
administrative structure would pave the road for a multicultural
democracy in Kosovo, so as the rights of all citizens of all
nationalities and religious communities were respected.
</P>
<P>
They reiterated the commitment of their countries to
supporting the U.N. charter on the full and total respect of the
territorial integrity of all nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Describing their tripartite meeting as "a historic one,"
Papandreou said that there was a very common framework and
approach of the Kosovo problem by all three countries.

<HEADLINE> Juventus Remains at Top of Italian Soccer Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Juventus of Turin remained at the top
of the Serie A standings Sunday while the high-charge derby in
Milan saw Inter Milan win and leap over AC Milan into third place.
</P>
<P>
Inter was already ahead by a goal in the first half and scored
again in the second was geared for a shut-out before AC Milan was
awarded a penalty at 91st minute which it successfully transformed
and in part saved some face.
</P>
<P>
Juve won at home against Bari, 2-1, but second-placed Lazio of
Rome kept in stride with an away win against Lecce 0-1. Juve also
scored on a penalty and saw yet another day go by without a
penalty called against it.
</P>
<P>
Roma also showed it was still in the race for the league
championship, should Juve slip up in this latter part of the
season,and defeated Torino 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Sunday's biggest upset was Perugia's startling 1-2 away
win against Venezia which helped pull it out of the relegation
area but seriously compromised Venezia's chances of staying in the
first division next season.
</P>
<P>
The Serie A survival hopes of next-to-last Cagliari and last-
placed Piacenza were all but extinguished in the two matches
played on Saturday with Piacenza falling 2-1 away against
Fiorentina while Cagliari visited Udinese and got hammed 5-2.
</P>
<P>
Parma ended a long no-win streak in division play by defeating
Reggina 3-0, while the Verona-Bologna match ended a goal-less draw.
</P>
<P>
Referees came under fire again today and Bari complained that
the first Juve goal came thanks to an uncalled foul while the
cause for penalty awarded to the Turin side was viewed by the
losers as exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Lecce was also very unhappy over being denied a penalty.

<P>
BERLIN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fiscger will make an official visit to Iran from March 6 to 7. The
visit will be widely expected to mark a turning point in the
bilateral relation between Germany and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Germany attached great importance to the bilateral relations
with Iran because Iran plays a major role in the affairs of the
Middle East and the Islamic World. But there were also much
troubles between both countries, especially the case of German
businessman Helmut Hofer.
</P>
<P>
58-year-old Hamburger leather businessman Helmut Hofer was
arrested on September 20 1997 while he was reaching at the Teheran
's airport. He was accused of having the unallowable sexual
relation with an Iranian woman student, therefore he was sentenced
to death by an Iranian court for several times during two years.
</P>
<P>
Through the diplomatic efforts of the both sides the question
about Helmut Hofer has been resolved successfully.
</P>
<P>
On February 18 the parliamentary elections were held in Iran.
In opinion of western countries the Iranian reformists won the
election. Therefore the western countries held that it's time for
improving the relationship with Iran. The Iranian foreign minister
Kamal Kharrazi had visited United Kingdom and France and the
Italian foreign minister Lamberto Dini is making an official visit
to Iran from March 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
The German government said that Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer would bring up the issues of disarmament and human rights
in his upcoming talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi and
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's visit will make preparations for the official visit
of Iranian President Khatami to Germany, according to the Iranian
foreign ministry spokesman Hamid-Reza Assefi.

ROME, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The streets and alleyways of Venice
were jammed Sunday with masked multitudes celebrating the most
famous carnival event in northern Italy where the spirit of
Casanova lives on.
</P>
<P>
The 18th century, in fact, was the most evident and recurring
theme among those parading the streets of this lagoon city and
attending the various balls and other events which will continue
through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The second car-free Sunday observed in a growing number of
Italian cities, now 145, allowed for carnival festivities as well
as hundreds of thousands if not millions of people took advantage
of the fine weather and clean air to stroll the historic city
centers.
</P>
<P>
One of the results of this was "people jams" on the streets and
long lines outside museums.
</P>
<P>
Viareggio, the Tuscan coastal city which rivals Venice in its
carnival fever, Sunday attracted over 200,000 people who came to
watch the parade of elaborate floats and costumes.
</P>
<P>
This year's parade and carnival celebration in Viareggio was

OTTAWA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Natural Resources, the
country's second-largest heavy oil producer, will begin test
drilling for a new oilsands development in two years in the
western province of Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The local information service said Sunday that the project of

</P>
<P>
The initial planning for Mic Mac will be completed in September.
</P>
<P>
Several companies are planning to expand their oilsands
development in the country, where Shell Canada has announced the
building of an oilsands plant of 4.1 billion Canadian dollars (
about 2.8 billion U.S.dollars) to pump 155,000 barrels a day by
2002.
</P>
