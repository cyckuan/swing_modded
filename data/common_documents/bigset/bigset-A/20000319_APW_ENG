<HEADLINE> Pa. Lawmakers Exempt From Ethics Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pennsylvania legislators are exempt from the
state ethics law for public officials, and scores of them have used
their authority in ways that could help their own, their family's
or their employers' financial interests, according to a report
published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the state's 253 lawmakers, 68 -- or 27 percent -- have
introduced legislation since 1991 that could specifically benefit
the type of business with which they or their close relatives are
associated, The Philadelphia Inquirer found in a review of state
records.
</P>
<P>
   And 52 -- or 21 percent -- serve on legislative committees that
have oversight over such businesses, The Inquirer reported.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators, citing constitutional separation of powers,
insisted in 1987 that the State Ethics Commission exempt them from
most of the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public office is a public trust,'' the ethics law's preamble
says. ''Any effort to realize personal gain through that office,
other than compensation provided by law, is a violation of that
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's own ethics rules allow lawmakers to write and
vote on bills that help their own interests, as long as the bill
helps at least one other person or company. And they are not
required to reveal that they or their close relatives -- including
spouses -- stand to gain financially from a bill they are sponsoring
or supporting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pennsylvania is the most backward state in the country when it
comes to these issues,'' said state Sen. Allen Kukovich, who has
repeatedly called for tighter ethics, lobbying and campaign finance
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have written the laws in such a way that they can violate
the public trust without violating the law,'' said Diane Renzulli
of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Public Integrity, a
government watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawmakers the newspaper cited as examples:
</P>
<P>
   --Sen. Frank A. Salvatore, a senior member of the committee that
regulates liquor and beer, is chairman of the board of one of
Philadelphia's largest wholesale beer distributors. He has proposed
bills that would benefit beer-sellers, including his family's
company.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. John Barley, now the House Appropriations Committee
chairman, founded a family business that has made millions of
dollars from sewage sludge disposal on farmland. He has opposed
tougher rules for sludge application and played a key role
rewriting a law on farm pollution regulations.
</P>
<P>
   --Rep. Andrew Carn helped secure approval for $35,000 in state
grants to a private computer training company whose interim
director is his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those legislators told The Inquirer they did nothing
improper and were acting in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight states have more stringent financial disclosure
laws than Pennsylvania, according to the Center for Public
Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty prohibit lawmakers from being paid to represent clients
before state agencies, according to the California-based Council on
Government Ethics Laws. Pennsylvania has no such restrictions.

<HEADLINE> USDA Scientist Knipling Dies at 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edward F. Knipling, who helped develop the
radiation method of sterilizing insects harmful to plants, animals
and humans, died of cancer Friday at his home in suburban
Arlington, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling's work was praised as an efficient, pesticide-free way
in insect control and has been credited with eliminating the
screwworm fly in North America and with it a threat to the
livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling and colleague R.C. Bushland used radiation to sterilize
male screwworm flies, which then were released to mate with female
flies in the wild. The unfertilized eggs did not hatch into larvae
and the screwworm population eventually was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Before his retirement in 1973, Knipling was director of the
entomology research division of the Agriculture Department's
Agriculture Research Service. He won numerous awards, including the
National Medal of Science in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include five children, 14 grandchildren and nine
great-grandchildren.

</P>
<P>
   In the last 91 seconds, Flores, Dimson and Jamie Carey went to
the line for Stanford, combining to make eight straight free throws
to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Free throw troubles kept Stanford from winning in regulation.
With 1:05 left, Lindsey Yamasaki made one of two free throws to put
Stanford ahead 63-62. Flores, an 88 percent free throw shooter,
made only one of two with 15.4 seconds to play to make it 64-62.
</P>
<P>
   Thorius penetrated and sank a leaning one-hander from in the
lane with 3.6 seconds to go to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford built a 25-8 lead with 10:33 to go in the first half on
the strength of two 3-pointers each by Flores and Carey and one by
Yamasaki.
</P>

<P>
   Stanford led 49-40 with 10:43 to go in regulation when freshman
center LeeAnn Bies sparked a 13-0 Michigan run with two free
throws, a three-point play and a layup. Thorius's 3-pointer at 7:31
capped the run and boosted the Wolverines to a 53-49 lead with 7:31
to play.

<HEADLINE> China To Wait on Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's government announced Saturday that it
would wait to see how Taiwan's new president handles relations
between the island and the mainland, despite its earlier warnings
that a Chen Shui-bian victory could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by state news media, Beijing repeated its
assertion that Chen's election did not change Taiwan's status as
''an inseparable part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We should listen to what the new leader in Taiwan says and
watch what he does. We will observe where he will lead cross-Strait
relations,'' said the statement, attributed to the Taiwan Office of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State
Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
   The ''one-China policy,'' under which China holds that Taiwan is
a breakaway province, is the precondition for peaceful unification,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   '''Taiwan independence' in whatever form will never be
allowed,'' it said, concluding with a call for the people of Taiwan
to help ''realize the complete reunification of the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was read toward the end of a late-evening
television news program, followed by a brief report saying
Taiwanese news media reported Chen had won in Taiwan's election for
''local leaders.'' Chinese news media generally do not refer to
Taiwan's elected leader as a president, or when they do, place the
word president in quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's election challenges the status-quo in relations between
the sides, said Zhou Zhihuai of the Institute of Taiwan Studies
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're now at a crossroads in cross-Strait relations,'' he said
in a telephone interview in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beijing's official ''wait and see'' position, Chinese
academic Yan Xuetong, a scholar at a think-tank linked to China's
spy agency, warned on Sunday that war with Taiwan was inevitable
within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Short-term, nothing will happen. Long-term, war is
unavoidable,'' Yan said in an interview. ''For me, long-term is
definitely within 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen was the candidate Beijing disliked most because his
opposition party has called for formal independence for Taiwan,
which has governed itself since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled
to the island after the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji and state-run media had warned Taiwan voters
a Chen victory could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Beijing said it might use military force if Taiwan
delayed reunification talks indefinitely. The Chinese government
previously had said it would use force if Taiwan declared
independence or foreign governments meddled.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's statement contained no repetition of these
threats.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the election, many Chinese have said they did
not know much about it. China's state-run news media gave the
campaign in Taiwan almost no coverage. Most major national and
Beijing papers had no stories about it on Saturday.

<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Vaclav Varada scored twice in the
Buffalo Sabres' 5-1 victory over the Calgary Flames on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ward, Curtis Brown, and Maxim Afinogenov also scored for
Buffalo, which moved within one point of the New York Rangers and
the Pittsburgh Penguins for eighth place in the Eastern Conference.
Buffalo and New York each have nine games left, but Pittsburgh has
11.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shantz scored for the Flames, who have lost six straight,
including four in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
   Varada opened the scoring 1:01 into the second after a Calgary
turnover. Flames defenseman Derek Morris fell while carrying the
puck out of the Calgary end. Chris Gratton pounced on the loose
puck and passed it to Vladimir Tsyplakov, who got it to Varada for
a one-timer that beat Grant Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   Gratton has one goal and five assists in five games since being
traded to Buffalo from Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo made it 3-0 when Ward and Brown scored 47 seconds apart
midway through the second.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's goal at 12:21 came with Calgary's Marc Savard in the
penalty box for slashing at Dominik Hasek's glove after the Buffalo
goalie covered the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek lost his shutout bid 4:30 into the third, when Shantz
poked the puck past him.
</P>
<P>
   Afinogenov made it 4-1 with a power-play goal at 12:54, and
Varada scored on a breakaway with six seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek finished with 30 saves, while Fuhr stopped 16 shots.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 97, Supersonics 96  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) - Scottie Pippen's two free throws with 7.7 seconds
left and Brent Barry's missed 3-pointer at the buzzer gave the
Portland Trail Blazers a 97-96 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen inbounded the ball with 16.6 seconds left and received a
return pass, then drove from the left side and was fouled by Gary
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Barry had a wide-open 3-point attempt from the corner but missed
badly with three seconds left. Time ran out before either team
could control the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis made one of two free throws with 17 seconds left
to give the Sonics a 96-95 lead. Lewis missed the second shot and
the Blazers set up for the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace led the Blazers with 24 points and Bonzi Wells
added 23.
</P>
<P>
   Payton led the Sonics with 24 points. Ruben Patterson added 15.
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The game may have been a preview of a possible playoff matchup,
as the Blazers are third in the Western Conference and the Sonics
are sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace beat the shot clock with an 18-foot jumper for a 95-93
lead. The Sonics tied the game at 95 on a jump shot by Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire turned the ball over on Portland's next
possession, and Baker passed the ball to Payton but his shot was
blocked by Pippen. Lewis rebounded and was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics got back-to-back baskets from Lewis in a 9-0 run for
an 89-83 lead with 4:58 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's putback basket gave Portland a 77-75 lead after three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 64-60 when Steve Smith was knocked woozy by a
pick by Horace Grant. Wells entered the game and the Blazers picked
up the pace as Wells scored seven of Portland's next nine points.
His layup put the Blazers up 69-68 with 3:51 left in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics led 58-54 at halftime. They outscored Portland 39-28
during the second period and shot 15-of-21 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Payton went scoreless and missed both his attempts during the
first quarter. He found the range with 16 points and four assists
in the second quarter and the Sonics rallied from a 10-point
deficit to retake the lead 51-48 with 2:14 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Sonics activated Lazaro Borrell for the game and put
Emanual Davis on the injured list with a damaged facial nerve.
...The Sonics picked up the pace from the outside during the second
period, connecting on 4-of-5 from 3-point range. ... Wallace picked
up his NBA-leading 29th technical foul in the third quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Todd Bertuzzi scored two of
Vancouver's four second-period goals as the Canucks moved within
four points of a playoff spot with a 6-1 victory over the Ottawa
Senators on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bertuzzi scored 18 seconds into the second period, then added
his second goal at 9:21 to give Vancouver a 4-1 lead. Bertuzzi's
second goal was his 19th of the season and set a career
single-season high for both goals and points (40). He had 18 goals
and 39 points with the New York Islanders in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks improved to 5-1 in their last six home games and
moved within four points of idle San Jose for the final playoff
spot in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Markus Naslund made it 5-1 with 1:27 left in the second period
and added two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jovanovski scored the only goal of the first period and
Bertuzzi and Trent Klatt scored in the first 1:30 of the second
period to give Vancouver a 3-0 lead. Mark Messier added two assists
for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators dropped to 35-25-11-2 and fell to sixth spot in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Barrasso, making his first start in net for Ottawa,
surrendered four goals on Vancouver's first 10 shots. Barrasso, who
was acquired from Pittsburgh for goalie Ron Tugnutt and defenseman
Janne Laukkanen, dropped to 5-8-2 this year. The 34-year-old
goaltender had skated just eight times in the month leading up to
the trade because of injuries and the death of his father in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Potvin made 20 saves for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Marian Hossa made it 3-1 with his 28th goal 6:05 into the
second, but Bertuzzi and Naslund scored to give Vancouver a
four-goal lead before the period ended. Harold Druken scored 3:23
into the third period.

Power Goes Out in New Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A grass fire knocked out electricity to nearly
550,000 New Mexico customers for up to three hours Saturday, snarling traffic in
Albuquerque, shutting down radio and television stations and forcing the state
high school basketball tournament to halt play. From Las Cruces to Gallup to
Albuquerque to Santa Fe to Taos, power went out shortly before 5 p.m. It came
back on, in phases from south to north, after about 6 p.m. By 8 p.m., the
southern part of the state was fully restored and Albuquerque was more than 85
percent restored, utility officials said. More than half of Santa Fe had its
power restored.

Report: Light Eyed in Swissair Crash

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investigators say a pilot's map light in the cockpit ceiling
in the 1998 crash of a Swissair plane off Nova Scotia could have been a source
of ignition, The New York Times reported Saturday. Canadian investigators were
sorting through the debris of Swissair Flight 111 to try to find the map light
from that plane, Jim Harris, spokesman for the Canadian Transportation Safety
Board, told the Times. The cause of the crash that killed 229 people has yet to
be determined. Boeing, which makes the MD-11 model planes, is urging airlines
using that type of aircraft to check the lights often until they can be
replaced.

congratulations to the winner, Chen Shui-bian, of the Democratic Progressive

Taiwan politics by founding President Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party,
''clearly demonstrates the strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.''

into the deadly crash of Flight 261, The Seattle Times reported Saturday. No
criminal wrongdoing has been established in the Jan. 31 crash off the coast of
California that killed 88 people, the Times said. The criminal investigation
grew out of a 15-month-old inquiry into practices at Alaska's maintenance
facility at Oakland, Calif., the Times said. In that inquiry, a grand jury in
San Francisco is investigating whether supervisors signed for repairs that
weren't done or that they weren't authorized to approve.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore posted only average grades as a
student at a prestigious Washington prep school, in most of his courses at
Harvard and during brief graduate studies at Vanderbilt, The Washington Post
reported. The newspaper said in Sunday's editions that it obtained Gore's
transcripts independently. Citing academic records of both Gore and George W.
Bush, the Post said Gore entered Harvard with an 1355 SAT score while Bush
arrived at Yale for undergraduate work with a 1206 SAT total. Once in college,
both men posted similarly mixed academic records, the Post said, pointing out
that in his sophomore year at Harvard, ''Gore's grades were lower than any
semester recorded on Bush's transcript from Yale.''

<HEADLINE> Kings 104, Clippers 83  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vlade Divac scored six of his 20 points
during a pivotal fourth-quarter rally and Predrag Stojakovic also
had 20 as the Sacramento Kings erased a 23-point second-quarter
deficit and beat the Los Angeles Clippers 104-83 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, eighth in the Western Conference playoff race, won
for the sixth time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson scored 25 points for the Clippers, who blew a
lead of 20 or more points for the second time in their last three
home games and failed to make a field goal during the first 7:23 of
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring the final 11 points of the first half, the Kings
extended their run to 21-0 on a layup by Jason Williams that gave
them a 51-45 lead with nine minutes left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers tied it at 68 with a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by
Eric Piatkowski, but the Kings opened the fourth quarter with a
13-1 run as Divac made a layup, a 13-footer and a 14-footer that
capped the run with 7:46 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers got no closer than 10 points after that.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off consecutive losses of 20 points at Sacramento and 27
points at Denver, the Clippers squandered this game in front of
their third sellout crowd of the season -- and the first that didn't
involve their Staples Center co-tenants, the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who blew a 20-point margin in less than eight
minutes during a 118-101 loss to Charlotte eight nights earlier,
nearly gave back all of a 36-13 lead in the final 8:31 of the
second quarter as the Kings rallied within 45-41 by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made a driving layup with 28 seconds left for his first
basket of the half, then intercepted a pass by Charles Jones and
threw a one-bounce pass that Tony Delk converted into a layup at
the halftime buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles opened the game with a 19-2 run as Sacramento missed
its first nine shots and turned the ball over four times. Corliss
Williamson's six-foot hook shot in the lane was Sacramento's only
basket during the first 7:26 of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings ended the quarter 3-for-20 from the field (15 percent)
and trailing 24-8. It was their lowest-scoring quarter of the
season and the fewest the Clippers had allowed in franchise history
-- one fewer than the then-Buffalo Braves gave up in the second
quarter in a 98-90 loss to the Baltimore Bullets on Feb. 5, 1971 at
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson, who returned to the Sacramento lineup after
missing four games because of a sore left knee, missed all five of
his shots in the first half and finished with seven points on
3-for-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Clippers are 2-22 against the eight Western Conference
teams currently holding down a playoff spot. They beat Sacramento
97-91 on Dec. 23 at Los Angeles and the Timberwolves 98-85 on Nov.
17 at Minnesota. ... Former Los Angeles Dodgers general manager
Fred Claire attended the game. ... This was Sacramento's third and
last set of back-to-back games against the same opponent. They
split the first two games of the season in Japan against the
Timberwolves, and split a home-and-home set with Vancouver at the
end of February. ... On Tuesday night, Mitch Richmond will make his
first appearance at Arco Arena since leaving Sacramento at the end
of the 1997-98 season. Richmond, who has played more games and
scored more points for the Kings than anyone in the Sacramento era,
didn't come to town with the Washington Wizards last season because
of the lockout-shortened schedule. ... The Clippers outrebounded
Sacramento 48-34, the fifth straight game in which the Kings have
been outrebounded.

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Greg Vanney scored on a penalty kick
with 16 minutes to play and the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated the
Colorado Rapids 2-1 Saturday night in a Major League Soccer opener.
</P>
<P>
   The winning score came after referee Ricardo Valenzuela awarded
the penalty kick for Marcelo Balboa's foul on Mauricio Cienfuegos.
Vanney put the kick into the upper left corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado ended its MLS-record 743-minute scoreless drought,
including playoff games, nine minutes into the second half on Paul
Bravo's penalty kick. Valenzuela awarded the kick after ruling
Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman fouled Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones opened the scoring for the hosts in the 60th minute,
taking Cienfuegos' short pass, taking one touch and putting a shot
from just outside the penalty area into the upper right corner of
the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy led 18-10 in shots and 10-3 in shots on goal. Rapids
goalkeeper Adin Brown made eight saves, while Hartman made two.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries kept four Colorado starters out of the lineup, while
leading scorer Jorge Dely Valdes missed the match to play for
Panama in a World Cup qualifier against Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles played without Robin Fraser, the 1999 MLS defender
of the year, who has a strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Sigi Schmid, the 1999 coach of the year, served a
one-match suspension for comments about the refereeing in the
Galaxy's 2-0 loss to D.C. United in MLS Cup '99.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embarked Saturday on a long-delayed
journey to South Asia ready to caution India and Pakistan to curb their
nuclear-weapons competition. Clinton canceled an expected formal departure
statement. ''Gotta Go,'' he shouted at well wishers as he walked from the White
House to Marine I, the presidential helicopter, his arm draped around the
shoulders of his daughter, Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham. The
first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, passed up the trip because of her campaign

Power Goes Out in New Mexico

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A grass fire knocked out electricity to nearly
550,000 New Mexico customers for up to three hours Saturday, snarling traffic in
Albuquerque, shutting down radio and television stations and forcing the state
high school basketball tournament to halt play. The fire in the Four Corners
area scorched a transmission line, which caused electricity to arc,
automatically shutting down two power plants, utility officials said. People
lost power from anywhere from 40 minutes to three hours.

Report: Light Eyed in Swissair Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investigators say a pilot's map light in the cockpit ceiling
in the 1998 crash of a Swissair plane off Nova Scotia could have been a source
of ignition, The New York Times reported Saturday. Canadian investigators were
sorting through the debris of Swissair Flight 111 to try to find the map light
from that plane, Jim Harris, spokesman for the Canadian Transportation Safety
Board, told the Times. The cause of the crash that killed 229 people has yet to
be determined. Boeing, which makes the MD-11 model planes, is urging airlines
using that type of aircraft to check the lights often until they can be
replaced.

Report: Criminal Probe in Jet Crash

   SEATTLE (AP) -- What began months ago as an inquiry into maintenance
practices at an Alaska Airlines facility has become a criminal investigation
into the deadly crash of Flight 261, The Seattle Times reported Saturday. No
criminal wrongdoing has been established in the Jan. 31 crash off the coast of
California that killed 88 people, the Times said. The criminal investigation
grew out of a 15-month-old inquiry into practices at Alaska's maintenance
facility at Oakland, Calif., the Times said. In that inquiry, a grand jury in
San Francisco is investigating whether supervisors signed for repairs that
weren't done or that they weren't authorized to approve.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A 500-acre grass fire knocked out
electricity to nearly 550,000 New Mexico customers for up to three
hours Saturday, snarling traffic in Albuquerque, shutting down
radio and television stations and forcing the state high school
basketball tournament to halt play.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Hurst, an adoption supervisor with the state Department of
Children, Youth and Families, was in her downtown Albuquerque
office building during the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to use my video camera light to get down seven flights
of stairs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the Four Corners area scorched a transmission line,
which caused electricity to arc, automatically shutting down two
power plants, utility officials said. Most people lost power from
anywhere from 40 minutes to three hours. Outages in a few areas
lasted even longer.
</P>
<P>
   From Las Cruces to Gallup to Albuquerque to Santa Fe to Taos,
power went out shortly before 5 p.m. It came back on, in phases
from south to north, after about 6 p.m. By 9 p.m., the southern
part of the state was fully restored and Albuquerque was about 100
percent restored, utility officials said. By 10:30 p.m., only 80
customers in the Santa Fe area were still without power, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two elderly people called 911 when their oxygen tanks
shut off in Santa Fe. Fire Chief Curtis Lardy said emergency crews
responded to calls from a 100-year-old woman and a 78-year-old man,
among others. He said emergency technicians either restored failed
medical gear or treated patients with portable equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Power to hospitals, which were covered by emergency generators
during the outage, was 100 percent restored by 8 p.m., Public
Service Company of New Mexico spokeswoman Julie Grey said. Backup
generators kicked in at area jails and juvenile detention centers,
which were temporarily locked down, officials in Albuquerque said.
</P>
<P>
   U S West spokeswoman Valerie Santillanes said there were some
problems with phone service but ''they were very light and somewhat
random.''' ''We think it probably had more to do with people
picking up the phone to see if it was working,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state activated its emergency response center, as did the
cities of Gallup and Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said no problems were
reported at the state's airports.
</P>
<P>
   The outage began with several sharp surges and then darkness.
Power came back on in about 15 minutes, then went out again 15
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a fire on one of our major transmission lines from the
San Juan Generating Station (near Farmington) to Albuquerque,''
Grey said. ''It was caused by a grass fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire caused the Four Corners Generating Station to ''trip
off line,'' Grey said. The cause of the 4:45 p.m. blaze was not
determined.
</P>
<P>
   All of Public Service Company of New Mexico's 360,000 customers
statewide were affected by the blackout, the largest outage in the
utility's history, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The same fire caused another utility, Plains Electric, to lose
power from its plant that serves several northern New Mexico
communities. About 187,500 of Plains' 250,000 customers were
affected, said spokeswoman Amy Miller, bringing the total affected
to about 547,500.
</P>
<P>
   The outage left traffic lights out, causing major snarls
throughout Albuquerque. There was also a brief period of
pandemonium at an Albuquerque mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody just started screaming,'' said Rebecca Lies, an
employee at Stacy's Hallmark at the Coronado Center. ''So I got the
flashlight and I said, 'Just follow the light.''' She led 10 to 15
people outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Sutton, assistant manager of Software Etc. at the Winrock
mall, said all the stores had to close and roll down their security
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to kick everybody out of the store,'' he said,
including about 30 customers at an estimated cost in lost business
of $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many radio, television stations and newspaper newsrooms in
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos and Socorro were affected
by the blackout. The Associated Press bureau in Albuquerque was in
the dark, off and on, for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   People with battery-powered television sets were able to watch
the NCAA basketball tournament. The state high school tournament,
however, had to be halted when the lights went out in the Pan
American Center in Las Cruces in southern New Mexico. The game was
completed after about a 40-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Packer, who just moved to Albuquerque from Aurora, Ore.,
was among the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was worried for the fans because I thought people might
panic,'' Packer said, suggesting tournament officials could have
informed people about the situation, but ''they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ko, owner of the Ko Palace restaurant in Albuquerque,
said he stayed open by candlelight throughout the blackout, picking
up extra customers from restaurants that closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're cooking with gas,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Kim Smallwood scored 16 of her 22
points in the second half as Rice, playing in its first NCAA
tournament, upset ninth-ranked UC Santa Barbara 67-64 Saturday
night in the first round of the West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Gauchos had two chances to tie the game in the final 20
seconds after Marla Brumfield and Smallwood missed foul shots, but
Erin Buescher and Nicole Greathouse failed to connect on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a 26-game UCSB winning streak -- longest in the
country. The Gauchos (30-4), seeded fourth in the West, hadn't lost
since Dec. 4. UCSB had won 25 straight at home.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, the 13th-seeded Lady Owls and their handful
of fans in the capacity crowd of 5,824 at the Thunderdome
celebrated on the court as the stunned UCSB fans sat silent.
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield scored 16 points and Kirra Jordan had 15 before
fouling out with 1:51 left for the Lady Owls (22-9), who meet North
Carolina on Monday night for a berth in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   LaQuanda Barksdale scored 16 of her 23 points in the second half
to lead the fifth-seeded Tar Heels past 12th-seeded Maine 62-57
earlier Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greathouse led UCSB with 17 points and 11 rebounds, and Buescher
had 16 points and 16 rebounds. But it wasn't enough for the
Gauchos, who made just 34 percent of their field goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Smallwood, a senior, was averaging 7.6 points entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   A three-point play by Brumfield with 6:15 remaining capped a 9-2
run by the Lady Owls, putting them ahead 56-50, and they led the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Gauchos got as close as one point on a short jumper by
Kristi Rohr with 2:40 to play, but Brumfield scored her team's
final four points.
</P>
<P>
   Greathouse, a junior averaging 6.1 points, scored her team's
first 10 in less than four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Gauchos, fourth in the country in scoring with an
81.6-point average, quickly cooled off, managing only eight points
in the next 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Owls played UCSB on even terms throughout the first
half, which ended with the Gauchos ahead 28-27 despite making only
six of 23 shots.

By The Associated Press	   Louisiana Tech began its final NCAA women's
tournament run under
coach Leon Barmore with authority.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tamicha Jackson had 24 points and Ayana Walker had 14 points, 10
rebounds and five blocked shots as No. 3 Louisiana Tech routed
Alcorn State 95-53 Saturday in the first round of the Midwest
Regional at Ruston, La.
</P>
<P>
   The game began the final phase of Barmore's coaching career at
Tech. He announced Friday that he would step down as coach after
the season, ending an 18-year run in which he posted the highest
winning percentage (.872) in major college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victory improved his record to 518-76.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said defense was the key to the win for Tech (29-2).
Alcorn State finished 22-9.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach is always on us about defense,'' Walker, who played just
22 minutes, said. ''I thought in the second half my defense was
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech's relentless pressure held Alcorn State to 32 percent
shooting for the game and just 6-of-25 from the field in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made them come out to get shots and face us in the second
half,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, one of two teams to have played in every NCAA tournament,
made short work of an Alcorn State team making its debut.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people will look at this score and say, 'Well, it was
their first tournament,' but we were never scared,'' Alcorn State
coach Shirley Walker said. ''We got beat by 40-some, but overall I
don't feel bad about the way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other first-round game at Ruston, Vanderbilt beat Kansas
71-69 in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Jillian Danker and Ashley McElhiney each hit a free throw in the
final 30 seconds of double OT to lift the Commodores (21-12). After
McElhiney's free throw with 2.6 seconds left, Kansas had a chance
to win but Lynn Pride's 3-point attempt bounced off the back rim at
the buzzer.
</P>

China To Wait on Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's government announced Saturday that it would wait to
see how Taiwan's new president handles relations between the island and the
mainland, despite its earlier warnings that a Chen Shui-bian victory could lead
to war. In a statement issued by state news media, Beijing repeated its
assertion that Chen's election did not change Taiwan's status as ''an
inseparable part of China.'' ''We should listen to what the new leader in Taiwan
says and watch what he does. We will observe where he will lead cross-Strait
relations,'' said the statement, attributed to the Taiwan Office of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embarked Saturday on a long-delayed
journey to South Asia ready to caution India and Pakistan to curb their
nuclear-weapons competition. Clinton canceled an expected formal departure
statement. ''Gotta Go,'' he shouted at well wishers as he walked from the White
House to Marine I, the presidential helicopter, his arm draped around the
shoulders of his daughter, Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham. The
first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, passed up the trip because of her campaign

Power Goes Out in New Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A 500-acre grass fire knocked out electricity to
nearly 550,000 New Mexico customers for up to three hours Saturday, snarling
traffic in Albuquerque, shutting down radio and television stations and forcing
the state high school basketball tournament to halt play. From Las Cruces to
Gallup to Albuquerque to Santa Fe to Taos, power went out shortly before 5 p.m.
It came back on, in phases from south to north, after about 6 p.m. By 9 p.m.,
the southern part of the state was fully restored and Albuquerque was about 100
percent restored, utility officials said.

Report: Light Eyed in Swissair Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investigators say a pilot's map light in the cockpit ceiling
in the 1998 crash of a Swissair plane off Nova Scotia could have been a source
of ignition, The New York Times reported Saturday. Canadian investigators were
sorting through the debris of Swissair Flight 111 to try to find the map light
from that plane, Jim Harris, spokesman for the Canadian Transportation Safety
Board, told the Times. The cause of the crash that killed 229 people has yet to
be determined. Boeing, which makes the MD-11 model planes, is urging airlines
using that type of aircraft to check the lights often until they can be
replaced.

Report: Criminal Probe in Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- What began months ago as an inquiry into maintenance
practices at an Alaska Airlines facility has become a criminal investigation
into the deadly crash of Flight 261, The Seattle Times reported Saturday. No
criminal wrongdoing has been established in the Jan. 31 crash off the coast of
California that killed 88 people, the Times said. The criminal investigation
grew out of a 15-month-old inquiry into practices at Alaska's maintenance
facility at Oakland, Calif., the Times said. In that inquiry, a grand jury in
San Francisco is investigating whether supervisors signed for repairs that
weren't done or that they weren't authorized to approve.

   SEATTLE (AP) - Scottie Pippen's two free throws with 7.7 seconds left and

97-96 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics on Saturday night. Pippen inbounded
the ball with 16.6 seconds left and received a return pass, then drove from the
left side and was fouled by Gary Payton. Barry had a wide-open 3-point attempt
from the corner but missed badly with three seconds left. Time ran out before

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mark Vershaw scored 15 points as the eighth-seeded
Wisconsin Badgers upset No. 1 seed Arizona 66-59 on Saturday to advance to the
final 16 for the first time since the NCAA tournament went to its current
format. ''It's indescribable to come in as the eighth seed and beat Arizona,''
Wisconsin's Andy Kowske said. ''We started the Big Ten 1-4 and to go to the
Sweet 16 is unbelievable.'' The Wildcats (27-7) are the first No. 1 seed in two
years to lose in the second round, where they hadn't been beaten since 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Wisconsin stopped Arizona, Gonzaga knocked off St. John's and
Purdue beat Oklahoma to make it a clean sweep of the top three
seeds in the suddenly wide-open regional.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Vershaw scored 15 points as eighth-seeded Wisconsin upset
top-seeded Arizona 66-59 on Saturday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   On Arizona's home floor in Tucson, Matt Santangelo scored 26
points as No. 10 Gonzaga beat No. 2 St. John's 82-76, and Jaraan
Cornell scored 13 of his 15 points in the final 9:30 in No. 6
Purdue's 66-62 victory over No. 3 Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin successfully slowed the pace against speedy Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure I can adequately describe how good we feel or how
proud I am of this team,'' coach Dick Bennett said. ''They accepted
the game plan and employed it as close to perfect as humanly
possible. To defend a good shooting team like Arizona is something
I'll remember for a long, long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers limited the Wildcats to 39 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a tough lesson to learn,'' Arizona coach Lute Olson
said. ''It was very obvious that the better team won this game from
the standpoint of maturity and toughness.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Linton scored nine of his 14 points in the final 2:57
for the Badgers (20-13), who won two games in an NCAA tournament
for the first time since winning the national championship in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (27-7), the 1997 champion, is the first No. 1 seed to
lose in the second round since Rhode Island beat Kansas in the 1998
Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Gilbert Arenas led the Wildcats with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the regional semifinals Thursday in Albuquerque, N.M.,
Wisconsin will face fourth-seeded LSU, and Gonzaga will play
Purdue. LSU beat Texas 72-67 in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest Regional semifinals in Auburn Hills, Mich.,
Michigan State will play Syracuse, and Iowa State will face UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, Michigan State beat Utah 73-61 and Syracuse edged
Kentucky 52-50. In Minneapolis, Iowa State beat Auburn 79-60 and
UCLA routed Maryland 105-70.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, which reached the West final a year ago as the 10th
seed, shouldn't be considered a sleeper anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still fighting for respect,'' Santangelo said. ''Any
label you put on us means we're still playing and we're still
winning. That's what counts right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo made 6-of-10 3-pointers, including three in the final
eight minutes as the Bulldogs (26-8) pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Barkley led St. John's (25-8) with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue reached the final 16 for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McQuay led the Boilermakers (23-9) with 16 points. Nolan
Johnson had 20 points for Oklahoma (27-7).
</P>
<P>
   Play resumes Sunday in the East and South regionals.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, Temple plays Seton Hall, and Oklahoma State faces
Pepperdine in Buffalo, N.Y., and Duke plays Kansas, and Illinois
faces Florida in Winston-Salem, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, Cincinnati plays Tulsa, and Ohio State faces Miami
in Nashville, Tenn., and Stanford plays North Carolina, and
Tennessee faces Connecticut in Birmingham, Ala.
LSU 72, Texas 67:
</P>
<P>
   Stromile Swift had 23 points and 10 rebounds and Brian Beshara
came up with a big steal with just over a minute to play for LSU.
The fourth-seeded Tigers (28-5) have won 12 of their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was tied at 60 at the three-minute mark, but LSU scored the
next six points. Bright split the Texas defense for a layup, Swift
scored over Texas' Gabe Muoneke, and Beshara made two free throws
after intercepting a pass in the Longhorns' backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Wagner led Texas (24-9) with 19 points.
Midwest Regional:
At Cleveland:
Michigan St. 73, Utah 61:
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves scored 21 points as top-seeded Michigan State
rallied in the second half to beat Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State will face Syracuse in the regional semifinals
Thursday in Auburn Hills, Mich., about an 80-mile drive from the
Spartans' East Lansing campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, the senior point guard who turned down NBA millions for
a chance to win an NCAA title, scored 13 points in the second half
when Michigan State (28-7) overcame a six-point deficit and blitzed
the Utes (23-9) with a 27-7 run.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Hutson added 19 points for Michigan State, two victories
away from getting back to a second straight Final Four. Hanno
Mottola led Utah with 16 points.
Syracuse 52, Kentucky 50:
</P>
<P>
   Preston Shumpert's jumper with 37 seconds left was the
difference for the fourth-seeded Orangemen (26-5).
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, which beat Syracuse in the 1996 title game, set up its
offense after three late timeouts and a foul that stopped the clock
with 5.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   With the Orangemen bunched inside in a tight zone, Keith Bogans
drove the lane and tossed up an off-balance 10-footer that came up
short. Tayshaun Prince missed on a tip as the horn sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Shumpert finished with 12 points. Etan Thomas had nine points,
10 rebounds and three blocked shots before fouling out with 3:46
left. Bogans and Jamaal Magloire each had 12 points for Kentucky
(23-10).

Iowa St. 79, Auburn 60:
</P>
<P>
   All-American forward Marcus Fizer scored 16 of his 22 points in
the second half and had 12 rebounds for second-seeded Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Stevie Johnson added 21 points for the Cyclones (31-5), who won
the school's first regular-season conference title in 55 years and
set a school record for victories after being picked to finish last
in the Big 12. Marquis Daniels led Auburn (24-10) with 12 points.
UCLA 105, Maryland 70:
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which barely made the tournament field after a 19-11
regular season, won its eighth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson had 17 points and a school-record 16 assists as the
sixth-seeded Bruins connected on six fearsome alley-oops and a
school-record 14 3-pointers. Lonnie Baxter had 22 points and 10
rebounds for the third-seeded Terrapins.

<HEADLINE> North Carolina 62, Maine 57  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- LaQuanda Barksdale scored 16 of her
23 points in the second half Saturday night as North Carolina
rallied for a 62-57 victory over Maine in the first round of the
omen's NCAA West Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth-seeded Tar Heels (19-12), who trailed by as many as 11
points early in the second half, next face Rice, which upset No. 9
UC Santa Barbara 67-64 Saturday night, on Monday night for a berth
in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Maine, whose coach, Joanne Palombo-McCallie, made the trip west
despite being eight months pregnant, finished the season 20-11.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Cassidy, who led the 12th-seeded Black Bears with 30
points and nine rebounds, scored four straight points to tie the
game 50-all with 5:21 left, but the Tar Heels scored the next five
points to go ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Teasley's 3-point shot with 1:35 to play gave North
Carolina a 58-52 lead. Cassidy scored five straight to cut the Tar
Heels' lead to one point with 43.4 seconds to go, but Maine
wouldn't score again.
</P>
<P>
   Teasley set up Barksdale for a layup with 19.7 seconds to play,
and Teasley added two free throws 10 seconds later to complete the
scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, who also had 13 rebounds, scored nine straight points
to give North Carolina a 43-42 lead -- its first of the game --
midway through the second half. The Tar Heels never trailed after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Higgins came off the bench to score 16 points and Teasley
had 14 points and eight assists for the Tar Heels, who have won
seven of their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 71.5 points, the Tar Heels scored only eight before
Barksdale's three-point play with 6:26 to play in the first half
ended a scoring drought of over six minutes and cut Maine's lead to
16-11.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks mainly to Cassidy's 15 points and six rebounds, the Black
Bears led 24-20 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Power Goes Out in New Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Nearly 550,000 New Mexico customers
lost electricity for up to three hours after a 500-acre grass fire
shut down two power plants, snarling traffic in Albuquerque,
silencing radio and television stations and forcing the state high
school basketball tournament to halt play.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the Four Corners area Saturday scorched a
transmission line, which caused electricity to arc, automatically
shutting down the power plants, utility officials said. Most people
lost power from 40 minutes to three hours, while outages in a few
areas lasted even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the 4:45 p.m. blaze was not determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to use my video camera light to get down seven flights
of stairs,'' said Candy Hurst, a state adoption supervisor who was
in her downtown Albuquerque office building during the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Power went out shortly before 5 p.m. from Las Cruces in southern
New Mexico to the northern communities of Gallup and Taos. It came
back on, in phases from south to north, after about 6 p.m. Power
was fully restored to Albuquerque and the southern part of the
state by 9 p.m., utility officials said. By 10:30 p.m., only 80
Santa Fe-area customers remained without power.
</P>
<P>
   All of Public Service Company of New Mexico's 360,000 customers
statewide were affected by the blackout, the largest outage in the
utility's history, spokeswoman Julie Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire on one of the utility's transmission lines from the San
Juan Generating Station, near Farmington, to Albuquerque caused the
Four Corners Generating Station to ''trip off line,'' Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   Another utility, Plains Electric, lost power from its plant that
serves several northern New Mexico communities. About 187,500 of
its 250,000 customers were blacked out, said spokeswoman Amy
Miller, bringing the total affected to about 547,500.
</P>
<P>
   Power to hospitals, which were covered by emergency generators
during the outage, was restored by 8 p.m., Grey said. Backup
generators kicked in at area jails and juvenile detention centers,
which were temporarily locked down, officials in Albuquerque said.
</P>
<P>
   U S West spokeswoman Valerie Santillanes said there were some
problems with phone service but ''they were very light and somewhat
random.'''
</P>
<P>
   The outage began with several sharp surges and then darkness.
Power came back on in about 15 minutes, then went out again 15
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights in Albuquerque were out, causing major snarls
throughout the city. There was also a brief period of pandemonium
at an Albuquerque mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody just started screaming,'' said Rebecca Lies, an
employee at Stacy's Hallmark at the Coronado Center. ''So I got the
flashlight and I said, 'Just follow the light.''' She led 10 to 15
people outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Sutton, assistant manager of Software Etc. at the Winrock
mall, said all the stores had to close and roll down their security
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to kick everybody out of the store,'' he said,
including about 30 customers at an estimated cost in lost business
of $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many radio, television stations and newspaper newsrooms in
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos and Socorro were affected
by the blackout. The Associated Press bureau in Albuquerque was in
the dark, off and on, for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   People with battery-powered television sets were able to watch
the NCAA basketball tournament. The state high school tournament,
however, had to be halted when the lights went out in the Pan
American Center in Las Cruces. The game was completed after about a
40-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso, Texas, also had a citywide outage for about 30 minutes
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ko, owner of the Ko Palace restaurant in Albuquerque,
said he stayed open by candlelight throughout the blackout, picking
up extra customers from restaurants that closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're cooking with gas,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Slaying Suspect in Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By MARTY NILAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Police negotiators continued to talk Sunday
with a heavily armed murder suspect who took his ex-girlfriend's
mother and two others hostage two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations and newspapers reported that Joseph
Palczynski repeatedly asked to talk to his former girlfriend, Tracy
Whitehead. Police say he kidnapped her briefly before allegedly
killing four people in a two-day shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The (Baltimore) Sun reported Sunday that police met Palczynski's
demand for food, sending a robot to the apartment of Whitehead's
mother, Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not comment on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been in constant contact with Mr. Palczynski
throughout the night,'' Cpl. Vickie Warehime said early Sunday.
''Our main focus is to have this come to a peaceful end.''
</P>
<P>
   A psychiatrist was helping negotiators, Warehime said. Police
have said Palczynski has bipolar disorder, often called manic
depression, which causes extreme mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began Friday evening, when Palczynski shot his way
into the apartment east of Baltimore and took Whitehead's mother,
her boyfriend, Andy McCord, and his 12-year-old son, Brad, hostage.
Neighbors said Lynn Whitehead had returned home Friday after
staying with relatives during the manhunt for Palczynski.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that Lynn Whitehead's
sister-in-law, Donna Collins, called the apartment minutes after
Palczynski broke in and he threatened to kill the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I want is Tracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends say Palczynski has said in the past that
he would shoot himself or make police shoot him rather than go back
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Police were not allowing anyone in or out of the neighborhood.
Residents shut out of their homes were offered shelter at an
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old electrician had broken into another home earlier
Friday, tied up the occupants and stole two long guns and a
handgun, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been on the run since March 7, when police say he
kidnapped his girlfriend, killed the couple she was staying with
and a neighbor. A fourth person was killed the next day by a stray
bullet as Palczynski allegedly carjacked another vehicle, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped unharmed. Police would not disclose her
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been in a similar situation before. In 1992, he
kept police in Idaho at bay for 16 hours following a domestic
violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced out with
tear gas.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments in Japan Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Underlining the recent shift toward global
business, foreign investment in Japan more than tripled to $13
billion last year compared to 1998, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, citing the Bank of Japan, said that the pace of
investment gathered momentum in 1999, after posting record highs
for the past two years. Foreign investments last year totaled 3.4
times the 1998 figure, which stood at about $3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank attributes the steep increase to the
streamlining of government regulations and the fall in land prices,
which has brought down the cost of doing business in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan was closed Sunday and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The global realignment in industries and restructuring by
Japanese companies also created opportunities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The auto, telecommunications, banking and insurance sectors saw
some of the biggest deals.
</P>
<P>
   Renault SA bought into Nissan Motor Co. while British
Telecommunications PLC and AT&AMP;T Corp. took stakes in Japan Telecom
Co.
</P>
<P>
   Manulife Financial, Canada's largest life insurer, brought
Daihyaku Mutual Life Insurance Co. under its wing.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas direct investment by Japanese companies declined for
the first time since 1993, dropping 17.6 percent to $24 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Rate Drops for Erie Catfish  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- It's a decadelong scientific whodunit.
</P>
<P>
   For years, researchers tried to figure out why so many bullhead
in Presque Isle Bay had tumors. Now, they're trying to unravel a
twist that is just as mysterious: Why has the cancer rate in the
catfish dropped so precipitously since the late 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   It might be the millions of dollars Erie has spent to cut sewage
overflows. Or maybe it's that some of the big industrial polluters
have closed. Or it could just be evolution: The catfish are
adapting naturally to cope with the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could go on and on and on about all these theories,'' said
Penn State's Eric Obert. ''It's a pretty complicated case.''
</P>
<P>
   The bay is formed by a thin sand spit reaching into Lake Erie
from the industrial city. Long polluted by direct discharge of
industrial sewage and municipal sewer overflows, the bay is in the
process of being cleaned up. The city has spent millions to upgrade
a wastewater treatment plant and millions more to stop the
overflows that sent untreated sewage into the bay during heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
   The city was up for a national anti-pollution award, and Erie
might be able take credit for the improved health of the resident
bullheads, too -- if, that is, anyone knew what caused the tumors in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't really have a clue why,'' said Obert, who runs the
region's Sea Grant program, an arm of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The catfish, researchers have found, are a good tool for
tracking pollution. If the water isn't safe for the bottom-feeding
bullheads, it might be a warning sign for humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bullheads are probably kind of a canary in a coal mine,'' said
Jack Vanden Heuvel, a Penn State molecular toxicologist. ''They're
a sentinel kind of animal to tell us if there is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest research on the cancerous catfish suggests what was
assumed from the start: Polluted sediment is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Vanden Heuvel examined 40 sediment samples collected last year
and found ''dioxin-like activity.'' Any number of thousands of
industrial pollutants could be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But if the pollution is still there, why is the tumor rate down?
Vanden Heuvel doesn't know. He still needs to test the samples from
the early 1990s to determine whether toxin levels have decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could see if the dioxin-like response is stronger in the
past than it is now, which would be a sign that the area is
cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other possibility,'' he added, ''is that the area is not
cleaning up, but the fish have evolved. It's not necessarily that
the bay is getting better, but the fish are getting better at
dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like so many theories researchers have entertained, his may not
stand up.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 1980s when anglers first started noticing the tumors.
The bullhead is ugly as it is, but in cancerous fish, red bumps
clung to the barbules, their lips turned puffy and red, black spots
dotted their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Obert looked at 50 fish from the bay. An astounding 80
percent had skin tumors. Ten of the worst-looking fish were sent
off to a lab in Maryland: Four of them had liver tumors, too. Two
years later, a study of 110 bullheads found that 61 percent had
skin cancer, 22 percent had liver tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, a new study found that just 10 percent of
bullheads had liver tumors. In 1997, the rate fell to the single
digits, the normal range in the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are still grasping for an explanation to explain
that decline.
</P>
<P>
   The first chemical to be investigated was a cancer-causing
compound called nitrosamine. The bay had high levels of nitrogen
after hot effluent from a power plant killed off thousands of
gizzard shad. That plant has closed, but the connection to the
cancer is murky.
</P>
<P>
   Then they looked at PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
produced by the burning of fossil fuels. But catfish with high PAH
rates didn't necessarily have tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they considered a virus. Then they looked for testing
errors.
</P>
<P>
   No perfect answer popped up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be that all of them are problems,'' Obert said.
''That's been my frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Baumann, an Ohio State professor, related a story about how
clams off a pristine Maine coast developed tumors. Nobody knew why,
until they discovered a nearby blueberry farmer who sprayed his
fields with pesticides, then washed his trucks in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a cause,'' Baumann said. ''They just don't know what
it is.''

<HEADLINE> Three Missing After Frat House Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Three Bloomsburg University students were
unaccounted for following an fire early Sunday at a fraternity
house near campus.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Tau Kappa Epsilon house were asleep when the
fire broke out about 6 a.m., said university spokesman Jim
Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   Three residents managed to get out safely. It wasn't immediately
clear whether three other residents were in the two-story wood
house at the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we're in the process of not only sifting through
the remains (of the house) but sifting out the facts as well,''
Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire destroyed the off-campus house, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia County coroner was on the scene and fire officials
were investigating the cause.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Seek To Calm LatAm Worries  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The Spanish corporate giants investing heavily in
Latin America
are striving to avoid any public backlash against the region's
former colonial power.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They try to keep local executives in charge of the day-to-day
running of newly acquired firms and continue to list their shares
on local stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Even names can be important. When the energy conglomerate Repsol
bought the Argentine energy group YPF last year for $13 billion, it
called the resulting company Repsol-YPF in an effort to reassure
Argentines that Repsol's gain was not their loss.
</P>
<P>
   There have been stumbles, of course. After acquiring phone
operations in Brazil, Telefonica angered customers for a time by
sending out bills written in Spanish rather than Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are mixed results. Peruvians accustomed to
waiting up to 15 years for a telephone to be installed were
delighted when Telefonica took over the old state monopoly and cut
the time to a month. But people were angered that the cost of local
calls tripled.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an underlying fear of some Latin Americans that
they are losing economic sovereignty. When Aguas de Barcelona
bought the Emos waterworks in Chile, politicians complained that
yielding control over something as essential as water was a new
form of colonialism.

<HEADLINE> Marc Anthony Forced To Cancel Gig  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- An adverse reaction to medication for a sore
throat put Latin singer Marc Anthony on the sidelines, canceling
his St. Louis concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been taking medication for his throat for a few weeks
now,'' publicist Jennifer Nieman said Sunday from Atlanta. But on
Saturday, he apparently had a reaction because he took the
medication on an empty stomach, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony spent Saturday night in a St. Louis hospital. Saturday's
missed concert in St. Louis will be rescheduled, as will a
performance that was scheduled Sunday night in Atlanta, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony is expected to be back on stage Tuesday in Washington
and Thursday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''His voice is fine,'' Nieman said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's first salsa album was released in 1993. His third
album won a 1999 Grammy for best tropical Latin performance. This
year he was nominated for best male pop vocal performance for ''I
Need to Know,'' but did not win.

<HEADLINE> Was Greta Garbo Really Alone?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Was Greta Garbo really alone, or wasn't she?
</P>
<P>
   Her letters to her friend and rumored lover, the writer and
socialite Mercedes de Acosta, will be unsealed for the first time
on April 15, the 10th anniversary of Garbo's death.
</P>
<P>
   The 55 letters have been in the archives of the Rosenbach Museum
in Philadelphia for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   De Acosta, a feminist and fashion maven who died in 1968,
claimed she had trysts with actress Marlene Dietrich, dancer
Isadora Duncan and Garbo. But Garbo's family and some of the screen
legend's biographers are doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two camps,'' says Karen Swenson, author of the 1997
biography ''Garbo: A Life Apart.'' ''On one side, there is Garbo's
family, who think these letters probably don't say anything. And on
the other, there are gay activists and historians who think they
say everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Garbo letters will be on exhibit at the Rosenbach from April
18 through June 4.

<HEADLINE> Pope's Landing Area Vandalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- On the eve of Pope John Paul II's visit to the
Holy Land, suspected right-wing Jewish extremists spray-painted
swastikas and anti-pope slogans on the Jerusalem helipad where the
papal helicopter is to land, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican flag was defaced with red paint and eight lights
were smashed, police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said. Swastikas and
slogans such as ''Pope Out'' and ''Where were you during the
Holocaust?'' were spray-painted on the helipad's paved surface.
</P>
<P>
   The helipad is located on Mount Scopus, overlooking the walled
Old City, where the pope will visit the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Judaism's holiest site, the
Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The pope arrives in Jordan on Monday, beginning a six-day visit
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect that the vandalism was the work of ''right-wing
Jewish extremists,'' Ben-Ruby said. Although polls indicate a
generally high level of public support in Israel for the papal
visit, some extremist groups have expressed opposition to the visit
and called for demonstrations while it is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Jewish groups are critical of the Vatican for the
failure of Pope Pius XII to condemn the Nazis while the Holocaust
was taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, himself a Holocaust
survivor, is to meet the pope and has urged Israelis to welcome
him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, John Paul apologized for persecution of the Jews by
Christians in the past, and has made a number of statements
promoting reconciliation between the two faiths. Rabbi Lau said the
apology was a step forward, but that the pope ought to have
acknowledged the role of the church in the persecution.

<HEADLINE> Countries Talk About Banning DDT  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Pesticides such as DDT may pose a danger to humans
and animals, but for developing nations that use it to kill
mosquitoes and prevent malaria, the negatives don't always outweigh
the good DDT can do by saving millions of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Giving financial and technical assistance to countries so they
can be weaned from substances like DDT will take center stage
starting Monday, as negotiators from more than 100 countries resume
talks in Bonn on a global treaty to ban DDT and other of the
world's deadliest environmental poisons.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the fourth round of negotiations on a ban of the
''dirty dozen'' chemicals, a list of substances that are deemed the
most harmful because they break down extremely slowly and can
accumulate up the food chain. The chemicals, known as persistent
organic pollutants, have been linked to cancer, birth defects and
other genetic abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   A total ban on the chemicals worldwide is the only way to keep
them out of the earth's environment, because they are passed on so
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The next and last round of negotiations is scheduled for South
Africa in December, meaning this six-day session is critical in
ensuring work on the treaty can be finished. Leaders hope to have
the text of the treaty in shape before the negotiations end
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Getting assistance to the developing countries is crucial ''so
that this can really be a global effort and not just an effort of
developed countries,'' said Brooks Yeager, deputy assistant
secretary for the environment at the State Department and head of
the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Canada has given the most significant financial pledge,
making available $13 million in its federal budget to help
developing countries limit the release of the substances. Other
nations are also expected to start making their commitments known
at this meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of countries need the reassurance that if they take
on new and additional obligations under this treaty that there will
be some assistance,'' said Jim Willis, director of the U.N.
Environment Program's chemicals division.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have suggested alternatives to DDT that are
also as cheap and have proven successful in experiments in killing
malaria-carrying mosquitoes. However, the chemical is still
endorsed by the World Health Organization for that use, despite a
ban in 34 countries and severe restrictions in 34 others.
</P>
<P>
   The ''dirty dozen'' chemicals also include PCBs and other
pesticides that were first used decades ago, and also the
byproducts of chemical reactions known as dioxins and furans.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups have accused countries led by the
United States of trying to weaken the treaty's provisions on these
byproducts in order to protect industry. The United States insists
it has already taken strong measures against all the chemicals on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this treaty would eventually ban those substances it would
impact not only the developing countries but also the
industrialized world and mainly the industrialized world, because
they are the main producers of those dioxins,'' said Wytze Van Der
Naald, a member of the Greenpeace delegation that participates as
observers at the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty will eventually move beyond just the ''dirty dozen''
chemicals when it comes into force likely by 2004. Negotiators are
working out how to add new chemicals under the ban.

<HEADLINE> Police Accused of Erasing Tickets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two police officers were arrested Sunday on
suspicion of erasing traffic violation records, only weeks after a
top official at the same department in northern Japan resigned amid
allegations of lying and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests follow a string of other scandals among Japanese
police, including the use of amphetamines, sexual misconduct and
hazing. The incidents have shaken public trust in the police and
prompted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to criticize the nation's
police force.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent and head of traffic operations Norio Osawa, 65,
and assistant inspector Nozomu Sonehara, 50, of the Niigata
prefectural (state) police, were arrested Sunday and fired on
suspicion that they erased computer records in October of
violations by a 45-year-old man, Niigata police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police denied local news reports that Osawa is suspected of
having received $940 in gift certificates from the man, saying
neither officer had received money.
</P>
<P>
   A national lawmaker said later Sunday that one of his
secretaries was being questioned by police over allegations that he
made inquiries with police on behalf of the man, according to Kyodo
News agency.
</P>
<P>
   Niigata is located about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Niigata police chief Koji Kobayashi resigned amid
criticism that his department had lied about finding a woman who
had been kidnapped and held captive for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Kobayashi came under fire for approving the falsification of a
report on the discovery of Fusako Sano, 19, which claimed police
liberated her when in fact hospital workers took her into custody
after visiting Sato's home. The force was also criticized for
ignoring calls for help from the health workers.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President To Quit Party  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Storming the Nationalist Party's
headquarters, a stone-throwing crowd demanded -- and got -- President
Lee Teng-hui's promise Sunday to quit as the party's leader, one
day after its humiliating election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands of protesters blamed Lee for fielding a
weak candidate who was trounced by the opposition in Saturday's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The vote will bring to power an untested leader, Chen Shui-bian,
who some fear could spark a devastating war with Taiwan's longtime
rival, China, through his party's support for the island's formal
independence. The two sides split amid civil war in 1949, and China
insists Taiwan must eventually reunify with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of about 3,000 chanted ''Step down president!'' and
surrounded the Nationalists' headquarters in downtown Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Some smashed the windows of limousines bringing party members to
the building for an emergency meeting with Lee to respond to Vice
President Lien Chan's loss in Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   An angry mob chased senior party adviser Hsu Li-teh down the
sidewalk, kicking, punching and beating him with poles. They
knocked him to the ground, but he was able to stand up and scurry
into the building.
</P>
<P>
   The violence and chaos were rare for Taiwan, where political
violence is almost unheard of and heated street protests have grown
increasingly rare as full democracy has taken root over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Nationalists losing the presidency for the first
time in Taiwanese history, the island's young democracy headed into
the unexplored and voters tried to make sense of what the loss
meant for their party's future. They also looked for someone to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't get us wrong. We respect Chen's victory, because that's
what democracy is all about. But things have to change,'' said a
bank employee who would give only his surname, Yang.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, which left several people with minor injuries,
contrasted strongly with the tone of Chen's triumphant first day as
president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to embark on the awesome task of forming a new,
minority government, Chen spent Sunday visiting government agencies
and offering thanks at temples and to his supporters, while
avoiding any mention of specifics on China.
</P>
<P>
   In a deeply symbolic round of political ancestor worship, Chen
stood at the grave of Huang Hsin-chieh, an early leader of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, burning incense and
telling the ''founding father'' of Taiwan's democracy about the
''great victory yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen and the vice president-elect, pioneering feminist Annette
Lu, held out a conciliatory gesture toward the Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will exert all effort to learn from the success and
experience of Lee Teng-hui to lead Taiwan and the entire Taiwanese
people,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also praised Lee for his plan to form a small transitional
working group to oversee the change in government that comes in
May. The Nationalists will relinquish power for the first time
since Gen. Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan after losing mainland
China to Mao Tse-tung's Communists in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old Lee presided over Taiwan's evolution from an
authoritarian state to a democracy with direct presidential
elections during his 12 years as the island's leader. Lee won the
first election in 1996. He will leave office May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's accomplishments meant little to many in the crowd outside
party headquarters. Most left by late evening, but a few hundred
stayed in the area until early Monday, demanding that Lee
immediately give up his party post.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lee Teng-hui sold out the people. He sold out the entire
country. It's time to go,'' said 44-year-old banker Cathy Chan, who
said she hadn't slept since Chen won the vote.
</P>
<P>
   After the election defeat, Lee, who is famous for his
stubbornness, said he would not step down from his party post. But
by late Sunday evening, he changed his mind and party spokesman
Huang Huei-chen delivered the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''To show our determination for reform after the major election
setback, we will form a reform committee to strengthen our
organization and join forces with the public,'' Huang said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee plans to resign in September, along with other senior party
members. The president ordered the formation of a committee that
would preside over the naming a new party leader, Huang said. Lien
also offered to resign as the party's vice chairman but Lee asked
him to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's victory was largely a result of a split in the party
caused by the expulsion of a popular Nationalist leader, James
Soong, who refused to support Lien and launched his own independent
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters who clashed with police Sunday supported
Soong, who finished a close second, and blamed Lee for causing the
party's schism.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos in the Nationalist ranks widened as Soong announced late
in the afternoon that he would form his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will forge the views of the majority Taiwanese and turn
them into the truly stabilizing power of Taiwan,'' Soong told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has long lived in the shadow of China's threats and the
international community was on guard for signs of instability
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   China has said it would wait to see how Chen would handle
relations, but the election results ''will not change the status of
Taiwan as a part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   A conflict could quickly involve the United States, which has
hinted it would defend the island if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Film Avoids Anti-Abortion Wrath  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Maybe it's the air of lush nostalgia. Maybe
it's the orphans' cherubic faces. Maybe it's Michael Caine's
paternal charm and Tobey Maguire's boyish wonderment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, ''The Cider House Rules'' has largely
managed to remain below abortion opponents' radar scope, despite
featuring characters who clearly favor a woman's right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, nominated for best picture and six other awards for
next Sunday's Oscars, has taken a few hits in anti-abortion
circles, including Christian broadcasts and publications. As a
whole, however, abortion foes have not protested particularly
loudly about ''Cider House.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people haven't bothered to watch it,'' said Pat Sheils,
office manager for the Legal Center for the Defense of Life, an
anti-abortion group in Morristown, N.J. ''Why bother to call
attention to it?''
</P>
<P>
   That surprises some abortion-rights advocates. ''You would think
they would latch on to it and make a huge deal out of it,'' said
Sandra Jordan, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. ''It is kind
of surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers and people on both sides of the issue cite a
number of reasons that ''Cider House'' may have avoided the
shellacking that conservative religious groups handed such movies
as ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' or last year's ''Dogma.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it's based on John Irving's bestseller, which rankled
abortion opponents when it was published in 1985, ''Cider House''
was marketed as a gentle coming-of-age story, with film trailers
that harked back to a nostalgia-drenched image of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire stars as Homer Wells, protege of Dr. Wilbur Larch
(Caine), who runs the combination orphanage-abortion mill where
Homer and dozens of Norman-Rockwell orphans live in rural Maine.
Caine is nominated for best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Homer resists Larch's arguments in favor of abortion, though the
youth is shown dutifully incinerating medical waste, presumably
fetal remains. After Homer ventures into the world, he finds
himself agonizing over an incestuous pregnancy and opts to perform
an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The movie somehow tries to say the killing of babies is a
godly activity, a blessed activity,'' said Ted Baehr, founder of
Movieguide, which highlights Christian and family themes in
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Movieguide criticized ''Cider House'' in its Oscar preview,
calling it an ''absolutely despicable movie'' whose incinerator
scene evoked ''shades of Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Movieguide gave negative ratings to all five best-picture
nominees and found two as objectionable as ''Cider House'' --
''American Beauty'' because it ''redefines beauty as ugliness'' and
''The Sixth Sense'' because it ''lies about the afterlife and
promotes spiritism.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents generally have stayed mum about ''Cider
House,'' though, because it has not been hugely popular and is not
an ''outright attack on people's faith,'' Baehr said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think it's a movie that evokes that sort of
response,'' Baehr said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, nominated for a screenplay Oscar, and filmmaker Lasse
Hallstrom, nominated for best director, toned down the abortion
issue for the movie version, Hallstrom said, because of his film
style and not out of worries about any backlash from abortion
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom, who comes from Sweden and staunchly favors abortion
rights, said the message remains clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just my way of telling stories -- more soft-spoken,'' he
said. ''If I want to convey and convince, I would rather lower my
voice than be loud about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''It doesn't draw conclusions. The audience is left to
draw them.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters have embraced the film. The day
before the Oscars, Planned Parenthood is giving Irving and the
movie its annual Maggie Award, honoring efforts that support
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cider House'' grossed $23 million before the Oscar nods last
month. The nominations have helped double its gross, respectable
but still modest by Hollywood standards.

<HEADLINE> Election Prompts Tension in Senegal  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- Peace and democracy, rare treasures in
Africa, were tested in runoff elections Sunday pitting a longtime
president accused of corruption against a fiery opposition leader
who warns of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years of rule by a party that for the angry poor
represents the rich elite, Senegal's reputation as one of the
continent's most stable, liberal nations was hanging in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   The vote featured a battle of personalities -- a reserved
incumbent President Abdou Diouf against vocal opposition leader
Abdoulaye Wade -- with little emphasis on policy or ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many African elections, where the ruling party controls
campaign funds and sometimes electoral authorities, the outcome of
Sunday's contest was uncertain in this West African nation of 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of violence, ballot theft and other irregularities
around the country marred Sunday's vote. Several injuries and
dozens of arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wade has warned of a popular revolt if he loses. After voting in
the capital, Wade told his supporters Sunday not to initiate
violence but to fight back if attacked. He also warned Senegalese
to ''remain vigilant'' for ''serious election anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, 70, has tapped into a growing desire among poor voters for
change. Four decades after Diouf's Socialist Party took power in
1960, nearly two-thirds of Senegalese remain illiterate and
hospitals and roads are badly neglected.
</P>
<P>
   At a ballot station in Dakar's working class Medina suburb, some
opposition supporters said they were prepared to fight if Diouf
wins. Preliminary results are not expected until Tuesday or later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a bad day if Diouf steals the election. There will
be people at the morgue and the hospital,'' said Matar Sy, an
electrician at a French military base near Dakar.
</P>
<P>
   Although turnout figures were unavailable, there appeared to be
fewer voters in Dakar than during the Feb. 27 first round. Some
voters had been unable to return on time from Muslim festivities
held in other parts of Senegal, which is slightly smaller than
South Dakota. One of the few African countries to hold regular
elections, Senegal has never before had a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   A light turnout in Dakar could hurt Wade's campaign, which draws
most of its support from urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf, 64, whose Socialist Party has ruled Senegal since
independence, won 41 percent of the previous round, compared to 31
percent for Wade.
</P>
<P>
   For the runoff, however, Wade has the backing of five of the
seven other contenders in the previous round.
</P>
<P>
   The president voted near his palace in downtown Dakar surrounded
by armed soldiers and crowds of supporters who cheered and threw
rose petals at him.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf's backers say he should be re-elected because under his
leadership Senegal has had a reputation as one of Africa's most
stable nations, with a vibrant trading economy despite few natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Diouf of fostering a corrupt elite and ignoring
the country's poor since he became president in 1981. In recent
years, unemployment and crime have increased in the coastal
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Political differences exploded into violence Sunday in a few
areas of Dakar. Several young Diouf supporters were arrested after
an attack on an electoral station, private radio station Wal
Fadjiri reported. At least 20 people were arrested during a street
fight in another suburb, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes also were reported in the interior towns of Nioro and
Ndande.

<HEADLINE> Entergy Puts Hope in Nuclear Power  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN SAYRE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- In an era when nuclear energy has seen Three
Mile Island and billions of dollars in cost overruns take away its
luster, Entergy Corp. believes yesterday's idea of the future will
turn into tomorrow's hefty profits.
</P>
<P>
   Provided, of course, that the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans-based utility holding company has become an
aggressive player in what promises to be an entirely new and hotly
competitive twist to nuclear energy -- buying fission plants from
utilities and selling the electricity on open, deregulated power
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The formula is this: find large generating plants in high usage,
high-priced power markets, such as the Northeast. Then pay market
value, a fraction of the construction cost, which already has been
covered by ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Entergy could be generating power for as little as
1.5 to 2 cents per kilowatt hour as compared with about 3 cents for
new plants fired by natural gas, said Don Hintz, head of Entergy
Nuclear, the Entergy subsidiary handling the nuclear power deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see anything on the horizon, from a cost perspective,
that will beat nuclear generating,'' Hintz said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of nuclear plants is a new twist in an industry
that bogged down in the 1980s and 1990s amid safety concerns,
skyrocketing and out-of-control price tags for building new plants
and unrealized fears that natural gas would no longer be readily
available for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Watts Bar plant, a Tennessee Valley Authority project at
Spring City, Tenn., was the last plant to come on line in 1996 -- 23
years after it was first proposed. Any plants ordered after 1973
have never been finished.
</P>
<P>
   But the existing plants stand to take on a new role as
deregulation approaches the power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy, which had $8.77 billion in revenue last year, bought
the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station in Plymouth, Mass., in November
for $81 million, becoming the first U.S. utility to purchase a
nuclear plant built by another company.
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, Entergy has been in a bidding war to buy two
nuclear generating plants from the New York Power Authority. The
NYPA is also considering a bid from Dominion Resources Inc. of
Richmond, Va., which offered to buy the plants for $857 million. On
Friday, Entergy raised its offer to $1.12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy plans to spend up to $1.5 billion to acquire as many as
a dozen plants. But it won't be without competition. In addition to
Dominion Resources' expansion efforts, Philadelphia-based Amergen
Energy Co. has purchased the Clinton plant in Illinois and the
still-running Three Mile Island I plant in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy expects Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy Corp. and
Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Group to also join in the fray
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Although many utilities have nuclear-generating plants, running
only one or two is not cost efficient, Hintz said. Entergy already
owned and operated five nuclear generating units for its regulated
power businesses in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana before it
ventured into the buying mode.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons we like this business is that there are
very few players who can compete in it,'' Hintz said.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy got into acquisitions of nuclear plants as part of a
major about-face in a restructuring plan that started in the 1990s
with holdings in telecommunications, home security and overseas
power distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
   After the company's stock price largely sat still during the
bull market, top management was ousted, the 1990s acquisitions were
dumped and nuclear power moved to a major role in the company's
future plans.
</P>
<P>
   The switch has been received well in the investment community.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ford, an analyst with ABN AMRO Inc. who follows utilities,
said Entergy is one of only a few with the necessities for the
ventures: a good operational history of its own plants, strong
relations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and a wealth of
trained plant personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ''For those companies, it's a very good strategy because there
are a wealth of electric utilities that, for a variety or reasons,
own and operate only one or two units,'' Ford said. ''That doesn't
allow for any reasonable economies of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the sale prices thus far, it would cost roughly six
times as much to buy a comparable fossil-fuel plant and eight times
as much to build a new plant, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy is targeting larger plants -- at least 600 megawatts --
and those with full decommissioning funds, which will cover the
hundreds of millions of dollars required to take apart the plants
once they close.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast is particularly appealing because it has some of
the highest regulated rates in the U.S., providing a lucrative
market as consumers begin to choose between power providers and
utilities go to the open market more and more price-shopping for
the best rate, Hintz said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Three Mile Island demonstrated in 1979, there are serious
safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''From our standpoint, the probability of an accident is
extremely small,'' Hintz said. ''We feel with our expertise and the
design of these plants in the U.S., and the training programs we
have, we think that risk is so small, it's not a major concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group based in Washington,
D.C., sees two sides to the safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the new owners are better operators, they could operate the
plants more efficiently and even more safely,'' said Charles
Higley, a spokesman for the group's nuclear issues office. ''But at
the same time, deregulation is forcing utilities to cuts costs and
cutting costs can make nuclear reactors less safe. That's the
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said operational risks are part of the equation.

<HEADLINE> No presidential primary, but lots for NJ voters to sort out June 6  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a hot Senate race and intriguing
intraparty competitions in several House districts, New Jersey
voters will have plenty to consider in the June 6 primary -- even
with the presidential contests long decided by the time they go to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates for Senate Jon S. Corzine and Jim Florio
turned up the volume last week on their already bitter battle.
Corzine, the multimillionaire former chairman of Goldman Sachs,
bought $888,000 worth of television ads over seven days, opening
the door for Florio allies to reiterate their charges that he is
trying to buy a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, state Sen. William Gormley of Atlantic
County became the fifth announced candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The battle to replace retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg will put
New Jersey high on the national radar screen. So will some House
races that could help determine whether the balance of power in
that chamber shifts from Republicans to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Before the two parties face off in the fall, however, some
intraparty battles must be resolved June 6.
</P>
<P>
   In the 5th district, some conservative Republicans are working
to defeat veteran Rep. Marge Roukema, R-Ridgewood.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema said last week it is ''troubling and shocking'' that a
House colleague, Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, is actively
supporting her challenger, state Assemblyman Scott Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   But Roukema shot down reports that she is among the moderate
House Republicans accusing party leaders and the National
Republican Congressional Committee of attempting to oust them in
favor of more conservative challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema pointed to statements of support from House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''My House leadership and the NRCC have been strongly supportive
of me for weeks now, and I'm confident they will continue to be,''
Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   Less happy with her party is Democrat Maryanne Connelly, a
candidate for the open house seat in the 7th district. She went
public last week with a highly detailed account of party leaders
pressuring and coercing her to drop out to make way for another
Democrat, Union County Manager Michael Lapolla.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, the mayor of Fanwood, won 44 percent of the vote in
1998 running against Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights. This year
Franks is one of the Republicans running for Senate, so the seat is
open and both parties are intent on winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly said state Sen. Raymond Lesniak, personally and through
emissaries, has offered her jobs with Democratic candidates as well
as one government post purportedly paying $130,000 for a few days
work each month, if only she will leave the race.
</P>
<P>
   Lesniak did not return calls from The Associated Press but told
The Star-Ledger of Newark that he has not offered Connelly
anything. He did not deny he tried to convince her to drop out,
however.
</P>
<P>
   There are more candidates but, for now, less intrigue on the
Republican side of the 7th district race. News from GOP candidates
last week included Patrick Morrisey introducing his new
''full-scale e-campaign'' that included hosting an online ''chat.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican divisions are showing in the 12th district, where two
former congressmen are seeking the chance to take on freshman Rep.
Rush Holt, D-Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pappas, who held the seat in 1997-1998, visited Washington
last week for a fund-raiser featuring Armey and House Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, Richard Zimmer, who held the seat from 1991 to
1996, was in Washington for a fund-raiser hosted by Hastert and the
NRCC chairman, Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.

<HEADLINE> Erie Canal out of the running for New York state quarter  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Most of New York's school children have
learned a song about ''Sal,'' a mule who pulled boats down the Erie
Canal. But come next year, they won't be seeing Sal or the canal on
New York's state quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the U.S. Mint have deemed the rendering of a mule
pulling a boat on the canal -- one of five proposals submitted by
Gov. George Pataki for the quarter honoring New York -- too detailed
to put on the back of a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very disappointing,'' said Martin Morganstein, the
development and public affairs coordinator for the Erie Canal
Museum in Syracuse. ''Nothing depicts the impact of New York state
on the growth of the U.S. more than the Erie Canal.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint's ''50 State Quarters'' program honors five states
a year in the order they ratified the Constitution. Delaware's
quarter started the program in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Morganstein was so hopeful that the Erie Canal would be picked
to represent New York on the tail of its quarter that he invited
Pataki to reveal the coin's final design at the Erie Canal Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Pataki submitted five concepts to the U.S. Mint
that he thought best represented New York State. They were selected
from hundreds of suggestions from school children, history buffs,
coin collectors and other New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint converted the governor's proposals into designs and
then determined whether the renderings would be ''coinable.''	   
</P>
<P>
   ''Designs need to be simple enough to put on the coin,'' said
Jennifer Arnold, a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Mint,
referring to the process of striking, or stamping, images on the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing of the Erie Canal was deemed ''uncoinable''
according to Arnold, who said the proposed image would not have fit
well on the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining designs were sent for review by the Citizens
Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee and the Fine Arts Commission
and are now waiting for approval by the Secretary of the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   His approval could come as early as the end of the week, and
then they will be sent to Pataki, who will select the final coin.
</P>
<P>
   The coin designs still in the running are:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Statue of Liberty against an outline of the state.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another depiction of the Statue of Liberty, this time with the
New York City skyline in the background.
</P>
<P>
   -- Henry Hudson's tall-masted ship sailing up the river that
would later bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   -- British Gen. John Burgoyne's surrender to the colonial army at
the Battle of Saratoga -- an American victory that convinced France
to join the revolution as an ally of the Continental Army.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Federal Building in New York City, which was the nation's
first capital.
</P>
<P>
   The design picked by Pataki must be OK'd by the treasury
secretary one last time before the Mint will strike New York's
first quarter in a special ceremony. So far, the choices of state
governors have all been approved.
</P>
<P>
   New York's quarter is due out in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Kohler, a historian at the Fine Arts Commission said that
the Statue of Liberty against the state outline is the front-runner
of the remaining concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Aren't people arguing that the Statue of Liberty is really in
New Jersey?,'' joked Mary Summers, the director of communication
for the Greater Buffalo Convention and Visitor's Center.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some leaders in Trenton, N.J., have suggested
that the Statue of Liberty may actually be on New Jersey soil.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said that a coin bearing the Erie Canal or an image
other than the Statue of Liberty might be a better representation
of the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Erie Canal opened up the west and now it's the site of
recreational boating, trails and tourism to small upstate
communities,'' said Mike Murphy, who owns Lockport Locks and Erie
Canal Cruises and is a tour guide on the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Plus,'' Murphy added, ''everybody already knows the Statue of
Liberty, and it makes them think New York City.''

<HEADLINE> Washington State's Tax Plan Stopped  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID AMMONS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Washington state's tax revolt has been
stamped out by a judge, but voters still get a consolation prize --
cheap car registration.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people voted in last fall's election to
adopt Initiative 695, which scrapped the state's hated graduated
tax on cars and replaced it with a flat $30 annual registration fee
for anything from Bill Gates' limo to a 30-year-old junker.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, I-695 also required a public vote for all
tax and fee increases, giving voters veto power over all state and
local taxes and fees.
</P>
<P>
   It was called America's most sweeping public-vote requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But it tore a $750 million hole in the budgets of state and
local programs, and hit transit programs especially hard. Bus
routes have been cut and transit workers have lost jobs as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, responding to challenges brought by transit
workers, ferry riders and local governments, King County Superior
Court Judge Robert Alsdorf overturned the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to unconstitutionally containing more than one
subject, the judge said, its automatic tax referendum provision
turns representative democracy on its head.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the central cries leading to the American Revolution
was 'No taxation without representation!''' the judge wrote.
''Echoes of that revolutionary spirit are found in the passage of
Initiative 695. However ... a representative democracy does not
contemplate, let alone necessitate, a direct vote of the citizens
on every act of government ....''
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd be destroying constitutional government as we know it''
by requiring a public vote before elected state and local
officials' decisions could take effect, Senate Majority Leader Sid
Snyder said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the initiative, Tim Eyman, a 34-year-old owner of
a small business, called it ''just a wacko ruling. I think this was
an illegal ruling. It was a political ruling. According to the
Constitution, all power is reserved to the people, except, I guess,
when politicians and judges disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyman and the state attorney general's office are appealing to
the state Supreme Court. A hearing is scheduled for June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Eyman ended up with half a loaf. Alsdorf agreed to allow
the $30 fee for car tabs, attached to license plates as proof of
payment, to remain in effect until the high court rules.
</P>
<P>
   Effective New Year's Day, the $30 flat fee replaced a 2.2
percent excise tax that was pegged to a vehicle's age and value.
Many families had paid $300 or more for tabs each year and luxury
motor homes cost their owners thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the popularity of the cheaper tabs, Gov. Gary Locke
and lawmakers from both parties rushed to assure voters they'll
enact legislation to keep the flat fee in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''The voters have spoken,'' said the Democratic governor, who
opposed the initiative but is running for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're saying 'You folks spoke. This is an example of us
listening,''' said state Rep. Hans Dunshee.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate passed a $30 tab bill on Friday and the state
House is expected to follow suit in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers agree that it would take a constitutional amendment to
restore the public-vote requirement. That would take a two-thirds
vote of both houses, plus voter approval, and Democrats in both
houses have indicated they would block such a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers hope to temporarily ease some of the pain of the loss
of funds from the vehicle tax by using up to half of the state's
$1.3 billion reserves. Most cuts in ferry service are being
restored, some highway projects will be funded, transit systems
will get more state subsidies, and cities and counties will lose no
more than 10 percent of their budgets.

<HEADLINE> Israeli's Remarks Rip Rabbi  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Tension heightened Sunday in Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's shaky coalition after the spiritual leader of one key
party attacked the leader of another in terms so bitter that the
attorney general was considering criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, compared Education Minister Yossi Sarid, head of the Meretz
party, to Satan and two other hated figures in Jewish scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   At a sermon Saturday night to mark the Jewish festival of Purim,
Yosef said Sarid ''is Amalek, he is Satan ... may his name and
memory be wiped out. He must be uprooted from the seed of Israel.
... Just as revenge was wrought on Haman, so will it be wrought on
him.'' The rabbi's words were received with thunderous applause and
shouts of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Amalek is described in the Bible as the sworn enemy of the
children of Israel. Haman is the Biblical villain whom the Jews
defeated in a victory that is celebrated on Purim, which begins
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Shas and Meretz have already threatened to
fracture Barak's narrow coalition of 69 of 120 lawmakers. Barak
needs both parties to maintain the majority necessary to push
through his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Prosecutor Edna
Arbel reviewed a videotape of the rabbi's comments Sunday to see
whether they constituted incitement to violence, the Justice
Ministry said in a statement. Rubinstein will make his decision in
the next few days, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time the attorney general had considered
prosecuting Yosef for his verbal attacks on Sarid or on Supreme
Court justices. This time, however, the comments were more extreme,
an official close to Rubinstein said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef issued a statement Sunday night clarifying that his
comments were not intended to encourage violence and telling
followers ''it is severely forbidden to behave violently against
any person, even if he doesn't treat us fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who belongs to Barak's One Israel
bloc, said if the rabbi persisted in such statements it would be
difficult for One Israel to sit in the same coalition with Shas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that if Yossi Sarid had by chance found himself in the
area where the rabbi was making these statements, there would have
been a lynching,'' Beilin told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Shas accuses Sarid of withholding funds from its religious
school system. At a news conference Sunday, Sarid said that he has
provided the funds even though the network has not fully complied
with a financial reform and management program that it had agreed
to.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said at Sunday's Cabinet meeting that he ''cannot accept''
the rabbi's statements and hoped that ''a way will be found to
correct them.'' He called on all parties to express their
disagreements without acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has been trying to repair relations with Shas, the
second-largest party in his coalition, in the wake of recent votes
on peace negotiations in which Shas voted with the right-wing
opposition. In a Cabinet vote Sunday, all four Shas ministers voted
against an Israeli troop withdrawal that is to give the
Palestinians 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Meretz demonstrators and Shas supporters clashed briefly outside
Yosef's Jerusalem home Sunday evening, but police pulled them
apart.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Looks to Iran for Trade  </HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The United States is lifting
some sanctions on Iran and talking about an eventual resumption of
relations because it wants ties nearly as much as Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran wants the international credibility it has been denied for
two decades, since Washington severed ties after the 1979 U.S.
Embassy hostage crisis in Tehran. Also, the nation has little hope
of an economic turnaround without diplomatic recognition by
Washington: Iran's teetering economy needs World Bank and
International Monetary Fund loans that the United States opposes,
and it wants U.S. technology and the investment in its energy
sector now banned by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Washington was lifting an import ban on Persian carpets, caviar and
pistachios. The move is largely symbolic because these exports
account for only a fraction of Iran's foreign exchange earnings, 85
percent of which come from oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, the United States seeks full diplomatic
relations and access to a 62-million strong market, the Middle
East's largest after Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington has banned U.S. businesses from selling
everything from Coca-Cola to Boeing airliners in Iran, European
firms have been cashing in by filling multibillion-dollar orders
coming from Tehran. Europe also has received other lucrative
contracts to rebuild Iran's oil industry and strategic facilities
devastated during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Elf Aquitaine of France and Agip of Italy signed a
$540 million deal with Iran's state-owned oil company. In 1995,
France's Total SA took over a $600 million deal that the U.S.
embargo did not permit U.S.-giant Conoco Inc. to make. Also last
year, the Royal Dutch Shell Group signed up to invest about $800
million in Iran's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton renewed a bill that bars U.S.
companies from investing more than $20 million in Iran's oil and
gas sector. The bill, which also provides for penalizing foreign
companies that do so, has been largely ignored by non-U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The list of lost deals goes on. Five years ago, U.S. aircraft
giant Boeing Co. wanted to sell Iran 16 Boeing 737-400s. But the $1
billion deal was blocked by the U.S. government, so Iran turned to
European-based Airbus. It has bought a few aircraft and is known to
be negotiating for several more.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Coca Cola became the only U.S. soft-drink maker to open
a plant in Iran; it was forced to pull out a year later when
Clinton tightened sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's policy of trying to isolate Iran has crumbled, with
some of America's closest allies in the region and beyond
increasing not just business but also political ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Saudi Arabia, Washington's closest ally in the
Gulf, ended years of estrangement with Tehran. Iran and Egypt,
another strong American ally, also have been talking about
improving ties. And last year, reformist Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami made landmark visits to Italy and France. He received red
carpet welcomes in both capitals, and the European Union expressed
its willingness to broaden ties.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke Friday of stability in the Gulf as an interest
shared by both nations, saying the United States ''would encourage
regional discussions aimed at reducing tensions and building
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   With no quick change of leadership expected in Iraq, and
possible turmoil in Saudi Arabia after the deaths of the present
generation of leaders, Iran provides the most promising anchor of
stability in the oil-rich region. With Iraq's armed forces out of
commission since the 1991 Gulf War, Iran has the largest army in
the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Strategically, Iran sits astride the world's second-largest
natural gas reserves. It has a choke hold on the Strait of Hormuz,
the gateway for one-fifth of the world's oil supplies, and is the
most economic route for new energy supplies from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also borders the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. Noted
Albright about that region: ''Huge reserves of oil and gas are just
beginning to be tapped.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet OKs Pullback Map  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A land transfer that stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks for five weeks easily cleared a
final hurdle Sunday with Israel's Cabinet approving maps for the
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer will take place Tuesday, just before negotiators
convene near Washington for peace talks, and will leave the
Palestinians in control of 41 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians had suspended the talks last month after it
became clear Israel was not going to give them populated suburbs of
Jerusalem as part of the troop withdrawal. The revised maps
approved Sunday give the Palestinians three suburbs near, but not
abutting Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The maps were approved by a vote of 16-6. Ministers from two
religious parties and an immigrant party opposed the withdrawal,
which will give the Palestinians full control of 5.1 percent of the
West Bank where they now have civilian control. A further 1 percent
will go from full Israeli control to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   ''From this week on, 60 percent of the Palestinians in the West
Bank will live under full Palestinian authority,'' Deputy Defense
Minister Ephraim Sneh said. ''This is the real change.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new map, Israel will also withdraw from areas near the
West Bank towns of Jericho, Jenin, Bethlehem and Hebron, pullbacks
that bring Arafat closer to the territorial continuity he wants to
create a state.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing critics said giving the Palestinians suburbs near
Jerusalem will threaten the security of nearby Jewish neighborhoods
and the unity of the city. Jewish West Bank settlers held protests
Sunday near the areas from which Israel is to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Israel released five Palestinian prisoners jailed
for anti-Israel activity and promised to release ten more Monday as
a goodwill gesture for the Muslim feast of Eid al-Adha, which ended
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The five prisoners were members of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction who were convicted of killing Palestinian
collaborators and injuring Israelis over the last two decades. All
five prisoners were from traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, claimed
by the Palestinians as the capital of a future state.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Israel has refused to negotiate the release of
Palestinian prisoners from east Jerusalem because it does not
recognize Palestinian jurisdiction over residents from the sector
of the city it captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Sublaban, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club in
Jerusalem, said the prisoner release will help to move the peace
negotiations forward because ''it shows the families (of the
prisoners) that the peace process is tangible and that they can
benefit from the fruits of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Israel to release all of the approximately 1,650
Palestinian prisoners being held for anti-Israel activity --
so-called security prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Landing Gear Problem Shelves Jet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Orlando,
Fla., was forced to return to La Guardia Airport minutes after
takeoff Sunday when the landing gear failed to retract, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke was later detected in the cabin, forcing an evacuation
that left four passengers with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Flight 1971, with 139 passengers and six crew members,
took off at 8:30 a.m. but quickly returned because of the landing
gear failure, landing without incident, said Port Authority
spokesman Allen Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   While on the runway, the pilot detected smoke in the cabin and
decided to evacuate the aircraft, deploying the emergency chutes,
Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Four passengers suffered minor knee and back injuries during the
evacuation, he said; none required hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a Boeing 727, was immediately taken into maintenance
to be examined, said Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Harmony Sockman.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was closed for about 30 minutes and was reopened at
9:15 a.m., Morrison said.

<HEADLINE> No Fortune for Famed Mozambican Baby  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIBUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Rositha Pedro, the baby who made
international headlines when she was born in a tree above swirling
flood waters, has a new home: a squalid house she and her family
share with dozens of other destitute Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
   After a South African military helicopter plucked Rositha and
her mother, Sophia, to safety on March 1, an hour after the baby
was born, their story prompted an outpouring of sympathy. A
businessman phoned a local radio station offering to pay for
Rositha's upkeep, and several other offers of support followed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three weeks later, none of the promises has materialized.
But Pedro and her husband Benet Josia Mundine still hold out hope
that those who offered to help can track them down in Chibuto --
which has no phone lines and is still only accessible by air
because the roads have been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   The family lives in an abandoned house in a tented aid camp in
the town 125 miles northeast of the capital, Maputo. When it rains,
water leaks from the chimney and open windows, but at least the
dilapidated house has a roof -- something most of the camp's
estimated 5,000 residents lack.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers gave the family two rough, gray blankets. All their
remaining possessions are stored in a corner of their little room
in a white burlap sack.
</P>
<P>
   Rositha, her 3-year-old brother, Benet, and 5-year-old sister,
Celia, sleep alongside their parents and three other flood victims
on grass mats on a cement floor in the room. Both Sophia and her
baby -- who spent four days in the tree with no food before being
rescued -- appear in reasonable health, considering their living
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all right here, but we have nowhere else to go,''
Sophia said as she breast-fed Rositha.
</P>
<P>
   She dreams of owning a brick house with a zinc roof from which
she could run a small shop. But Mundine, who lost his right leg in
Mozambique's 15-year civil war which ended in 1992, sat staring out
a window, wondering how he would ever manage to afford it. The
former soldier in the army of the ruling FRELIMO party said even if
he could get the materials for a house, he would need about $1,400
to have it built.
</P>
<P>
   Since their grass hut in Mondeane village outside Chokwe was
swept away by floodwaters, Sophia has been the family's sole
breadwinner, earning a few dollars from journalists who report on
the family. The money is used to supplement meager food handouts
from aid agencies, but it does not stretch very far among the 18
members of Pedro's extended family, most of whom have nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the media interest and the income that came with it are
drying up. Mundine and his wife say they have about $30 left and do
not know what they will do once it's gone.

<HEADLINE> Brit Accuses BMW of Being Secretive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- BMW's secrecy over its plans to sell its
British-based Rover unit reduced the chances of providing a proper
economic assistance package for laid off auto workers, Trade and
Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Byers said he was misled at a meeting with BMW director,
Professor Werner Samann, last week, just six days before the sale
was officially confirmed. Samann had assured him that BMW was
working to reduce losses at Rover, Byers said in an interview on
Sky TV.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said Samann later apologized to Byers, but had been
unable to discuss the sale with Byers because the information was
commercially sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has announced that it will sell the Land Rover division to
Ford Motor Co. for $2.91 billion, while British investment group
Alchemy Partners Ltd. has agreed to take over the money-losing MG
and Rover passenger cars unit.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy has indicated there will be layoffs at the Longbridge
assembly plant in central England, which now employs about 8,000
people, but has given no details.
</P>
<P>
   Byers told Sky that at his meeting with Samann on March 10, the
BMW director ''went through the losses that were being incurred and
would be reported to the board, but gave no indication whatsoever
that part of their strategy was to break up Rover and sell
Longbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed they went through their strategy to deal with the
losses of $3.2 million a day and nowhere in that was there an
indication that the breakup of Rover and the disposal of Longbridge
was even in their thinking,'' Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''BMW, by not disclosing their strategy, by keeping the
government in the dark and misleading ministers like myself, did
not allow us to put in place a (economic assistance) program that
at this time will be desperately needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Parliament's Trade and Industry Select Committee
announced later Sunday that the committee will investigate events
surrounding the sale of Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Martin O'Neill told the BBC the inquiry would
begin within two weeks. It will explore what options there are for
finding an alternative buyer for Rover and investigate whether the
government could have done more to avert job losses.

<HEADLINE> Up to 470 May Have Died in Fire  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- Rutemba Didas heard what sounded like an
explosion, then saw black smoke billowing from the brick structure
on a hilltop compound where members of a religious cult had been
living for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer and his neighbors heard screams coming from the
chapel, but they couldn't get close to the new building inside the
compound where members of the Movement for the Restoration of Ten
Commandments of God lived in this remote corner of southwestern
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Sunday it may take them a week to determine how many
people died in the Friday morning fire, but they believe there were
as many as 470 victims -- of mass suicide or mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not see any person running away. We really don't know
what happened to the leaders,'' Didas said, standing a short
distance from where charred bodies lay spread across the floor of a
120-foot by 30-foot structure.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances surrounding the deaths -- who the dead were and how
the fire was started -- remain foggy. Little was known about the
cult, although it appeared to incorporate Christian beliefs and
local farmers said it was led by a former prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Syncretic Christian religious sects are mushrooming across
Africa as many people become disillusioned with the inability of
politicians to improve their lives. In one case, also in Uganda, a
sect turned into a guerrilla movement that used claims of religious
powers to attract fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In Kanungu, cult members locked themselves in the chapel early
Friday and nailed doors and windows closed, then sang for a few
hours before dousing themselves in gasoline and paraffin and
setting themselves ablaze, said David Sseppuuya, deputy
editor-in-chief of the government-owned New Vision newspaper,
quoting investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to an eyewitness on the site, they came around and
bid farewell to the people and they heard that the Virgin Mary
would appear on Friday, so they did expect to die on Friday,''
Sseppuuya said.
</P>
<P>
   Didas said the cult was established in 1994 by former prostitute
Credonia Mwerinde at her family's compound.
</P>
<P>
   He said members of the cult did not socialize with others in the
area and communicated only by gesture, although they did sing and
pray aloud. The women wore white veils, and the men wore black,
green or red shirts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders said members of the sect slaughtered their cattle
and feasted for a week before the fire, drinking a large supply of
soft drinks and singing religious songs, according to the
independent newspaper The Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Cult members from inside and outside the compound had been
invited to a ceremony Friday to inaugurate the chapel, which had
recently been built by Mwerinde on the graves of her parents, Didas
said.
</P>
<P>
   In other buildings on the compound, there were images of the
Virgin Mary and several rosaries.
</P>
<P>
   Didas, whose farm adjoins the compound, said two men, one
identified as Joseph Kibweteere and the other an unidentified
Catholic priest, were Mwerinde's deputies. It was not known if any
of the three had died in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   A report Sunday in the Monitor disputed that account, saying
Kibweteere was the sect leader. He had reportedly predicted that
the world would come to an end Dec. 31 but changed that to Dec. 31,
2000 after nothing happened, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Curious onlookers and people from Kanungu trading center, less
than a mile from the compound, peered into the building, holding
sprigs of rosemary to their noses to ward off the stench.
</P>
<P>
   Tumwesigye Kajungu, a former schoolteacher from the trading
center who refused to join the cult, said his wife and six children
died in the blaze.

   In the capital, Kampala, 217 miles to the northeast, deputy
police spokesman Eric Naigambi said the cult had been regarded as
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Asuman Mugenyi, another police spokesman, said the adults who
died would be treated a suicide victims, but the deaths of those
under 18 years old would be regarded as murder.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included children, although the charred condition of
the bodies could make it impossible to identify them or arrive at a
conclusive figure the numbers of dead, Sseppuuya said. Doctors
began autopsies Sunday.

   Relatively little is known about the philosophy of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s when Uganda was emerging from 15 years of
bloody civil war, a woman calling herself a spirit medium said she
could lead a guerrilla army through battle unscathed. Alice Auma
Lakwena told members of her Holy Spirit Movement they would be
protected from bullets by rubbing themselves with oil pressed from
shea nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 she sought refuge in neighboring Kenya. Her cousin,
Joseph Kony, took up the insurgency and called it the Lord's
Resistance Army and said it was based on the Ten Commandments. The
LRA is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people in northern
Uganda and the abduction of children and youths.

<HEADLINE> 10 Vie in Illinois Congressman Race  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) -- Take 10 Republican political unknowns. Pit
them against each other in a suburban Chicago district, then add
possible control of the House of Representatives as an incentive.
Throw in millions of dollars for TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   It's a recipe for an election-season circus, and the show is
under way in this affluent swath of shoreline suburbs as Illinois'
March 21 primary nears and both advertising and mudslinging
escalate.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a voter shake his head, and Bill Snodgrass
was doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never!'' exclaimed Snodgrass, trying to sort through a field
that includes two heirs to family fortunes, an abstinence educator,
a concert pianist, former corporate titans, a Navy intelligence
officer, and until recently even a professional wrestler known as
''The Illustrious One.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They all have the basic Republican philosophy,'' Snodgrass
said. ''They want local control, less government and less taxes.
It's just who can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   After 11-term GOP Rep. John Porter announced his retirement last
fall, Republican leaders tried to recruit a popular moderate to
run. Though the 10th District includes some blue-collar towns like
Waukegan, most of it rolls along Lake Michigan north of Chicago,
through wealthy communities where residents tend to prefer fiscal
conservatives who are independent-minded and socially moderate.
</P>
<P>
   But Lt. Gov. Corinne Wood and three female state lawmakers
decided not to run. A dozen little-known candidates filed instead,
and just two have dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is, well, chaotic. There are accusations of
carpetbagging. Some yards in the district are festooned with signs
so large they require permits. Personal fortunes are being spent.
Candidates have sniped so much that the state Republican chairman
got involved.
</P>
<P>
   The primary winner will face the race's lone Democrat, four-term
state Rep. Lauren Beth Gash, who has beaten well-funded Republicans
before. Democrats see a winnable seat that will help them erase the
GOP's 11-seat House majority.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over Porter's replacement was expected to be one of
this year's most expensive. At least $5.4 million has been raised
for the GOP primary race alone -- $4.6 million straight from the
pockets of the field's six multimillionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Donnelley, a 30-year-old scion of the family that founded
printing giant R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons, has loaned at least $2.3
million to her campaign. Andrew Hochberg, 37, a developer who ran
the Sportmart retail chain until his family merged it with another
company, has put in $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   By March 1, the 10 candidates' combined spending had reached
$3.1 million -- for radio and TV ads on the region's expensive
network stations, glossy mailings and, from Donnelley, the
gargantuan yard signs.
</P>
<P>
   Spending by Donnelley and Hochberg has put them in front, along
with tax attorney John Cox, former top Porter aide Mark Kirk and
Northbrook Mayor Mark Damisch.
</P>
<P>
   Three candidates oppose abortion rights: Cox, who has put in
$434,500 of his own; abstinence educator Scott Phelps; and retired
financial consultant John Guy. The others are moderates in the
Porter mold.
</P>
<P>
   Crossfire attacks prompted two letters from state Republican
chairman Rich Williamson warning the candidates to cut it out. Much
of the flak has been aimed at Kirk, 40, who moved back to the
district, his childhood home, just last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, counsel to a House committee, says no other candidate
knows the district's issues as he does because of his work for
Porter in the 1980s, and that none has his Washington know-how.
He's counting on endorsements from Porter and township
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Porter got involved on Kirk's behalf because of fears Cox might
win the primary, leaving Republicans with a conservative and
spelling disaster in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox, 44, scoffs at notions he can't beat Gash. His strategy:
a pro-small business, anti-tax message that virtually ignores his
abortion position.
</P>
<P>
   Hochberg took heat for giving money to Democrats -- including
Gash -- and voting in Democratic primaries. He says he gave to
pro-Israel politicians no matter their party; he is courting
support from the district's sizable Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelley, the only woman, has been criticized for moving into
her grandmother's house within the district. She came from Chicago,
where she was a Washington lobbyist for her family's company.
</P>
<P>
   Damisch, 43, was criticized by Porter for using a photo of the
two together that suggested the congressman endorsed him. A trial
lawyer and pianist who has loaned his campaign $101,860, Damisch
touts himself as the race's only elected official.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates have spent significant personal funds --
former Encyclopedia Britannica chief James Goulka with $250,000 and
health care advertising executive Terry Gladman with $507,000 -- but
have little to show for it.

<HEADLINE> McCain To Return to the Senate  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nevermind that John McCain often joked with
his campaign audiences -- in pride, not in sorrow -- about never
winning a Miss Congeniality award in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Public displays of graciousness will mark his return to the
Capitol this week, a more formidable political force than when he
left it. It's the Senate's way, even though he ran a reform-based
presidential campaign that rocked the Republican establishment and
used fellow lawmakers as foils.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senators are in conflict every day with each other, in
committee, over issues, in letters, in the media, on the floor,''
said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., Senate point man for likely GOP
presidential nominee George W. Bush. ''But it has a fraternal
nature to it and you have to set the battles ... aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the displays of senatorial courtesy, the Arizona
senator's allies say fellow Republicans will ignore his new
political clout at their own peril.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are only two United States senators who have a truly
national constituency. One's name is Ted Kennedy and one's name is
John McCain,'' says former White House chief of staff Ken
Duberstein, a McCain friend and senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas said a recent national survey
pointed in the same direction, and that McCain can help GOP
candidates in terms of fund raising and voter support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The congressional (campaign) committee ought to put him on
right away to start doing these swing congressional districts,''
Goeas said. ''He can be a real asset in keeping Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein predicted McCain will be the ''No. 1 Republican''
asked to campaign for Republicans this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''He still may not win Miss Congeniality, but he will win a
popularity contest,'' Duberstein said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain made repeated joking references to Miss Congeniality
awards while campaigning, in part to rebut suggestions that he
lacked the temperament to serve in the Oval Office. He has
irritated fellow lawmakers, in part with a personal style that can
be brusque, and with public remarks.
</P>
<P>
   During a Senate debate on campaign finance legislation last
year, he drew fire for posting on his campaign Web site examples of
''pork-barrel'' spending that involved home-state projects eagerly
sought by fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And some relationships were frayed during the bruising campaign.
According to numerous associates, McCain is irritated with Sen.
Phil Gramm for comments the Texan made while campaigning for Bush
in South Carolina. McCain supported Gramm in the 1996 campaign,
despite a long-standing friendship with another contender that
year, Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has been out of the public eye since dropping his
presidential bid March 9, is expected back in his Senate office
briefly on Monday, and at the Republicans' weekly, closed-door
lunch on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides are planning his return to public life in Washington with
care.
</P>
<P>
   He'll meet Monday with political advisers to review plans for a
political action committee that would enable him to raise money to
finance his travels around the country on behalf of his ''reform''
agenda as well as for other candidates for office.
</P>
<P>
   He may speak on the Senate floor on Tuesday, possibly on a
reform issue. But no attempt will be made to flesh out his plans
for the coming months ''on his second day back in Washington after
a long campaign and a short vacation,'' according to spokesman Todd
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   It's also has been nearly two weeks since McCain has commented
publicly on Bush, who angered McCain allies last week by saying his
rival hadn't changed his views on reform.
</P>
<P>
   As of late last week, McCain passed word from his South Pacific
vacation spot to GOP Senate leaders that he wanted no public
ceremonies marking his return. ''There were almost as many ideas as
there were people with speed dials'' on their phones, said John
Czwartacki, an aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, aides assume he will be the center of attention after a
presidential campaign that surprised Bush in New Hampshire and in
Michigan and then won four New England states on March 7 before
folding two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, his campaign call for an end to the ''iron
triangle'' of lobbyists, legislation and money helped contribute to
a spike in voter turnout. Moreover, McCain attracted independents
and Democratic voters whose support will be pivotal in the fall
election.

<HEADLINE> Waco Standoff Being Re-Enacted  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- Aircraft circled, tanks rumbled and
combat-garbed shooters fired off rounds at a Texas military base
Sunday in a high-stakes field test to resolve whether federal
agents shot at the Branch Davidians in the waning moments of the
1993 Waco standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have always insisted that their forces
fired no shots that day, when the FBI launched a tear-gassing
operation designed to end the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   But Branch Davidian plaintiffs suing the government for wrongful
death insist Sunday's field test will confirm their experts'
analysis: that rapid-fire bursts of light appearing on the FBI's
1993 aerial infrared surveillance footage represent gunfire from
government positions into the Davidians' retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we ... show that there are flashes from gunfire, I am
hopeful FBI leaders will acknowledge that guns were fired and the
FBI will find out who fired and on what orders,'' the plaintiffs'
lead counsel, Michael Caddell, said prior to the test, standing
outside Fort Hood's gate. The Army outpost is located 50 miles
southwest of Waco, site of the 1993 siege.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials have suggested that the flashes come from sunlight
glinting off pools of water, metal or other debris strewn on the
ground while the government's tanks pierced the compound's walls to
insert tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished
during the fire that consumed their compound several hours into the
tear-gassing operation. The government contends their deaths,
whether from fire or gunshot wounds, came by their own hand. The
plaintiffs argue that government gunfire cut off the sect members'
only avenue of escape as the inferno raged.
</P>
<P>
   The field test, ordered by the federal judge presiding over the
Davidians' lawsuit, was designed to determine whether the Forward
Looking Infrared camera is capable of detecting people, debris
heated by exhaust from tanks, sunlight reflections and, of course,
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The government's infrared experts, as well as those hired by the
plaintiffs, will compare the test footage with the FBI's 1993 tape
to determine whether muzzle blasts fired during the test have
similar thermal signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results were expected as early as Sunday evening.
Caddell has scheduled a news conference Monday in Houston to air
portions of the test video and discuss findings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford, one of the government's lead
lawyers in the case, has acknowledged that infrared technology can
detect gunfire -- a statement Caddell has described as a stunning
reversal of the government's earlier position.
</P>
<P>
   The critical issue, Bradford and other federal officials
contend, is whether the cameras detect people on the ground. No
people were visible on the 1993 infrared tape until after the fire
erupted and FBI agents emerged from armored vehicles to search for
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   While the government suggests there can be no shots without
shooters, the plaintiffs argue that gunmen weren't detected because
the temperature of their fire-retardant clothing and body armor was
similar to that of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The test site was overflown by an FBI plane equipped with the
since-upgraded FLIR used at Waco and a Lynx helicopter on loan from
the British Royal Navy outfitted with an infrared camera of the
same generation as the one used in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared cameras captured images of shooters and tank
drivers carrying out the intricately choreographed demonstration.
The field was strategically peppered with debris to simulate the
scene at the compound on April 19, 1993, as tanks rammed into the
sect's rickety wooden structure.
</P>
<P>
   The field test was attended by the special counsel
re-investigating the government's conduct during the siege's final
day, former Sen. John Danforth. Also among the 50-some people in
attendance were U.S. District Judge Walter Smith, congressional
investigators and the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith rejected news organizations' request for the event to be
public.

<HEADLINE> New Boeing Offer To Go to a Vote  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE M. CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing engineers and technical workers who have
been on strike for more than a month cast ballots Sunday on the
airplane giant's contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the vote was expected to be close.
</P>
<P>
   If the offer was accepted, members of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace would return to
work at 9 a.m. Monday
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,000 to 17,000 workers walked off their jobs Feb. 9.
Since then, Boeing deliveries have slipped by more than 15
airplanes and work on some government contracts also has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative agreement on the separate contracts for engineers and
technicians was announced early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year proposals, technicians would get a 4
percent raise in the first year and a 3 percent raise in each of
the next two years. Engineers would receive a 3 percent raise every
year of their contract.
</P>
<P>
   The company dropped its demand that workers pay part of their
health insurance premiums. Health coverage would be extended to
domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the lump sum, 10 percent bonus payment won by the
International Association of Machinists, the proposals offered
engineers and technicians bonuses of $1,000 after 30 days, $500
following delivery of 225 planes this year and $1,000 after
delivery of 491 planes no later than March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The union counted 17,000 workers on strike, mostly in the Puget
Sound area, although recent Boeing estimates put the number at
15,000. The union represents 22,352 workers, of whom roughly
two-thirds are dues-paying union members.
</P>
<P>
   Due in part to the strike, Boeing's stock fell from a high of
$47.62{ a share on Jan. 17 to $32.37{, just shy of the 52-week low
of $32, on March 10. On Friday, shares gained $2.38 to close at $38
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Slain American's Parents Visit Site  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC NUNEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Arriving at the site where their
daughter was killed last week, the parents of a slain Michigan
woman were welcomed into the arms of a grieving, sympathetic
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all feel your loss,'' read one of the signs held Saturday
by dozens of residents who lined the main highway in Cahuita, about
90 miles east of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Emily Eagen, from Ann Arbor, Mich., and friend
Emily Howell, of Lexington, Ky., both 19, were found on the side of
the highway last Monday. Both had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Howell had been in Costa Rica working on a photography project
for her studies at Ohio's Antioch College. Eagen, who withdrew from
Antioch in August, was visiting Howell.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Costa Rican police said they were close to releasing
a description of at least one suspect. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's description was provided by two witnesses who
claimed they were forced at gunpoint to burn the sports utility
vehicle the women were using, said Jorge Rojas, director of the
country's Judicial Police. The vehicle was found near San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Shirley Eagen and their daughter Sarah, accompanied
by U.S. Embassy officials, left a flower arrangement at the site of
the killing on Saturday and received a condolence card from the
town.
</P>
<P>
   The family declined to speak publicly. Charles Eagan issued a
brief statement shortly after their arrival Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a difficult time for us,'' he said. ''Please don't
chase us while we're in Costa Rica.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents also met with Costa Rican investigators and went to
the cabin lodge in Puerto Viejo, a popular beach spot south of
Cahuita, where the women were staying the weekend before their
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have agreed to accept the help of a Miami-based FBI
agent, who is reviewing evidence gathered by Costa Rican
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths have shocked this Central American country, whose
reputation for safety and stability in an otherwise turbulent
region has helped attract thousands of U.S. retirees, about $1
billion annually in tourism and more than 1 million tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen has said his daughter wrote her family back in Michigan
describing a country of ''friendly people.''
</P>
<P>
   But as one of the resident's signs sadly announced: ''Bad news,
they kill, too.''

<HEADLINE> Egypt Won't Try Rights Advocate  </HEADLINE>
By MAE GHALWASH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Egyptian human rights advocate who faced
up to 15 years at hard labor said Sunday that the government had
decided not to prosecute him, closing a case that had drawn
international criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, conveyed last week to an official from Human
Rights Watch, marks a sharp turnaround in the government's position
on Hafez Abu Saada, secretary-general of the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I welcome any decision to close this file,'' Abu Saada said.
''If human rights abuses take place, officials ... should take the
offenders to trial, not human rights activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada said assurances of his safety were relayed to Hanny
Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa
division of Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York. Megally
was in Egypt last week on a mission to examine the human rights
situation.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Prosecutor General Maher Abdel-Wahed, Megally
was told that ''the file has been completely closed and there is no
case,'' Abu Saada said.
</P>
<P>
   Megally could not immediately be reached for comment. Egyptian
officials were also unreachable Sunday, as government offices were
closed for a Muslim holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The government's turnaround appeared to be a clumsy attempt to
close a case that had drawn sharp criticism from local and
international human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada was detained and charged in 1998 after a weekly
newspaper alleged his group accepted $25,000 from the British
Embassy in Cairo in return for publishing a false report that
damaged Egypt's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused police of arresting and torturing hundreds of
Coptic Christians during a murder investigation in a southern
Egyptian village in August 1998. The government denied any abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights and the British
government say the donation from the Human Rights Committee of the
British Parliament was for a project concerning legal aid to
Egyptian women.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Kassem, an EOHR board member, quoted Megally as saying
that Abdel-Wahed had told him that authorities decided to close the
case after they ''received a letter from the British Embassy which
assured us the funds were for legitimate purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   A remaining charge of breaking a military decree that bans
accepting donations without government permission -- an act
punishable by seven to 15 years of hard labor -- was not addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada, who had been in France, came home last week after
meeting with senior Egyptian officials who encouraged him to
return.

<HEADLINE> Hajj a Moneymaker for Many  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Religious rituals combined with
roadside capitalism this week for Idriss Abul-Hashm of Myanmar, who
sold vials of perfume at a hefty profit to fellow Muslims gathered
for the hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Abul-Hashm is not alone: Thousands of vendors pack streets
during hajj, selling products to a captive audience of several
million pilgrims as they move from city to city performing the hajj
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Abul-Hashm, 30, buys tiny bottles of perfume for less than a
quarter apiece on arriving in Saudi Arabia, then brings them to the
holy cities of Mecca and Mina to sell them for 53 cents. He also
buys and sells cheap rings. Altogether, he earns $40 or $50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Selling in the streets is illegal at the hajj, but the
phenomenon isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money is good,'' Abul-Hashm said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 2.1 million people performed the hajj, which drew to
a close Sunday in Mecca. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims from
around the world entered the holy city's Grand Mosque to complete
the pilgrimage's rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Around midday, the mosque was crowded with pilgrims performing
the Tawaf al-Widaa, or the ''farewell circling'' of the Kaaba --
walking seven times around the cubical structure while praying and
reading the holy Koran.
</P>
<P>
   After circling the Kaaba, many pilgrims began their journey
home. Others may travel to the holy city of Medina to visit the
Prophet Mohammed's tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hajj was excellent,'' said Mohammed Roshan, 44, of
Pakistan, after leaving the Grand Mosque. ''This is the first time
I performed it and I hope to come every year from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hajj is required at least once of every able-bodied Muslim who
can afford it, and this year 1.26 million pilgrims came from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The hajj was free of large-scale tragedies, but six people were
crushed to death at the Grand Mosque last week and five people died
in car accidents. Two years ago, 180 people were killed while
performing the stoning of the devil ritual.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds thronging around the holy cities are tempting targets
for vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Abdulaziz M. bin Saeed, commander of public security in
the holy areas, says authorities do their best to prevent pilgrims
from becoming vendors during the week. He said they confiscate
wares and hand them back to pilgrims when they leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the salesmanship goes on nonetheless. Many Africans sell
wooden statues and colorful clothes. Cameras and binoculars are the
big products of visitors from former Soviet republics. Afghans
bring table cloths and bedspreads to sell; pilgrims from the Indian
subcontinent hawk a variety of foods and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Omar of Afghanistan sells about 50 Pakistani-made bed
covers each day during the roughly weeklong hajj, earning $1.10 for
a single-size cover and up to $1.87 for the doubles. Mohammed
Rasoul of the Russian republic of Dagestan peddles binoculars,
cameras and drills. Not all are cheap -- his binoculars can run
$320.
</P>
<P>
   The main clients for the street vendors are pilgrims and some
Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always come during hajj and see what things they have.
Usually, they have nice and cheap things,'' says Saudi citizen
Sayed Hamdi, 21, who was carrying a toy he bought from a
Bangladeshi for his younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdi, a student, said he spends about $100 on purchases each
time he comes to buy from hajj pilgrims.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Tries To Halt Extradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- An attorney to a Bosnian Croat whose
extradition is sought by the U.N. war crimes tribunal said Sunday
he would ''use all means'' to try to further postpone his client's
transfer to the court in The Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Kresimir Krsnik, said his client, Mladen
Naletilic, was in poor health and unable to travel to stand trial.
The Vecernji list newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying
that Naletilic could be transported to The Hague as soon as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia last year authorized extradition of Naletilic, better
known as Tuta, charged by the tribunal in December 1998 with 17
counts of war crimes for alleged atrocities committed against
Muslims in 1993-1994 in southwestern Bosnia. But the extradition
was suspended due to Naletilic's coronary problems.
</P>
<P>
   Naletilic's Croatian doctor said last month his life could be
endangered if moved to The Hague, but tribunal doctors ruled
earlier this month that he is fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable that they are forcing Naletilic to travel
in such a bad health condition,'' Krsnik told The Associated Press.
''I will use all means to delay it,'' he said, but refused to
specify further moves.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman of the tribunal, Paul Risley, told the Jutarnji
list daily that they expect to be able to try Naletilic ''very
soon,'' adding that the court has provided guarantees for his
health.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia's new government, which took power in January, is
determined to extradite Naletilic but wants to be sure his health
will not suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certain that Naletilic will be extradited and tried in
The Hague,'' Foreign Minister Tonino Picula said recently. He added
that Croatia has asked the court to provide a plane-equipped with
medical equipment for Naletilic's transport as a condition to
lifting the suspension of his extradition.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word from the Justice Minister Stjepan
Ivanisevic -- who must sign off on the extradition -- and it was not
immediately clear whether the court provided the requested plane.
</P>
<P>
   Krsnik said he spoke to Ivanisevic recently, but the minister
had not yet made a final decision.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Co: More Lines Needed  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A weekend power outage that affected as
many as 1.6 million people in New Mexico and Texas could have been
avoided if the power company had been allowed to build more
transmission lines, a company spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Brown, a Public Service Company of New Mexico spokesman,
said the utility tried to get permission to build the additional
transmission lines in the mid-1990s but was met with local
opposition from residents who considered them an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent a lot of money and we were never able to erect a
single line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outage, New Mexico's biggest, shut down businesses, disabled
traffic lights and cell phones Saturday and left people scrambling
to find candles and flashlights from the northern town of Questa to
El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Workers responded quickly to the crisis, which left them far
busier Saturday than on New Year's Eve. They restored power in
about six hours, aided by their resurrection of a familiar routine:
Y2K drills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really do think the Y2K drills honed our response time,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Power from at least three generating stations in northwest New
Mexico and Arizona is transmitted on lines that bottleneck in
northwest New Mexico. A brush fire near the northern town of
Kirtland engulfed one of the lines Saturday afternoon, and smoke
particles that conduct electricity caused a short circuit, said Lt.
Edmund Neff, a volunteer firefighter with the Valley Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Fire then engulfed two of the poles supporting the lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''When smoke gets up in power lines, it'll make it act like a
lightning storm out there,'' Neff said. ''People said there were
explosions out there.''
</P>
<P>
   When automatic switches transferred the power to another line,
it was overloaded and it also shut down. Line after line overloaded
and shut down through the state like dominoes falling, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire apparently started with a controlled burn of dry
vegetation on Navajo land that got out of hand about 15 miles
southeast of Kirtland, Neff said. Strong winds in northwest New
Mexico also fanned the flames, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A message left at the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project office in
nearby Farmington wasn't immediately returned Sunday. No one
answered the phone at other Navajo offices.
</P>
<P>
   Neff said the fire was extinguished by about 7 p.m. Saturday.
The fire burned about 1,500 acres, he said, adding that none of the
poles on the three towers burned through. No firefighters were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   During the blackout, the electric company was able to route only
about half the electricity needed to power Albuquerque, which meant
some areas had to be cut off so such high-priority users as
hospitals didn't lose power entirely, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He said more high-capacity transmission lines would have
provided an alternate route for the power. Instead, about 1.3
million people in New Mexico lost their electricity. About 300,000
utility customers in El Paso also went without power Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in Frat House Fire in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A fire in an off-campus fraternity house
killed two people early Sunday, while others jumped to safety in
their underwear from a second-story window.
</P>
<P>
   The privately owned Tau Kappa Epsilon house, two blocks from the
Bloomsburg University campus, was destroyed in the 6 a.m. blaze.
Two bodies were recovered from the wreckage, but they were not
immediately identified.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know whether they are male or female,'' university
spokesman Jim Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   Two students escaped by jumping from a second-story window in
their underwear, and a third fled out the front door, police said.
All reported awakening and finding heavy smoke in the building; one
reported hearing a smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not immediately know how many people were in the
house, Hollister said. He said three residents were unaccounted
for, but could not say whether the two bodies were those of missing
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Two adjacent townhouses were also damaged, but no one in those
structures was injured. The cause of the fire was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, red-eyed students and curious onlookers
watched as fire officials and construction equipment examined the
rubble. The county coroner was also on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Another fraternity house fire killed five Bloomsburg students on
Oct. 21, 1994. A smoldering sofa was blamed for that blaze.
Batteries had been taken out of smoke detectors in the Beta Sigma
Delta house, a common practice during smoky parties.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results showed four of the students in the 1994 fire had
alcohol in their blood and two had traces of cocaine and marijuana
in their systems.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 13, 1992, one student died at Phi Kappa Theta fraternity
at California University in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a Jan. 19 fire in a dormitory at Seton Hall
University in New Jersey killed three students and critically
injured six others.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg, founded in 1839, is a state university about 100
miles northwest of Philadelphia with an enrollment of about 7,500.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer To Hit Aetna For Reparations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A New York attorney whose
great-great-grandmother was a slave in South Carolina says
businesses that profited from slavery should be made to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Daedria Farmer-Paellman, who spoke with The State newspaper of
Columbia for a story in Sunday editions, said Aetna Inc. was first
on a long list of businesses -- including textile, banking and steel
firms -- that she'll target for apologies and reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, apologized earlier
this month for selling policies in the 1850s that reimbursed slave
owners for financial losses when their slaves died. The Hartford,
Conn.-based company's public apology was prompted by an inquiry
from Farmer-Paellman.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer-Paellman wants Aetna to donate $1 billion to set up a
foundation benefitting minority education and businesses. She said
other businesses that benefitted from slavery also should
contribute to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna spokeswoman Joyce Oberdorf said her company would balk at
paying reparations, noting slavery was not illegal when the
policies were issued. ''It's unclear whether we ever made a dime on
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Baker, director of the Insurance Law Center at the
University of Connecticut School of Law, said it was a common
practice to guarantee slaves, including insuring them as cargo on
ocean voyages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never very pleasant to think about with 20th century
eyes, but Aetna wasn't unique in that regard,'' Baker said. ''When
you had a slave economy, it infected many facets of economic
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Several German companies paid reparations to Holocaust victims
for their use of Jewish forced labor during World War II, and
European insurance companies have been sued by relatives of
Holocaust victims for failing to pay life insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of private American companies for slavery
reparations is rare, but Farmer-Paellman said she planned to meet
with a group experienced at seeking Holocaust reparations.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Berlin, a University of Maryland history professor who
specializes in slavery, said efforts like Farmer-Paellman's are
forcing businesses to consider their past. ''This can be a very a
troubling question.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question more businesses may have to answer, said Randall
Robinson author of ''The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks'' and
president of TransAfrica Forum, a think tank specializing in
African, Caribbean and African-American issues.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he expects to see legal action taken against
companies in the future. ''From the reparations side of this, this
is the first salvo.''

<HEADLINE> Deforestation Worsened Flooding  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- The flooding that hit this
Indian Ocean island nation was made worse by deforestation,
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of the lush forest of Madagascar, a
Texas-sized island off southeast Africa, remains. Much of it has
been declared protected or made into national parks.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest shrinks each year as farmers slash and burn trees
and natural vegetation to plant rice and other crops. Every year,
some 494,000 acres of forest are destroyed, resulting in land that
is less able to absorb water and quickly erodes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forests on hillsides, like sponges, absorb the flow of water.
Deforestation thus worsens flooding in the valleys,'' said Andrew
Cooke of the National Environment Office.
</P>
<P>
   Recent survey flights over flooded areas reveal grassy hills
barren of trees and scarred by ugly red gashes where erosion has
exposed the soil. Outside the capital, hills are marked by giant
chunks of earth which have caved in on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction jeopardizes one of the world's most biologically
unique and diverse environments. Separated from the African
continent 160 million years ago and settled by humans only in the
past two thousand years, Madagascar has been home to exotic flora
and fauna, including the endangered lemur, large carnivorous plants
and miniature chameleons.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the northeast, the mudslides are due in part to
deforestation, but the sheer amount of rain was also dramatic,''
said World Wildlife Fund representative Jean Paul Paddack.
</P>
<P>
   The northeast town of Andapa, in a rice-growing region where
forests have been decimated to make way for crops, was hit
especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   In the area, 250 miles northeast of the capital of Antananarivo,
49 people died in mudslides or drowned in swollen rivers and 30
more are missing, said Paddack. Granaries with 400 tons of rice
stocks were flooded. The road into town is cut by mudslides.

<HEADLINE> UN Troops in S. Leone Rebel Area  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers have set up
operations in the heart of rebel-controlled Sierra Leone, a
breakthrough as the world body tries to bring a permanent peace to
this West African nation, U.N. officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers commander, Maj. Gen. Vijay Jetlay, said about
100 soldiers and military observers deployed Thursday to Kailahun,
a town in the diamond-rich eastern region controlled by the
Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   Jetlay, who visited Kailahun on Saturday, said much of the city
had been left in ruins by years of civil war and that many of the
town's civilians were hungry. He said engineers would improve the
roads as fast as possible to allow aid to get there quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels waged a bloody eight-year war for control of Sierra
Leone, until signing a July agreement that traded peace for a role
in a power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   But many rebels refused to turn in their weapons and repeatedly
blocked free movement of U.N. troops monitoring the peace. The
deployment in Kailahun marks the most significant move by
peacekeepers into rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   Cease-fire violations remain commonplace, but the deployment
gave rebels a chance to show it stood by the peace deal, said
Oluyemi Adeniji, U.N. special envoy to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Successive deployments in rebel-held territory will change the
image of the RUF to the outside world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels killed tens of thousands of people, and horribly
disfigured thousands more, in their campaign to gain power of
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabwe Farms Invaded  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Thousands of squatters ignored a judge's
order to leave white-owned farmland Sunday, deepening a
confrontation between descendants of British settlers and poor
blacks, many of them veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war.
</P>
<P>
   Police made no move to enforce Judge Paddington Garwe's order,
made Friday, for the squatters to abandon within 24 hours the land
they began occupying several weeks ago. Government officials
appeared to encourage the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the African people want land now, whatever judgment comes
from the courts or government, the liberation struggle continues,''
Information Minister Chen Chimutengwende said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd bussed in from Harare by President Robert Mugabe's
ruling ZANU-PF party reportedly marched through the Enterprise
Valley, 30 miles northeast of the capital, and warned farmers they
would be evicted and their land redistributed to black Zimbabweans.
The incident occurred on Saturday, according to a farming community
leader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 properties have been occupied since Mugabe lost a
referendum last month on a new constitution that would have given
him power to seize white-owned land without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   David Hasluck, executive director of the Commercial Farmers
Union, said state radio and television have refused to comply with
Garwe's order for them to broadcast details of his order.
</P>
<P>
   The occupations threaten production of the country's food and
major export crop, tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 white farmers, mostly the descendants of British
settlers, own about a third of the country's productive land. Known
as Rhodesia, Zimbabwe was a British colony before independence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the state has bought more than 2,000 white farms for
resettlement, but the program has been plagued by mismanagement and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The government has nearly 2 million acres of agricultural land
that has not been used for resettlement and mostly lies idle. The
government says it can't afford to parcel up the land into smaller
plots and install roads, water pipes and other vital
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Another St. Pat's parade, another warm reception for Giulianiupstate  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Marching in Buffalo's St. Patrick's Day
parade on Sunday, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani completed a
two-day, five-county campaign swing that demonstrated the political
importance of upstate New York in this year's Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown that while the number of undecided
voters in the race between Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton is
miniscule, it is largest in upstate New York, traditionally the
most conservative region of New York, but a place where residents
tend to be suspicious of things New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Parade officials made it tough for Giuliani to get close enough
to change any minds in Buffalo, though, advising him not to stray
from his place in line to shake hands even as Democratic Mayor
Anthony Masiello sprinted freely about.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, it's a Democratic city,'' Giuliani said at the parade's
end, where dozens of supporters held campaign signs and chanted
''Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to be too happy about this reception so
they're going to try to find ways to step all over it. The Clintons
are and the Democrats here,'' he said. ''I've been in politics a
long time. I can figure it out. This is a terrific reception for a
Republican candidate in a Democratic city and when I go home I will
know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Marching in his sixth parade in two weeks, Giuliani was greeted
with cheers of support along the entire route with only an
occasional shout of ''Hillary'' rising above the din of bagpipes
and applause.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime Sunday, Clinton's Senate campaign pointed out that
Giuliani's campaign was given $1,000 by a gun manufacturer whose
business was incorrectly listed in Giuliani campaign filings as
''Bushmaster Farms'' instead of ''Bushmaster Firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dyke of Windham, Me., was George W. Bush's finance
chairman in Maine but he resigned in July, saying he didn't want
his support for Bush to become an issue for anti-gun activists.
Dyke's company manufactures automatic weapons for government
agencies, semiautomatics for public use and a rifle widely used in
shooting competitions. His company was sued by a Los Angeles police
officer wounded during a high-profile gun battle with bank robbers
armed with semiautomatic assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, accused the mayor
of trying ''to hide a contribution from an assault weapons
manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Dyke contribution after the parade,
Giuliani accused the Clinton campaign of trying to deflect
attention from the warm receptions he had been receiving upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had ''no idea'' who Dyke is, and that he would
withhold a decision on whether to return the $1,000 contribution
until after he had reviewed the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of 150,000 contributors excuse me if I don't know all of
the names of the contributors,'' he told reporters. ''This has been
a terrific weekend for us so in order for you not to focus on the
terrific reception I got at the Erie County parade here in Buffalo,
they pick out some obscure name ... What was it a thousand-dollar
contribution? I guess we've raised now $13 or $14 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Before hitting Buffalo, Giuliani had breakfast with veterans in
Chemung County. On Saturday, he marched in a St. Patrick's Day
parade in Onondaga County, went to Jefferson County to attend
Watertown's Irish Festival, visit a gas station and speak at a
community forum. In Oneida County later Saturday, Giuliani visited
a rural gas station and spoke at a volunteer fire company's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, he continued his complaints about the
Clinton administration's failure to bring down high home heating
oil and gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year has gone by and he still hasn't stood up to OPEC,''
Giuliani said in Buffalo. President Clinton's call Saturday for
congressional approval of legislation to establish an oil reserve
for the Northeast, the mayor said, ''wouldn't have any impact on
anything for about six months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has oil reserves that he can sell right now and he's not
doing it,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired From Md. Standoff Home  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A murder suspect holding three people
hostage for a third day repeatedly fired bursts of gunfire out a
window at police Sunday while breaking off his telephone contact
with negotiators, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities tried to avoid agitating the suspect, who was
believed to be watching the ordeal on television.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Palczynski had been on the run since March 7, when police
say he kidnapped his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and killed the
couple she was staying with and a neighbor. A fourth person was
killed and a boy was wounded when Palczynski allegedly carjacked a
vehicle, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped unharmed; police would not disclose her
whereabouts. Palczynski later fled to Virginia, where he stole guns
and forced a man to drive him back to Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
   The five bursts of gunfire Sunday morning were the first signs
of activity since Palczynski took Whitehead's mother and two others
hostage Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported and police did not return his fire.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski stopped talking with negotiators for about an hour
and a half Sunday morning, and police moved in with an armored
vehicle and a bullhorn to urge him to resume communications.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joby, we need you to pick up the phone,'' an officer said over
the loudspeaker, using Palczynski's nickname. ''Come on Joby, pick
up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski responded with shots and the armored vehicle backed
away.
</P>
<P>
   He soon resumed talks, but then fired more shots, spokesman Bill
Toohey said. Later, police used a robot to send food into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our main strategy is patience, patience, patience,'' Toohey
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Palczynski returned to the area from Virginia, police
searched the area for more than a week. On Friday, he broke into a
house, tied up the occupants and stole three guns.
</P>
<P>
   He then shot his way into the home of Whitehead's mother, Lynn
Whitehead. Relatives said he was holding Lynn Whitehead; her
boyfriend, Andy McCord; and 12-year-old Brad McCord.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to characterize their negotiations with
Palczynski but confirmed that a psychiatrist was helping
negotiators. Police have said Palczynski has bipolar disorder,
often called manic-depression, which causes extreme mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old unemployed electrician also has a history of
convictions for assault and battery. Days before the killings, he
was charged with assaulting Whitehead but was released on $7,500
bail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he kept police in Idaho at bay for 16 hours following a
domestic violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced
out with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends say Palczynski has said that he would
shoot himself or make police shoot him rather than go back to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not allowed anyone in or out of the blue collar
suburb east of Baltimore since the standoff began.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who lives within view of the back of the house where
the hostages were being held made a run for it with her 11-year-old
son and 10-month-old baby Sunday morning after she heard the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been there since Friday,'' said an exhausted and
distraught Anna Day. ''I don't have anything. I need formula. I
need bottle liners. I need diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm scared to leave the kids. We've been sleeping on the
floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police urged residents to stay inside where it was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking people not to make a break. It is dangerous to go
out on the street,'' Toohey said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, friends and relatives called television
stations to urge Palczynski to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody cares about you. We love you very much,'' said Ron
Messman, who said he has been a friend of Palczynski since high
school. ''You need to clear your mind, put down your weapons, let
the hostages go. It's time to end this, buddy. You need to do it
peacefully and you need to do it quickly.''

<HEADLINE> TV Struggles With Standoff Coverage  </HEADLINE>
By TEDDIE WEYR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Television producers and reporters cooperated
with authorities' requests during a hostage standoff, giving their
coverage an important role in a drama that capped two weeks of
feverish coverage of an alleged murderer on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they knew Joseph Palczynski, who was holding three
people hostage since Friday night, was watching TV, which aired
numerous pleas from friends and family members for him to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do know he's responding constantly to television,''
Baltimore County Police spokesman Bill Toohey said Saturday, the
second day of the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours into the hostage drama Friday night, Toohey asked
WBAL-TV to interview him live on the air so he could issue a
''correction.'' The hostage drama began, Toohey said, when a
neighbor called 911, not Palczynski himself, as reporters had
initially been told. The reason for the update, he said, was
Palczynski had said WBAL-TV ''had been reporting it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, television stations went live with an appeal by
a lawyer and friend, David Henninger, to release the hostages. At
the direction of a TV reporter, he looked straight into the camera
of WBAL-TV, which police believed Palczynski was watching at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Police also asked stations to refrain from broadcasting certain
things that might upset Palczynski, who has a history of mental
illness and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police say he shot his way into the home of Lynn Whitehead, his
former girlfriend's mother, Friday night. He is accused of briefly
kidnapping his ex-girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, on March 7 and
killing a couple who had taken her in and a neighbor who tried to
help her. Police say a woman was fatally struck by a stray bullet
as Palczynski carjacked a vehicle the next day.
</P>
<P>
   David Parker, assistant news director at WMAR-TV, said police
asked the station not to air photos of Tracy Whitehead or the four
people he is accused of shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''My decision was to comply with that,'' Parker said. ''It was a
request. We did have the option of saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, the focus is not on the victims. The focus is
on Joseph Palczynski and getting those people out, and therefore
those pictures were not necessary,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally when police make requests, whether it's a hostage
situation, whether it's a bank robbery, whatever, our No. 1 concern
is to get the story out there,'' he said. ''However, in a situation
like this, where we have a man armed, suspected of killing four
people already and certainly others in danger, yes, we're going to
do what we can to make sure no one else gets hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Police asked TV crews on the scene Saturday night that they not
put Palczynski's father on the air for fear of agitating
Palczynski, who has told friends of problems with his father. One
station aired a taped interview with Joseph Palczynski Sr. in which
he appealed to his son to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Newman, vice president and general manager of WJZ-TV, said
news directors were, when time permitted, reviewing material before
it aired to make sure it was placed in perspective ''and most
importantly does not reveal any inside police strategy or tactical
information that would make what is a very difficult situation even
more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   TV stations repeatedly broadcast pleas from Palczynski's family
and friends Friday night and throughout the day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals from his grandmother and friends painted him as a victim
of his illness who is intelligent and loyal. And friends said that,
because Palczynski was always there for them, they were ready to
return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said he was unaware of police specifically asking that
appeals be aired. ''We have sought them out in most
circumstances,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors didn't get to apply violent offender law for inmatereleased early  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Because a convicted rapist was released from
prison without their knowledge, prosecutors weren't able to apply a
recent law that would have allowed them to seek to have Raymond
Alves committed to a psychiatric facility.
</P>
<P>
   Despite legal safeguards, Alves, who claimed to have raped and
killed more than a dozen women, was allowed to walk out of prison
March 9.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune has
acknowledged that state corrections employees violated numerous
procedures before releasing the 57-year-old from the Southern State
Correctional Center in Cumberland County.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those violations, prosecutors weren't aware that
Alves was being released and never got a chance to seek to have him
civilly committed as a sexually violent predator.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Gov., Christie Whitman called for a law making it
easier to confine sex offenders who had served their terms but were
still considered dangerous. The Legislature then passed the
Sexually Violent Predator Act.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the older law, which required a person to suffer from a
mental illness, the new law can be used to confine a person with a
mental abnormality or personality disorder that predisposes a
person to commit acts of sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the new law makes it easier to confine sex offenders
who have served their full sentences, violating the Constitution's
ban on double jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Furlong is one several private lawyers in the state who
defends sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know sex offenders aren't really mentally ill but we're
going to call them mentally ill to extend their prison terms -- the
Constitution be damned,'' Furlong said in Sunday's editions of The
Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, now a federal fugitive, served less than half of a
47-year sentence for the 1976 rape of a teen in Fair Lawn and the
assault of a Clifton teen.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Terhune appeared before the Senate Judiciary
Committee to explain Alves' release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, our own notification protocols and procedures were
not followed,'' Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune did explain what should have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Five months before any inmate convicted of a sex offense is due
to be released, a team of corrections personnel should begin a
review of his record. Personnel should include the prison
administrator and a licensed clinical psychologist who works for a
private company.
</P>
<P>
   But in Alves' case, the review did not begin until Jan. 11, two
months before his release. The review should have begun Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   When psychologists evaluated Alves, they overlooked details that
should have automatically made him a candidate for civil commitment
as a sexual predator, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   The two psychologists have been dismissed, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   If the psychologists had recommended that Alves be confined, a
psychiatrist would have reviewed their decision. If the
psychiatrist agreed, Alves' case would have been forwarded to
Attorney General John Farmer Jr. Farmer would then determine
whether Alves should have been confined as a sexually violent
predator.
</P>
<P>
   Under an alternative method, the Bergen County prosecutor could
have sought to use the state's older civil commitment laws to keep
Alves off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of which method is sought, the attorney general and
county prosecutor must be notified at least 30 days before any
inmate convicted of a sex offense is released.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections department mailed Alves' notification the day he
was released.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities on Wednesday obtained an arrest warrant for
Alves, allowing FBI officials across the country to assist in the
manhunt.

<HEADLINE> North Jersey case raises questions about regulatory system  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Allegations that a North Jersey dentist who
was disciplined in 1987 for causing the death of a patient recently
broke a 5-year-old boy's leg while treating his tooth have focused
new attention on the way the dental profession is regulated in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson County prosecutors are investigating the Feb. 22 incident
in which Mario Rivero of North Bergen allegedly suffered a broken
leg while undergoing treatment at Dr. Kevin P. Ward's Union City
office. The boy's mother said the dentist squeezed the boy's leg so
hard he broke it. No criminal charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, 42, is also being sued by Rockaway Township resident Cathy
Candelieri and her daughter Amanda Schwab, 8, who claim Ward broke
the girl's arm while pulling her tooth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ward had his license suspended for a year in 1987 after a
4-year-old Jersey City girl died under anesthesia in his office.
During a state hearing, Ward admitted to ''a significant error in
professional judgment,'' and was ordered to complete 60 hours of
classes on administering anesthesia and recognizing medical
emergencies. But a board spokeswoman said he never completed the
training.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Dentistry, an arm of the Division of Consumer
Affairs, oversees the dental profession in New Jersey and metes out
discipline for professional misconduct. Its members are mostly
dentists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the board revoked no licenses. It temporarily
suspended the licenses of only 11 dentists -- less than 0.2 percent
of the 7,200 who practice in New Jersey. Four dentists voluntarily
surrendered their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The latest allegations against Ward, in addition to his past
dealings with the Board of Dentistry, drew sharp criticism from one
state lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's an example of the system, the system needs to be
changed,'' Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk, R-Bergen, told The
Record of Hackensack for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's shocking,'' said Vandervalk, who chairs the Assembly
Health Committee. ''His license should have been revoked if he was
ordered to undergo training and didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's reasons for its actions at that time are ''lost to
the mists of time,'' Mark Herr, director of the Division of
Consumer Affairs, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Herr conceded that there may have been times in the past when
professional boards have gone too lightly on licensees out of
reluctance to punish a ''brother professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The dental board consists of eight dentists, a dental hygienist,
a state government representative and two public members.
</P>
<P>
   Herr said he has instructed the regulatory boards that the top
priorities for discipline are cases involving injury, sexual
misconduct or insurance fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He said the board is investigating the latest charges brought
against Ward. It next meets in Newark on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's innocent until proven otherwise. We're doing what we need
to do to get to the bottom of whether the allegations are true,''
Herr said.

<HEADLINE> Dangling Tanker Closes Fla. Highway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A gasoline tanker hanging over the
edge of Interstate 95 closed southbound lanes for more than seven
hours Sunday in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker rammed about 20 yards of guardrail in a downpour
around 8:30 a.m., said city fire division chief Richard Murphy. The
tractor ended up touching the ground on an embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Tow truck operators stabilized the tank with two straps to keep
it from falling and hold it steady while 40 gallons of fuel was
drained.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Highway Patrol closed the southbound lanes and
routed normally heavy traffic onto city streets. Northbound traffic
was reduced to two lanes. Roads reopened around 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the tanker was being treated for head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The accident distracted motorists, causing one minivan to
collide with the guardrail. The driver suffered minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Romania Loses $100M Over Danube  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romania has lost $100 million in
revenue and been forced to lay off most of its shipping employees
due to the continued blockage of the Danube river, the prime
minister was quoted as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearing the Danube is a matter of extreme importance for
Romania,'' Mugur Isarescu was quoted as saying by the private news
agency Mediafax.
</P>
<P>
   The river was blocked after NATO destroyed bridges in Novi Sad
during its 78-day bombardment of neighboring Yugoslavia that ended
in June. Yugoslav authorities have not cleared the debris from the
river, which has blocked traffic coming from Ukraine, Romania and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Isarescu was quoted in Brussels, where he is to present his
country's economic strategy to the European Union. Romania wants to
be an EU member. Isarescu likely will ask for financial aid to help
clear up two recent chemical spills originating in Romanian mines
that left major rivers polluted in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Isarescu said shipping agents had lost $100 million and
four-fifths of employees in the shipping industry had been laid off
due to the river blockage. He said the river crisis also was
jeopardizing Romania's chances of privatizing its fleet.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh Exhibit Protested  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- They called him a mass murderer. They
denounced him as a ''lewd monster.'' But by the hundreds, the
demonstrators made it clear that there's one thing Ho Chi Minh
shouldn't be: art.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit featuring portraits of the late North Vietnamese
leader is stirring emotions in the San Francisco Bay Area, once a
hotbed of anti-Vietnam War sentiment and now home to a large
community of Vietnamese-Americans, many of them fervently
anti-Communist.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 1,500 protesters, most of them Vietnamese, turned
out for the exhibit's opening at the Pacific Bridge Contemporary
Southeast Asian Art Gallery. They weren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not art. This is propaganda,'' said Thomas Nguyen, 42,
who left Vietnam in 1984 and lives in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam veteran C. David Thomas created the 35 identically
sized, multicolored collages assembled like a quilt on the wall of
the gallery. Ho Chi Minh figures prominently in each panel.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, of Newton Centre, Mass., said his goal was to stimulate
a re-examination of Ho Chi Minh, who died in 1969 before the war
between North Vietnam and U.S.-backed South Vietnam ended.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's a very complex leader who we need to take a
closer look at. I don't think he was evil,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The artist said he was inspired by his service for the United
States as a combat engineer in the central Vietnamese highlands and
by his approximately 30 visits to Vietnam since then.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters weren't interested in the artist's effort to peel
back Ho Chi Minh's reputation for brutality and examine him anew.
They said they had lived through his rule and had made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations against the month-long exhibit began Friday
night, when about 500 protesters gathered for a candlelight vigil.
On Saturday, the demonstrators came equipped with loudspeakers,
many South Vietnamese flags and portable toilets. Some held signs,
one reading ''Ho Chi Minh, Lewd Monster and Mass Murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest also drew a number of Vietnam veterans. John Lingar,
president of the Oakland Chapter of Vietnam War Veterans of
America, said he was disappointed when he found out Thomas was a
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would think that he would have a little more respect for
his brothers who were killed over there,'' Lingar told the San
Francisco Examiner. ''Ho Chi Minh is no better than what Hitler was
to the Jews.''

<HEADLINE> F-16 Crashes Durin Texas Air Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- An Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed
Sunday afternoon while performing maneuvers as part of an air show
near Kingsville Naval Air Station, killing the pilot, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was identified as Maj. Brison Phillips. He was a
member of the 78th Fighter Squadron from Shaw Air Force Base near
Sumter, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in a field about six miles north of the naval
base about 12:45 p.m., said Navy Master Chief Jim Rostohar.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came down in an open field, basically in the middle of
nowhere,'' Rostohar said.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi resident John Rubino saw the plane hit the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a bright, red and orange fireball,'' Rubino said.
''You could hear it and feel the shock of the concussion. It felt
like someone hitting you in the chest.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the air show, which was to include a performance by
the Navy's Blue Angels, was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were searching the wreckage for a reason why the
plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsville is about 30 miles southwest of Corpus Christi.

<HEADLINE> Map Lamp Eyed in Swissair Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swissair has told investigators
probing its 1998 airline crash off Nova Scotia about overheating
problems with a pilot's map light in the cockpit ceiling, an
airline spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Donzel said Swissair technicians found signs of
burning around the lamps of other MD-11 airliners last November.
They immediately told the Canadian Transportation Safety Board,
which is looking for the cause of the September 1998 crash that
killed 229 people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots reported smoke in the cockpit before losing contact
with air controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times on Saturday quoted Jim Harris of the board as
saying Canadian investigators were sorting through the debris of
Flight 111 to try to find the map light from that plane.
</P>
<P>
   The board has recovered 98 percent of the aircraft, most of it
in small pieces, from the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the board said it has not established any direct
connection at this time between Flight 111 and possible problems
with the lamps.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane's manufacturer, Boeing Commercial Aircraft Co., has
issued an alert service bulletin, urging airlines using MD-11
jetliners to check the map lights often until they can be replaced
and to install fire-resistant tape to protect insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is considering whether to
make such checks mandatory. FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler did not
say when such a directive might be issued.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian board has identified other possible causes of fire,
such as arcing of electrical wiring, that might have caused the
crash, but has said the investigation probably will take two years
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Donzel said the problem with the reading lamps, which use a
halogen bulb that develops high heat, was discovered when
technicians were replacing Mylar insulation with more
fire-resistant Tedlar insulation.
</P>
<P>
   They found the halogen bulbs had sometimes been touching the
insulation, reducing the flow of air needed to cool off the lamps,
he said. The lamp fixture had melted and burned through in some
cases, he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Exchange Deal Merge Made  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An agreement reportedly has been reached to
merge the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders
confirmed Sunday that a deal had been brokered, The Wall Street
Journal reported on its Web site Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The three boards gave a green light for the merger,''
Pierre-Yves Jeholet was quoted as saying. The merger was to be
announced Monday in London, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would create the second-largest exchange in
Europe behind the London Stock Exchange, with a combined market
capitalization of $2.32 trillion, the newspaper said. The London
exchange has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion, according to
year-end 1999 figures compiled by the Federation of European Stock
Exchanges. Deutsche Boerse would be a distant third with $1.36
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Didier confirmed Wednesday the three exchanges were in
''advanced'' talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels stock exchange board would have to approve any
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Eyed in Nicaragua Ambush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- Members of a Nicaraguan leftist
paramilitary group are suspected in the ambush killing of the
group's former leader, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Andres Castro United Front allegedly killed
former leader Edmundo Olivas because of personal differences,
police spokesman Carlos Bendana said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bendana identified only the band's alleged leader, Franklin
Hernandez Granados, who was still at large.
</P>
<P>
   Olivas and another man, Francisco Congreras were shot to death
Thursday near Boaco, 55 miles northeast of the capital, Managua.
Olivas' wife was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   The front, made up of a band of ex-Sandinista soldiers, was one
of several groups of former combatants from both sides of
Nicaragua's 1980s Contra war. The groups rearmed to forcibly demand
government aid or engage in banditry.
</P>
<P>
   The front officially disarmed in 1997 under an agreement with
the government. Police said some members kept their weapons and
continue to commit robberies and kidnappings in the central part of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Northern Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 5.4 struck near the northern coast of Japan early Monday, but
there were no reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake hit under the seabed of the Pacific Ocean about 30
miles off the coast of rural Miyagi Prefecture, or state, the
Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The tremor was centered at a depth of about 50 miles, but the
agency said there was no dangers of tsunami, or tidal waves, set
off by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was most strongly felt in a town of Nakayama, 192
miles north of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a 4.2 magnitude tremor hit Niigata Prefecture, which
faces the Sea of Japan, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo. There
were no reports of injuries or damages.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> No.6 Penn St. 75, No.16 Auburn 69  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Look at it through Rene Portland's
eyes, and Penn State's 75-69 victory over Auburn in the second
round of the NCAA tournament seemed almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''This really shows the growth of what these kids have been able
to do,'' the Penn State coach said Sunday. ''To go from nothing (in
1997) to the NIT champions (in 1998) to the second-round last year,
and now to the regionals -- that's what they're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Shepherd had 19 points, including five 3-pointers in her
second straight big NCAA tournament game, as No. 6 Penn State beat
the 16th-ranked Tigers for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd felt much better about this game, and not just because
the victory sends Penn State to the regional semifinals for the
first time in four years. The last time out against Auburn, she
went 0-7 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in my shooting slump,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   She's out of it now: Shepherd had 18 for the Lions in their
first-round victory Friday over Youngstown State.
</P>
<P>
   Maren Walseth added 17 and Andrea Garner and Helen Darling had
15 points each for the Lady Lions (28-4), who waved and hugged at
center court as they improved to 15-0 at home. Penn State faces the
winner of Illinois-Iowa State in the Midwest Regional semifinal in
Kansas City on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Hamilton had 19 points and Lori Nero added 16 for Auburn
(22-8), which lost in the second round for the third time in a row.
</P>
<P>
   With Penn State clinging to a 64-62 lead with under two minutes
to play, Auburn missed five straight shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' Walseth grabbed two misses, was fouled and made one
of two shots. Then Andrea Garner was fouled with two seconds on the
shot clock, and made both shots to put Penn State ahead 67-62 with
a minute to play. The Lions went 8-of-8 from the line in the final
minute to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The tight finish reminded Garner of the Big Ten final, when
Purdue outlasted Penn State at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a great job of remaining calm, something we didn't do
against Purdue,'' she said. ''Today was the day we either showed it
or didn't show it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions beat Auburn for but for the first time in the NCAA
tournament. The Tigers had knocked Penn State out in 1996 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers rallied from a six-point deficit midway through the
second half. Working the ball around, they got a basket from each
of the five players on the court during a 13-0 spurt to go ahead
54-47. Hamilton capped the run with a strong basket inside and
screamed, high-stepping up the lane in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But with 12:26 to play, Hamilton picked up her fourth personal
foul, and Auburn couldn't open a bigger lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought emotionally, we just got a little to hot,'' Auburn
coach Joe Ciampi said. ''There were two critical fouls after that.
We got a little too aggressive defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They never quit,'' Portland said. ''There were times when it
looked like it was going to get away from us, but it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers struggled all game with Penn State's half-court press
and had 16 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State jumped to an 11-2 lead, then started hitting
3-pointers. Shepherd hit four and Chrissy Falcone added three more
as the Lions went 7-of-11 from 3-point range in the first half. But
Auburn shot 52 percent to stay within 40-37 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Darling had nine assists for the Lions. Garner had 14 rebounds,
tying a career high.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee 65, Connecticut 51  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Minus Khalid El-Amin, defending champion
Connecticut never stood a chance against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled by a sprained right ankle, El-Amin was largely
ineffective for the fifth-seeded Huskies, who looked lost Sunday in
a 65-51 loss to fourth-seeded Tennessee in the second round of the
NCAA South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I bring the energy and demeanor to this team,''
El-Amin said. ''And without me, we weren't able to go offensively
like we are normally able to.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin scored only three points, while longtime rival Tony
Harris scored 18 points for the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had to be tough for them not to have their general,''
Tennessee center C.J. Black said. ''It looked hard for them to fill
those shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols capitalized on his absence by turning Harris loose.
</P>
<P>
   The two junior guards have a prickly relationship dating to
their days of AAU basketball and without El-Amin to guard him,
Harris had free rein through the lane. He made just four of his 11
shots, but was able to draw numerous fouls and finished 9-of-12 at
the line.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he got no satisfaction in winning the most important
battle the two have ever waged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel sorry for him because he got hurt at a big time for
them,'' Harris said. ''But he has a big heart and he will bounce
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (26-6) got past the second round for the first time.
The Vols were bounced out of the tournament in either the first or
second round five straight times.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee will play North Carolina, a surprise winner over
top-seeded Stanford, on Friday in the regional semifinals. Losses
by Stanford, No. 2 Cincinnati and No. 3 Ohio State made Tennessee
the highest remaining seed in the wide-open South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols, whose Knoxville campus is located just 200 miles away
from Birmingham, celebrated at center court while the crowd chanted
''SEC! SEC!'''
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like the home team here in Birmingham,'' said Vincent
Yarbrough, who finished with 14 points. ''We tip our hats to the
crowd, which played a huge part in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (25-10) missed a chance at its eighth trip in 11
years to the regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Without a healthy El-Amin, the Huskies never even threatened the
Vols. Connecticut's leading scorer and floor leader sprained his
ankle in the first-round win over Utah State and still was bothered
by it against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He took just two shots and played only 13 minutes -- grimacing
through most of them while tenderly favoring the heavily wrapped
ankle -- and could only somberly look on from the bench as his
teammates struggled without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just couldn't get into an offensive flow,'' Connecticut
coach Jim Calhoun said. ''We're so dependent on Khalid's energy on
offense that we couldn't get anything established. But we do depend
on Khalid offensively probably too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut got 17 points from Albert Mouring and 14 from Kevin
Freeman. Center Jake Voskuhl had only two points in the final game
of his college career and Connecticut's 51 points was its lowest
total of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously this is not the same team without Khalid,''
Tennessee coach Jerry Green said. ''But our team still played
pretty well, probably as good as we played all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, one of just two Tennessee seniors, added 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin, who averages 32.5 minutes, started but played just six
minutes in the first half. Without him, the Huskies fell behind
32-22 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   His only basket of the day, a long 3-pointer with 13:38 to play,
pulled Connecticut within four at 38-34. But Jon Higgins answered
with a 3 at the other end El-Amin then left the floor in the middle
of an 8-0 Tennessee run that pushed the lead back to 46-34.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to will us and the next time down on defense, I think
reality hit me,'' he said. ''I wasn't able to get around a screen
and my man hit another 3.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin came back on the court soon after, but it was too late
for the Huskies -- who never got the lead under double digits again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dominance, the Vols were still outrebounded 37-26,
but made up for it by forcing 15 turnovers and grabbing seven
steals.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Gives Cubs' Wood the OK  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Even the Chicago Cubs team doctor was
thrilled with Kerry Wood's first start.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Schafer examined the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year on
Sunday and said his reconstructed elbow is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said keep going in the right direction,'' Wood said. ''It
was a very short meeting. He checked me out and said everything
looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood started Saturday for the first time since reconstructive
elbow surgery last April, giving up one hit in one inning against a
Chicago White Sox split squad. He threw 15 pitches, 10 for strikes,
and his velocity ranged from 93-97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The arm felt fine during the game, and Wood said he woke up this
morning without soreness or stiffness.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very, very pleased with his exam today. Those were the words
of Dr. Schafer,'' general manager Ed Lynch said. ''We will go
day-to-day here. He passed the test yesterday, felt outstanding
today and we'll just take it on a daily basis from here. But all
indications are it was a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood is scheduled to pitch again Thursday, but he'll throw in a
minor-league game down the street at the Cubs' minor league
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got some guys they want to look at,'' Wood said. ''No
big deal. I'll just go down there and pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lynch, ''We want to put him in a more controlled
environment, and we have pitchers who are going to open the season
with us who need the work. We want them to pitch here Thursday
against Seattle and get their innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood will skip the team's trip to Japan and will probably start
the season the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, who tied a major league record in just his fifth career
start, striking out 20 in a nine-inning game, has made swift
progress since he had ligament replacement surgery on April 8,
1999. While it takes most pitchers who have reconstructive surgery
18 months to recover, he began throwing off the mound during the
winter and was throwing to hitters by the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   He started throwing curveballs last week and made his first
start Saturday -- one year and five days after tearing elbow
ligaments in his only spring training appearance last year.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma St. 75, Pepperdine 67  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Eddie Sutton got his wish for Oklahoma
State's seven seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Paced by center Fredrik Jonzen's 21 points and two clutch
3-pointers from Joe Adkins, the Cowboys broke open a close game in
the second half Sunday and beat Pepperdine 75-67 to advance to the
East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted so much to get to the Sweet 16 with this team because
those seniors have been a very special group,'' said Sutton, the
Cowboys coach whose last two appearances in the NCAA tournament
ended with second-round losses to a top seed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them that I thought they were good enough to get there,
and when you get there anything can happen. It's down to 16
ballclubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State will face Seton Hall on Friday in Syracuse, N.Y.
The 10th-seeded Pirates beat second-seeded Temple 67-65 in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State and Pepperdine were coming off 20-point victories
in the first round. The third-seeded Cowboys (26-6) beat
14th-seeded Hofstra 86-66 and No. 10 Pepperdine (25-9) defeated No.
6 Indiana 77-57.
</P>
<P>
   This one was a fight for 30 minutes. The Waves, who press at
every turn, befuddled the Cowboys at the outset and built a 5-1
lead. Sutton had seen enough and called a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we came out, (the Waves) had great energy level and we
were down,'' said Cowboys point guard Doug Gottlieb, who finished
with nine assists and five points. ''And Coach, instead of going
nuts like some coaches do, sat us down and said, 'Look, now let's
start playing. You obviously know they can play. Relax and play.'''
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys did. Jonzen's strong inside game -- he scored 12
of his points in the first half -- allowed them to take a 35-31 lead
at the break.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked about that before the game, saying we had to get the
ball inside,'' said Jonzen, who had 13 points and 11 rebounds
against Hofstra. ''The high post was wide open. That was one of the
main keys -- getting the ball inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game was tied six times before Oklahoma State finally
came to life midway through the second half with the score 44-44.
And the Cowboys did it as the Waves struggled from long range.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine stunned Indiana by hitting 9-of-17 3-pointers. But
the Waves missed their first 10 of the second half Sunday, going
scoreless for four minutes. Pepperdine finished the game 7-of-32
from 3-point range, while the Cowboys hit half of their 14 and shot
49.1 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were getting even better looks than we did against
Indiana,'' said Tezale Archie, who had 14 assists and seven points
but missed six 3-pointers. ''We got all the looks we wanted. We
just didn't knock them down. A few of them were contested, but I
thought we did a real good job of kicking off to the next guy who
was open.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Waves were misfiring, the Cowboys pulled away with a
16-4 run. Adkins, who had 18 points, administered the crushing
blows, hitting two straight 3-pointers, the second from the right
corner boosting the lead to 65-50 with 3:25 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done it in his four years here,'' Gottlieb said. ''He got
the clutch award from Coach last year. Sometimes he comes out and
takes some wild shots, but when it comes to (crunch) time and we
need a bucket and he's open, it's going in.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Brandon Armstrong hit two 3s and Archie hit another
to break the drought in the final two minutes, the Waves were too
far behind to regroup. They left with their heads high, even if
they didn't join West Coast Conference rival Gonzaga in the next
round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows about Pepperdine now,'' Archie said. ''When we
first got here there wasn't but two Pepperdine fans -- our athletic
director and his wife. By the end, half the building was chanting
for us. We made a statement. Hopefully, we can start a dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' defense worked well enough to hold Indiana
All-American A.J. Guyton to three points on 0-for-2 shooting in the
first round, and it worked pretty well against the Cowboys. Desmond
Mason, who had 30 points against Hofstra, had 13 against the Waves.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong led Pepperdine with 19 points and Nick Sheppard had
13.

Three Killed in Fraternity Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A fraternity at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania
caught fire early this morning, killing three people inside while others jumped
to safety out of second-story windows. Six male fraternity members were sleeping
in the Tau Kappa Epsilon house when the fire broke out about 6 a.m. Three
managed to get out safely, university spokesman Jim Hollister said. The cause of
the fire was not immediately clear. The two-story wooden house is located in a
hilly neighborhood about two blocks from campus.

Shots Fired From Md. Standoff Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A murder suspect holding three people hostage inside a
house today repeatedly fired bursts of gunshot out a window at police while
breaking off telephone contact with negotiators, officials said. Joseph
Palczynski had been on the run since March 7, when police say he kidnapped his
girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and killed the couple she was staying with and a
neighbor. The five bursts of gunfire this morning were the first signs of
activity since Palczynski took Whitehead's mother and two others hostage Friday
night. No injuries were reported and police did not return his fire.

Waco Standoff Re-Enacted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas (AP) -- Aircraft circled, tanks rumbled and combat-garbed
shooters fired off rounds at a Texas military base today in a high-stakes field
test to resolve whether federal agents shot at the Branch Davidians in the
waning moments of the 1993 Waco standoff. Government officials have always
insisted that their forces fired no shots on the siege's final day, when the FBI
launched a tear-gassing operation designed to end the 51-day standoff. But
Branch Davidian plaintiffs suing the government for wrongful death insist
today's field test will confirm their experts' analysis: that rapid-fire bursts
of light appearing on the FBI's 1993 aerial infrared surveillance footage
represent gunfire from government positions into the Davidians' retreat.

Clinton Arrives in India
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton opened the first trip to troubled
South Asia in 22 years by an American president Sunday night and immediately was
forced to scale down his visit to Bangladesh when the Secret Service raised
concerns about a side trip to a rural village. Presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart cited concerns raised by security experts and another official said
there were fears about taking the president by helicopter over a dense, tropical
forest where security could not be guaranteed. Clinton's six-day journey to
India, Bangladesh and Pakistan brought him to one of the poorest regions of the
world struggling with population growth, malnutrition, illiteracy and poor
health.

Ho Chi Minh Exhibit Protested

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- An exhibit featuring portraits of the late North
Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh is stirring emotions in the San Francisco Bay
Area, once a hotbed of anti-Vietnam War sentiment and now home to a large
community of Vietnamese-Americans. On Saturday, 1,500 protesters, most of them
Vietnamese, turned out for the exhibit's opening at the Pacific Bridge
Contemporary Southeast Asian Art Gallery. Artist and Vietnam veteran C. David
Thomas said his goal was to stimulate a re-examination of Ho Chi Minh, who died
in 1969 before the war between North Vietnam and U.S.-backed South Vietnam
ended.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an effort to get more Hispanics online, a Spanish-English

<HEADLINE> Florida 93, Illinois 76  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MACENKA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Lon Kruger left the Florida Gators
behind four years ago. On Sunday, they turned the tables on him.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's 93-76 victory over Illinois in the second round of the
NCAA East Regional put the Gators into the round of 16 for
back-to-back years for the first time in school history. It also
improved the Gators to 4-1 in NCAA tournament play under coach
Billy Donovan, who succeeded Kruger following his departure to lead
the Fighting Illini.
</P>
<P>
   ''They pretty much had control of a lot of things throughout,''
Kruger said of the Gators, who harassed Illinois into 39-percent
shooting and 15 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Florida will play top-seeded Duke on Friday in the regional
semifinals in Syracuse, N.Y. Duke beat Kansas 69-64.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman reserve guard Brett Nelson had 16 points and three
steals to spark the Gators on a day when they had to go through a
crucial first-half stretch without top player Mike Miller, benched
with foul troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brett made great decisions,'' Donovan said. ''I don't think
people truly appreciate how far that kid has come from the first
day he set foot on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson hit four of his six attempts from 3-point range, adding
more punch to a fast-paced Florida style that proved to be too much
for Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''This feels really good,'' Nelson said, ''but we can't look
back on these two games. We want to keep advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had 13 of his 19 points in the second half as
fifth-seeded Florida (26-7) defeated the Fighting Illini for the
first time in their five meetings. Teddy Dupay added 16 points and
Udonis Haslem 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of guys who can do a lot of different
things,'' Miller said. ''That's our style.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-seeded Illinois (22-10) got 27 points from Cory Bradford
but little help from anyone else. Sergio McClain, with 11 points,
was the only other Illinois player in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Frank Williams, who had a season-high 21 points to lead
Illinois past Pennsylvania in the opening round, got into
first-half foul trouble against Florida and didn't score until
nearly 23 minutes into the game. He finished with six points.
Marcus Griffin, who had 17 in the opening round, contributed just
nine against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't pleased with the way we performed,'' Bradford said.
''We could have done a better job, but it's too late to do that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida was trailing by two points when Miller went to the bench
with 4:50 left in the first half after being assessed his second
personal foul. But Nelson scored five points and Matt Bonner added
four as the Gators closed the half with a 13-5 run for a 40-34
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators were particularly effective in the second half,
drawing Illinois into a running game and forcing nine turnovers.
Florida 54 percent in the half and scored 53 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our style of play was very, very effective,''
Donovan said. ''The game really started to get going up and down
the floor in the second half, and that was to our liking.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida opened the second half by getting two 3-pointers from
Dupay and one from Nelson to stretch it to 53-41.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois was unable to significantly cut into its deficit and
Nelson pushed Florida's lead to 67-53 with 11:01 left when he stole
an errant pass and hit a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Gators pushed it to 14 again, this time at 74-60 on a
17-foot jumper by Miller with seven minutes remaining, Illinois was
unable to cut its deficit to single digits the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who pushed their lead as high as the final margin,
sealed it by making 11 of 14 free throws in the last 3:14.
</P>
<P>
   ''Florida just never gave us much of a crack to make a run,''
Kruger said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Highways May Destroy Forest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Government plans to repair and pave
four highways could devastate a swath of Amazon rain forest more
than twice the size of Portugal, a newspaper said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The work on 2,170 miles of roads in four states is part of an
economic development program known as ''Advance Brazil.'' Folha de
Sao Paulo reported that it could destroy up to 72,000 square miles
of rain forest over the next 25 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's report was based on a study prepared by three
non-governmental organizations -- two Brazilian and one American,
the Woods Hole Research Center of Massachusetts. Calculations were
based on historical patterns of deforestation that occurred in
other Amazon highways.
</P>
<P>
   The plans ''endanger the sustainable development of the Amazon
region,'' said Thomas Lovejoy, a World Bank environmental
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The study also warns that another 74,800 square miles could be
destroyed by small farmers and cattlemen who are attracted by the
project and use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land.
</P>
<P>
   The government told the paper it would not comment on the study
but was dedicating ''special attention'' to the possible negative
impact of its development projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- DeAnn Evans, an associate professor of
journalism at the University of Utah and the former managing editor
of the Deseret News, died of a heart attack Sunday, her brother
said. She was 59.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in media criticism and ethics, Evans spent her
career in Salt Lake City, where she built a reputation as a devoted
educator.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was almost an icon,'' said James Shelledy, editor of The
Salt Lake Tribune. ''She was great teacher and she was a mentor to
many, many journalists, especially female journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans graduated with honors from the University of Utah and
earned a master's degree in journalism at Northwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the Deseret News in 1967 and worked her way up the
ranks before being named managing editor in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Evans left the Deseret News to pursue her doctorate at the
University of Utah and then became associate professor at the
University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include her brother, State Sen. R. Mont Evans,
R-Riverton, and sister, Sherrel Evans Burgoyne.
Edward F. Knipling
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Edward F. Knipling, who helped develop the
radiation method of sterilizing insects harmful to plants, animals
and humans, died of cancer Friday at his home in suburban
Arlington, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling's work was praised as an efficient, pesticide-free way
of insect control and has been credited with eliminating the
screwworm fly in North America and with it a threat to the
livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
   Knipling and colleague R.C. Bushland used radiation to sterilize
male screwworm flies, which then were released to mate with female
flies in the wild. The unfertilized eggs did not hatch into larvae
and the screwworm population eventually was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Before his retirement in 1973, Knipling was director of the
entomology research division of the Agriculture Department's
Agriculture Research Service. He won numerous awards, including the
National Medal of Science in 1966.
Stanley Ralph Ross
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stanley Ralph Ross, an actor-producer who
also wrote more than 250 television show episodes, died Thursday of
cancer, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said he was 64, but an entry in the book ''Who's Who
in America'' gave his birth date as July 22, 1940, making him 59.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Ross was a freelance photographer, a
copywriter and advertising executive before discovering what he
once called his ''true vocation'' of writing.
</P>
<P>
   Over a 30-year career, Ross wrote dozens of scripts for
television movies and TV series such as ''The Monkees,'' ''The Man
from U.N.C.L.E.'' and ''Columbo.'' He wrote 32 episodes of the
1960s ''Batman'' series.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed or created TV shows such as the 1970s hit
''Wonder Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross co-wrote the book, music and lyrics for a musical,
''Chaplin,'' produced at the Los Angeles Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   As an actor, Ross appeared on television in ''Falcon Crest'' and
many other series. His films included ''Tony Rome.''
Tom Simmons
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Tom Simmons, a retired Dallas Morning News vice
president and executive editor whose nearly half century with the
newspaper included the ambush of Bonnie and Clyde and the
assassination of John F. Kennedy, died Friday of complications from
congestive heart failure. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson Simmons III started his journalism career at
age 15, volunteering as an apprentice reporter at the Dallas
Journal, a sister publication of The News.
</P>
<P>
   He was transferred to the News as a copy reader and headline
writer in 1934 and got his first byline covering the ambush of
legendary outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow on May 23, 1934.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army from 1944 to 1946, he returned to the
paper and advanced to night news editor, news editor, and in
January 1963, assistant managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, he and another News manager orchestrated the paper's
coverage of the Kennedy assassination.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Simmons was named vice president and executive editor.
He retired in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons is survived by his wife, Jean Adelaide Webb Simmons, a
former travel editor for the News who still writes a travel column
for the paper; a daughter, a son-in-law, and three grandchildren.
Herman B Wells
</P>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Herman B Wells, the Indiana University
president and chancellor who led the school through spectacular
growth, died Saturday of heart complications. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, a Jamestown native who graduated from Indiana in 1924,
was named IU's acting president for the 1937-38 school year at the
age of 35. He was appointed as IU's 12th president in 1938 and
served until 1962. He also served as interim president briefly in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   He oversaw the growth of IU from a pre-World War II campus of
about 9,000 students to a major Midwestern institution that had
grown to more than 20,000 students by the 1960s. The school now has
more than 90,000 students on eight campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who had served as chancellor since he stepped down as
president, led Indiana through a time of major change on campus and
within the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and '50s, he stood by Indiana professor Dr. Alfred
Kinsey, who shocked the world when his books on human sexuality
provided the first publication of scientific data on sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey founded the Kinsey Institute For Research in Sex, Gender
and Reproduction on IU's Bloomington campus in 1947. The center is
still a frequent target for critics nearly 50 years later.

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Panel Examines Sex Case  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- As long as man has waged war, rape
has been an outrageous weapon in his arsenal. And as long as man
has sought to punish war crimes, rape has been near the bottom of
his list.
</P>
<P>
   An international tribunal, which has been investigating Balkan
war crimes since its establishment in 1993, wants to turn things
around.
</P>
<P>
   A rape trial opening here Monday marks the first time an
international court tackles sexual enslavement. The case is a
keystone in the most ambitious attempt yet to acknowledge a woman's
vulnerability to the excesses of war.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serbs Radomir Kovac, Dragoljub Kunarac and Zoran Vukovic
are charged with rape, torture, enslavement and outrages upon
personal dignity in the Foca case, named after the city where the
crimes allegedly took place. All three have pleaded innocent to war
crimes and crimes against humanity, which carry a maximum life
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, the defendants operated
''quasi-brothels'' -- or ''rape factories'' -- in a local school, a
sports hall and a construction workers' barracks in Foca, southeast
of Sarajevo, in the summer of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Nightly, women and girls, some as young as 12 years old, were
allegedly forced to have sex with soldiers and paramilitary
fighters. They were gang-raped, tortured and often forced to give
birth, Prosecutor Dirk Ryneveld wrote in his pretrial brief. Adding
to the humiliation, the women were ordered to perform household
chores for their victimizers, Ryneveld says.
</P>
<P>
   Although the total number of victims is not given, 72 women were
detained at the sports hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of them suffered permanent gynecological harm due to the
sexual assaults. At least one woman can no longer have children,''
the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 rape victims are expected to testify at the trial.
They will be protected by privacy measures, and are identified in
court documents with codes: FWS-48, FWS-50, FWS-75.
</P>
<P>
   Although Foca was the most notorious case of systematic rape in
the 1992-95 war, there were reports of rape by all sides in dozens
of camps across Bosnia. In 1993, a European Community commission
estimated 20,000 rape victims in the conflict. The Bosnian
government put the figure at 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   One Muslim woman who submitted to rape during the Bosnian war to
protect her daughter told a researcher ''it's something you never
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I carry it around with me in my heart, in my soul,'' the woman
was quoted as saying in the book ''War Crimes against Women,'' by
scholar Kelly Dawn Askin. ''I think of it when I go to bed, and I
think of it when I get up. It doesn't let you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Rape is as old as war itself. Since the battles of ancient
Greece, commanders have given soldiers license to rape women, who
were seen as a spoil of war.
</P>
<P>
   But what distinguished the Bosnian war was that women were prime
targets in ''ethnic cleansing'' campaigns because of their role in
propagating identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is new, and extraordinarily horrifying, is that many of
the rapes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia
(were) ... committed with the intent to impregnate, in an effort to
destroy a particular ethnicity,'' Askin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks -- a soldier of one ethnicity raping a woman of
another -- reportedly led to thousands of forced pregnancies and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Since medieval times, attempts have been made to curb the
practice of wartime rape, at least on paper. In the 14th and 15th
centuries, Kings Richard II and Henry V of England declared rape a
capital offense. The Lieber Instructions outlawed rape by U.S. Army
soldiers during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But even when rape was outlawed, it was low on the list of
priorities. It was not prosecuted at the 1945-46 Nuremberg trial of
Nazi officials. At the Tokyo trial of Japanese leaders, rape was
not recognized as a full-fledged war crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's part of the reaction of patriarchal society,'' said
Patricia Viseur Sellers, the tribunal's rape expert. ''Men are
tortured and that's important. Women are raped and that's not
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The only known prosecution of forced prostitution occurred in
1948 in Batavia, now Jakarta, Indonesia. A Dutch colonial court
tried Japanese military defendants for raping Dutch women prisoners
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav tribunal is making every effort to put sexual
crimes at the top of its list of priorities. At least half the
staff is female; one of the three judges in the Foca case is a
woman, Florence Mumba of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, along with its Tanzanian-based sister court
judging perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, has recognized
the massive and methodical nature of the sexual assaults in both
cases. Judges have acknowledged rape not only as an act of torture
and a war crime, but also as crime against humanity -- a more
serious offense encompassing systematic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been immensely successful at prosecuting sexual violence
at both tribunals,'' said Sellers, formerly an attorney at the
Philadelphia public defender's office.
</P>
<P>
   For feminist activists and many legal scholars, however, that's
not enough. They want systematic rape recognized as an inherently
genocidal crime and insist that women be named a protected group in
an annex to the 1948 Genocide Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Says Catharine A. MacKinnon, a University of Michigan law
professor who has worked with Bosnian rape victims: ''Genocide
denial seems particularly tempting to some when the victims are
women and the atrocities are sexual.''

<HEADLINE> I.U. Chancellor Wells Dies at 97  </HEADLINE>
By REX W. HUPPKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Herman B Wells, the popular Indiana
University president and chancellor who led the school through
spectacular growth and helped integrate Big Ten athletics, has
died. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chancellor Wells was, quite simply, a great man, one of the
exceptional figures in higher education this century,'' Indiana
President Myles Brand said in a statement released Sunday. Wells
died Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who graduated from Indiana in 1924, was named IU's acting
president for the 1937-38 school year at the age of 35. He was
appointed as IU's 12th president in 1938 and served until 1962. He
also served as interim president briefly in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Wells oversaw the growth of the school from a pre-World War II
campus of about 9,000 students to a major Midwestern institution
that had grown to more than 20,000 students by the 1960s. The
school now has more than 90,000 students on eight campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who had served as chancellor since he stepped down as
president, ended segregation at tables in the Indiana Memorial
Union and helped integrate Big Ten athletics. He quietly urged
basketball coach Branch McCracken to recruit Bill Garrett, who in
1948 became the first black to play a varsity sport in the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Intensely interested in international affairs, Wells was
appointed a special adviser on liberated areas for the State
Department and was a member of the allied missions for observation
of Greek elections at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, President Eisenhower appointed Wells as a delegate to
the 12th General Assembly of the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 89, Hawks 85  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Michael Finley scored 20 of his 31 points in the
first quarter and the Dallas Mavericks held Atlanta scoreless over
the final 3:50, beating the slumping Hawks 89-85 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, playing its first game since top scorer Isaiah Rider
was placed on waivers, had gone more than 10 quarters without
leading until Jason Terry hit a 3-pointer with 7:14 remaining for
an 81-80 edge.
</P>
<P>
   It was short-lived. Finley worked inside for a basket with 6:49
to go, putting the Mavericks ahead to stay. He hit another jumper
with 4:09 remaining for an 86-83 lead, and it was the final field
goal for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams kept misfiring after Jim Jackson's basket with 3:50
left pulled the Hawks to 86-85. They combined for nine straight
misses and two turnovers before Finley was fouled with 18.8 seconds
to go. He made both free throws to give the Mavs an 88-85 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson missed a 3-pointer, Greg Buckner grabbed the rebound and
was fouled. He made one free throw with 11.8 seconds left to seal
the victory, the fourth for the Mavericks in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has lost 11 of 13, including four in a row.
</P>

   Finley hit 7-of-11 from the field in the opening period,
including all three of his 3-point attempts, for the
highest-scoring quarter allowed by the Hawks this season. He played
only three minutes in the second quarter, failing to score, but
added 11 points in the second half.

<P>
   Alan Henderson had a season-high 24 points for Atlanta, but
didn't score in the fourth quarter. Jackson added 20 points.

<P>
Notes: Jackson had blood on his pants as he came on the court at
the start of the game, forcing him to go back to the locker room
for a new pair. Rookie Dion Glover made his first NBA start. ...
The game drew only 10,377, smallest of the season at Philips Arena.
... The Mavericks had only three turnovers. ... Dikembe Mutombo,
leading the NBA in rebounding, had 18 boards for the Hawks. ...
Dallas, the top-shooting 3-point team in the league, went 7-of-17
outside the arc. ... Atlanta's LaPhonso Ellis has eight rebounds,
leaving him one short of 3,000 for his career.

More Shots Fired From Standoff Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A murder suspect holding three people hostage for a
third day fired shots out a window tonight after several hours of calm following
a morning burst of gunfire. Authorities tried to avoid agitating the suspect,
who was believed to be watching the ordeal on television. Joseph Palczynski had
been on the run since March 7, when police say he kidnapped his girlfriend,
Tracy Whitehead, and killed the couple she was staying with and a neighbor. Five
bursts of gunfire Sunday morning were the first signs of activity since
Palczynski took Whitehead's mother and two others hostage Friday night. At least
six rounds were fired from the home Sunday evening.

Brazil Highways May Destroy Forest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Government plans to repair and pave four highways
could devastate a swath of Amazon rain forest more than twice the size of
Portugal, a newspaper said today. The work on 2,170 miles of roads in four
states is part of an economic development program known as ''Advance Brazil.''
Folha de Sao Paulo reported that it could destroy up to 72,000 square miles of
rain forest over the next 25 to 30 years. The study also warns that another
74,800 square miles could be destroyed by small farmers and cattlemen who are
attracted by the project and use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land.

in the Tau Kappa Epsilon house when the fire broke out about 6 a.m. Three
managed to get out safely, university spokesman Jim Hollister said. The cause of
the fire was not immediately clear. The two-story wooden house is located in a

Israeli Cabinet OKs Pullback Map

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A land transfer that stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks for five weeks easily cleared a final hurdle Sunday with Israel's Cabinet
approving maps for the withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank. The
transfer will take place Tuesday, just before negotiators convene near
Washington for peace talks, and will leave the Palestinians in control of 41
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians had suspended the talks last month
after it became clear Israel was not going to give them populated suburbs of
Jerusalem as part of the troop withdrawal. The revised maps approved Sunday give
the Palestinians three suburbs near, but not abutting Jerusalem.

Clinton Opens Trip To India

   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton opened the first trip to troubled
South Asia in 22 years by an American president Sunday night and immediately was
forced to scale down his visit to Bangladesh when the Secret Service raised
concerns about a side trip to a rural village. Presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart cited concerns raised by security experts and another official said
there were fears about taking the president by helicopter over a dense, tropical
forest. Clinton's six-day journey to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan brought him
to one of the poorest regions of the world struggling with population growth,

made Friday, for the squatters to abandon within 24 hours the land they began
occupying several weeks ago. Government officials appeared to encourage the
squatters. The occupations threaten production of the country's food and major

<HEADLINE> Duke 69, Kansas 64  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Shane Battier said it was nothing
special, just good, old-fashioned defense that allowed Duke to
advance in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Battier had 21 points, eight rebounds and a career-high eight
blocked shots Sunday as the Blue Devils beat Kansas 69-64 in the
second round of the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get into the tournament, teams don't know your
tendencies all the time, so something that may not be as effective
in the ACC all of the sudden becomes a lot more effective here,''
said Battier, whose previous high for blocks was seven.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the case today. They didn't think I was a great
shot-blocker and they took it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake. Duke, owner of the nation's top-scoring offense,
relied on its defense in the second half, holding Kansas to
32-percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''You look at the stats and you probably said we didn't play
well,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose club shot 37 percent
and had a season-high 23 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we played really well. It was a game that we forced
a lot of mistakes on them and they forced us to make a lot of
mistakes. It wasn't like mindless turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Carlos Boozer made the go-ahead follow shot with 53.5
seconds left and stole Nick Bradford's pass 29 seconds later to
help seal Krzyzewski's 50th NCAA tournament victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't see Nick usually do that, but that's college
basketball,'' Kansas coach Roy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Krzyzewski caught a glimpse on TV of North
Carolina beating Stanford, the second No. 1 seed to fall before the
round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared his club could be next after getting off to its
worst start of the season, shooting 2-for-15 with six turnovers as
the eighth-seeded Jayhawks built a nine-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought they knocked us back a bit,'' Krzyzewski said. ''We
hadn't faced a team that played that good defense in the lanes. All
the sudden it looked like we were playing horribly. I told our team
we weren't playing bad, but that it was going to be a high-level
game and to adjust to it because Roy's team wasn't going to let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke (29-4) will face fifth-seeded Florida on Friday in the
regional semifinals in Syracuse, N.Y. The Gators beat fourth-seeded
Illinois 93-76.
</P>
<P>
   The game between Duke and Kansas, two teams with 53 combined
tournament appearances, was filled with intense play and a
first-half shouting match between Krzyzewski and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Each downplayed the exchange after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably looked worse than it was,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Hinrich equaled his season high with 12 points for Kansas,
which lost the 1991 championship game to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (24-10) almost shot itself out of contention in the
opening 8{ minutes of the second half, going 1-for-12 from the
field, but used 13 Duke turnovers to go ahead 64-63 with 1:18 left
on a three-point play by Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-9 Boozer, who finished with 15 points and 13
rebounds, made his two key plays, and Chris Carrawell and Jason
Williams each hit two free throws over the final 24.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took it as a challenge to come in and try to play more
physical than them and be real active inside,'' said Boozer.
</P>
<P>
   Hinrich's 3-point attempt with seven seconds left could have
tied it, but the shot bounced off the rim, and Carrawell, Duke's
only senior, grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great look. I thought it was going in,'' said
Hinrich, holding back tears. ''You just don't know how bad I wanted
to hit the shot for all my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinrich had three 3-pointers in the opening six minutes to
provide Kansas with a spark, but he picked up his third foul with
8:36 left and sat out the rest of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute after Hinrich went to the bench, Krzyzewski
and Williams got into it near the Duke bench during a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a former North Carolina assistant under Dean Smith,
walked the length of the scorer's table to find out what Krzyzewski
was questioning, and the two coaches exchanged words before being
separated by a referee.
</P>
<P>
   Duke had only two buckets in the first 9:11, but Kansas'
turnovers allowed the Blue Devils to crawl back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't been down too many times this year,'' Carrawell
said. ''For us to keep fighting and to keep staying with it, that
shows we're not going to go down easy.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the half, the Jayhawks had 12 turnovers, two
starters were in foul trouble, and the game was tied at 35.
</P>
<P>
   Duke averaged 12 3-pointers over its last seven games, but was
1-for-10 from behind the arc in the first 20 minutes and finished
just 2-for-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like to compete and I felt that this year we could have
competed harder and been tougher,'' Williams said. ''It was like I
was preaching to them all the time. Yet, when we got here, I really
felt that we did that.''

<HEADLINE> Miami 75, Ohio St. 62  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Miami Hurricanes are earning respect
and adding to the school record books with every NCAA tournament
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hemsley scored 24 points as Miami upset third-seeded Ohio
State 75-62 on Sunday in the South Regional to advance to the round
of 16 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (23-10) had never won an NCAA tournament game before last
season, let alone two in the same year. The loss spoiled the
Buckeyes hopes for a return trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again we are swimming in uncharted waters,'' Hurricanes
coach Leonard Hamilton said. ''It feels kind of good. Each time we
win a game, each time we take another step forward, we're making
history for our program.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-seeded Miami will play seventh-seeded Tulsa in the South
Regional semifinals Friday in Austin, Texas. Tulsa beat
second-seeded Cincinnati 69-61.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Tyler added 20 points for Miami, and John Salmons 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to build that tradition and mystique the way the
Kentuckys and Connecticuts have,'' Hemsley said. ''This is just a
great step.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Miami won a share of the Big East regular season title,
it was given a No. 6 seed in the tournament. The Hurricanes weren't
happy about it at the time, but haven't let it affect them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to put a number on it, but if we play defense and
execute like we did today we can play a few more games,'' center
Mario Bland said.
</P>
<P>
   Scoonie Penn led the Buckeyes (23-8) with 19 points, eight of
them in a 90-second span late in the game after Miami had taken a
13-point lead. Michael Redd added 13 before fouling out with 4:17
left to play, and George Reese had 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough,'' Penn said. ''We felt we were a team that could
have moved on, but we didn't play well enough today to move on and
that hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Hurricanes scrapped their way to a 41-26 rebounding
advantage and outshot the Buckeyes, hitting 26-of-51 (51 percent)
to Ohio State's 20-of-56 (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Miami never let Ohio State get into the offensive flow it used
to route Appalachian State in the first round Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're every bit as good a defensive team as we've
played all year,'' Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley's back-to-back 3-pointers gave the Hurricanes a 56-51
lead with 6:16 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley fired another 3-point attempt on the next possession to
beat the shot clock, and Mario Bland snared the long rebound. He
passed to Tyler, who hit a 15-footer to make it 58-51.
</P>
<P>
   Redd, the Buckeyes' leading scorer, picked up two fouls in a
span of 18 seconds and left with 4:17 to play.
</P>
<P>
   A basket and two free throws by Salmons made it 62-51 with four
minutes to go, and Tyler added a field goal to make it 64-51.
</P>
<P>
   Miami closed the first half with a flurry.
</P>
<P>
   With just seconds left, Redd picked off a pass at midcourt and
soared in for a dunk, which he slammed off the back of the rim.
Ohio State's Brian Brown, trailing the play, got the rebound and
promptly ran over Hemsley for a charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes quickly inbounded and Salmons launched a long
3-pointer that beat the buzzer for a 36-31 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a big play,'' O'Brien said. ''What can you say? He
didn't miss it on purpose.''

<HEADLINE> No.5 Notre Dame 95, GWashington 60  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- The only thing George Washington did
right was get Notre Dame's Ruth Riley into foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that glitch, the fifth-ranked Irish had few problems
beating the Colonials 95-60 Sunday night in the Mideast Regional
second round, led by Niele Ivey's 23 points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Notre Dame's third trip in four years to the Sweet
Sixteen wasn't pretty. The Irish (27-4) committed 25 turnovers in
an ugly game that featured 53 fouls and 74 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But George Washington (26-6) couldn't get much going, even when
Riley was in foul trouble. The Colonials shot a horrid 17-of-60
from the field and committed 19 turnovers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing by 18 at halftime, the Colonials made a run just
once in the second half, closing to 54-39 with 13:12 left. But
Notre Dame went on an 18-5 run and just kept pouring it on,
maintaining a lead around 30 most of the final period.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonials struggled from the beginning, hitting three of
their first 22 shots. But with Riley in foul trouble early,
Danielle Green took over, scoring all 16 of her points in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish went up 43-25 at the half after Green hit a pair of
free throws with 7.1 seconds left, Monique Hernandez stole the
inbounds pass and Julie Henderson put back her miss before the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Riley still managed 14 points and 10 rebounds in limited playing
time, while Henderson scored 14 and Alicia Ratay had 11 for Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Elisa Aguilar scored 15 to lead George Washington, while Marlo
Egelston had 13.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame will play the winner of Monday night's game between
Tulane and Texas Tech in the Sweet Sixteen.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Hopes To Temper Market Moves  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Stocks plunged Monday amid fears
President-elect Chen Shui-bian could push Taiwan into a war with
China, but they didn't fall as far as the law allows.
</P>
<P>
   Prices dropped by 3.1 percent in the first few minutes of
trading -- as Taipei's market reopened following Saturday's election
that swept Chen to power, ending more than a half-century of
governance by the ruling Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Shares could have dropped as much as 3.5 percent under emergency
measures announced Sunday night by Finance Minister Paul Chiu.
</P>
<P>
   The Weighted Price Index was off by 271.19 points at 8,492.08
after about 15 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Taiwan's political upheaval as a market threat similar in
magnitude to September's devastating earthquake, Chiu decided to
halve the normal 7 percent limit for one-day stock drops for the
next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chiu did not alter the daily limit of 7 percent increases,
however.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said it would intervene and buy shares if
necessary to try to prop up prices and the Taiwan dollar, but it
was not clear in the early going whether the government rescue
funds had been active in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan dollar was marginally weaker against the U.S. dollar
in heavy trading volume as Taiwan's central bank intervened to
maintain stability. The Taiwan dollar had slipped a tenth of a
percentage point, trading early Monday at the rate of 30.798 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Bearish analysts had said Sunday that stock prices would go
down, although some said that after a day or two of serious drops
investors might start seeing some good buying opportunities, as
they have in the past when Taiwan faced various calamities.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's win could aggravate tensions with China, which is
disturbed by his party's pro-independence stance. China views
Taiwan as a rebel province and says it must reunify with the
mainland at some point.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is how many days of steep selling we're going to
see,'' said Peter Kurz, the top executive in Taiwan for Wall Street
investment bank Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the big sellers may have bailed out last week,
when Taiwan spent the equivalent of $3.3 billion to contain a share
slide. Prices stabilized but never recovered from the spooky loss
of 6.6 percent in one session, finishing the week with a drop of
7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   China responded Saturday night to Chen's election by issuing a
conciliatory wait-and-see statement -- which stood in stark contrast
to Beijing's earlier saber-rattling -- and that could help prevent a
massacre on the market, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was swept to power in large measure on his promise to
attack the ''black gold'' system of corruption that has permeated
Taiwanese political life.
</P>
<P>
   That could threaten some of the cozy ties between the
Nationalist Party, which has controlled Taiwanese politics for more
than half a century, and many traditional businesses including
banks and factories run by staunch Nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The more recent superstars of Taiwanese commerce, the island's
world-beating semiconductor plants, are seen as being more
independent and less vulnerable to any coming shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen will find himself up against a legislature dominated by
Nationalists for at least two more years, and any resulting
paralysis in government could thwart efforts already under way to
reform Taiwan's banking system, liberalize its markets and revamp
its corporate laws, Kurz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chen is going to break some of the business behavior patterns
of the past,'' Kurz said. ''The basic modus operandi of how you do
business here in Taiwan is going to change. Chen is going to be a
reformer, and some of the cozy ties between business and government
from the past will change.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be good long-term, but any radical changes will
undoubtedly cause some pain at first.

<HEADLINE> Three Dead in Frat House Fire in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A fire in an off-campus fraternity house
near Bloomsburg University killed three people early Sunday, while
others jumped to safety in their underwear from a second-story
window.
</P>
<P>
   Five male fraternity members and an alumnus of the fraternity
who was visiting for the weekend were sleeping in the Tau Kappa
Epsilon house when the fire broke out at about 6 a.m. The alumnus
and two of the fraternity members managed to get out safely,
university spokesman Jim Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister said it was too soon to tell whether the bodies were
those of the missing students. He said the victims would be
identified through dental records.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't set in with me until I went down to the scene,''
said Jason Starling, a member of the university's Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity. ''You had people out there camping out. You had the
(surviving) brothers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. The two-story
wooden house is located in a hilly neighborhood about two blocks
from campus.
</P>
<P>
   Red-eyed students in sweatshirts huddled in small groups and
talked quietly as fire officials and construction equipment sifted
through still-smoking ruins. A neighboring white three-story home
was scorched, and police said it sustained severe damage inside.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg University President Jessica Kozloff said the
building was owned by the fraternity and had been maintained well.
She said the university had revised its procedures to offer
education and training for off-campus students after a fraternity
house fire in 1994 killed five students.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are young adults who do make decisions on their own
about their lifestyle and where they're going to live,'' Kozloff
said. ''We can't protect them from everything.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials cleared the house for occupancy after noting a
dozen code violations in October, including a battery missing from
a smoke detector, five electrical heaters being run on an
inadequate electrical system, a missing doorknob and an empty fire
extinguisher, said code enforcement officer Dean Van Blohn. He said
the violations had been corrected by late January.
</P>
<P>
   The house was required to have three smoke detectors, Van Blohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you that if we discover that this occurred
because of any negligence ... we will certainly take measures to
make sure it doesn't happen again,'' Kozloff said.
</P>
<P>
   Two escaped by jumping from a second-story window in their
underwear, and a third fled out the front door, police said. All
reported awakening and finding heavy smoke in the building; one
reported hearing a smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Classes have been canceled for two hours Monday morning, when
the university president will address the students.
</P>
<P>
   Tau Kappa Epsilon, dormant on the Bloomsburg campus for some
years, was restarted in 1997 with 18 members. It was in good
standing with the university and the fraternity's national
headquarters, Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   Another fraternity house fire killed five Bloomsburg students on
Oct. 21, 1994. A smoldering sofa was blamed for that blaze.
Batteries had been taken out of smoke detectors in the Beta Sigma
Delta house, a common practice during smoky parties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a Jan. 19 fire in a dormitory at Seton Hall
University in New Jersey killed three students and critically
injured six others.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg, founded in 1839, is a state university about 100
miles northwest of Philadelphia with an enrollment of about 7,500.

<HEADLINE> Wide Open NCAA Hits Second Week  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NICHOLSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tournament of upsets and overtimes is running out of big
names.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, Cincinnati, Temple and defending champion Connecticut
lost Sunday, and Duke needed a late basket and steal from freshman
Carlos Boozer to avoid yet another shocker.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Wisconsin stunned No. 1 Arizona and Gonzaga upset
second-seeded St. John's in the West, the 2000 NCAA tournament
proved it is one of the most wide open ever.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, ranked No. 1 for much of the season, dropped out
Sunday with a 60-53 loss to North Carolina in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is numbing to think the season is over,'' Cardinal coach
Mike Montgomery said after the loss that left as many No. 10 seeds
in the field as No. 1s.
</P>
<P>
   Since seeding started in 1979, the only other time two No. 1s
didn't reach the round of 16 was 1981, when DePaul and Oregon State
failed to survive the first week.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries played a big role in Sunday's games.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati couldn't overcome the loss of Kenyon Martin, and
Connecticut was lost with Khalid El-Amin slowed by an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the All-American center who broke his leg in the
Conference USA tournament, could only watch in despair as Tulsa
beat second-seeded Cincinnati 69-61 in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard when you can't help,'' Martin said. ''It is a
helpless feeling. It's very tough in this room right now. It's
something that can't be explained in words.''
</P>
<P>
   With point guard El-Amin hobbled, Tennessee beat Connecticut
65-51 in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I bring the energy and demeanor to this team,''
El-Amin said. ''And without me, we weren't able to go offensively
like we are normally able to.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall found a way to beat second-seeded Temple after
Shaheen Holloway, the hero of the Pirates' first-round victory over
Oregon, injured his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Shine, Holloway's backup, hit the winning basket in overtime
as the Pirates beat Temple 67-65 in the East. Shine scored a
career-high 26 points, including the deciding 3-pointer with 18
seconds left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just tried to step up when I saw him go down,'' Shine said.
''I was just ready for my opportunity. When I got into the game we
were kind of down. I just wanted to provide a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall will play Oklahoma State in the regional semifinals
in Syracuse, N.Y. Oklahoma State beat Pepperdine 75-67. In the
other semifinal, Florida will play Duke, a 69-64 winner over
Kansas. Florida beat Illinois 93-76.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Regional semifinals in Austin, Texas, on Friday,
North Carolina will play Tennessee, and Tulsa will face Miami.
Miami beat Ohio State 75-62.
</P>
<P>
   The West and Midwest semifinals are Thursday. In the West in
Albuquerque, N.M., Wisconsin will face LSU, and Gonzaga will play
Purdue. In the Midwest in Auburn Hills, Mich., Michigan State will
play Syracuse, and Iowa State will face UCLA.
</P>
<P>
EAST
At Buffalo, N.Y.
Seton Hall 67, Temple 65, OT
</P>
<P>
   Shine was 7-for-11 from 3-point range, and Seton Hall finished
with an East Regional-record 15 3-pointers in 30 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Rimas Kaukenas added 18 points for the Pirates (22-9). Mark
Karcher led Temple (27-6) with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Temple coach John Chaney saw yet another season end without
reaching his first Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team certainly had a lot more talent and a lot more depth
than any team I've had since I've been involved, but your best team
isn't always the team that wins,'' the 68-year-old coach said.
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma St. 75, Pepperdine 67
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Jonzen scored 21 points as third-seeded Oklahoma State
broke open a close game in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Adkins added 18 points for Oklahoma State (26-6). Brandon
Armstrong led Pepperdine (25-9) with 19 points. Pepperdine was
7-of-32 from 3-point range, while Oklahoma State made half of its
14 attempts.
</P>
<P>
At Winston-Salem, N.C.
Duke 69, Kansas 64
</P>
<P>
   Shane Battier had 21 points, eight rebounds and a career-high
eight blocked shots for Duke (29-4) in a rematch of the Blue
Devils' victory in the 1991 championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Boozer made the go-ahead follow shot with 53.5 seconds left and
stole Nick Bradford's pass 29 seconds later to help seal coach Mike
Krzyzewski's 50th NCAA tournament victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Hinrich had 12 points for Kansas (24-10).
</P>
<P>
Florida 93, Illinois 76
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Brett Nelson had 16 points and three steals to help
Florida advance to the final 16 for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators (26-7) are 4-1 in NCAA tournament play under coach
Billy Donovan, who succeeded Lon Kruger following his departure for
Illinois four seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Miller led Florida with 19 points. Cory Bradford had 27
points for Illinois.
</P>
<P>
SOUTH
At Birmingham, Ala.
North Carolina 60, Stanford 53
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Joseph Forte hit two huge 3-pointers in the closing
minutes for eight-seeded North Carolina (20-13).
</P>
<P>
   Forte finished with 17 points, sparking a decisive 10-0 run and
punctuating his effort with a game-ending dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cota added 10 assists, seven points and seven rebounds to
help the Tar Heels record their 30th straight 20-victory season.
</P>
<P>
   David Moseley scored 17 points for the Cardinal (27-4).
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 65, Connecticut 51
</P>
<P>
   Tony Harris scored 18 points as fourth-seeded Tennessee (26-6)
took advantage of El-Amin's ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin was largely ineffective for the Huskies (25-10). He
scored only three points, and took just two shots in 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
At Nashville, Tenn.
Tulsa 69, Cincinnati 61
</P>
<P>
   Eric Coley had 16 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for Tulsa
(31-4).
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow, did we play down the stretch,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self
said. ''They're a terrific team even without Kenyon. There should
not be an asterisk beside this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Mickeal had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Cincinnati
(29-4), and Ryan Fletcher, starting in Martin's place, had 13
points.
</P>
<P>
Miami 75, Ohio St. 62
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Hemsley scored 24 points as Miami upset third-seeded Ohio
State to advance to the round of 16 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Tyler added 20 points for Miami (23-10), and John Salmons
had 13. Scoonie Penn led Ohio State (23-8) with 19 points, eight in
a late 90-second span after Miami had taken a 13-point lead.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers 59, St. Joseph's 39  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- Rutgers limited St. Joseph's to its
lowest point total since the 1982-83 season in posting a 59-39
victory in the second round of the NCAA women's tournament Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory in the West Regional advanced No. 2 seed Rutgers
(24-7) to the round of 16 for the third straight year and prevented
10th-seeded St. Joseph's (25-6) from reaching that stage for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, which lost in the final eight last year to eventual
national champion Purdue, will face either Alabama-Birmingham or
Mississippi State on Saturday in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The 39 points were the lowest for the Hawks since a 66-33 loss
to Cheyney State on Feb. 10, 1983. Cheyney State was coached by C.
Vivian Stringer, Rutgers' current coach.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's shot 23 percent and made just 13 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Davalyn Cunningham scored all 10 of her points in the second
half, as the Scarlet Knights turned a four-point halftime lead into
a rout. Tasha Pointer had 16 points and Usha Gilmore added 12 for
Rutgers, which was limited to 36 percent shooting (21-of-58).
</P>
<P>
   Angela Zampella had 12 points for the Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's leading scorers, Susan Moran and Jana Lichnerova,
weren't factors, finishing with seven and nine points,
respectively. They combined for 38 in a first-round win over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's came into the game with the nation's second-leading
defense, giving up 52.9 points, and Rutgers was No. 4 at 55 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers rarely gave St. Joseph's a good look outside and clogged
the middle with Cunningham and Tammy Sutton-Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its woes on offense, St. Joe's defense kept it in the
game until the second half.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Lichnerova, the Atlantic 10 Conference player of
the year, cut Rutgers' lead to 23-22 in the opening seconds of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights responded with a 23-7 spurt, during which
Cunningham scored all her points and Sutton-Brown added five.
Rutgers limited the Hawks to 3-for-18 shooting and forced six
turnovers during the spurt.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph's previous low this season was 53 points in a loss to
Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven lead changes and two ties in the first half,
which ended with Rutgers ahead 23-19.
</P>
<P>
   It was a physical game. Less than 30 seconds in, Lichnerova was
hit below the left eye going for a rebound and she played the rest
of the way with a black welt.

Suspect Fires More Shots in Maryland
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- Shots burst again from a Maryland home this evening
where a murder suspect has been holding three people hostage since Friday.
Joseph Palczynski had been on the run since March 7, when police say he
kidnapped his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and killed the couple she was staying
with and a neighbor. Five bursts of gunfire this morning were the first signs of
activity since Palczynski took Whitehead's mother and two others hostage Friday
night. At least six rounds were fired from the home tonight.

Taiwan Shares Down Amid Uncertainty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Stocks plunged Monday amid fears President-elect Chen
Shui-bian could push Taiwan into a war with China, but they didn't fall as far
as the law allows. Prices dropped by 3.1 percent in the first few minutes of
trading -- as Taipei's market reopened following Saturday's election that swept
Chen to power, ending more than a half-century of governance by the ruling
Nationalist Party. Seeing Taiwan's political upheaval as a market threat similar
in magnitude to September's devastating earthquake, Finance Minister Paul Chiu
decided to halve the normal 7 percent limit for one-day stock drops for the next
two weeks.

Charge Against Clinton Possible

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said today he is adding
investigators to help him determine whether to file criminal charges against
President Clinton. It marked the first time that Ray, who took over for Kenneth
Starr in October, has publicly discussed the possibility that Clinton might be
prosecuted for his statements and actions in the Monica Lewinsky matter. He said
on ABC's ''This Week'' that the five-year, $50 million investigation that began
with Starr's look at the Clintons' Whitewater real estate dealings is far from
over.

Highways May Destroy Brazil Forest
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Government plans to repair and pave four highways
could devastate a swath of Amazon rain forest more than twice the size of
Portugal, a newspaper said today. The work on 2,170 miles of roads in four
states is part of an economic development program known as ''Advance Brazil.''
Folha de Sao Paulo reported that it could destroy up to 72,000 square miles of
rain forest over the next 25 to 30 years. The study also warns that another
74,800 square miles could be destroyed by small farmers and cattlemen who are
attracted by the project and use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land.

   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A fraternity at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania
caught fire early this morning, killing three people inside while others jumped
to safety out of second-story windows. Six male fraternity members were sleeping
in the Tau Kappa Epsilon house when the fire broke out about 6 a.m. Three
managed to get out safely, university spokesman Jim Hollister said. The cause of
the fire was not immediately clear. The two-story wooden house is located in a
hilly neighborhood about two blocks from campus.

'Brockovich' Holds Court at Movies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julia Roberts won an easy verdict from moviegoers as her
legal-eagle drama ''Erin Brockovich'' debuted atop the weekend box office with
$28.2 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. ''Erin Brockovich'' is
based on the real-life story of a California woman who took a clerical job with
a legal firm and uncovered a pollution scandal involving Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric
Co. Brockovich led a crusade for 650 residents whose water was contaminated by
the utility and won a $333 million settlement. The sci-fi rescue thriller
''Mission to Mars,'' last weekend's No. 1 movie, slipped to second place with
$10.9 million.

the opening period, including all three of his 3-point attempts, for the

<HEADLINE> Virginia 74, Boston College 70  </HEADLINE>
By HANK KURZ Jr., AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Telisha Quarles had eight of her
career-high 24 points during a 10-0 run in the second half Sunday
night as Virginia beat Boston College 74-70 in the second round of
the women's NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers, seeded fourth in the Mideast Regional, reached
the final 16 for the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Boston College (26-9) finished its second trip to
the tournament the same way its first one ended. Last year, the
Eagles lost to Tennessee in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (25-8) won its 15th consecutive home game with solid
defense against the Eagles' scoring leaders and the clutch outside
shooting of Quarles, who hit three 3-pointers in the critical
6{-minute second-half stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' top two scorers were held scoreless in the first
half and managed 14 points overall. Alissa Murphy, who had 26 in
the first round, finished with three on 1-for-7 shooting, and Cal
Bouchard was 4-for-11 for 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's first basket, a 3-pointer with 15:19 left, gave the
Eagles a 40-36 lead, but with a crowd that included Buffalo Bills
quarterback and Boston College alumnus Doug Flutie cheering every
play, Quarles shot the Cavaliers back in front.
</P>
<P>
   Quarles hit a 3-pointer from the right wing with 14:33 left,
followed a steal and layup by Renee Robinson with a 10-footer and
then added another 3-pointer, this one from the left corner, to cap
the burst that gave Virginia a 46-40 lead with 9:53 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles closed to within 48-45 with 8:22 left, but Quarles
pulled up again in the left corner and knocked down another
long-distance shot. The Eagles were never within three again until
the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 73-70 and four second left, Quarles capped her
night with a free throw that put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Quarles finished 8-for-17 from the field, 5-for-8 from behind
the arc.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Gottstein led Boston College with 25 points, one short of
her career high, and Brianne Stepherson had 21. The two combined
for the Eagles' first 24 points until Nicole Conway's jumper 51
seconds before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia led 30-26 at halftime. Boston College's point total was
half what it managed in the first 20 minutes of its first-round
game against Nebraska.

<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Expect the Unexpected  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Arizona's Joan Bonvicini and Tennessee's
Pat Summitt know each other so well that there should not be too
many secrets when the top-seeded Lady Vols meet the Wildcats in the
second round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches anticipate an aggressive, uptempo game in which
rebounding and transitional play will be key. But there also is the
element of surprise for Monday's Mideast Regional matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-seeded Arizona (25-6) will be trying to advance beyond
the second round for only the second time, while Tennessee (29-3)
tries to extend its 26-game winning streak in first- and
second-round games.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no telling what Joan might decide to do,'' Summitt
said Sunday. ''She is a very talented coach with a very solid
staff. Just watch her team play; they have been very impressive,
run a lot of different looks defensively and bring full-court
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, pausing, she added, ''On the other hand, we have put our
team in all kinds of situations in practice and we have gone
against multiple defenses. So as we look at Arizona ... I think we
have prepared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonvicini sounded much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at Pat's teams they always play so hard ... and
they play defense,'' Bonvicini said. ''She mixes up her defenses a
lot more than she used to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bonvicini said her team can't get caught up in the
All-American talent on Tennessee's team or the six national
championship banners hanging from the ceiling of its arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the most critical thing is to play our game,'' she
said. ''We play Arizona's basketball game and understand the
strengths of Tennessee, but also understand our strengths and play
with those strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Summitt said her team ''knows that everyone playing in this
tournament certainly has the potential to win,'' and that teams
always seem to play their best against Tennessee because of its
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bonvicini and Summitt have coached against each other eight
times, including Bonvicini's 12-year tenure at Long Beach State.
Summitt holds a 5-3 lead overall, including a 2-0 record against
Bonvicini's Long Beach State in the coaches' only NCAA tourney
encounters -- in the 1987 Final Four and the 1989 round of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, ranked second in the final regular season poll,
advanced with a 90-38 victory over 16th-seeded Furman on Saturday.
Arizona, ranked 21st, opened with a 73-61 victory over ninth-seeded
Kent.

<HEADLINE> Twins Make Five Roster Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins made five roster
cuts Sunday, reassigning infielder Brian Richardson to their minor
league complex and optioning four players to Triple-A Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Jack Cressand and Benj Sampson, infielders Doug
Mientkiewicz and and catcher Chad Moeller were optioned, leaving 37
players in the major league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably got the attention of some of the players still
here when they saw a few of the fellas leave,'' Twins manager Tom
Kelly said. ''Now we have total panic, as you saw when there were
like 18 guys in the hitting cage. I guess that's the way we have to
do it to get their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to put up with some of the things we put up
with last year, and we need to give the people of Minneapolis-St.
Paul a better product than we gave them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mientkiewicz hit .368 in 10 spring games following a 1999 season
in which he hit just .229 with two home runs and 32 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fairness to Doug, I should have sent him down last year
when Mr. Ryan (general manager Terry Ryan) wanted to do so in the
summer,'' Kelly said. ''But I fought Terry on that and insisted
that he stay up in the major leagues because I thought he could
handle it. That's a decision I made and it turned out to be wrong,
but hindsight's always good.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Corey Koskie said he was a little shocked by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does send a message to the rest of us,'' Koskie said.
</P>
<P>
   Mientkiewicz's departure leaves David Ortiz, Ron Coomer, Butch
Huskey and Mario Valdez to battle for the starting job at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   ''You like your first baseman, your third baseman and your
outfielders to generate some runs,'' Kelly said. ''Your middle
infielders and your catchers can get by with hitting .220 because
of the other things they do in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly put the team through an extended pregame workout, focusing
on defensive drills with the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've become very sloppy and we need to re-establish some
continuity and some consistency in play,'' he said. ''Until we get
some more maturity and a better understanding of what needs to be
done, we're going to have to continue a very rigorous work program,
and that's what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the intensified practices and the roster moves, most of
the players seem to be getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   ''It works,'' Koskie said. ''You knew it was coming, but I don't
mind that stuff because I needed it. Defense is always something
you can improve on, so I'm never going to complain about that kind
of stuff.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An agreement reportedly has been reached to
merge the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders
confirmed Sunday that a deal had been brokered, The Wall Street
Journal reported on its Web site Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The three boards gave a green light for the merger,''
Pierre-Yves Jeholet was quoted as saying. The merger was to be
announced Monday in London, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The combination would create the second-largest exchange in
Europe behind the London Stock Exchange, with a combined market
capitalization of $2.32 trillion, the newspaper said. The London

<HEADLINE> Three dead in Bloomsburg University fraternity house fire  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE STRAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A fire in an off-campus fraternity house
near Bloomsburg University killed three people early Sunday, while
others jumped to safety in their underwear from a second-story
window.
</P>
<P>
   Five male fraternity members and an alumnus of the fraternity
who was visiting for the weekend were sleeping in the Tau Kappa
Epsilon house when the fire broke out at about 6 a.m. The alumnus
and two of the fraternity members managed to get out safely,
university spokesman Jim Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister said it was too soon to tell whether the bodies were
those of the missing students. He said the victims would be
identified through dental records.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't set in with me until I went down to the scene,''
said Jason Starling, a member of the university's Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity. ''You had people out there camping out. You had the
(surviving) brothers out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. The two-story
wooden house is located in a hilly neighborhood about two blocks
from campus.
</P>
<P>
   Red-eyed students in sweatshirts huddled in small groups and
talked quietly as fire officials and construction equipment sifted
through still-smoking ruins. A neighboring white three-story home
was scorched, and police said it sustained severe damage inside.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg University President Jessica Kozloff said the
building was owned by the fraternity and had been maintained well.
She said the university had revised its procedures to offer
education and training for off-campus students after a fraternity
house fire in 1994 killed five students.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are young adults who do make decisions on their own
about their lifestyle and where they're going to live,'' Kozloff
said. ''We can't protect them from everything.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials cleared the house for occupancy after noting a
dozen code violations in October, including a battery missing from
a smoke detector, five electrical heaters being run on an
inadequate electrical system, a missing doorknob and an empty fire
extinguisher, said code enforcement officer Dean Van Blohn. He said
the violations had been corrected by late January.
</P>
<P>
   The house was required to have three smoke detectors, Van Blohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you that if we discover that this occurred
because of any negligence ... we will certainly take measures to
make sure it doesn't happen again,'' Kozloff said.
</P>
<P>
   Two escaped by jumping from a second-story window in their
underwear, and a third fled out the front door, police said. All
reported awakening and finding heavy smoke in the building; one
reported hearing a smoke alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Classes have been canceled for two hours Monday morning, when
the university president will address the students.
</P>
<P>
   Tau Kappa Epsilon, dormant on the Bloomsburg campus for some
years, was restarted in 1997 with 18 members. It was in good
standing with the university and the fraternity's national
headquarters, Hollister said.
</P>
<P>
   Another fraternity house fire killed five Bloomsburg students on
Oct. 21, 1994. A smoldering sofa was blamed for that blaze.
Batteries had been taken out of smoke detectors in the Beta Sigma
Delta house, a common practice during smoky parties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a Jan. 19 fire in a dormitory at Seton Hall
University in New Jersey killed three students and critically
injured six others.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsburg, founded in 1839, is a state university about 100
miles northwest of Philadelphia with an enrollment of about 7,500.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 89, Magic 85  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson had 18 points, a season-high
10 assists and a career-high nine steals and Aaron McKie hit two
key free throws with five seconds left as the Philadelphia 76ers
defeated the Orlando Magic 89-85 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who had seven of his steals in a spirited first half,
was gunning for his first career triple-double. Tyrone Hill had 15
points, Theo Ratliff scored 13, George Lynch had 10 points and 11
rebounds and Matt Geiger added 10 points for the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer scored 26 points on 10-of-18 shooting from the field,
Darrell Armstrong scored 16 and Ben Wallace grabbed a career-high
21 rebounds for the Magic, who have lost three in a row and four of
their last five to jeopardize their playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff had two blocks in the final two minutes to seal the win
for Philadelphia. First, he blocked Wallace, who was trying to put
back an offensive rebound. In the final minute, he swatted away a
driving layup by Chucky Atkins. Neither team scored from the 3:40
mark until McKie's foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers took their first lead of the fourth quarter with 5:07
left when Hill grabbed a loose ball and hit a layup and a free
throw to put Philadelphia ahead 83-80. After Mercer made two foul
shots, Eric Snow hit a baseline jumper and Ratliff tapped in a
rebound to give the 76ers an 87-82 lead with 3:52 remaining. Pat
Garrity sank a 3-pointer with 3:40 left to pull the Magic within
two.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong paced a big third-quarter run for the Magic, getting
10 points and five assists in the period. Orlando came back from 13
points down to take a 72-69 lead after three quarters. Armstrong
scored six straight points during a 20-7 run that ended the period.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson scored 14 of his points in the first half, most from
drives to the basket. He had eight points in the second quarter as
the Sixers overcame a one-point deficit and grabbed a 52-41
halftime advantage. The Magic had just one field goal in the final
6:36 of the half and turned the ball over 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Magic had a scary moment in the first quarter when
Armstrong knocked his head on Geiger's knee while diving for a
loose ball. Armstrong remained motionless for about four minutes
while medical staff attended to him. Although he looked woozy while
leaving the court and heading to the locker room, he did return
before halftime. ...Orlando's 18 first-half turnovers was the most
in the four-year history of the First Union Center. The Magic
finished with 28.

<HEADLINE> Trinity official says drugs not a big problem on campus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A Trinity College student remained in
critical condition Sunday from what police said was drug-alcohol
binge that claimed the life of one of his roommates and left two
others facing criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a school spokeswoman said drug use is not widespread
among Trinity students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not in a reactive mode in response to this and we don't
believe we have a drug problem on campus,'' said Linda Campanella,
Trinity's senior vice president for operations and planning.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the tragedy certainly would spark a dialogue
between students and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a lot of dialogue and reflection that comes out
of this. We will try to learn as much as we can from this and act
on that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the dead student, Josh Doroff, 22, of Harrison,
N.Y., and his three roommates were drinking and doing drugs in
their dormitory room Thursday night and Friday morning, celebrating
the end of mid-term exams.
</P>
<P>
   Doroff, a political science and economics major, died Friday
afternoon after being taken to Hartford Hospital by friends. The
other stricken student, Clement ''Nick'' Kaupp III, 22, of Mendham,
N.J., was found later, unconscious in the room. The pre-law student
was also taken to Hartford Hospital, where he was listed in
critical condition on life support Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokesman James Battaglio said Sunday that Kaupp's
family had asked that no more information be released on his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the students, all seniors, apparently had mixed
prescription anti-anxiety drugs, sleeping pills and a migraine
medication. In addition, they also were drinking and may have taken
heroin, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the roommates, William B. Bachman, 21, of South Natick,
Mass., and Joshua B. Eaves, 22, of Downingtown, Pa., were scheduled
to be arraigned on Monday on charges of narcotics possession.
Authorities said they were trying to learn where the students
obtained the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Students are on spring break and classes will not resume until
March 27. A memorial service for Doroff will be held that day at 4
p.m. in the college's chapel. College staff, including counselors,
will be available starting the weekend before classes resume.

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Moon for Misbegotten'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA, AP Drama Critic
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There may not be a more generous, warmhearted
and touching Eugene O'Neill heroine than Josie Hogan, the
strong-willed farm girl of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Josie is the quintessential earth mother, a nurturing creature
who sacrifices a lot for the man she loves and then allows him to
go off to face the consequences of his wasted life. It would seem
to be a natural role for Cherry Jones, the incandescent actress who
won a Tony Award several seasons back for ''The Heiress.'' For the
most part, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who rarely makes a wrong move on stage, starts
tentatively, displaying a forced heartiness that's at odds with her
open, natural sweetness and pert features. Yet the unease
eventually evaporates, and her performance gains strength as the
drama quietly -- and slowly -- travels to its tender, heartbreaking
and moon-drenched conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Moon,'' which opened Sunday at Broadway's Walter Kerr Theater,
is a sequel of sorts to O'Neill's masterpiece, ''Long Day's Journey
into Night.'' Both plays feature the dissolute, despairing
character of ne'er-do-well Jim Tyrone.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Jim, a would-be actor, returns to his family's Connecticut
estate where Josie and her cantankerous father, the wily Phil
Hogan, live as tenant farmers. Father and daughter have a combative
relationship, although affection is never far below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Josie is a big, coarse woman, disparagingly called ''an
overgrown cow'' by her father and something less than a virgin by
most of the locals. Yet Jim, who has had his fair share of loose
ladies, sees something special in Josie, and Josie finds something
attractive in him. He sees through her gruffness, and she
understands his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is a leisurely, talky playwright. ''Moon'' originally
was in four acts. At the Kerr, it's been cut and played with one
intermission. Still, director Daniel Sullivan can't make the
evening move any faster.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 dawdles as the Josie's younger brother Mike flees his
tyrannical father, and Josie and her dad make fun of a wealthy
neighbor who comes to complain about Hogan's wandering pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The second act pays off, though, with Jones rising to magical
heights during one of the most affecting scenes in all of American
drama -- Josie's midnight rendezvous with Jim. In the moon-dappled
front yard of the Hogan farmhouse, Josie cradles the guilt-ridden
Jim, haunted by his disreputable behavior after his mother's death.
She finally understands the reasons for his unbearable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   As Jim, Gabriel Bryne looks exactly right, just like ''a dead
man walking slow behind his own coffin,'' which is how Josie
describes him. His ghostly pallor is unnerving. It's a quiet,
ultimately moving performance that does not depend on histrionics
to get the audience's sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Dotrice gives a rich, gleeful performance as Hogan, ''a
wicked old tick, as crooked as a corkscrew.'' Yet Dotrice is more
than the evening's comic relief. His Hogan has several sides. You
know he cares for his daughter, even though he is not above wanting
to get a little monetary gain out of her happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Eugene Lee has worked wonders with the Hogans'
dilapidated farmhouse, placing it center stage at the Kerr -- with a
mountain of boulders on one side as a reminder of the barren nature
of the land old Hogan has to work.
</P>
<P>
   This production must compete with the memory of the landmark
1973 Broadway revival that starred Jason Robards and Colleen
Dewhurst. It was one of those rare occasions in the theater that
made audiences re-evaluate a play that had never been thought of as
more than second-tier O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   If anything this new revival reconfirms the opinions of more
than 25 years ago. The greatness of ''A Moon for the Misbegotten''
remains undiminished.

<HEADLINE> US Coast Guard Seizes Ecuador Boat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- A U.S. Coast Guard cutter has intercepted
an 80-foot fishing boat off Ecuador's coast overloaded with about
250 Ecuadoreans, apparently trying to make their way illegally into
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No information was immediately available from Ecuadorean
officials Sunday about the incident, which, according to U.S. Coast
Guard officials, took place Saturday morning in the Pacific Ocean
about 200 miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Knight, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard's 11th
District in San Francisco, said the passengers were in good
condition and would be turned over to the Ecuadorean navy Monday
along with the vessel that carried them, the Viviana II.
</P>
<P>
   The destination of the fishing boat was not immediately known,
but it was presumed the people on board were heading to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was intercepted by the Thetis, a U.S. Coast Guard
cutter based out of Key West, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like we caught the vessel pretty early on in the
voyage,'' Knight told The Associated Press. ''The reports are that
all on board were in good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean travel is not a usual route for illegal entry into the
United States by Ecuadoreans. Traditional smuggling routes have
been by land through the Mexican border. Ecuador's worst economic
conditions in decades has made life difficult in the South American
nation.

<HEADLINE> Dogs Find New Life in Prison  </HEADLINE>
By AMY SANCETTA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANSFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- Late last year both Eric Roberson and
Star, a young female Labrador retriever, were sitting in their
separate cells. He was 16 years away from his first parole board
hearing for a 1992 murder conviction. She was one day away from
euthanasia at the Ashland Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, they would both be sharing Roberson's cell, and
both would be looking toward a better future.
</P>
<P>
   While many prisons across the nation have introduced therapy and
guide dog training curriculums, Mansfield Correctional Institution
has established a unique program of its own. The institution has
begun bringing together castaway dogs from the pound and castaway
men from the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Called ''Death Row Dogs'' by the inmates, the dogs are
socialized and trained within the prison walls, then put up for
adoption. Since the program began in the fall of 1998, not a single
dog has been returned to the pound.
</P>
<P>
   ''These animals are underdogs too,'' explains program
coordinator Carol Mull. ''The men identify with them and have a
great desire to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   A high school dropout and father of two young daughters,
Roberson ended a night of drinking and drug abuse with two friends
with the robbery of a bar and the murder of its owner. When the
friends testified against him, Roberson plea-bargained his future
and ended up in Mansfield. He does not remember much of the night
which would seal his future.
</P>
<P>
   Since he came to prison, he has overcome his addictions, earned
a high school equivalency diploma, and been baptized in the
Presbyterian Church. But what he says saved his heart came on the
day he noticed a flyer looking for volunteers to enter a dog
training program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a harsh environment here,'' Roberson explains. ''I
always viewed this place as being filled with the rejects of
society, so I couldn't imagine this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Warden Jesse Williams could.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had introduced a pilot dog program into the Lorain
Correctional Institution several years earlier. He found that the
presence of dogs there provided training and socialization not just
for the dogs, but for the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   When he transferred to Mansfield, he knew he wanted a dog
program there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Ashland Humane Society jumped at the chance to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It benefits them, it benefits us, it benefits society,'' Mull
says. ''They're so happy they don't have to euthanize these dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners are screened before being allowed to participate.
There are reviews of their criminal records -- no child or animal
abusers, no sexual predators -- and of their conduct within the
prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   Once matched with a dog, a prisoner is fully responsible for its
care: feeding, grooming, washing, housebreaking, training.
Cellmates act as helpers, but no more. Prison guard Dale Thompson
conducts weekly group obedience training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to like the dogs. It is difficult to find a staff
member who does not have a desk drawer full of bones and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives the inmates a feeling of responsibility and the
chance to give back to society,'' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson agrees. ''I didn't think I had any compassion left in
me,'' he says. ''But when I received one of the first dogs in the
program, a brindle boxer pup named Brin, I fell in love as soon as
they laid her in my arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He carried the fragile puppy across the prison yard to his cell
block, his compassion mixed with anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was anxious, because I thought guys would think I was
soft,'' he continues, ''and I was afraid for her safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he got to his cell block, the men all gathered around.
They seemed afraid to get too close as well, to show that they
cared about something. Roberson put the puppy on the ground, and
she started to run and jump. Men laughed and reached out to touch
her.
</P>
<P>
   When the coldest and most hateful man on the block dropped to
the floor and rolled around with the pup laughing, Roberson knew
that everything was going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   One year and five dogs later, he received Star. While many of
the dogs in the program were abused, untrained, and skittish, it
was apparent that Star had once been somebody's pet. She was
housebroken, unafraid of the strange noises of the prison, and knew
the ''sit'' command. Over the next seven weeks, Roberson worked on
her leash and obedience training. She was severely undernourished,
so he made sure she returned to a healthy weight with food provided
by the Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   And over the weeks, their bond grew stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what you've done or what kind of day you've had,
she's always there wagging her tail and giving kisses,'' Roberson
says as he rubs Star on the head.
</P>
<P>
   ''She loves me no matter what problems I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Star and Roberson share their cell block with 180 other men and
one other dog. Prisoners in the wood shop build the cages which fit
in the inmate's 10 by 10 foot cell. At Christmas, some 600 inmates
paid $2.50 apiece to have their picture taken with Star or one of
the 15 other dogs on the grounds, wearing Santa caps and posing in
front of painted holiday backdrops. The money raised went into a
fund for Amish-made leather collars and leashes.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Cathy Schlaeg volunteered to co-train Star, taking her
home on weekends and introducing her to a very different
environment -- of children, cars, malls and the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   She was so smitten with the dog, that when it came time for Star
to be adopted, Schlaeg jumped at the chance herself.
</P>
<P>
   She met Roberson in the prison office to take Star to her new
life. Roberson knelt next to Star, and rubbed her all over.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so gentle with her,'' Schlaeg explains. ''Just like she
was his child.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He told her, 'Now you be a good girl. You remember everything
I taught you. You're going to a good home where people will love
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Swelling with emotion, Roberson gave her one last hug, then rose
and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now get her outta here,'' he said, choking back tears.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Roberson seeks Schlaeg out to ask how she and the
dog are doing. Schlaeg hopes to be able to bring Star back inside
for a visit someday.
</P>
<P>
   And after several weeks alone, Roberson is waiting for a new dog
to love and train.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I did on the outside, it's something I have to accept to
keep going in here,'' Roberson says.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I've come to learn that life is so precious. I know that
now.''

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves have never been
this good in the standings and rarely have they looked this good on
the court, either.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Wally Szczerbiak scored a career-high 27 points and
Terrell Brandon had 28 points and 13 rebounds as the Wolves whipped
the Milwaukee Bucks 109-82 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The blowout put Minnesota 13 games above .500 for the first time
in the team's 11-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves (39-26) buried the Bucks, who have lost 15 of 20 and
six straight on the road, with a 41-12 third-quarter blitz in which
they shot 76 percent and got 14 points from Brandon and 13 from
Szczerbiak.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's leading scorer, Ray Allen, had another off night and
finished with 10 points on 2-for-16 shooting. He missed 29 of 36
shots over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon's biggest plays came just before and just after
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was up 48-46 when Bobby Jackson sank an 18-foot jumper
with eight-tenths of a second left. Tim Thomas tried a bounce pass
to Allen, but Brandon, standing in the lane, deflected it, grabbed
it, spun and sank a jumper at the buzzer for a 52-46 lead at the
break.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon hit a jumper and a 3-pointer in the first minute of the
third quarter to make it 57-46 and the lead was never in single
digits again.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett's only basket of the third quarter made it 91-58
and capped a 43-8 run.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Robinson led Milwaukee with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, coming off a 5-of-20 shooting performance in a two-point
loss at New Jersey, missed his first 13 shots before sinking a
3-pointer with 8:22 left that made it 97-65.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Wolves are 19-9 against sub-.500 teams, but seven
of the nine losses have come at Target Center. ... Milwaukee's
seven offensive rebounds in the first quarter delayed the blowout
until after the half. ... Szczerbiak's previous high was 26 points,
against Washington and Portland. ... Sam Mitchell played for the
first time since missing 14 games with an ankle injury. He played
the final five minutes.

<HEADLINE> Former House Speaker Mitra Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Former House Speaker Ramon Mitra, who
gained prominence as a freedom fighter jailed by dictator Ferdinand
Marcos, died Monday following a bout with liver cancer, his family
said. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The illegitimate son of a penal colony superintendent and a poor
woman who died before he was age 1, Mitra was reared in poverty by
a grandmother and worked his way through school and became a
journalist before entering law school at San Beda College.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the diplomatic service in 1957, serving in Washington
and at United Nations before entering politics, first as a member
of the House of Representatives in 1960s and later at the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Mitra survived a grenade attack on a political rally of the
Liberal Party on Aug. 21, 1971 that nearly wiped out his party's
senatorial slate that was running against Marcos' Nacionalista
Party. Marcos blamed the communists for the attack, which led to a
crackdown on leftists, but opposition leaders believed he
masterminded it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later Marcos declared martial law, jailed political
opponents, including Mitra and the chief opposition leader, then
Sen. Benigno Aquino.
</P>
<P>
   To show defiance to Marcos, Mitra grew a beard and vowed not to
shave it until Marcos was overthrown. He returned to politics in
1984 as a member of the opposition in the Marcos-dominated
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   When Marcos was ousted in the 1986 ''people power'' revolt,
Mitra was appointed by President Corazon Aquino, Benigno Aquino's
widow, as agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Mitra ran for the House of Representatives and became
its speaker. He lost in the presidential election in 1992 in a
seven-way race to Fidel Ramos. After his defeat in the presidential
race, Mitra faded from politics and resurfaced in 1998 as a
supporter of Joseph Estrada, who won the presidential race in that
year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada then appointed Mitra as president of the state-owned
Philippine National Oil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Mitra is survived by his wife, Cecilia, and their six sons.
</P>
<P>
   His family said his remains will be brought to the House and the
Senate for memorial services and stay overnight Monday at the
Philippine National Oil Corp. offices.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday he will be buried in Palawan province, southwest of
Manila, in a small plot he personally chose near a lighthouse
overlooking the bay in Puerto Princesa city.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) --Two power-play goals by Fredrik Olausson
and a third by Paul Kariya sparked the Anaheim Mighty Ducks to a
3-1 victory over Detroit on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert stopped 33 shots as the Mighty Ducks
coped with a nemesis to take a giant step toward a possible playoff
berth. Coupled with San Jose's loss in Dallas earlier Sunday,
Anaheim's sixth victory in 28 games against Detroit moved the
Mighty Ducks within two points of the Sharks for the final playoff
in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson broke a 1-1 tie in the second period, using assists by
Kariya and Teemu Selanne to slap a hard shot into the net from the
blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Olausson's second goal of the game gave him 11 career multi-goal
games, his first since Feb. 10, 1999 against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya dug the puck out of a scramble in front of the goal and
buried it into the net at 3:46 of the third period. Kariya's 36th
goal of the season tied Anaheim's season high of three power-play
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Constant pressure on Hebert paid off in the Red Wings' first
goal nearly 10 minutes into the game. Nicklas Lidstrom made it 1-0
on a power-play goal assisted by Steve Yzerman and Tomas Holmstrom.
Lidstrom's 18th goal came on Detroit's 10th consecutive shot at
Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim drew even a little more than four minutes later on
Olausson's point-blank 25-footer past goalie Ken Wregget.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit defenseman Larry Murphy played in his 1,550th game,
breaking a tie with Alex Delvecchio to move into second for career
games. Only Gordie Howe, with 1,767, has played more games in NHL
history.

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Petr Sykora scored twice, and
Patrik Elias had a goal and two assists in the New Jersey Devils'
5-2 victory over the Florida Panthers on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens and Bobby Holik also scored for the Devils, who
won for the first time in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure scored his league-leading 51st goal and Mike
Sillinger added a goal for Florida, 3-7-1 in its last 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils trailed 2-1 after the first period, but evened tied
it 2-2 at 5:46 of the second. After Florida was unable to clear the
puck, Scott Stevens took a pass from Alexander Mogilny and shot it
past Trevor Kidd from the left circle. The assist was Mogilny's
first point since joining the Devils on March 15.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey took a 3-2 lead at 15:48 on a power play when Elias
worked a give-and-go with Holik, flicking a shot past Kidd. Holik
scored at 17:21 to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora got his second goal of the game at 5:38 of the third for
the Devils, 5-10-1 in their last 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers took a 1-0 lead on the power play when Bure
whistled a pass from just inside the blue line past the stick side
of Martin Brodeur at 17:11 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it just 2:02 later when Sykora scored his 20th
with a shot high into the corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Florida wasted little time going ahead again when Mike
</P>
<P>
   Sillinger gave the Panthers a 2-1 lead with 12 seconds left in
the first. He deflected a shot by Mike Wilson just four seconds
after Devils' defenseman Ken Daneyko was sent off the ice for a
double minor.
</P>
<P>
   The game was temporarily stopped with 1:45 to go when a fight
between Scott Niedermayer and Peter Worrell got ugly, as both
received game misconducts.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Greg Johnson scored the tying goal 54 seconds
into the third period and assisted on Cliff Ronning's game-winner
51 seconds into overtime Sunday as the Nashville Predators beat the
Los Angeles Kings 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Blake's second goal in 34 games was the only blemish on an
otherwise spectacular performance by Nashville goalie Mike Dunham,
who made 41 saves and stopped all 29 shots he faced over the final
48:08.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham established a career high with his 17th victory,
thwarting three Los Angeles power plays and extending Luc
Robitaille's longest goal-scoring drought of the season to eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off their first shutout loss in 92 games, the Kings held
a 34-14 advantage in shots on goal and a 1-0 lead before Johnson
scored his 10th goal on Nashville's first shot of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning made a short pass from behind the net to Karlis
Skrastins, who skated away from Ian Laperriere and out to the top
of the left circle, made a 360-degree spin and let fly with a wrist
shot that deflected off Johnson's stick and over Jamie Storr's
glove.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning, who leads the Predators with 23 goals, got his second
game-winner when he converted Bill Holder's cross-ice pass in front
of the crease and beat Storr to the glove side. The victory was
Nashville's 54th as a franchise, breaking the record for
second-year expansion teams shared by Tampa Bay and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which had won its first three games against
Nashville this year, dropped to 27-2-2 when leading after two
periods. The only other time they were beaten after two was Jan.
29, a 3-2 loss to Toronto in which the Kings wasted a 2-0,
third-period lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings established a season high for first-period shots with
an 18-6 advantage against Nashville, which was playing its fourth
road game in six nights. But the only shot to get past Dunham was
Blake's fifth goal of the season, which ended the rookie
defenseman's 10-game scoring drought.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Blake's shot from the top of the right circle was
kicked out by Dunham, the Kings' rookie center positioned himself
at the edge of the crease and converted Jozef Stumpel's pass from
behind the net at 12:43.
</P>
<P>
   Just 48 seconds after Rob Blake's check on Richard Linter sent
the Predators' defenseman limping to the dressing room, the Blake
earned a boarding penalty for sending Johnson head-first into the
right corner of the Kings' zone. But the Predators failed to get a
shot on net during the 22 seconds they had a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's Scott Walker had to be helped off the ice after Aki
Berg's one-timer from inside the Nashville blue line struck him
flush on the right knee during a power play with two minutes left
in the second period. It was the 32nd shot the Predators' right
wing has blocked this season.

<HEADLINE> Football Coach Bob Blackman Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Hall of Fame football coach Bob Blackman,
who won or shared seven Ivy League titles at Dartmouth, has died at
the age of 81.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman died Friday at Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in
Burlingame, Calif., from a systemic infection.
</P>
<P>
   He recently became ill while traveling in Singapore, and he and
his wife, Kay, were flying home to Hilton Head, S.C., when he again
got sick. The plane made an emergency landing in San Francisco so
Blackman could be treated.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 seasons at Dartmouth from 1955-70, Blackman went 104-37-3.
His teams went unbeaten three times and twice won the Lambert
Trophy as the top team in the East. He also coached at Illinois and
Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, he was named national coach of the year by the Walter
Camp Foundation, and that team was ranked 14th in the country. No
Ivy League team has been ranked that high since.
</P>
<P>
   He coached at Illinois from 1971-76, and finished his career in
the Ivy League in 1982 after six years at Cornell, but never
matched his success at Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   At Illinois, his teams were 29-36-1 with one winning season, but
were 24-23-1 in Big Ten play after Illinois went 2-19 in the three
years before he arrived. At Cornell, he was 23-33-1.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, Blackman was affiliated with the East-West
Shrine game and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He coached several of the postseason all-star games, and was a
past president of the American Football Coaches Association.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman's death comes on the same weekend former University of
New Hampshire hockey coach Charlie Holt died. The two probably were
nationally the best-known coaches from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, a native of DeSoto, Iowa, who grew up in southern
California, began his coaching career as a student at Southern
California after his promising playing career was derailed by polio
when he was a freshman. He served as a student assistant, then
coached naval base teams during World War II after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to California after the war and coached Monrovia
High School to a championship. Blackman also coached at Pasadena
City College, where he won two national junior college
championships and compiled a 34-6-3 record in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he took over Denver and, the following year, the school
won its first Skyline Conference title in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   After three years at the University of Denver, Blackman took
over Dartmouth's program in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a tough guy, I mean, demanding, no humor,'' said Dick
Jaeger, who played three seasons for Blackman at Dartmouth, and is
the school's athletic director. ''The bullhorn was his trademark at
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playbooks arrived in the middle of the summer. Chalk talks
were cerebral and film breakdown sessions could be vicious. But you
had to respect him.''

<HEADLINE> Suns 99, Warriors 82  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Kidd's visit to his hometown
turned, as usual, into a painful experience for the Golden State
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had 15 points, 14 assists, nine rebounds and three steals
as the Phoenix Suns defeated the Warriors 99-82 Sunday night for
their 18th victory in 23 games.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who grew up in Oakland and starred in college at nearby
California, came within one rebound of his sixth triple-double of
the season. He leads active players with 31 career triple-doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Robinson had 25 points, Rodney Rogers had 21 and Penny
Hardaway had 16 for the Suns, who have won 15 of their last 17
games against the Warriors. Rogers, who hit all five of his 3-point
attempts, had 13 points in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes had 25 points, nine rebounds and a career-high five
steals for the Warriors, who have lost nine of 10. Jason Caffey
added 20 points for Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by seven points at halftime, the Warriors opened the
third period with an 11-2 run. The streak was capped by Hughes'
3-pointer, giving Golden State a 58-56 lead with 7:55 left in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Phoenix responded with a 12-2 run, including a 3-pointer by
Kidd, to take a 68-60 lead. Another 3 by Kidd gave the Suns a 73-64
lead with 1{ minutes left in the period. Phoenix led 76-66 entering
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   After Caffey opened the final period with a dunk, Rogers scored
10 points as the Suns went on an 11-0 run that made it 87-68. The
run was capped by an alley-oop from Kidd to Rogers for a slam.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had 19 points and Kidd had 10 assists as the Suns, who
are 7-3 on the road since the All-Star break, took a 54-47 halftime
lead. Phoenix led by as many as 15 points early in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had 15 points and Caffey added 12 in the first half for
Golden State, which has lost five straight at home.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Phoenix guard Rex Chapman, who had his appendix removed
Saturday at a San Francisco hospital, is expected to be sidelined
for 2-3 weeks. ... Center Erick Dampier missed his second straight
game for the Warriors with a sprained right wrist. He also has been
sidelined for 43 games this season with left knee problems. ...
Suns backup center Oliver Miller left the team about an hour before
game time and flew back to Phoenix because of a family emergency.
... With the win, the Suns reduced their magic number for clinching
a playoff spot to three.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Workers Approve Contract  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE M. CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Striking Boeing engineers and technical workers
approved a new contract Sunday, ending one of the biggest
white-collar walkouts in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace planned to return to work at 9 a.m. Monday following
their 40-day strike.
</P>
<P>
   Some 9,660 of 13,440 eligible, dues-paying union members cast
ballots, spokesman Bill Dugovich said. Both the technical and
engineering sides approved the contract by more than 70 percent,
union executive director Charles Bofferding said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The technical community has found its voice ... This has been
a clear victory,'' Bofferding said at an evening news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boeing is delighted that SPEEA members ratified the tentative
settlement, and we are looking forward to their return to work,''
company CEO Phil Condit said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been an emotional time for all involved. We are
confident that with time we will be able to heal from this
unfortunate situation as we strive to continue listening to each
other and understanding our mutual interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, union members waiting in long voting lines near
the foot of the Space Needle were split on whether the latest
offer, which included guaranteed wage increases of at least 9
percent over three years and bonuses of up to $2,500, was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't meet everything we want, but it's a start,'' said
Jim Timko, an engineer at Boeing's Everett plant about 30 miles to
the north, who was voting yes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kizer, 46, also an engineer at the Everett plant, said he
was rejecting the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year was the best year ever for Boeing. The company has
never said thank you,'' Kizer said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, which
recently welcomed the Boeing union as an affiliate, congratulated
members at the news conference Sunday night. ''Our newest affiliate
has shown us our oldest lesson, that solidarity does work,'' Trumka
said.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to rally with union members outside Boeing's plant in
suburban Renton Monday morning before they all marched into work
together.
</P>
<P>
   During the walkout that began Feb. 9 and involved about 15,000
to 17,000 workers, Boeing deliveries slipped by more than 15
airplanes, and work on some government contracts suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers surprised many, first by going on strike, then by
staying out as long as they did.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers union has long been overshadowed by the powerful
Machinists union, whose members actually build the planes. The
engineers' only other walkout lasted for just one day in 1992, and
the union had no strike fund when the current dispute began.
</P>
<P>
   Important Boeing customers such as American Airlines and United
Airlines missed deliveries and had to adjust their maintenance and
flight schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The strike had come at an awkward time for Boeing. The company
was only beginning to recover from two abysmal years in 1997 and
1998, when its commercial aircraft division suffered heavy losses
because of snarled production lines and delayed deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative agreement on the separate contracts for engineers and
technicians was announced early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year proposals, technicians would get a 4
percent raise in the first year and a 3 percent raise in each of
the next two years. Engineers would receive a 3 percent raise every
year of their contract.
</P>
<P>
   The company dropped its demand that workers pay part of their
health insurance premiums. Health coverage would be extended to
domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than the lump sum, 10 percent bonus payment won by the
International Association of Machinists, the proposals offered
engineers and technicians bonuses of $1,000 after 30 days, $500
following delivery of 225 planes this year and $1,000 after
delivery of 491 planes no later than March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents 22,352 workers, of whom roughly two-thirds
are dues-paying union members.
</P>
<P>
   Due in part to the strike, Boeing's stock fell from a high of
$47.62{ a share on Jan. 17 to $32.37{, just shy of the 52-week low
of $32, on March 10. On Friday, shares gained $2.38 to close at $38
on the New York Stock Exchange.

   AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa State finished against Illinois much
better than it started.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Welle scored 19 points, Desire Francis hit four
second-half 3-pointers and Iowa State overcame an agonizing start
to beat Illinois 79-68 Sunday night and advance to the round of 16

</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Iowa State (27-5) fell behind by eight points early
and was down 11 in the second half before finally finding the
shooting touch that has made the Cyclones one of the best offensive
teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Then they pulled away from the sixth-seeded Illini (23-11) in
the final 4{ minutes and will meet second-seeded Penn State (28-4)
in the Midwest Regional semifinals next Saturday night in Kansas
City. Penn State advanced with a 75-69 victory over Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second straight year Iowa State has reached the
regional semifinals. The Cyclones were eliminated by Georgia in the
Mideast Regional finals last year.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois led for the last time at 61-60 on Kylie Martin's follow
shot with 7:56 left. Stacy Frese, held in check most of the night,
then hit a 3-pointer as the shot clock buzzer sounded for a 63-61
Iowa State lead, triggering a 14-3 run that put Iowa State in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Francis followed Frese's basket with a layup for a 65-61 lead
before Tauja Catchings sank a free throw and scored on a putback to
draw the Illini to within a point.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa State answered with nine straight points, Lindsey
Wilson capping the burst with a 3-pointer, to go up 74-64 -- too
much for Illinois to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Francis finished with 18 points, Wilson scored 13, Frese 12 and
Megan Taylor 11. Martin's 18 points led Illinois, which got 14 from
Allison Curtin and 13 each from Catchings and Susan Blauser.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State got a lift from a boisterous crowd of 13,478 that
included All-American Marcus Fizer, who has led Iowa State to the
round of 16 in the men's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois frustrated Iowa State early with its tough man-to-man
defense and took a 6-0 lead as the Cyclones missed their first
seven shots. Iowa State did not score until Taylor hit a follow
shot at the 14:50 mark.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Iowa State had 17 points by that time against St.
Francis.
</P>
<P>
   The Illini led 12-4 before Iowa State finally started clicking
by getting the ball inside to Welle. Welle converted a three-point
play in a 7-0 run that tied it at 18, and the Cyclones took their
first lead at 22-20 on Welle's turnaround in the lane with 6:13
left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Six straight points by reserve Holly Wilson gave Illinois a
28-24 lead and Kyle Martin's 3-pointer put the Illini up 35-31 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois led even though Catchings, an all-Big Ten forward, sat
out the final 8:03 of the half after picking up her second foul.

   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- April Brown scored all 11 of her
second-half points during an 23-3 run in the second half as LSU
beat Stephen F. Austin 57-45 Sunday night to advance to the NCAA
East Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   LSU (24-6), which plays Western Kentucky or Duke next Saturday
at Richmond, Va., wiped out a nine-point halftime deficit,
outscoring Stephen F. Austin (28-4) by 35-14 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen F. Austin's Shawnta Johnson scored the first basket of
the second half to push the lead to double digits and Stephanie
Whitmore hit a short banker with 15:43 to play that made it 35-24.
</P>
<P>
   But Katrina Hibbert, who also was held to two points in the
first half, hit a field goal on a fast-break opportunity to start
the big run.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Ferdinand also had two baskets and two key steals during
the run and a jumper by Brown gave third-seeded LSU the lead at
36-35 with 11:14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Brown finished with 13 points, DeTrina White 12, Ferdinand 11
and Hibbert 10.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Shots Fired From Standoff Home  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A murder suspect holding three people
hostage for a third day fired shots out a window Sunday evening
after several hours of calm following a morning burst of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities tried to avoid agitating the suspect, who was
believed to be watching the ordeal on television.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Palczynski had been on the run since March 7, when police
say he kidnapped his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and killed the
couple she was staying with and a neighbor. A fourth person was
killed and a boy was wounded when Palczynski allegedly carjacked a
vehicle, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped unharmed; police would not disclose her
whereabouts. Palczynski later fled to Virginia, where he stole guns
and forced a man to drive him back to Baltimore County.
</P>
<P>
   Five bursts of gunfire Sunday morning were the first signs of
activity since Palczynski took Whitehead's mother and two others
hostage Friday night. At least six rounds were fired from the home
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported and police did not return fire at all
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski stopped talking with negotiators for about an hour
and a half Sunday morning, and police moved in with an armored
vehicle and a bullhorn to urge him to resume communications.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joby, we need you to pick up the phone,'' an officer said over
the loudspeaker, using Palczynski's nickname. ''Come on Joby, pick
up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski responded with shots and the armored vehicle backed
away.
</P>
<P>
   He soon resumed talks, but then fired more shots, spokesman Bill
Toohey said. Later, police used a robot to send food into the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our main strategy is patience, patience, patience,'' Toohey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had not allowed anyone in or out of the blue-collar
suburb east of Baltimore since the standoff began. But throughout
the day Sunday, armored cars were used to ferry 11 residents to
safety, police said. They were removed from a four-block area
during nine separate trips, said police spokeswoman Vickie
Wareheim.
</P>
<P>
   One woman and her two children made a run from the neighborhood
after shots were fired Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been there since Friday,'' said an exhausted and
distraught Anna Day. ''I don't have anything. I need formula. I
need bottle liners. I need diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm scared to leave the kids. We've been sleeping on the
floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After Palczynski returned to the area from Virginia, police
searched the area for more than a week. On Friday, he broke into a
house, tied up the occupants and stole three guns.
</P>
<P>
   He then shot his way into the home of Whitehead's mother, Lynn
Whitehead. Relatives said he was holding Lynn Whitehead; her
boyfriend, Andy McCord; and 12-year-old Brad McCord.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to characterize their negotiations with
Palczynski but confirmed that a psychiatrist was helping
negotiators. Police have said Palczynski has bipolar disorder,
often called manic-depression, which causes extreme mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old unemployed electrician also has a history of
convictions for assault and battery. Days before the killings, he
was charged with assaulting Whitehead but was released on $7,500
bail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he kept police in Idaho at bay for 16 hours following a
domestic violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced
out with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends say Palczynski has said that he would
shoot himself or make police shoot him rather than go back to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, friends and relatives called television
stations to urge Palczynski to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski's father said he hoped his son would end the standoff
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope to God he takes the right road and for all our sakes
lets those people go,'' Joseph Palczynksi Sr. told WBFF-TV.

Boeing Workers Approve Contract
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Striking Boeing engineers and technical workers approved a
new contract Sunday, ending one of the biggest white-collar walkouts in the
country's history. Members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace planned to return to work at 9 a.m. Monday. Under the three-year
proposals, technicians would get a 4 percent raise in the first year and a 3
percent raise in each of the next two years. Engineers would receive a 3 percent
raise every year of their contract.

Clinton Arrives in India
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- President Clinton opened the first trip to troubled
South Asia in 22 years by an American president Sunday night and immediately was
forced to scale down his visit to Bangladesh when the Secret Service raised
concerns about a side trip to a rural village. Just hours before starting a
daylong trip Monday to Bangladesh, the White House canceled a stop at the
village of Joypura, about 20 miles from the capital of Dhaka. Presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart cited concerns raised by security experts and another
official said there were fears about taking the president by helicopter over a
dense, tropical forest where security could not be guaranteed.

470 Feared Dead in Uganda
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- Ugandan police said Sunday it may take days before
they can fully explain Friday's fire involving members of the Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God. As many as 470 people were killed in
either a mass suicide or murder. Circumstances surrounding the deaths -- who the
dead were and how the fire was started -- remain foggy. Little was known about
the cult, although it appeared to incorporate Christian beliefs and local
farmers said it was led by a former prostitute. Syncretic Christian religious
sects are mushrooming across Africa as many people become disillusioned with the
inability of politicians to improve their lives.

Web site is handing out more than 2 million computer disks offering free
Internet access customized for bilingual use. Quepasa will use Internet service
from NetZero, which already offers free access in English to some 3 million

Suns Beat Warriors 99-82
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) --Jason Kidd had 15 points, 14 assists, nine rebounds
and three steals as the Phoenix Suns defeated the Warriors 99-82 Sunday night
for their 18th victory in 23 games. Kidd, who grew up in Oakland and starred in
college at nearby California, came within one rebound of his sixth triple-double
of the season. He leads active players with 31 career triple-doubles. Clifford
Robinson had 25 points, Rodney Rogers had 21 and Penny Hardaway had 16 for the
Suns, who have won 15 of their last 17 games against the Warriors. Rogers, who
hit all five of his 3-point attempts, had 13 points in the fourth period.

Predators Beat Kings 2-1, OT

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Greg Johnson scored the tying goal 54 seconds into the
third period and assisted on Cliff Ronning's game-winner 51 seconds into
overtime Sunday as the Nashville Predators beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1. Jason
Blake's second goal in 34 games was the only blemish on an otherwise spectacular
performance by Nashville goalie Mike Dunham, who made 41 saves and stopped all
29 shots he faced over the final 48:08. Dunham established a career high with
his 17th victory, thwarting three Los Angeles power plays and extending Luc
Robitaille's longest goal-scoring drought of the season to eight games.
